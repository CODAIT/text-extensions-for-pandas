0, on 12/09/09 14:11 PM (PST),regretful ,2009 Pontiac Torrent GXP GXP 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),regretful," GM says 16/24 mileage,more like 12/19,that's using cruise control, at approximately 70mph never over. It gets even less at 55 mph!what the!? Let up on the gas and it comes to a stop, I mean motor runs but I mean the power just dogs, it's like all power stops going to the drive train? I guess it saves on brakes. It has a horrible turning ratio, didn't notice it on test drive, you need to plan ahead to park. The CD player takes forever to load. If I'd known the gas mileage was going to be this bad, I would've bought a truck or a SUV with 4x4.",3.875
1, on 06/16/16 16:14 PM (PDT),David ,2009 Pontiac Torrent SUV 4dr SUV (3.4L 6cyl 5A),2009 Pontiac Torrent 3.4L V6 AWDI have had a Ponti," I have had a 2009 Pontiac Torrent AWD 3.4 L V6 since 2010. I get 25-28 MPG highway at 60 mph. I live in the country so for city driving I have less data. Going up steep hills hill MPG can drop to 15 MPG. Minimum MPG is 23-24 with no city driving and various driving terrain. Vehicle has 185,000 miles and gets the same good MPG as new. Car has had a new throttle body, new front transaxle, new timing chain, two new intake manifold pressure sensors, new ERG, new battery, and all fluids, plugs, and filters  changed at recommended times or more often. Brakes are original and will go to ~210,000 miles. The problems I have seen with the car are a lot to front transaxle wear and rear differential wear. I have had to change those lubricants more than recommended. Also had some automatic transmission shifting issues. The transmission seemed not to be able to make up its mind. The dealership said it was OK on test drive so I fixed it myself by installing new intake manifold pressure sensor (first sensor went bad in 2 months so it took another one before problem was solved). I relayed the info to the dealership and they agreed that was the problem. Vehicle drives great in snow and ice, it has all options; Stabilitrac and traction control. Road noise is high. Buy a quiet all weather tire and it will be better. Overall I would buy this vehicle again. I like the AWD snow and ice driving. I have never gotten stuck.",4
2, on 10/27/15 18:28 PM (PDT),Vic ,2009 Pontiac Torrent SUV 4dr SUV (3.4L 6cyl 5A),"Great, reliable car/SUV."," Sold it. (But loved it and miss it!)Super dependable with a decent ride and nice acceleration. Plenty of room for 5 and lots of cargo space. Rides more like a truck with a stiffer ride. This SUV is very flexible and dependable. It's a great family car, yet can also carry large loads (i.e., equipment, tools, lumber, etc). Have thought about trading it in but its just such a nice utilitarian vehicle that I hate to part with it.Update: Sold the car in January this year (01/2016). It was still in excellent condition, no mechanical issues, no rust, decent (but stiff) ride. Wanted something with a smoother ride for trips around the country. Sold it for $8000 which I felt was pretty good for a 7 year old vehicle. Have been a regular Pontiac owner (Grand Am, G6, Montana, Torrent) and am sooooo disappointed they went out of business.",5
3, on 09/22/10 00:00 AM (PDT),mollyd ,2009 Pontiac Torrent SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.4L 6cyl 5A),Driving it until it dies.," Originally owned a 2007, traded in for a 2009 AWD when I heard they were stopping the line.  I literally walked on the lot, said how much and then started negotiating.  This one rides smoother than the 2007.  I'm 5 feet tall and not only do I feel safer in an SUV, this one isn't so wide that I feel like I'm driving a bus. The AWD really gets me around in almost impassable snow.  We had 13 inches and I didn't have a problem.  I really love this car, mechanically I have not had a single problem at 30k+.  My biggest challenge is where the front end ends, I always have about 12 inches of freedom I don't know about.  Plus, parallel parking isn't tough unless it's a tiny spot. Fuel econ 17/21.",4.5

Suspension has a sport feel, different than the sister GM SUVs like it. The wife does not want to get rid of it still,but keeping an eye out for a lower mileage Torrent now to replace it.",5

Yes I replaced one wheel bearing, did the head gaskets, and now adrive train bearing. But it's on it's third lifetime in Midwest Winters and hot summer. We got it with 74k 10 yrs ago. On our third set of tires, we buy Cooper. If I can find another with only 100 k on it, I'll buy it for later on. Love the manuverability.",4

8, on 02/12/16 13:45 PM (PST),Naomi Milligan ,2006 Pontiac Torrent SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.4L 6cyl 5A),Please don't buy this truck!," I purchased my 2006 Pontiac Torrent used but 'GM certified' the day after I drove it off the lot I had to take it back for an oil pan seal (luckily the dealer covered that since I had the car less than 24 hours) that was just the beginning and I should have RAN!! I have had this truck 3 years and thus far I have replaced the following: tires, 16 wheel bearings (all by different mechanics to rule out mechanics error), rear end, carrier bearing, CV axles (front and rear), brakes and rotors, 4 alignments (to try and fix the wheel bearing issue), ball joints, control arms, EGR tube, ABS sensor, factory radio (switched for an actermarket as I've heard of sooooo many issues with the factory ones), cruise control, steering column, windshield washer motor, windshield (x3 don't let a pebble hit the glass, ever!), and after JUST putting over a grand in to it not even a month later (which seems to be about the timeline I get in between repairs) the check engine light is on, the alternator is going out, and there is an all too familiar grinding starting back up. I have actually decided to get a second vehicle as this one is in the shop SO MUCH and every time I go to sell it, something else BREAKS and I have to get it repaired. I am not one to beat my vehicles up (I hate paying for repairs!) and this thing STILL is nothing but problems! The interior is also cheaply made as there is paint coming off the door handles and the radio surround. Oh! And the bumper brackets broke about a month after I bought it (and continued to break) so I got innovative and started using cable ties, probably the most reliable part on this entire vehicle!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS VEHICLE AT ALL COST!!!! I've estimated about 8 grand (so far) in repairs and as soon as the check engine light came on it started idling hard (non-permissible content removed)!",3

Overall reliable, comfortable, smooth ride, fun to drive. Get about 17 city/24 hwy mpg. Pros: Very spacious front/rear seating and cargo space; comfortable; reliable; smooth ride for low-price basic crossover class (broad wheel base). Cons: Replaced heating/A/C actuator motor at 53K (+$900 repair) but was GM recall later - contacted dealer, reimbursed same day; replaced wheel bearings at 75K; replaced bolts on exhaust at 86K (apparently common problem on Torrent and Equinox - made exhaust loud - easy $20 fix); slow pick-up at acceleration; odd window controls placement (all in front seat center console).",4.75

The first year and a half, the vehicle was the best that I'd owned. Drove from Memphis, TN to Gatlingburg in the snow, Hattisburg, MS, Meridian, MS, Jonesboro, AR, and Little Rock, AR with no problems. But during my trip to Little Rock, it seemed like I was having trans problems. When I took it to the trans shop, they said it was a speed sensor. Needless to say, the speed sensor kept messing up. I had it replaced 4 times before getting rid of the vehicle. Now, my ex-fiancee's aunt has replaced the trans but the problems persists. And the paint is peeling.",4

Dealer dismissed this as it was off warranty and nothing they could do. Paint is now peeling on tailgate, front passenger 1/4, rear driver 1/4 panel and inside the rear passenger door. I'm waiting to see if GM is going to step up as this is not the result of normal wear and tear.Inferior paintis a known problem on 2006 models. ",3

Look it up - blender acuerator.   My mechanic says it is the poorest designed car he has ever seen and won't even attempt to replace that part.  I am getting rid of this piece of junk as soon as I can.  It is winter in the south and no heater.  The dealership just laughed when asked about ongoing issues with this car.",3.25

Around 80K I replaced a wheel bearing and it stopped heating. By 90K I had blown head gaskets twice and made the decision to put a new motor in it with 44K. This motor is running much smoother but my engine light stays on at all times. Going on 95K on the body and my struts need to be replaced and another set of tires. I need to get this car paid off and move on from GM. ",3.375

Although, my recent experience has left me terrified of the vehicle. I been driving for four hours in the middle of the summer when without any warning whatsoever my car had died.  I lost all steering and veered to the side of the road.  A bad alternator had caused the car to die.  Because of this, the power lock doors and windows would not open.  I was trapped inside my Pontiac Torrent midsummer in 37 degree Celsius sun unable to open any doors or windows.  I had learned the hard way there is no emergency release within the vehicle to unlock the doors and car windows.",3.75

The interior is spaceous, providing plenty of room for passengers in both the front and back seats.   Never had any problems with engine, transmission or brakes.

Although, I must say I only drive about 10,000 miles a year. I bought it March 2006 and just had to get new tires about a month ago. I have not had any problems with mine at all up until this week. My check engine light came on? I have not gotten it checked out yet but I really don't think it could be much of anything since I have so few miles. Besides that, I LOVE driving it and really has been a good car, especially for what I paid for it! ",4.375

I purchased the Torrant in 2006 with 11000 miles on it. It was a loaner car. Love the Torrant when it's not in the shop. I have only had two problems with it. Right from the start the AC would quit working I live in the south so AC is a must. Had the Torrant to my dealer several times & another and they couldn't find anything wrong. Finally after they replaced parts and worked on several things they thought it was fixed. Well it's still not from time to time. Now Torrant is in the shop again. The suv just quits while I am driving. My dealership is great & really trying to repair. Defective code B2105 com lost with ECM BCM to PCM still problem. ,3.75

The traction control light goes on but doesn't seem to help at all. Starting,stopping, and cornering are all bad. Any faster than 3 - 5 mph around a corner, and it will spin. Much worse than my S-10.

So happy with the 06, replaced with new 2009 by phone, sight-unseen, from Hubacher Cad, who ordered from Bay Area (we're in Sacto, CA area.)  Problem: they had no gold, only silver.  Have had 3 days, not driven yet (broken ribs.) Hope it's as great as my gold 2006.  Original like new still, regular maintenance, and only one problem with electrical which dealer fixed immediately.

First two wheel bearings changed were covered under the lease at 20,000 kms.  Remaining 4 on all tires were not.  Have just begun to hear that familiar humming once again that signals another $350 out of my pocket.  The alternator went at 72,000 km for the cost of $1,000, tires were replaced around the same time, along with rotors and brakes.  This spring, the paint began chipping on the drivers side and back and so the whole vehicle will need a paint job.      ",3.75

It had so many great features on the interior (heated seats, dark fabric, easy wheel mounted controls, temp. display etc...).

After numerous ""smaller repairs"" I noticed a rattling sound and brought it in...the engine needed to be taken out to replace a loose cap inside of it ($3,500) luckily it was covered by warranty.

Over all I have to admit I have been happy with it. I like the roominess, the stereo, and the power. The problems I've had are the right front door speaker had to be replaced, twice. I had to replace the windshield in it, twice. Both times no explanation for why the windshield cracked. Too much flex in the body? Also the remote clicker wouldn't always unlock the car. That seems to be working okay now. The car is nearing the end of it's warranty and I had planned on trading before it expires but the car has depreciated so much that I owe more than it's worth. Now that Pontiac is going away wonder what that will do to the value? My next car will be a Honda",4.25

I cannot for the life of me figure out what is causing this!  The first two were under warranty the last 3 have cost a whopping $ 400 each incl. labor.

I live in a snowy area and have driven it in the snow but never ever saw the AWD light kick on. It used to shift rough but now it's OK. I guess it was just because it was new.

A lot of little problems from sensors that would not allow me to put gas in my car (really!) to a freaked out blower motor that would not turn off. (twice) This summer vacationing at the beach, I was caught in a torrential rainstorm. Noticed a horrible wet smell the next couple of days. Yesterday took Christine to get her washed and water came through the dome lights. From the gearshift. And into the floorboard. Warranty gone!

But, I've had it almost exactly 2 years and the heater stopped working.  Per the dealership, I've got a plugged heater core wich is $400-500 to fix. They also have another Torrent in the shop right now with the same problem.  This seems a bit odd to me that 2006 Torrents would start having this problem. Wished it had a 5 year/100,000 warranty.

All within the first couple months of owning this thing (except for the rotors, that was at 17,000 miles, still ridiculous).

It's now 2 years old and it's been in for service over 10 times starting 6 months after I bought it.  It's been in for reasons ranging from a bad battery to the ignition column locking up.  Each time I take it in service claims it's fixed and each time I have the same issue or a whole new one.  I've called Pontiac and GMC and neither can help me.  I'm now stuck in a car that's been deemed unsafe for another 2 years because it will cost me too much to get out.  I cringe whenever I drive the car and brace myself to deal with service centers.

However, I have had trouble starting up the car especially on short trips. Sometimes, it doesn't even start the first (or sometimes second, or third) time! That is outrageous for a brand new car.

The decision maker was the Equinox had scratchy upholstery while the Torrent's was soft and comfortable. The Torrent has proven to be a comfortable vehicle, even for tall passengers riding in the back seat.  Sharp exterior but the interior could use a touch of class. Three design flaws: (1) I don't smoke, but a removable ashtray should be standard for things like gum wrappers; (2) The CD storage area is not easily accessible; and (3) A wider cargo compartment would have been more beneficial than having the small side storage wells.  No mechanical problems (knock on wood). Nice vehicle and GM offered 0% financing",4.125

It has 'just enough' power on both the highway and in the city to make short & long trips fun & enjoyable. The vehicle is reliable in most situations and I like the roominess in the interior. The stereo and sound system is nice.  As for the AC, it is about useless in the Las Vegas heat.  Many a times, I simply opened up the windows to cool off rather than tax the AC system.  Passengers in the rear seats cooked.  There is plenty of leg and head room. I have found that the vehicle does not have the much of a turning radius and it has many blind spots; like when backing up or parking.

Its V6 gives me plenty of power to ease onto Interstate highways and it climbs over the mountains of Western Maryland with ease. The 5 speed transmission is the smoothest shifting one I've ever experienced.

Sad but this Pontiac Torrent is a rock solid performer and for good value. It is said GM always stops building a car when they got it right.  I echo most of the comments above. This is a fun to drive vehicle and handles  well for the 3.4L Minor gripes: the cupholder window control, Perhaps a luggage rack bar on top as standard.  Back  seat room is far superior to all other  midsize SUVs.  The only problem? My  20 year old daughter  now ""claims"" it as her primary driving vehicle!

It gets very good gas mileage on the highway - about 25 to 26.  The controls are pretty good, but the steering and handling on the base model is unacceptably sloppy. If you like this vehicle, get the GXP model which has a different and tighter steering system. The center console could be a lot better and more useful - it lacks storage and the center mounted power window buttons are not intuitive. ",3.75

I test drove several SUVs over Labor Day weekend (the 2008s were priced to move).  I didn't even know that Pontiac had a crossover (I was familiar with the Equinox, which is the same vehicle).  I was about to pull the Trigger on a Santa Fe, which actually had a nicer interior with more storage, but once I test drove the Pontiac, I was sold.  The 3.4 L pulls that rig right up to speed with no problem, and the handling was tight like a sports sedan.  Compared to the Santa Fe and the Escape, the Torrent won on performance alone (and good looks).  Also, I averaged 26 MPG on the 120 mile freeway drive home.  Not bad for a big vehicle like this.",5

Though the Envoy was loaded the Torrent has plenty of features and is fun to drive.  I pulled my boat 500 miles with no problem and the mileage is about 20% better than the Envoy.  The Torrent is fun to drive, don't believe the reviews about it being ""mushy"" etc. The 3.4 V6 has plenty of spunk.  The vehicle performs very well in town and on the highway.  Highway mileage is about 25 and city is about 18.

Enough space to carry just about anything, but handles like a compact, that fabulous Pontiac power steering and transmission.  Pontiac is the true signature American car; sharp style at first glance, muscle when you need it, smooth ride, fun and always dependable.  I have done weekend driving with the Murano and the Jeep Liberty and the Torrent beats both no contest.  It has all the classic benefits of a Pontiac:  fast start, stylish interior and exterior, affordable price (at $26,000 it is $12,000 cheaper than the Murano) and great on gas.  I get 27 miles to the gallon, and it only takes $61.00 to fill up the tank.  I love this car.",5

This SUV is fun to drive, has enough horsepower to carry 4 good size (and then some) people without dragging its feet, and handles very well. Even though it has lots of room inside, it's not a huge land barge like the Escalade. My friend bought a Ford Explorer and his 15 mpg is killing him.

This is especially important for me since I am on the road a lot and my car is in a Motel Parking lot overnight. The car is only 48 hours old and already has 600 miles on it.

The Pontiac has it all over them. More power, more room, better styling, better fuel economy all with a lower price tag. The interior on the Pontiac Torrent is very roomy, comfortable and well laid out. Cargo space is huge and versitile because of the sliding rear seat. Fit and finish is outstanding both inside and out. Power from the standard 3.4L V6 is impressive and the 5 speed automatic transmission is smooth shifting and the rest of the drivetrain is also smooth and quiet.

As soon as I got in and adjusted the seats and realized that I would never again need a pillow to get close enough to the steering wheel, I was in love. And then to top things off,I finally had a place to store my huge purse; the center console lifts up to hold a purse or anything else. And then you can fold the center back down again. For a woman who pays a lot of money for purses, I never have to throw it on the floor, or the back seat, I can have it next to me but neatly stored. Someone was really thinking there.

It has met my expectations. NO mechanical problems and took 2 week road trip and it was very comfortable. I planned on keeping this vehicle for many years, due to it's nice performance, handling and storage room.  It has a 5 star crash rating and unfortunately I recently was involved in a serious collision with airbag deployment. I walked away from the car without a scratch or bruise!

Slips and slides and I get zero traction. Basically, I come to a rolling stop at stop signs, because I know I won't get traction to get going again.  The traction control is a joke. I had my Torrent for a month, and the traction control went out. They claimed they fixed it, but it still doesn't work properly.  Will be trading for a roomier SUV, this fall.  Also, you'd think for a smaller SUV, it would get better gas mileage. I can get as bad as 9 mpg, driving in town, and up to 25 on the highway. For how small it is, I would like to see it get way better mileage than that!!",2.75

Everything has gone on it but the Dealership in my hometown of Orillia never seems to be able to agree with my findings of course.  Hoping to trade it in soon.

I agree with everybody else in saying that the parking break and cup holders should be restructured so they could be used at the same time, and also the location of the cigarette lighter is hard to get to when you are using the cup holders.

Dealer says they've not seen this before but refuses to help.  GM's Regional Manager refuses to contact me so I can discuss this with GM.

I have looked on and off but in 2006 when I saw the Torrent I knew I had to have one. I test drove the Rav and CRV and the Torrent left the best impression on me. It had the feel of a sporty Pontiac. The Torrent has decent giddy-up not as much as my 2005 Bonneville SLE but still enough. The back-seat slides forward and back to adjust for cargo room or leg room. I have been very happy with its balance of function and performance. In a crowded segment the Torrent stands out, and frankly there is not a better small SUV out there for the money. I am enjoying this little thing a lot and it is perfect for a family the likes to travel. ",4.875

Styling is ""eye catching"" and performance with the 184 HP engine is remarkably strong, handling is much like a sports car feel.  Highway is a smooth ride.  Instrumentation is easily viewed and accessible. There is plenty of room for driver and passengers. The back seat adusts as well which is unique.  As a mid-size it is comparable to other, more expensive makes, as far as hauling capacity.  The sound system is wonderful.  During hot summer months the A/C cools quickly.  I looked at other makes comparable in size priced in the $30,000's that I would normally purchase but for the money I choice this Torrent and have been pleased.  Time will tell.    ",4.875

I found that the CRV & Rav4 cant pull a boat & looked toyish.  The Escape is smaller & gets worse gas mileage.  Likewise, the Dodge Nitro/Jeep Liberty twins have lower MPGs, & they just didnt have a quality feel.  The Torrent feels roomier inside than any of the other SUVs, & its reliability ratings are good.  Overall feel is that of a more expensive import.

Was tail-ended, everyone safe, and the cost of repair was very reasonable because the rear bumper is in a couple of different parts.  If the whole thing had been one piece, it would have been higher. The interior design is sorely lacking.  If the cup holders are in use, the parking brake cannot be.  You have to remove drinks from the holders to put on the parking brake as well as use the cigarette lighter for recharing cell phone. When putting on the parking brake by habit and there are drinks in the holders, the drinks spill or the holder is in danger of being broken.  P Drives wonderfully.  Fun.

The controls on the Steering Wheel are terribly designed. The 3 cruise control buttons (and those for the radio too) are much too small for a man's finger! I must take off my eyes off the road and actually look to find the right button, then use my fingernails to activate the control button.In short, a terrible design. I now have 12,000 Miles on it and I am ready to replace the tires. Especially in rainy weather, a little acceleration and the wheels start to spin! No traction whatsoever -very disappointing.

It is very safe, one of only two cars getting 5 stars with-out side airbags! Get the SAB option anyway!  It is very roomy, opened up it holds more than many SUVs much larger, and it holds more than all other mid and small SUVs.  This is because the rear is still squarish, so it really opens up.  The mileage is good for an AWD, I regularly get 22 to 24 in real driving.  But like all Torrent/NOX owners I wish it had a little more pep. The 08 has more engine options.  Major complaint is the lack of a good arm rest for my left arm on the door, or a telescopic steering wheel. ",3.75

We decided to stay in the GM family so that knocked out the Honda (it also seemed a little small for our use).  The Pontiac had better option packages and the one we wanted was readily available at the dealer.  After driving it for a few months my observations are as follows: The styling is great, it does look like higher end vehicles, the pick up is slow but once you hit it, it takes off.

The Torrent has a responsive feel and very good handling for a crossover type car. Although the horsepower could be slightly higher to create better response, there is plenty of pickup to nudge your way into highway merges. Extensive leg room and flat floor space makes for better comfort than our previous Envoy in the back seat area. Fully equipped with everything but the navigator, my wife seems to marvel at the remote start and sunroof features which add more enjoyment. Better feel than the Equinox, easy to drive, the Torrent makes for a great alternative to pricier crossovers.",4.875

If you want sharp looks with functionality, this is the car for you. The mesh inside the Torrent is a lot smoother than its counterpart.

Looked at the Jeep Grand Cherokee Ltd which is what I had before but wanted something a little less to go along with my new retired lifestyle. Looked at others but nothing clicked until I drove the Torrent. Its towing cap. (3500 lb.) is more than adequate for my use and the back opens up to be fairly flat and roomy.  It is fairly quick but no flash -- but then my other car is a Bonneville SSEi (turbo).  It handles well and corners well -- it feels agile.

Not only is the Torrents size just right, but it looks cool, it drives very well, and it has great leg room in both the front and rear seats. The V-6 engine really goes when you need it to. The car handles corners better than our 02 Corolla did.  The gas mileage is acceptable for a car this size. The 3500lb towing capacity is enough for all of our needs.

Okay, we got the looks but what were they thinking with the realiability adn performance?  We have been back to the dealership several times.  No, we didn't purchase the extended warranty on the used vehicle but who would have thought we would need to with an American made vehicle?  Where's the American pride?  We've had numerous inconvenient problems such as power windows not working, electronic sliding door opening while going down the road, gas gauge not working, cup holders breaking easily, directional not working, coolant problems -- so far over $2,000 in costs plus!",2.25

The fact that it hasn't, speaks VOLUMES about GM's attitude toward customer satisfaction. If you ever wondered why the Japanese car companies are killing American auto makers, you need look no further than this vehicle. The cheap quality of interior parts is only surpassed by the $1500  repair bill every 2-6 months when yet another sys/component fails.",2.5

Coolant leaking into the cylinders for quite some time but just letting it go to squeeze the last few miles out of this.  Electrical problems since new, hooking up to computer does not tell mechs what is wrong. Front windows both not working!Replaced steering, ignition,headlamp switch, fuel system (2 x). Replaced cup holders under warranty several times and now all broken. Do not close rear hatch with handle because I know it will break. Sliding door serviced 5 separate times. Replaces generator. Bought this for 30K. have spent another 5K.  No wonder GM is having problems! Go spend time with Japanese to find out how to make cars!",2

Myself have put over another one hundred thousand miles. Its been the best vehicle Ive ever owned. The car history report was clean when I bought it, still is today. No lie, the van runs like its new still to this day. However there is some minor issues that I think are small. The gas needle reads full all the time, It leeks dexacool, very small amount. My light comes on maybe once a month. I had to replace a fog light, and a head light. That's it, I live up in the mountains of western Maryland and my van will fly up these hills like there nothing.

The radio lights and gas gauge have not worked for years.  We got $1250 for a trade-in, so if you buy one, you should plan on driving it into the ground.",3.625

All GM's vans had problems, this is by far the best out of the three though.

We bought with 29K in 2002 for $18M.  Fully loaded w/o DVD and 100K/6yr warranty for $2K, great value by the way, after all its a GM.  Standard accoutrements are excellent.  The leather, rear air/rear sound, automatic sliding door, quad seating are all you can ask for unless you appreciate listless children drooling over the most recent Disney DVD. We love this vehicle and wish GM wasn't leaving the utilitarian minivan market. Crossovers don't offer the room and the Suburban is too big. We're going foriegn due to GM's shortsightedness and lack of caring for the family utility vehicle...the mini-van. God rest its soul.  Marketing sure led to its demise.",3.875

If they had any sack they would pony up and refund everyone $1000, which would be about 8 out of 10 owners, and they knew of the problem for years. The resale value is laughable. I have had 3 intake gaskets done and is leaking again. I would not advise my worst enemy to buy this boat anchor.

327, on 10/23/07 19:00 PM (PDT),Poor quality ,2000 Pontiac Montana Minivan 4dr Ext Minivan,Reliable as a Model T," First thing the car did was the breaking and snapping off of the plastic parts inside the car. Cupholders, knobs, ect. Then the tail and brake lights. They don't just burn out, they fuse (melt) to the plastic tail lamps. This happens every 10,000 mi or so. Did I mention oil consumption? How about a quart every 2,000 mi. The electric rear windows leak also. That's why there is huge stain on the rear carpet. A nice rusty color to boot. The radiator began overheating too (83,000 mi). When the van is started warm or cold, it likes to rev to 1500 rpm, so you have to turn it off and restart till it stays at 800 rpm. A mind of it's own for sure. Will be buying anything but this, next time around",2.75

Problems with rear air, blows hot air even though it has been repaired several times.  Low coolant level all the time, mechanic said I need to replace the vehicle soon becuase the coolant is leaking into the engine oil. Constant problems with the power sliding door - sticks open often, don't use it anymore. Great interior, still looks like new but cupholders broke soon after purchase- flimsy and ill placed.

Our van has been very reliable, except for the intake gaskets that I had to replace. Otherwise, at 100k it still runs and rides pretty good. Love the room, and we use this as our truck at times as well. I do wish they had better resale. Mine is 100% mechanically, and still worth peanuts. Power sliding door needs to be reset from time to time, but other than normal care, it has been a good van",3.375

At 75,000 miles the new Orange Anti Freeze coolant ate thru some gaskets. I got to dig out my wallet again.Over $1000 for this one. The fuel gauge has not worked for thousands of miles, the dealer can fix me up for under $800 by replacing something in the fuel tank. No thanks, I will just keep the tank full. The power windows fail periodically, but reset themselves, must be a heat thing. Fortunately the dealer only charges me $30 when I bring it in for repair estimates.",2.875

The video system helped keep our two kids busy when we drove to Yellowstone and back to Pennsylvania and later to southern Florida and back, along with trips to Massachusetts and back in between.  The system takes both vhs video tapes and video game inputs.  On these long trips I found the gas milage was better than expected as the most recent trip to Florida gave me at least 27 to close to 30 mpg on the highway.  The digital information system helps when put on instantaneous mpg, one learns what helps and what hurts as far as gas milage goes.

However, the Montana was $5K cheaper (although now it's payback time - no resale).  It has really been surprisingly dependable - little stuff (fuel pump under warranty, power window switch, currently at 75K the fuel gauge and cruise control are out) but it has been overall quite dependable.  Average gas mileage (17-24), loads of power, and really handles well now that I have switched to 235/60-15 tires - you've simply got to do that.  Turns it from wallowing pig to confidence inspiring sport-minivan.  Air Conditioning is marginal - you might want to get the dual AC.  Seats - barely  OK.",3.625

Not only was the ride comfortable (2 trips to Florida from New Jersey in 2 years) but the fuel economy was great for a 6 cylinder engine (27 mpg on the FL trips). Plenty of room. My only complaints were the air conditioning (it rarely ever got cool enough) and the middle seat removal latches. Both were difficult to operate and one actually broke. Other than that, it was a great car. Seat belt restraints and air bag saved my life in a recent accident that totalled the vehicle.",4.625

I began having electrical problems right after the warranty ran out, smelling smoke while I was driving and tracing the problem to a 24 V DC short in a connector in the interior driver side rear panel.  The wiring bundle was so hot that it melted the insulation on the wires.  This resulted in damage to the tail/brake light, automatic leveling and interior air compressor circuits.  Now, after roughly 65K miles, the transmission has started to go out.  This is a family vehicle that I needed to last for many years.  As it is, I will likely get it paid off in time to junk it.

Dealer turns a deaf ear, while a call to GM was no better--gentleman I spoke with indicated that 95,000 was a good excuse for oil usage.

The dealer showed me this car, and I wasn't totally impressed initially, but after a test drive, I had a change of mind. This car gets it done. I've had it for about 18 months now, and as a commuter, who drives about 30,000 miles a year, my little silver bullet has proven solid through an extreme winter in Ohio, never given me any engine trouble, and is pretty comfy for a base model. I keep the oil changed, and I do regular maintenance as the manufacturer suggests.6/17 update: Finally something went bad on this little car.

The body is rusting through on the doors, hood, and trunk.  It is simply horrible in snow, rain and wind.  The front stereo speakers stopped working within 2 years of ownership.

It came with every available option, (IE: leather, sun roof, Pioneer XM stereo, heated seats, remote start, 17 inch tires). I drive a lot of highway miles to/from work and I wanted a car that got good highway gas mileage and looked sporty. Highway 32 mpg winter, 36 mpg summer. Mileage decreases at speeds over 65 mph.  Original tires lasted to 98,000. Replaced rear brakes at 120,000, front brakes at 182,000. Now replacing second set of tires 3/23/16 at 185,500 miles. I change oil every 4,000 to 5,000 miles and have most routine maintenance performed. The front right strut has failed twice (weak design).  Car is getting noisier with age (road noise).  Handling in snow is not very good for this lightweight car.  Comfort is not the best as expected with a smaller lightweight car, but for a go-to-work car, it exceeds my expectations. Not recommended for adult seating in the back as it is difficult to get in and out and head clearance isn't sufficient for over 6'-0"" individuals.  Other than this, it has been a relatively low cost maintenance car and very dependable. I intend to drive it another 100,000 miles.  Replaced serpentine belt and second set of rear brakes around 215,000 miles, replaced battery at 223,000, all for reliability reasons. Still runs good averaging 35 mpg.  Struts starting to rattle with age and will likely replace soon. Up to 237,000 miles now with only routine maintenance.",5

It made me realize that a lot of people out there will never be pleased no matter what. The Pontiac G5 is the best car I've ever owned, and my previous car was a six cylinder Lexus ES300. The G5 is small for sure, but it packs a serious punch that I never expected out of a car with a 4 cylinder engine. It's faster than my Lexus was and is way more fun to drive. In my opinion it's the best economy car on the market. Seriously, the dudes (or dudettes) who wrote bad reviews need to get their heads checked because the G5 is amazing. Just wish they were still being made. I would get a new one without any type of reservation. ",4.875

I got it used with two previous owners that didn't take care of it it seems. I purchased it and have drove it a lot. I found it needed a fan, sunroof drain pipe fixed, and now it needs new struts. The dealership fixed everything and hopefully will fix the struts. But all of that are used car problems especially when the last owner(s) didn't take much care of it. I love my car. Has everything that comes with it. I don't know if they are added features or if the GT comes with all of it. Sadly mine is an automatic tho. I love the pioneer audio, the heated seats, the sunroof, everything. It's a beautiful car and gives a powerful burst when on the gas even tho it's only a small ecotech 4 cylinder. And when I go to fill it halfway up because that's when I always do. Never let it get below half is my way and I always fill it till it's full. I spend only $13. Some cons that I noticed are the doors swing pretty far out. Not a con but the con is they can sometimes swing open with small force so I'm constantly telling people be careful. Another con. Doors and trunk hit hard. When closing the doors and trunks the seem to slam. Doors I have no idea why but the trunk because the spoiler weighs a lot. Another con involving the trunk is the spoiler being heavy. Not so much a con but makes it hard to open the trunk because when pushing the button to release it it doesn't pop up very far and I don't like using the spoiler. One con is that it doesn't shift until the rpms are pretty high. Unless that's my way of driving. You may get better shifts and better gas mileage where I'm averaging only 20mpg where it should get 25-30. Those cons aren't that big of a deal but the worst con I have and the thing that I hate the most is the turn radius. You don't want to make a u-turn unless you are clear for a long distance. You may need to back up. I have a fairly big highway to u turn on and sometimes I'm still scared. I can barely back into my driveway because where everyone turns into to back into the driveway or back out. It's a pit filled in with gravel and I always end up in the wooded part behind it. So that's my review on the Pontiac G5. I love it but be careful turning always.",4

I was doing about 40mph & never had the chance to hit the brakes. I was wearing my seat belt & the air bag deployed, I was knocked out, fortunately when I came to I was basically OK. I did sustain some injuries,but nothing major! The G5 did sustain almost $6k  in left front damage tho. So I was a crash test dummy & lived to write about it!

So far within the first year and 35,000 km (21,000 miles) I've had the fuel sensor and pump replaces, the rear bushings on both front suspension replaced, the radio replaced 4x!! because the original radio that came with the car at the time of purchase was black and the company that GM gets to do the warranty work does not carry radios with black faces (on going issue). So far I'm really not impressed with the quality of my G5 and I'm just waiting for the next thing to go wrong. I can tell you this my next car will not be a GM (BMW, Acura, Honda).

I noticed if the car sits for more than a week, the rotors are totally shot.  Is this something that anyone else is having problems with?  I'm also not happy with the noise in the car, all the plastic is coming loose already.  I actually own a Honda Civic Si, and I haven't had any problems with it, as well as my Scion TC.

Keeping price in mind, I went with the base model, which still has great performance and equally impressive looks. My personal record average was 38.7 MPG in medium/light traffic on the interstate for an hour. Unlike most other cars I have driven, the headrests are actually effective and the seats are amazingly comfortable. For being over 6 feet tall, I have more than enough leg room and my head doesn't ever bump the ceiling. The interior controls are clustered intuitively and to my taste. ",4.875

My rotors are cheap and will soon need to replace them with made in the USA steel I've been told by guys at work because they are constantly wearing down even though I don't drive it irresponsibly.  I drive 120 miles a day, and I wish I bought a foreign made car, because the rattling in the front of the car is really starting to scare me.  This car will be worthless when I finally pay it off.

I have never had maintenance done on my car except for necessary oil changes. I do not have any problems with seeing through the back window because of the rear spoiler like a lot of other people have mentioned. I actually think the spoiler gives the car a more sporty look.  Some people may not like the firm seats but personally I find them quite comfortable. The car accelerates well considering the 4 cylinder and is a great around town driver.  I would not however recommend this car for someone who does a lot of highway driving as it is very light on the road and tends to sway because of the loose steering.,4.25

Sunroof button kept falling out, coolant leak (4 times for that problem), Oil leak was the recent one. None of them are because of my driving, the car has 8,000 miles on it there is NO reason for this to be happening. Other then that its a great car.

Looking around the lot I saw the G5, a 5 speed, very basic model. I hadn't driven a stick in years, but I found it immediately easy and fun to drive.

Well good thing this car came with a great warranty because I used it 4 times already. My clutch had a manufacturing defect which made it pop off the plate twice leaving me stranded. So they put in a new clutch plate. Then my rotors went at 9000 miles and had to be resurfaced, which they called normal. I've had cars go 30k and not need that. This car just feels poorly made overall. It's peppy for a 4 banger but the handling is too loose and the transmission shifts awkwardly rough compared to my old cars.

Idle is barely noticeable; the road and wind noise is also low.  Steering has some play in it, which I prefer because one doesn't have to grip the wheel so hard to keep it in a straight line.

Cheap interior (and mine's fully loaded), but you know that going in with Pontiac.  Electric steering's a bit non-responsive and then over-corrects (this is only an issue on sharp turns; no issues on highways, etc).  If you're a confident driver you won't notice the problem, and the GT corners really well (and is generally fun to drive) for a car its size.  At night when the road's wet or icy and you're taking a sharp turn the steering makes you feel a bit out of control.

It starts to click when you turn -Glove box is so small and inaccessible you can barely keep an envelope in there (it was way bigger in my old Sunfire)  ",4.875

Really is fun to drive and I love the purr of the V-8 motor.  I trade cars every 2 to 3 years, but this is a keeper. I even bought an extended warranty for 7years and 84,000 miles. Told my wife to bury me in it.  Mileage is not great, but a 400+ mile trip last year netted about 24MPG and not at 55MPH either.",4.875

I was looking for something with muscle that could still be somewhat sensible. I have had zero problems with the car, and I still love it. I have the mileage up to almost 23,000 already, and I'm in the thing constantly. The remote start is fantastic! It even has a sensor that detects the outside temperature..so if you remote-start your car on a hot day, the A/C comes on, start it on a cold day, the heat comes on. All in all, my only complaint was lack of tire selection..however, Goodyear is now manufacturing Eagle F1 All-Seasons in the appropriate sizes and they are killer tires. There are several companies that make tires for it..",4.875

I was blown away. Had been seriously looking at the new Mustang, but no more. Acceleration, high speed driving in all conditions, rain snow,(with winter performance Goodyears Eagle Ultragrip GW3 V rated) even city driving in stop and go traffic, the finesse this car has in stopping, lane changing, accelerating makes even the trip to work in heavy traffic almost enjoyable.

Otherwise my pick of the 3 new cars to drive at home that have this is the first choice. Have had many Grand Am's GT and also 1973 Grand Am with V8 with 4 spd and this GXP V8 much better as 1973 Grand Am would get scratch shifting into 4th gear at 90+ MPH but Grand Prix GXP with 4 dr. is much better all around car. Happy with purchase.  Was considering Toyota Camry Hybrid but ""The Fun"" and not a commuter drone is what this is about.  Some vibration noise in instrument panel at top so put some silicon fixed that, and twice slight noise when take steering hard turn in or out of parking spot but trying to narrow that down to fix.

The main problem with this car is the tires if you ever have a flat or have to get new ones.  The tire sizes are almost impossible to find.  I had a flat tire and had to wait almost 3 days to get a new one because no one stocked it.  Definitely a bad thing for a daily driver. This car also does not come with a spare tire.  It comes with a tire repair kit which does nothing for an unrepairable tire.  Then comes the gas mileage.  I only drive this car around town mostly and am lucky to average 16 in town and 22 on the highway.  I still only have about 3000 miles on it so hopefully those numbers will improve.  The rear seat entry is pitiful for this cars size.  ,4.125

Getting in the car and driving it is a thrill and it makes me forget any problems I may have. The performance is more than adequate. Stepping down on the gas a little makes it seem like it is taking off like a jet. It just wants to move. My first long trip rendered just over 26 mpg which is quite acceptable for a higher performance engine. The only problem I have experienced is the navigation system but I understand this is an overall problem and it doesn't really bother me as there will be a fix for it. The best part of this car is my dealer and my saleslady. A big plus!,5

Everything seems to be in the right place (well other than the dimmer switch). This car was the dealer demo so I got a gr8 deal on it. Was going to buy a Maxima, now that I own this Pontiac, I would not consider owning the nissan now. what more can I say, Ponaic got it RIGHT and now all they have to do is stay there and they will have many happy and loyal customers.

It has many assets: Much cheaper than the Volvo S60R I was also looking at, expressive appearance, dark cherry red exterior, cool rims, black leather interior, smooth ride, lots of cargo space, and rumbling 303hp V8 that runs on 4 cylinders for 28 mpg when cruising.  And fun to drive, with great acceleration, control and braking.  On downside, w/ my ht, driver's seat must be tilted back so I don't hit roof.  Also, headrest is fixed parallel w/seat back, so it's too far back to be of use even if seat weren't tilted.  Was car designed for Neanderthals, or should I drive with a racing helmet?

I looked at a Honda Accord at 8:30 this morning and was driving a Pontiac GXP off the lot by 12:30 this afternoon.  There is just something about that throaty V8 and the wrap around cockpit that says ""this feels right!""  It has the clothes of a sports sedan, but is undoubtedly a legitimate muscle car.

I chose a cherry metallic color for this car and I'm constantly getting excellent comments on the color and the style.. Now nothing is perfect. The rear seating is a bit tight.

With Stability Control, Magni Steer, and Full Time traction control, Plus the fantastic Heads Up Display, this is a safe car to drive. Just listen to the sound of the Small Block V-8, and you want to ride all day. Gas mileage, I am heavey footed but still getting 25 in Hiway, and 17 to 20 in mixed.

My gas consumption has averaged about 19-20 mpg so far, even all highway. I hope this changes as the engine breaks in.  ",4.375

I just finished graduate school and got a good job so I could finally afford a nice car.  I looked at the Charger a lot and was almost set on it when a friend persuaded me to test drive a GXP based on what he had read about it online.  I took his advice and ended up getting one just weeks later. Everything everyone has already written here is true.  I leased because I want to wait to see about the reborn Camaro and Challenger in a few years.  But regardless this is a sweet car.  I'm 23 and I love driving it.

The GXP is not as tight, but the V8 power is awesome.  I disagree with Edmunds because they aren't factoring in price and gas mileage.  The Charger may be a better car, but it's a new model.  Grand Prix has been around a few years.  Also, the Charger, which is much heavier doesn't get 28 mpg on the highway (GXP does if you use cruise control).  Also, I got a loaded GXP for 28000.  A similarly equipped Charger would go for 35000, and OnStar isn't even available!  In an other 18 months, I am going to get the G6 GXP!!",4.625

It has great gas mileage, great horsepower, it has needed only minimal repairs, and the only thing bad thing about it has been an issue with the ignition but that has been fixed. This is my first Pontiac I have bought and I donÂt regret the decision one bit.

Lots of horsepower, love the heated leather seats, the tire pressure system has come in handy. Slight hum from the climate control motor (drives my wife nuts, doesn't bother me). Started getting better gas mileage the more I drove it. I thought about trading it in on a 2014 Mustang but I would miss this car too much. I'm keeping it for now.

My only issue is that the front end bumper is so low, it end up scraping when I park. I've also got a minor leak in my oil pan, but that's nothing major.

I am a little disappointed and depending on how many more problems I have, will depend on whether I keep this car or not. If this is all Pontiac has left, then it was time to retire.

The last Grand Prix is very distinctive which is a real plus compared to generic ""non-style"" from Toyota and other mass marketers.  The GP also has a strong V6 that delivers excellent fuel economy without being a slug like many of it's competitors.  Mine has a tan interior which remains cool even on the hottest summer days with the sunroof wide open.

The struts were already bad, and it ran great. This car was a classic new-age Pontiac in that the electronics inside broke, but it held together under the hood. (the gas flotation device broke, inside dashboard lights went out partway). I had very few problems under the hood with this car. It ran in all conditions, and it carried the workload. Eventually, the head gasket blew and the trans started to go bad at 215k miles. Between service records and me, these were the first problems under the hood. It is a great first car in that it can take quite a beating. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a first car.",4

The clock currently shows 137K, and I am fairly impressed with it. Starts every time I put the key in, no matter how hot or cold it is. The good: plenty of power with the standard 3.8, decent sound system, good fuel economy with the size of the car, the overall look of the car is pleasing to the eye. The bad: needed intake manifold and gaskets right at 100K, a solenoid in the trans is going bad, low roof line so my head is almost rubbing the ceiling (I'm 6'1""), very picky about which alternator is in it.My overall opinion is this is a good car, and that takes a lot for me to say being a die-hard Mopar fan.

It runs smooth and powerful even with the 3.1. Handling is very responsive (kind of like the Camaro LT I use to have). Ride is firm and sporty. At 68K mi. it has a few minor imperfections, but hey, Ive been driving a 92 Chevy pickup with a stick for 12.5 years so this car feels like a Vette. I was glad to find out that the engine has a timing chain, no belt. Lots of fun to drive with dead straight tracking. I find myself taking the long way home. The stereo sounds great & the seats are comfortable. Overall, it's a really nice ride for not a lot of money. If you want a great car for $5 to $6k check one out. ",4.875

Couldn't bare to pay close to 20k for an new econobox, so bought the last of this generation in 2007 for half that. It is a comfortable muscle car. Acceleration and long distance cruising are its forte. Handling is okay but sloppy when really pushed. The transmission does this clunk at times when starting from a stop?? The ""leather"" is more like vinyl and the rear seats are not adult comfortable over the long haul. The hvac  setting doesn't work in the first 2 positions. The brakes fade under repeated hard use.

However I am so disappointed in my grand prix at the constant repairs with such low mileage. At 20,000 had the transmission pulled and repaired along with a wiring harness. Soon after the car had a very bad oil leak. Now at 57,000 the abs light is on water pump needs replacing. I have coolant running out and will cost me around $800 because the labor is long .

For the small of the two engines, the 3100S definitely provides impressive power and response. Quick off a stop and maintains speed effortlessly.  4 speed is definitely the way to go with this car, which shifts quite smoothly I might add.  Phenomenal highway car as well, especially when it makes 30+ mpg! Not bad around the city either, I average between 22-25 mpg.  The engine sounds great when the car is winding out too, without losing gas needlessly.

Fuel economy is 17 mpg in stop-and-go city and 30 mpg at 70 mph on the highway.

This engine got great gas mileage and is known to last a lot of miles.  The car drove very smooth and had great performance for when you wanted to get up and go.

951, on 12/08/15 02:42 AM (PST),Michelle ,2004 Pontiac Grand Prix Sedan GTP 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl S/C 4A),Loved it while I had it," A few years ago I was in a tight spot and had to replace my car ASAP because it had been totaled and I was allowed to have it for three days  to ""drive within daylight hours in the local area"" so that I could replace my car.Enter the orange 2004 Pontiac GTP.  I bought it used, with over 130k miles on it.  That was the best car I ever had! I loved it until I had to part with it recently (traded it in for a Kia Soul - don't judge me! I didn't want to do it but I had to!)To start, it was lovely all around.  Smooth, sleek, sexy - my friends found it to be an attractive car even if it was something ""older"" than what they had.  I even had a friend that asked if I were to sell it that I come to him first.  Unfortunately I had to part with it after three years, with over 167k miles on it.  Let me tell you a little something about the Pontiac I had.For the first two years, it held together great.  But this past year it started falling apart.  I replaced the cad. converter, the throttle body, the blower motor, replaced the master window switch and had my muffler fixed (technically that was last year).  I bought this car for around $5k, and just barely got a $1000 for it.  Here's my bottom line to anyone looking to purchase an older Pontiac; be prepared to drop some serious cash into it if it's a GTP.  One of the reasons why I had to part with my beloved car was because on my way to class I broke down on the highway.  A call to a trust worthy mechanic and towman later I found out the computer in the car was going.  Ah-ha~ I thought to myself, so this is they the horn was starting to be picky about when it would sound!  I almost got into an accident because my tires were worn (I didn't know at the time) and when I hydroplaned I nearly caused an accident - had it not been for the squealing tires the other driver would not have been aware of what was going on... because not matter how many times I hit the horn it wouldn't work! (but later it worked in the parking lot)Over all what I loved about it - it was affordable before it started falling apart.  Comfortable.  The heated seats and sun roof were a plus.  Beautiful color - I haven't seen too many cars pull off the orange exterior as well as the Pontiac.  Looked fantastic with tinted windows.  Great trunk size, V6 engine was great, and it was fun even if it didn't have all of todays bells and whistles (blue tooth, navigation, etc)  I once had to tote around an old man in a wheelchair and what we liked was the seat was leveled with his wheelchair.  Pop a sliding board on the seat and he could just scoot over comfortably.  The back seat might be a tight fit for some people, but I was able to transport a friend (riding shot gun) her two kids (one in a car seat, the other in a booster) plus my basset hound pound puppy.Downside? If you're in the snowbelt this was not an ideal car.  I crashed twice into a curb in one year because of snowbuild up on the tires.  I managed to bust up a strut and my swaybar.  Some of the parts I needed my mechanic had to go to a junk yard for - which makes me wonder if the first converter that was replaced was a junk yard part.  The backseats are not ideal for tall people.  You'll feel squished and I don't know about others, but I always felt that I was being folded in half sitting back there.  And if you have a GTP, be prepared to shell out some serious $$$ for repairs.  Some of the simplest jobs cost extra for me because of how everything under the hood was arrange.  Oh... and don't ask me why but GM put the power steering fluid down, almost behind the engine! It was very irritating when I had to pop the hood and locate the cap.All in all, this may make a great summer car for people who want less features and more car.",5

This one of the best cars I have ever owned. I have been driving it every day for the last 2 years 80 miles round trip to work. it now has 148,000 on it and it's still a great car. Great power, performance, comfort and reliability. I average 26 MPG. No major problems. This car has renewed my faith in American vehicles. Very sad to see Pontiac go. Anyone who hates this car must have a lemon. Yes, I would buy again",4.5

Good car until the 40,000 mile mark. Took it in for my routine oil change, and was told that there were particles of metal in transmission fluid. I did a trans flush and added Lucas Trans Lube to it. It took 2 full flushes to get all of the metal out of the system. Now at 88,000 miles, I was told, again, by a new mechanic that my trans fluid needs to be changed. The manual calls for 1 trans change at 100,000 miles. This would now make it 3 flushes in 88,000 miles. Check gas cap and check eng light came on at 65,000 miles. Computer says there's a leak in the exhaust manifold. Trading in before I dump money in it.",2.75

Bottom line, GM's got to do better.  The exterior design and discounted price sold us this car and I wish it hadn't.  I now understand what professional car reviewers look for.  The interior design is poor and cheap.  The finish on the steering wheel is peeling and the low glovebox is nearly inaccessible.  The seat side bolsters have worn through and the cheap interior plastic is impossible to clean.  Horrible side/rear visibility.

Edmunds rates that the engine is noisy, but I disagree. You can hear the growl without having to shout over it which is exactly how I think it should sound! I agree with all of the Pro's listed by Edmunds. I wish our car had the HUD as that is the only option that our GP does not have.

First the rear suspension went out, then the air conditioner and finally the car leaked inside from a heavy rainstorm. Pontiac should have went out of business instead of Oldsmobile.

So far I've had the steering repaired. Recently, the a/c compressor bearing went out. That skewed the belt which put tension where it didn't belong. The alternator, tensioners and compressor all needed replacement. The new compressor (a GM part) has significantly higher sides to keep the belt in place. I've also learned there's a problem with the intake gaskets and some day they'll need replacement. (My wife's '05 Impala already went through this.)

I brought it into the same dealer that repaired the oil pan leak.  They informed me that my lower head gasket, and power steering pump are now leaking.

You of course can't buy just the plastic piece that breaks you have to buy a whole motor replacement which cost between $80- $150.  I had to replace both of them within two years of each other.

It out-performs everything in its class regardless of cost.  So trading a little quality for performance is what you have. My maintence on this car so far has been new tires and oil changes.  I think this car is very good for what you pay.  I don't see anything in it's price range then or today that I'd rather own.  If your in the market my suggestion is test drive it.

You have plenty of back seat space so it is just easlier to access the back with doors. Nice power when needed from the supercharger, climbs hills with no problem, does well in rain and snow.  The car is solid inside and out. No rattles!!!  The radio display in both cars do some weird things!!!  The HUD(heads up display) display is the best feature.

Had a 1997 Mustang V6 before, but traded it in for a family car when my daughter was born. I wanted a more pratical car yet sporty as I had only owed sport coupes (all sticks)before. The GP-GT was the perfect car for me. I chose it over an Accord, Maxima and Camry. However, the last 44K (currently has 94K on it)has been another story. First the transmission (seems like a popular complaint) went out. Unfortunately, didn't have extended warranty. Then a power window, the ABS is malfunctioning causing the brakes to shudder when applied until the ABS turns itself off. I have also gone through 3 ""seven year"" batteries. Too bad, because the GP-GT is so fun to drive!",3.625

Last Monday my mother was on her way to work when she slide on black ice and tried to turn away from the car at the red light ahead. Swiped the front end bouncing off the car into a snowbank. The snowbank did the majority of the damage. She was okay which is another great testament to this vehicle! It needed towed out of the snowbank yet still drove but insurance deemed it totaled.

At 172,000 miles, it continues to run strong and reliably.  The 3800 engine is a durable performer.  The transmission does act up a little on random occasions; primarily hard shifts.  The only significant issue I've had with this car is that I've had to replace the lower intake manifold gasket three times since it was new.  I also had to replace the radiator and sunroof motor.  Also, the headlights on these cars don't seem to put out near enough light.  The headlight and taillight lenses tend to collect condensation; but the paint has kept a strong shine and rust isn't a problem.  The interior of the car has held up well other than the leather on the steering wheel and one of the radio speakers.  There are very few squeaks or rattles on the car even now.

Its a two door and looks mean.  It has very good power from a v6 200hp, 240 supercharged but not worth the extra $$$.  Reilability of these engines are suppose to be unsurpassed. Handling is very good and you can take curves and stuff faster than normal cars. As for some of this reviews below, these cars DO NOT have a timing belt!  This is the old timing chain, pushrod, dependable motor that has been around forever! (since the 70s) As for the bad... Its not common to have a steering itermediate shaft go out... Bad GM design.  *dealerships tend to try and replace the Rack and Pinion to cure this sound* beware its usually the shaft! ",4.125

This has been by far the most reliable American car I've had.  The only things I've had repaired was a faulty ABS sensor (under warranty) and replaced the fan motor.  Evidently there is a small discharge hole that can clog easily and rust out the motor.  The performance of the Grand Prix is great for such a heavy car.  A heavy car certainly helps for stability and passenger protection.  My MPG averages about 19-20 in city driving and gets around 30 on the highway.  MPG has improved with time.

The only work I have had to do in 3 years is flush the coolant (preventstive maintenance) and replace the original battery (75,000 miles).  The 3.8L engine and wide track suspension make it a dream to drive. Even though it is a 2000, I think it is one of the best looking cars on the road - the gentleman at the car wash place are particularly impressed.

Right now, the DRL's won't turn on, but to be honest, I think it almost looks better without them.  This car is great around town, and will easily get around anything too slow on the highway.

It does very good on long road trips. Now the bad part. Luckily when we (fiancee and I) bought the car, we got the extended warranty. It has helped pay for the $5K in repairs of this car. So far - intake & exhaust manifold gaskets have been replaced, HVAC fan was stuck on high, steering rack & pump replaced, front drivers side ball joint went out and in a ""chain reaction"" of events - broke the drivers side axle in two, replaced both of the tie rods.

Power- steering pump went out.  All within 10,000 miles of 100k.  The car is definitely worth keeping and repairing.  The GTP is the only way to go.

It never got great gas mileage due to the six cyl engine and the overall weight of the car.  I never took it on any great road trips---a 650 mile round trip was the longest I ever took with it.  But it's solid for in-town driving.  Given it's now 2018, the 2002 Grand Prix is ageing gracefully and if you get one you have to treat it kindly.  It is too bad that Pontiacs aren't made anymore.

It was clear that it had some adventures before I bought it but I needed a car quick. Was  pleasantly surprised when I did a road trip and got 31 miles per gallon - not bad for the 3.1 V6 Living in the North Country where winter can last 6 months and commuting 95 miles a day hasd put this car to the test. The biggesdt problem has been the wheel bearings. Luckily I am able to replace them myself- have done all 4 of them. Had a LITTLE  trouble the first winter withthe security system shutting off the car after 10 seconds. On the internet I found a module that allowed me to bypass the security system and it has been starting great ever since. Now with 189000+ miles on it I am replaceing the car with another Pontiac Grand Prix. I just bought a 2007 withthe 3.8 V6. Am looking forward to another great Pontiac.,5

Water pump,  abs system,  radiator cleaned and fuel pump. In 8 yrs that is great. Transmission and engine are still strong and the gas mileage is great. Interior has some flaws but  not too bad and it has had issues with holding water after extremely wet seasons but believe that was a previous owner /mechanic issue by removing seals.

I have had very little trouble with this car, the only real repair it has needed was that the rocker panels needed to be replaced. This is a great looking vehichle with classic great looking Pontiac lines. My least favorite part of this car was the low quality of the interior, which I feel that I could easily tear apart. The performance of this car has been outstanding though. Though the 3.1L isn't as fast as the 3.8L, it is much less prone to blowing head gaskets and mine has gotten to 238K miles and I still haven't had an issue. I get great gas mileage(19 City, 32 Highway), and the wide body design makes steering feel controlled, as I once was able to evade a moose going 60 in a 55!

The only things I ever had to do to the car were oil, tires, and wiper blade changes.  I did change the spark plugs at 50,000 miles, but only because I wanted to, it didn't need it.

At 25k, I had to replace my front wheel bearings; a $500 repair. At 56k, both my intake manifold gaskets blew out - $700. Six months later, my head gaskets are blown and the heads possibly damaged from the heat. I commute 25 miles one way to work in it every day, and have had only dealer repairs on it.

Things to look for: leak in through vent under the hood by windshield. The gasket just needs to be placed better (cost $25 to fix). It needed new computer part for the heater mechanism at about 40000 miles. Needed to replace wiper motor at about 50000 miles, needed new ABS sensors around 70000 miles.

I switched to chevrolet after bad experiences with other GM vehicles (firebirds)and after I totaled (not my fault) my camaro I decided I wanted a larger safer car so I bought my 2002 Grand Prix SE.. It is a good riding car but uncomfortable to ride in. The seats should be softer and should hug your body more. I was just hit with an unexpected but obvious problem with the Grand Prix.

It's been a great car, cosmetically it is beautiful. The short stubby antenna is horrible for receiving radio stations unless you are in town near the transmitter site or within a 10 mile radius. Steel antennas do a better job. Other than the reception of FM/AM in this car, the only other gripe I have, it much like the Trans Am, and Grand Am, the Grand Prix feels like you are having to lift yourself out of the car. I am used to a mini van or SUV where I don't need to LIFT myself from the seat. The seats are very comfortable. Maintenance on this one is great. No mechanical problems the entire time I have owned it which is about 4 years now. (Knock on wood). There is lots of trunk space, I do notice blind spots in the back while driving. Sometimes we may not notice a vehicle riding in our blind spot. The back seat seems to block our view also the angle of the posts for the roof support are positioned in a way which create a blind spot. The 97 Grand Am also has the same problem. They are good cars, but the blind spots and sitting low to the ground are an issue I cannot over look. Other than those issues, I am happy with the quality of the 2005 Grand Prix.

I've had only two minor issues that were quickly corrected under warranty. Very comfortable around town and on the highway. Acceleration with the supercharged engine is excellent, as is braking. This is a large vehicle, so handling is good but not great. Fuel economy is in the low 20s with mostly highway driving; nothing close to the 28 mpg listed on the window sticker. Interior materials are a mix of good to cheap, with some areas nicely padded and textured; others are cheap in feel and durability. Red illumination of instrumentation is very appealing. All controls are easy to operate and very intuitive.  ",4

They seem to think i'm crazy.  Really, i'm not.  It feels as if the brakes are sticking almost, but they say they aren't.  I don't know what to do anymore, so this car is for sale as we speak.  I'm getting an 07 Camry very soon.  No more GM for me.  Sorry.  All in all, I would really have liked this car had it not been for this weird problem, and the problems with build quality.

I can't complain. Build quality and reliability are excellent. The s/c 3800 is fantastic! Instant power when you need it, mash the gas and hold on. Average 24 to 25 mpg overall on mid- grade fuel. This car handles the twisties with ease and glides over the highway. Handles the Vermont winters with no problem due to a set of Blizzacks and Stabilitrak. Huge trunk, excellent heated leather seats, and sound system. Lacks a bit on headroom though and rear legroom can be tight. Installed K&N filter. Overall, a good little daily driver and nice upgrade from my previous Grand Am's. Can't wait to trade up to a V8 GXP!",4.75

Comparing it to a car like the vette is not fair but dollar for dollar it is work every cent. You get a powerful engine that responds. Decent comfort and great style.

I disagree. The car preforms fantastic, great power and exceptional handling. The car will understeer if pushed too hard.

Reliability on both cars (97 & 05) is terrific. Having a fold down front seat has come in handy more then once. I replaced the mufflers with Flow Masters and new exhaust tips. $400 and the car sounds like it wants to go and looks better from the back. My son-in- law replaced the air filter with a K&N filter. My only regret is that I did not know a V-8 was on the way. Pontiac needs to get back into NASCAR. I plan to stay with Pontiac and if it goes the way of Olds I will leave GM.

The suspension meets a fine balance between sportiness and confort, while the acceleration is enough to arouse a the Indy racer in all of us.

Its straight line performance is great for a sedan.  Its steering is a bit vague, but that's compared to my compact Mazda.  My 4cyl Mazda only got 2mpg's better with half the horsepower.  The dashboard is a bit bland in all black, so I recently bought a Sherwood dash kit to accent it.  The only other gripe I have is the door handles.

Great looking machine w/ the performance (HP, torque, braking, suspension) to support it.  Surprisely controlled torque-steer (traction control) and instantaneous response from the beefed- up 4T65E tranny.  The LS4's torque band is huge and pulls from one end of the tach to the other.  The StabiliTrak Sport is simply amazing in the snow/ice allowing you to drive safely while having some fun to boot.  The PBR brakes (huge drilled & vented rotors w/ dual pistons calipers up front) are gorgeous, responsive, and fade-free.

After only 3 months I sold it and bought the 2005 Grand Prix GXP. Soooo many more features and it handles incredibly great for a sedan. And regardless of what the magazines say. The Grand prix beat the Mustang at the Drag strip in (STOCK) form by a tenth of a second. Not bad for a sedan. The suspension and brake system is great and the tires are the same as the factory Mercedes AMG 500. For some reason this car was never advertised and the magazines won't print much about it.

I was looking at this or a BMW 545, and this took the cake (yes, really). Interior feels wonderful, exterior is beautiful.  Power is everywhere.  Despite what journalists are saying, torque steer has not occured yet, but for one time when it was floored at 10 MPH on uneven pavement.  All I had to do was hang on tighter.  Rear drive cars will break traction and get all twisted up (slip/regrip/lurch)if you floor it on uneven pavement, so what's the big deal?  I guess some self proclaimed 'enthusiasts' like to kick out the rear end around corners, but if you ask me, I'd rather stay pointed where I want to go. Back seats are great too.",5

It pulls a little when doing heavy braking but torque steer on acceleration is minimal.  Roomy and comfortable on the inside but I don't understand why Pontiac can't give this car memory settings for the seats - my husband is 6' 4"" and I'm 5' 5"" - tough to exchange drivers.

Still, be aware of it and it's not a problem. Very solid ride with little or no body lean into corners.  City mileage hasn't worked out as advertised yet, though I only have 600 miles on it, so far.  Hopefully it'll get better than the current 14 mpg after a couple of thousand miles.  Highway miles are decent (26mpg) and should also improve, soon.

Dual climate climate control is nice.  Radio automatically adjust for sound as you speed up or slow down.  The V-8 will cut off 4 cylinders once you get to cruising speed to save gas mileage.

From a teen's point of view, it is pretty much all you can ask for as the engine doles out plenty of torque and noise on the high end of the rev range, yet is perfectly capable of being composed highway cruiser. We have taken numerous camping trips and the cavernous trunk would swallow up any gear we threw in. However, as I grew, the back seats really became unbearable as they sit so low to the ground your knees are practically digging into your chest and you worry your bum will scrape the pavement.

I've enjoyed the fuel economy as it has an 18 gallon fuel tank that allows me to drive for 500 miles when on road trips with work before needing to fill up. Gas guage broke a year after I got it, so I just fill up every 350- 400 miles to be safe. I got 224,000 miles out of an '89 Grand Am, so these cars can go for a while if you take care of them.

None.  Gas mileage hovers around 22MPG mixed city/highway.  My 3.8-litre engine purrs and still has getup when I need it, even with AC cranked.  Transmission still works smoothly thru the gears.  The tan cloth upholstery fabric hasn't held up all that well, and the interior ceiling fabric is pulling away along the top of the rear window.  Bottom line:  I've been car payment free for over two years and still have a reliable and reasonably good-looking ride.  Until any serious difficulties arise, I'll just keep banking those potential payments.  ",3.875

The car has stalled on me numerous times while driving, coasting, or waiting at a stop light.  Other times, it simply won't start.  I cannot count how many times the grand prix left me stranded.  If you purchase this car, be sure to have a cell phone handy to call friends/family for a ride.  Mechanics say that it is fine, but problem persists.  Electrical problems abound.   I will definitely do my homework before my next car purchase.  When I do, quality and reliability will be at the top of my list.  This car seriously lacks both.

I absolutley love this car, it's fast, handles very well, and looks incredibly mean. freeway driving is a blast, and it only takes a moment for the speedo to jump from 70 to 100, which makes passing a breeze.

I can usually meet or exceed the highway EPA estimates in all my vehicles, but not this one.  The 3.8 V-6 normally aspirated gets 30 - 34 on the highway, but lacks the power.  Interior is a little tight and design is dated.  I was sorry to see the Bonneville retired, but this is a close substitute.  Runs fine on regular gas.

When I was offered a trade for this '07 Grand Prix (this is NOT the GXP V8, it's the base model V6). I took her for a spin. When I popped the hood and saw she had the 3.8-litre engine I fell in love on the spot! I've had 3 Lesabres and that engine is my favorite! I've now had the car just over a year, I am the second owner, and apparently, the first owner took good care of her because she has been wonderful. I had to replace the brake pads and one headlight in a year.  My only problem with the car is that I'm fat and over 50, so getting out of a low sitting bucket seat is work. But I can't blame the car for that. Another review mentioned the water flushing sound. My car gets that too. Weird. Harmless but weird. I will soon be selling this because I've found a cherry LeSabre, and the bench seat is more my style. It's been a great car and I will be selling it to someone very lucky indeed.Edmunds asked me to update my review. I sold the car in May and bought that LeSabre. The new owner called me the other day to tell me how much he loves the Pontiac. I never expected follow-up, but a good experience is worth celebrating. As for the LeSabre, I am in hog heaven!

This review is for the Base Model 3.8L V6.I had an old terrible Mzda B2500 a while back that I sold to buy this car. So far my experience with it has been mostly positive. I'm 6'2 and the car has been able to accommodate my size well. The front and read seat are comfy and have sufficient room in comparison to other cars I've driving. My seats are felt and the arm rests / doors are leather. So far the interior has held up really well. Thing is as fast as you could want it to be without a turbo in it. Took it to the track and got it up to around 130 mph easy. Thing didn't even break a sweat. Now don't get me wrong, it's not the fastest car in the world but in comparison to all the shotty 4 cyld cars out there this thing can really boogie. Pros:It's comfy, fast as hell, good looking, plenty of trunk space, and has a great sound system on board.  Cons:21 mpg in town 25 on the hwyThere is an oxygen sensor right in the way of the middle back spark plug. The only way to remove said spark plug is to remove the catalytic converter and then remove the oxygen sensor that's mounter on the exhaust manifold directly inline with the plug. Transmission oil pan gasket is junk.Terrible visibility on the inside, windows in the back are just to darn small.No room in the engine bay to work with at all. I gave myself a second degree burn on the exhaust manifold trying to change the serpentine belt. I would almost consider pulling the whole engine to change the head gaskets, there's just to much engine for that tiny engine bay. The serpentine belt pops off if you hit a 1 inch deep puddle at 20 mph.The stock iridium spark plugs are darned expensive turning a $100 tune up into a $180 tune up : /Rotors will warp if you look at them wrong.Other than all that the car is great.

I am not lead footed but do lean on it a bit from time to time. I find the build quality to be a bit lacking for the interior but a dash dress up kit really helps.

Who knows what would have eveolved if Pontiac had stayed in business.  It seems to be economical and service at other GM dealers shouldn't be a problem.  Love the Bluetooth, on-star and CD player.

1829, on 11/03/16 17:43 PM (PDT),Mike W. ,2006 Pontiac Solstice Convertible 2dr Convertible (2.4L 4cyl 5M),"Fun, looks great, and very quirky"," The Solstice is the latest two-seater convertible I've owned; previous cars include the Honda del Sol (my all-time favorite car), the Toyota MR2 Spyder, the Audi TT, Mercedes SLK 230, Mazda MX-5 Miata, and the BMW Z3. Here's what I see as the good and bad after owning my vehicle for about a month: First, it looks great. I have gotten several compliments on it already. I love the lines and the way the convertible top completely disappears into the trunk. The car is a blast to drive, and it hugs the road. There's no windscreen, but the heat blasts strong, keeping me toasty on a chilly day. The gas mileage overall has been just OK, but I did get about 33 MPG on a recent road trip. Now, for the not-so-good...this is the quirkiest car I've ever had. I didn't notice until after I had bought the car that there are no power windows or locks. I thought that just about every car had power windows and locks; you have to roll the windows up and down with the old-fashioned hand crank. The cup holders are behind the driver in the center, making them pretty useless, especially when one has to use his right hand to shift the gears. The hood release takes a scavenger hunt to find. It's kind of a pain in the butt to put the top up or down, but I don't mind that too badly; I'm spoiled because I had been driving convertibles with power tops; and with the Spyder and Miata it was simple to put the top up or down from inside the car. The build quality doesn't seem good; the leather on the seats seems like it will rip eventually, and there's plastic, plastic, plastic everywhere. With all that, I still love the car. I didn't buy it because I mistakenly thought it was a Z4; I bought it because it had low mileage, looked great, and the overall reviews from owners are very good. The bottom line is that if you can tolerate the quirks, this car is just plain FUN. I plan to keep this beauty for a long time; I bought a beater for run in the winter time.",4

Most of those have left the realm of affordability. So after test driving 5 times, I took a chance on this car. No regrets at all. I love how it drives, I love how zoomy it is. There are so few out there that you don't see many on the road and people think it is WAY more expensive a sports car than it actually is. Heads turn wherever I go and people approach me at the gas station to talk about it. Since it is my 'fun car', I do not worry much about the storage capacity (there is almost none). If you are looking for something to cruise in, run about on a beautiful day or drive to work (and then daydream about leaving for the day) than this is your car.  ON THE OTHER HAND - I wish GM had put a little nicer fit and finish in the interior. The hard plastics are a bummer and the leather isn't great. The top is a little wonky to get up and down, but when stowed the car looks fantastic. I have had the car for over a year now and have only had to change the oil.",5

Nearly 85K miles later, the water pump seal was finally passing enough coolant to warrant replacing the pump. For the most part I've serviced the car myself, and ran into a problem with hard-shifting, especially when down-shifting. Finding no satisfactory advice online, I also found no resolution troubleshooting the transmission -- even replacing the transmission control modules did no good. Turns out the intake and exhaust valve solenoid actuators were the culprits. Seems when these parts fatigue or get dirty, the actuators fail to perform properly, so sensors signal the transmission control module to initiate transmission protection mode. I believe this protection mode actually is detrimental to the maintainability and safety of the car!  After replacing the two actuators, the car has performed flawlessly.",4

Top is easy to raise and lower, and tight as a drum. I wanted a fun, sporty, stickshift, good handling, quick sports car like the old MG's and Austin Healy and that is what I feel I have. I kid Vette owners it is a halfavette - cylinders, size, and price! But a lot of fun.",5

First off, after 18 months of ownership, it's style and looks still turn heads just about anywhere you go. So don't expect to get lost in traffic. Secondly, it's ease of handling and control, especially on winding roads, makes you want to drive instead of it being a chore. Knowing the only available engine (4 cyl.)I knew it's limitations.All in all, for the price I could not have done better. Sadly, with 3 kids (17-22yrs.), and my wife who feels much younger when she drives it, I must wait my turn. I need 3 more!",4.875

When this vehicle was on the drawing boards I kept articles on it. When delivered it fully met my expectations. I purchased mine with a convertible acoustic roof (thick). It drives very quite, has a great stereo system, and handles very well. On turns it hugs the road. I have not had any mechnical issues at all with my car. If you need to make an emergency stop, this car stops very quick with no loss of control. This car handles very well and looks like a corvette from the rear, yet has a european sports look from the front. Depending on the color you pick it can look sporty or luxurious.

Fun car on open roads, performance is good, would like a little more zip.  Comfortable for a 2 hour drive, nothing more.  Interior styling is average with cheap looking dash and door materials.  Overall the concern to buyers is (practical).  You cannot even haul a load of groceries.  The car is always fun to drive and I anticipate this to be a body style that time does not dull.

I like the way the top folds down and the cleanness of the design with the top down. I wish there was room for more misc. storage, but this is a small thing.

The front has the little whisper of the first Corvettes made with the round curves and grille area.

It's so much fun to drive and it works well.  As we had to wait two months longer than expected for delivery, we were becoming impatient and were seriously thinking of the much more expensive BMW Z4.  We're sure glad that we waited for the Solstice.  The power is enough to be fun but a little more grunt (e.g., a V6) would draw even more excitement for this vehicle.

So far, I really like the GXP's performance. The exterior is hot! My only beef with the exterior is the black grill -- it looks cheap!  Why not keep the same chrome grill as the Solstice?  The interior is sleek -- the seats hug you.  However, there is no storage space.  I can't even find any place to keep my garage door opener.  I've noticed that the window controls are in an awkward place -- inevitably, my elbow triggers the windows. The biggest pain is the manual top -- miss the Z4's automatic top.

Very happy with it - we didn't need top end performance , but it is sporty, turns heads  and a fun weekend play 'toy'.

I paid just over 16.5k for a brand new '08 with the wheel package, Monsoon radio (a must), and a few other goodies.  The car stickered at $26,062.  An unbelievable deal and I'm pleasantly surprised with the ride, handling and even the performance of the 2.4 ltr. The fit and finish is great and the materials aren't as cheap as I had expected from a GM product. This may just be the best car deal I've ever made.",4.875

Yes, the guy who placed the switches should be shot, but, in spite of al the complaints from magazine types, we can, with thought, place enough luggage for 2 for a 1 week trip. Just no big bags. There are plenty of storage slots if you look at it, even with the top down.  Mileage is way better than EPA says.  We get 25 mpg in town on both cars. The top can be a pain, but once you get a system, it's pretty easy.  It is a fun car, and handling is great. Took mine to Phx In'tl Raceway's roadcourse and had a blast. yes, the interior design team must have had a party the night before, but the fun factor outweighs the negatives.",4.125

I have never enjoyed driving anything as much as I enjoy taking the top down and cruising in this. It is beautiful, sporty, roomy enough for what I wanted, and most deservingly a head-turner. As for the car critics 'not enough room, interior needs better styling, needs more power and handling,' don't get me started. If it were up to the major critical magazines and publications we would all be driving BMW's and Mercedes anyway. For less than 22K out the door, with rebates and employee pricing, I am fully satisfied and laughing at the Z4's and Kompressors. I think I'm gonna buy my wife the coupe. The top needs no improvement. I timed myself with no help other than my buddy pushing start on the stop watch. 10 seconds to lower the top, 8 to put it back up. Tell me your automatic put-the-car-in-park tops can do that.",4.75

That was it, it was finally my time!! 4 days later I was driving home my Brazen colored Solstice. I love this car. This car is sexy as hell and IMO blows the Sky away in the looks department. It's a blast to drive and never fails to turn heads. My only regret is I purchased it with only a couple of months of driving days left before it gets put up for the winter.

Have always driven GM and had two bad cars when GM had the quality issues, but those are gone and the product is now excellant. The styling looks good - we have had comments of ""Cool car, Good wheels, Love your car"" from teens and adults.  You can ride with the top down at highway speed and carry on a conversation, and we do not have the opt. wind screen.

We live mid-way between the Carolina coast and Blue Ridge and soon learned that, despite small size, it is a competent and comfortable. The GXP is equally at home going up steep, curvy grades or cruising flat interstates.  It is short on luggage space but, carrying only essentials is a worth- while trade for the fun.  First gear is a bit short and abrupt for stop-go traffic.  Third is wonderfully long which makes city driving easy.  Fourth is good to 65 MPH.    The car communicates.

Flip off the traction control and make Corvette-like tire smoke. Enduraflex panels make parking lots non-scary. The Eco-Tech Turbo motor is impressive and pulls hard at virtually all RPMs. Very neutral handling posture especially at the limits, impressive brakes. In the final analysis, think of this car as a 7/8-scale Corvette. It's sexy, overt, a little louder and ready to eat GT Mustangs at the next stoplight. Despite the bravado, it is civil enough my wife can drive it and enjoy the car's appeal.

Sadly, I will store it for the long Michigan winter soon. I have owned quite a few sports cars and this one takes the cake. This is a roadster in the purist form of the word. I do not care if the top takes me 2 minutes to put up or down. I don't care that it has little storage or some of the swithes are a little hard to get to. I understand and appreciate the car for what it is. And quite frankly, I feel Pontiac and GM nailed it with the GXP. I have owned a BMW M-3 and I think the cars manual 5 speed transmissions feel the same. I wonder if the writers for car mags just don't like to admit GM did it better than anyone else.

If you buy a large boxed item, make sure you don't have a large passenger...it will go in their lap.

Handling is on par with cars costing $10k+ more (I've driven a Crossfire some). Even with cold tires & road on a 11 °F day this thing road like it was on rails-the suspension set-up is perfect,IMHO.

Comparing the GXP to either of these cars is a mistake. Do not be misled - this is a car built for fun and high performance. I took the 2006 on a long road trip and could not even put a duffel bag in the trunk; I had to put my clothes, sans suitcase, where I could, shoving them into nooks and crannies everywhere. 5 cubic feet of storage space ain't much, especially when divided into small segments here and there.  The 2006 reminded me a lot of my Miata, but I got a lot more compliments, questions and stares. The 2007, however, is a muscle car and a roadster. It is FAST!

The visibility from the cockpit is a little restricted, but I quickly learned how to anticipate visual angles for quick maneuvers, i.e., headchecks and headtilts for mirror views.

This car is a clasic in only it's second year.  Although it looks great, driving is even better.  The Solstice hugs the road and takes turns with zero roll or sway.  Acceleration with the 2.4 ltr is good.  Wind noise (top down) is minimal and conversation is easy.  Top goes up and down easy and with the head-liner (tough to get) it's very quiet and temperature stable.  Visibility with the top up is limited (bad blind spots).  We purchased the automatic and it's smooth and handles Northern New Mexico mountains well.  At this price, this car rocks.",4.875

Interior build quality is less than par, but for the performance factor, you get what you get. The exterior wasnt thought out 100%, the fact that its front wheel drive and comes stock with a rear spoiler, is counterproductive. As long as maintainance is under control, the vehicle will last as long as you last. Oil changes on any smaeller engine aluminum, or otherwise, with higher rev ranges, should be done every 2000-2500 miles as a rule.

The original brake shoes wore out after only 10K miles, yet the 2nd pair is still fine after 40K. On the roof the clear coat is bubbling and peeling, which started when the car was only 4 years old. The radio sometimes does not turn on when the car does. The whole body is tweaked, so sometimes the doors won't close. Several wheels and the back axle are bent. The suspension is way too soft so the weight distribution is impossible to manage, causing poor handling. Mine doesn't have anti-lock brakes..",2

Though the 2 middle air vents don't work. I didn't realize it until after I got the car. I'm sure its fixable though.

I guarantee the past 2003 are completely different.  I can only conclude that people who experience problems with 2003, 2004, and 2005 models are cars that have been in an accident and that have been not been properly repaired.

I wasn't happy with the newer styling, but it has grown on me.  I drive the car about 100 miles a day, and I have not had any problems with it, except for having to replace two of the tires already and the windshield(I'm not good with windshields, I had to replace the windshield four times in my old Sunfire).

The car has a pretty strong rust problem I don't notice on other Sunfires.  Our body ground from the battery cable rusted out and that caused some wacky problems with dashboard lights.  That was the only time it left me stranded and wouldn't start.   The back speakers are an issue on all 99 Sunfires.  Apparently the wiring breaks and then the rear speakers work when they make contact.  Instead of finding the break, I ran new wires.

Do buy the extended warranty, though, as things can go amiss. Muffler still new however I've had to replace the big muffler brackets a couple of times. Bit of a gas guzzler. This past year leaves me with a problem with the driver's side door lock - any cold or condensation makes it virtually impossible to unlock. Apparently this is an ongoing issue with the Sunfire.

I knew old car, slowly one by one the regular routine, had a civic beforehand and well no comparison both bad on parts and good on others. i wouldn't purchase a Pontiac again, the good thing is its a cheap vehicle to maintain never missed an oil change etc. over 300,000 km and hence the replacement of a lot of things, i myself am a mechanic so its easy, but for someone who wants a a-b car and doesn't want to replace something every other week, I'd look at another option. overall an okay car better for a first one. plus cheap on insurance.",2.875

Other than that just what you would expect as it got older and more miles. We ran it to 260,000+ miles before my oldest son flipped it over on the freeway. He managed to get it slowed down quite a bit before the tire burst and dug into the ground causing it to flip and he walked away with just a bump on the head because it held up. I have no doubt that I would have gotten to 300K before it gave out. I am definitely going to look for another Sunfire when we are ready to replace it.",4.75

Not to mention the window cranks fell off along with the stereo knobs. This car is the worst investment and I wouldn't even want my worst enemy to drive it!

I have also had very few mechanical problems yet with 104K miles.  A few things I do not like is that the 98 model has some messed up cruise control. The chain sticks and it's one of the few recalls that they have not figured out.  It gets stuck once you set it at a certain speed and then you cannot set it lower than that speed again. ",3.875

I was barely a month over 18 in 1998 when I decided I needed to replace my aging 1977 Mustang II. I chose the 98 Pontiac Sunfire because of its sleek look and features. 12 years later I am still driving my little blue car. The 2.4 twin cam engine has plenty of pep and has never let me down, whether driving in the Mojave Desert or in Downtown San Francisco traffic. The only persistent problems I have had revolve around the cooling system. I have needed to replace the radiator fan and thermostat more times than I can remember (thankfully only a few hundred to repair), the ABS system has failed irreparably, but she has gone over 12 years and over 183,000 miles",4.25

She got it used right after she got out of high school when it was 2 or 3 years old. I have had it all through high school. For the way a 16 year old drives a car it has held up great. I have done oil changes every 3000 to 4000 miles and had the brakes totally redone. It has been crashed 2 times both in the back. but even after all that and 170000 miles it is still going strong. It dose stall time to time. But not very often. One censer did go bad on it. that is the only major thing that happened to this car. paint it coming of but it is from the crash were it was repainted.,4
2232, on 04/04/09 20:53 PM (PDT),AfraidOfSunlite ,1998 Pontiac Sunfire Coupe GT 2dr Coupe,gotta be a GT," I have heard of many horror stories about the dime-a-dozen Sunfire with the eco-tech 2.2 litre. Having purchased the GT with the 2.4, I have had nothing but good things to say about the performance and reliability of the 4- banger.  In fact, at 218,000 and counting, I have outgrown the horrible interior, and cannot wait until the darn thing just blows up... but I am starting to think the thing will run forever!  It just won't die.  There are many drawbacks to an interior with ZERO versatility, and driver user-friendly usability, but I have to remember it was paid in full by 2002, and I have been driving it virtually for free for 7 years and counting!  All and all, worth every penny and more!",3.875

I had it for over 5 years and it took me all over. It always started first turn, had plenty of pep, ran on pennies, and all I ever had to do to it was change the front pads twice and the rotors once before I sold it. It had 260,000 k's on it and would of went for a lot more. The shocks needed replacing but that's a wearable part.

This car has been so reliable I am definitely thinking about buying a Pontiac again. Gas mileage has been around 25 mpg and for a small car it has a good zip to it. Handling is fine if your not pushing it in the snow, and I find the bucket seats comfortable for long distances. Although it could use lumbar supports.

No major problems until last year (A/C compressor failed at 105k) and then replaced the clutch and the water pump both just recently at 120k.  Have not received good service from Pontiac dealer though.  Only complaint with styling is the cupholders; the ONE in front sits too close to the gearshift and when shifting into 5th gear, I always hit whatever cup is sitting there - gets pretty annoying.  Does not handle well in heavy rain or wind, let alone icy conditions.  But overall I've been pretty happy with it for the price.",3.875

The ignition switch was a warranty recall yet every time it was ""fixed"" it broke down again! I've spent as much as I paid for this car on repairs, it is ridiculous.

When i saw it in the lot, I knew I wanted it for its 700 price tag and nice look. It's a look you either like or don't. Plus it's a convertible...those are for rich people these days.  I bought it with a piston misfire, but it was still running. Took it to a shop and got the entire head repaired, everything drained, and told them I would handle the little stuff. And boy was there a lot of little stuff.im not complaining thought, everything is relatively easy to fix and get to in the engine and around the car. It's become second nature and takes seconds disconnecting the battery and air intake to get to the guys. I've fixed the automatic window, changed hoses, belts. Used stopleak and JB weld to fix a big ol crack in the engine block a d it's still trucking and not leaking months later. I changed the starter, bypassed the relay and gave it a pushbutton start, so no problems getting that thing running ever.it was stuck in reverse and was and easy fix with a couple 10 dollar bushings. This car is fun to drive, it's been an adventure and learning experience driving and working on it......that being said, the electrical work leaves much to be desired, the convertible top wasn't taking good care of and I'm currently leakproofing it with liquid gasket, and it also disconnected from the car in the back, probably gonna have to use a whole tube.

Within 4 months I had to put a ton of money into it, the brake pads were bad, tires were bad, it needed ball joints amongst other issues. The reason I went with Car Hop is because they claim to be cheaper (not overall) and they allow you to get liability insurance instead of full coverage. Definitely not worth the price. I do like the look and feel of the car, and everything in terms of air, radio and controls work fine, but the internal problems are far too severe.

I went from 63,000 to 187,000 between 06/2009-06/2012, if that tells you how good this car is. I about cried when they told me I couldn't have it back. Only things I've ever had to replace (besides tires/brakes) was the water pump and snake belt, which together was only 250, and the alternator went out this year and was 300. That's less than 600 for all the wear and tear I figured I have put on it. If it hadn't been for the storm I could've most likely driven this car another 3-5 years. Gonna miss, that is for sure. ",4

My complaints about the car are very cheap upholstery(even for a cheap car), lousy cup holders (worthless for anything other than a 12 oz can) and for me the seats are uncomfortable on long trips (although they are fine for short trips) I do avoid taking this vehicle on long trips because of the seats.

You can go out and buy metal replacement gears for both motors for half the cost of buying a new motor from the dealership. So those of you who complain of light motors going out look at other cars out there with flip up lights... I am sure if you ask their owners they have had problems with theirs as well.

I'm only 16 and this is already my second car. I love driving to school in this baby and watching all the heads turn as I pull in the lot. Going to the mall is now more about getting there than being there. The car is so much fun to drive. Taking corners at 70 mph as if I was only going 30. The feeling of power as the body shakes when revved up. It's muscle all the way. The inside is a little cramped though and the system sucks big time. Don't recommend for a taller person.

The Formula has an extemely powerful LS1 engine which is the same engine in the Corvette. The engine is incredibly smooth and sounds great.  Also, I get 26 miles per gallon highway! I ran 13.48 at 105mph (stock) and I have the conservative 2.73 gears in the rear end. I am not one to insult the inports but those cars (300zx turbo, 3000gt vr4 and rx7 turbo) have nothing on this car when it comes to straight line acceleration plus it handles very well.

Being able to take corners at 30 mph without feeling like your going to roll the thing is a great ride. Only things I don't like are the traction problems in wet weather and its ride height.

Insurance isn't too bad since it's a V6, but heck, it still wastes a majority of comparable cars (let's see you try that again, Mr. Mustang 'GT'!).  Averages about 23-27 MPG, and it doesn't take Premium like TA's need.  This is a very solid car, mine is now seven years old and doesn't have a dent or crack or speck of rust or broken interior plastic.  Absolutely GORGEOUS car.

It was disgustingly underrated by GM so that it wouldn't take sales from the  vette, but in reality they have the same engine. 350hp would be more realistic.

Access and egress are a bit tight, as the car sits low. The rear seats are very close to the fronts and only small people or children will fit with comfort. Very adequate trunk space for a hatchback.The BatMobile rocks!I bought the car in Hawaii where I live part time and after a year there, had it shipped to my home in La Jolla, CA so it would be garaged instead of under a cover.The original beautiful green-to-blue color paint gets a lot of compliments.

It's got plenty of power, yet can be refined enough for city driving. Not to mention this is just a beautiful car. The leather in the car is top notch, my only complaints are with the traction control system. It does work, but it's not very effective performance-wise. It decelerates the engine for too long of a time and does not enhance performance, unlike the 350Z that I sell whose traction control system is beyond par. Otherwise, this car has more power than any other car you can buy for this amount of money. Period. And the great looks, dependability, 4.5 out of 5 star",4.75

Just don't expect to roll it out during a blizzard or something without the proper tires, it's performance in the snow is nothing to write home about. However, on a nice dry day this car will put a smile on your face without dropping a single cent on modifications. The interior is classic GM which is to say, plastic and somewhat cheap but it is very friendly to the driver and will give you a powerful feeling the moment you get behind the wheel. The aggressive styling of the exterior, particularly with the WS6 package(which included a hood and some other goodies), makes this car stand out from all others as a real eye catcher. Now if you find yourself bitten by the performance bug, the 5.7 liter LS1 V8 takes to bolt-on modifications like a fish takes to water, it is possible to modify this car without internally changing this engine to over 350 whp on a good tune(mods would include headers, underdrive pulley etc). The (1993-)2002 Trans AM WS6 is a treat to drive and great to own, a fantastic car that unfortunately was met with lukewarm reception due to the times and I would recommend it to anybody looking to not only join a community of enthusiasts but also drive what is quickly becoming the greatest performance dollar to horsepower ratio you will find on any platform from any auto-maker!",5

I have beaten multiple high end cars and performance cars off the line, down the strip etc such as Corvette Z06 or Camaro z28's. This car is superb. It is my daily driver. Im now at 141xxx and still running strong. Only problem i've had is a small oil leak but thats pretty normal on all cars. Stock the 3.8 push 200hp or so and these cars have tons of potential. Iv added multiple bolt ons (cold air etc)l and full exhaust mods and a performance chip and that alone pushes the RWHP to 380+hp. Phenominal car and handles great too",4.375

Not too good in the snow, but if you've driven RWD before, you'll know what to expect - Traction control helps.

The second row seats won't fold down because the head rests are so big they hit the front seats.  Also, they don't flip up like my Chevvy Venture's seats did to make more room temporarily for cargo.  They also have slippery rounded backs, so you can't carry anything on them when they are in the down position.  They are too heavy for me to carry alone, whereas I could carry 2 of the Ventures seats at the same time.  The third row seats are even heavier, requiring two people to move them.  Further on the headrests, they are so large as to render rear vision very limited.  You have to use the mirrors to back up.  The dealership has been great though.  ",2.625

The Montana back seats are sturdy and comfortable and we love the cargo area very functional with the tray  installed and the built-in air pump is handy. So far this gets my recommendation!,4

It's what the Kia Soul should have looked like, if the Soul were a hatchback as in a normal, not boxy car. The engine is great, starter is quiet for an economy car. It's the Toyota 1.8 from the Corolla and it's excellent in this car. Great match to the automatic 4 speed transmission. Easier to get into and out of than lower slung cars. XM radio and stability control are nice touches, although I've tried to provoke the VSC and it seems to kick in a little late. They put an actual 115 volt household outlet in the car too, although there is a cutoff point to how many watts the plugged in object can be. The outlet will shut down if the limit is exceeded. A good driving position for tall people still leaves your feet a little closer to the pedals than you'll really be comfortable with, but, minor issue. Handling is stable but not sport worthy.  The ride can best be described as firm but not punishing, well controlled. Climate controls are Toyota and very easy to figure out. Lots of cupholders and storage space. There's even (flimsy) cup holders in the back and storage space under the trunk floor (it's not much space though).

I feel almost eye level when beside a RAV4 or Escape. Vibe really feels as much like a small SUV as a hatchback. Main complaint is quite a few rattles with interior and steering especially when getting above 65 mph. Steering is stiffer than I'm used to and braking isn't as good as I expected coming from a mid sized vehicle. Fuel economy is ok but not great, I've gotten 25 to 31 on every fuel up. GT trim has the larger 2.4L Camry engine and if you have a lead foot you could only get low 20s, this car has some ponies.",4

Things I fixed because I broke it or it was a weird thing that was not the car makes fault: Evaporator(rock got in it and I lost defrost) 4 new wheels (flimsy steel core chrome plated rims bent when I curbed the car, couldn't unbend) everything else has been regular maintenance.

The 2.4 is more than enough power, but I still get over 30 MPG with 50/50 driving, so I'm very happy.  Manual is fun to drive and very comfortable.  Cargo space is great, as I can fit my bike in the back without taking any wheels off.  Sound system is great.  I switched from a huge suburban to this and I don't regret it.  Cash for clunkers program is a great deal.",4.875

The car is definitely worth its weight in gold, I traded in my 2003 Grand Am, and am very impressed that Pontiac has stuck with the great responsive, sport like steering.  The car overall has great body lines, interior is comfortable, and the fold down rear seats including the passenger are a great feature.  The overall pick-up response of the car is very impressive, especially in manual mode where you can get the few extra RPM's when wanting to get that ""race feel.""

It's so much fun to drive, and handles like a much more expensive vehicle. The ride is quiet and smooth, and the 2.4 engine provides more than enough power. The interior seems spacious and all the controls are in easy access. The interior uses alot of plastic, however it does not look or appear cheap. The seats are very comfortable in the front and rear, and the cargo space is incredible when the rear seats are folded down. The A/C blows nice and cold which is a plus, since I live in Florida.

However, my wife has already informed me that she will be getting a speeding ticket as this Vibe is much quicker and smoother than her old one.  We're extremely pleased, again.

For those of you who think the Vibe is comparable to the Dodge Caliber, you're thinking WRONG!  I drove the Caliber and the Vibe in the same day and there is NO comparison.

I was a little concerned that Pontiac parts might not be available in the long haul but GM insures me that Vibe owners will be supported for years to come.

I find myself checking the windows to see if I left one of them open.  There seems to be no sound deadening insulation in this vehicle at all.  This makes long trips very tedious - and also makes listening to music impossible.  Also, the AWD model should be available with a manual transmission - the automatic doesn't allow you to coast freely - it's always holding you back causing you to play with the accelerator to hold a constant speed.",3.25

The last Vibe got 30.1 miles per gallon for 29000 miles.  This 2009 is averaging over 30 miles per gallon too. Repairs have only required service oil,filter,tire rotation and alignment on the 2006 model. The 2009 has only 3000 miles and has had no repairs as of yet.  On the 2009 model I miss the carpeting on the deck in back the shade covering that area along with the intermittent window washer. Other wise the 33.2 miles per gallon on a recent trip is great.

I bought my 06 Vibe to replace my 03 Dodge Neon. I was shocked at how much better the gas milage is! It has everything I want in a car. It is bigger inside than it looks. I love the room in the back seat and the seats are very comfortable. Cargo room is better than expected. The only problem I had mechanically is the torque converter needed replacing last year but it was still under warranty. I drive it daily 45 minutes each way to work and back and am excited to take it on my first long trip in 2 weeks (680 miles one way) Too bad it has been discontinued. I will buy them until they cant be found anymore!,5

I drove that car for 3+ years and had the mileage up to 112000 when Bambi took me out of the race. I was sooo mad.. There was no thinking about it and I went right out and bought another one. I loved the first one and I'm still loving the second one. Other than normal maintenance I've never had either car in for any problems.!! Just oil and filters and replacing the tires. You can not go wrong with a Vibe !! Too bad that Pontiac is going out of busines as this particular type of Pontiac is a sure-fire winner.

Gas mileage is around 30 all the time. Haven't got much more than 33. I think its because of the cross bars and the fact that I don't have many miles on it.

The cars handling is quite good and acceleration is decent with the automatic. Not especially fast but ok for my needs.  I like the older (pre '09) Vibes for the side molding and fairings.

With the Vibe you get sensibleness - good gas mileage, surprising cargo capability, and a slightly higher (for a small car) seat height. Despite its sporty appearance, it's no sports car, and it could use a little more power for mad city traffic. But when you figure in the good mileage, it's generally worth the trade off.  ",4

Also, it's a long reach back to turn the overhead light on and off.  Great space in the back, like the way the window will open separately from the hatch.   No OnStar, which would have been nice.

The rear seat folds flat and is hard plastic so you can easily slide your stuff in and out. The cargo mat (or carpet) is a good option to keep stuff from sliding around, and it also quiets it down a bit. The performance is adequate, the Toyota engine revs freely if you ever need to pass. The only problem I've had is when the oil was changed, someone put the windshield washer tube out of its clip so it was kinked and no fluid came out. This was quickly fixed and adjusted correctly at the dealer. It gets excellent mileage and is fun to drive. I recommend it for someone not needing the space of a minivan. ",5

The Vibe seems to be comparible on interstate as far as power goes, gas mileage was 34 mpg on our first road trip and the passenger and driver compartment was more comfortable than the van. There was actually more leg & foot room. The only downfall is the cargo space but we hope to take advantage of the roof rack for that.

Traded in a '97 Grand Prix and although I miss the HP of the V6 this is not bad in town. On the highway it needs additional spunk.

The engine does get a little loud when the RPMs get up there, but it is never unwelcome. Interior-wise, the car is very comfortable and all the controls are well placed. Gauges are bright and easy to read and the car handles superbly. I would not hesitate to buy another one of these great little cars.",5

I've had it about one month now and love it.  Fun to drive, it handles well.  Passengers in front and especially the back find it much more comfortable than the 2-door SUV.  It's roughly a 1000 pounds lighter, and I sacrificed very little cargo space.  I'm tracking the gas mileage and will report that later.",5

My only other complaints are that the seats are not as comfortable as they could be (they could use a lumbar support), and the side mirrors are pretty small.

The Vibe is very reliable, gets good fuel economy (31 MPG highway with the 1.8L engine), and handles like a compact but has the passenger/cargo space of a station wagon.  I have found two issues with it--the flip side of the 1.8L engine's fuel economy is that it has sluggish acceleration.  There's also a common problem with the radio volume knob breaking...which I fixed by sawing it off and slipping a new one on.  That said, I love this car.

We also own a 4 years newer, $10,000 more expensive Subaru and the Vibe blows that car out of the water in nearly every area. Two things that I'd like to see better on the Vibe would be: better snow/ice handling. If you don't have the ABS option and live in a snowy/icy climate it's a little bit of a lightweight car. The second would be acceleration, as the Vibe seems a bit underpowered. When I put the gas to the floor for a quick highway onramp, for example, it's a veryyyy slowwww acceleration.But otherwise it's a fantastic car. The reliability is absurd, especially for what you might hear about Pontiac, I've never had to do any non-routine repairs. I attribute that to the joint-venture with Toyota (all of the guts of this car are Toyota with the superior trimmings/finishing touches of American manufacturers - really the best of both worlds).They redid this car for the 2009 model year and the newer Vibe I found displeasing. The sightlines of my 2008 are outstanding but they shrunk the rear window and some others are harder to see out of in the newer ones.

The back has ample space to fit all sorts of gear and the roof rack adds extra space. Front pass. seat flips down so when I bought 10 foot 2X4's they fit perfectly. Even if they had been longer I would not worry cause back window pops open! While traveling X country I recharged by AA batt. using the 2 prong outlet in dashboard.

The roof rack- less roof rack makes no sense. The cross bars used to be standard. Have to unscrew the antenna to use it anyway. The upgrade stereo is nice, so are the alloys. I like the head rest positioning, never had a car that I could actually rest my head on the head rest while driving. Plenty of rear seat room, and cargo carpet and bungee tie-downs are a must-have.

One of the sensors in the gas tank malfunctioned which prevented any gas from being pumped into the tank. Took 4 days for the dealer to get the part and fix it and then they lost the keys. Would definitely buy another one.",4.25

Reliable, good acceleration, good mileage.  Engine built by Toyota with Pontiac styling.  Awesome killer sound system.  Moonroof slides open, and can tilt vent too.  I have owned my VIBE for 11 yrs.  Wish they were still making new ones!  Comfy ride (I am a very large person, and seats fit and feel great!).  Nice feature...back of fold down seats is hard quality plastic which makes cargocompartment very durable.  D rings  in cargo for tying downs.  Great visibility with all the windows.  Sporty, spunky, practical and fun!  (make sure airbags have been ""fixed"" on recall, check your VIN to see if ""complete, there were 2 recalls on the same repair like most vehicles in U.S).  No worries though GM dealers will fix in a snap.  Still love my Vibe for all the reasons mentioned!  Oh, the driver and passenger's seats open fold all the way bac in case you need to take a nap on a long trip etc.  Cool sporty instrumentation too!  Good handling around corners, if you get good tires, great handling in snow, and rain.  Gas mileage is very good (ave. 29mpg city and highway together) Best in it's class!

3196, on 01/19/16 02:14 AM (PST),Kile ,2004 Pontiac Vibe Wagon Fwd 4dr Wagon (1.8L 4cyl 5M),"Vanessa, my vivacious Vibe"," I have had this car for 5 years now. Bought it used with 40,000 miles on it, and it now as 204,000 and still drives like it always has! I used it to commute to and from college (approx. 1-1.5hr highway) for 2 years, took it from PA to FL once, and PA to NC probably 30 times. I'm a big traveler, and this car is great in all situations. First let me start by saying the AWD is unbeatable. I've driven trucks and SUV's that handle worse in the snow than this little beast. I used to live up in a mountainous area, where we always got at least 6 more inches of snow than the surrounding areas, and it does just fine going up and down steep hills in the snow, and yes, even ice. I am an avid snowboarder, so not only does it have ample room in the back with the wagon-like set up and the seats folding down for all of me and my friends' gear, but any time a snowstorm is coming in we PREFER to take my vehicle out just because its capability and reliability in a snowstorm situation. I've driven this on Interstate 80 through a PA snowstorm up in the Poconos with 10inches of snow (at least) on the highway and never had any trouble or loss of traction (keep in mind, some good all-season tires are worth their weight in $ too!). As far as non-inclement weather trips go, I average about 33mpg on highway trips, with a record of 39mpg over 500miles. Not bad for this car! City is like they rate it for, right around 26-28mpg. On our trip to Florida for spring break one year, my friends and I used the handy little 115v two-prong outlet in the front to run an Xbox to keep us busy and entertained on our trip down! It has neat little features like that. I have also moved a series of 5 times, and filled that car up to the brim. The seats fold down in the back (and the passenger), and they actually fold FLAT, and have a hard back so it's almost like having a mini truck. This has been useful soooooo many times, and the interior holds up to this abuse. Nothing is damaged save for a few minor scratches on ""the bed liner"", and the seats are suuupper comfy even for a guy like me (im 6'2""). Being a childish college student, I have not always driven this car easy as well. One of my favorite things to do with it back in the day would be reverse donuts in a wet or snow-filled empty parking lot (not recommended). That kind of beating would wear on most cars, but I've never had any issues with the transmission or engine or anything for that matter. That being said, I love this car, and I have always been very meticulous with the maintenance. The manual recommends an oil change every 4-6,000 miles. I change it every 3. I rotate the tires and check the fluid levels. They say with Toyotas, as long as you keep up with the maintenance, the car will last you forever. I can attest to this! (being that it is the sister car of the toyota matrix). The toyota transmission has handled hill after hill and beating after beating with no trouble. Still shifts like the day I got it. smooooottthhh. I wish I owned the GT so I had a little more acceleration, but it still does great in high traffic, high speed, merging situations. My only complaint, and I have seen this in a toyota matrix, is the gear lights next to the shifter had gone out and that some idiot biker ran into my passenger door and left a little dent. If you're looking into this car and want something reliable, useful, and long-lasting, look no further. Do yourself a favor and pick one up for super cheap.",5

The only thing I've had done to the car is maintenance (oil, tune-up, tires, etc) and very minor repairs. By minor repairs, I've had to replace the driver door check arm twice (about $30 each time and easy to do myself), and the antenna recently broke, partly my fault by putting antenna balls on it. Other than that, this has seriously been a fantastic car. I bought it at 70k miles for $8000. I knew I wanted a vibe because it had everything Toyota for a GM price tag. It's taken me all over the country and has been the source of many happy memories. I couldn't be any happier with this car and would seriously consider getting another late model vibe or even a matrix when the time comes to replace it.

The car rides high for its light weight and you are at the driver level of the average SUV.  You must adjust your mirrors accurately to avoid the blind spots - don't look surprised Toyota/Pontiac - you know they are there. Very easy to park and turn. A truly great little car... but boring.

I enjoy driving the car and like the good 35-40 mpg I am getting on the freeway. However, I do find the driver seat to be a bit uncomfortable on longer drives. I have had two service calls, one for a leaky front wind sheild and another for some weatherstrips that came loose on the passenger side window. No problems with anything mechanical.  I would recommend this car for anyone seeking good mpg and a reliable car. Open the hood and you will see that pretty much everything has Toyota Motor corp on it.

Took it on 770 mile trip within 1st week and was surprised at the mileage at the speeds I was driving (75-85mph).  Averaged 32.5 at 80-85 34.5 at 70-75.  Handled great and enjoyed the height adjustment feature on the drivers seat.  I purposely ordered the 5spd because of my good luck with my '92 Camry with the same setup and almost the same gas milage but over 200,000 miles  on the car.  Still drive the Camry to work everyday but the milage concerns me on a trip, therefore the vibe purchase.  Love the way you can use the interior for even long items.

This is our primary family vehicle for a family of four and a labrador retriever.  The Vibe is a comfortable car to drive and be a passenger in. I am surprised by the amount of backseat room in this car. This car is getting about 35 mpg on the highway, if not more, and it only costs about $40 a week in gas, driving 24000 km a year. Easy to get around the city in and a breeze to park. I would buy another one for sure, can't wait for the 2009 model.",4.75

I cancelled my subscription. The location of the air and heater controls is a nightmae with an automatic. I have large hands. :-(  Also get a scratch on the cheap plastic interior, it will never come out. I have never owed such a cheaply made car.

I average 27 MPG mostly highway miles, but would probably get better mileage if I did not keep the speedo at 80 miles per hour. I love the ride after driving a jittery midsize pickup truck for 6 years. I have owned cars from just about every company out there, and I can honestly say I have never been more pleased after 5000 miles of driving. This car meets all of my driving needs and then some. The fit and finish on this 48,000 mile car are still as new. I love it.",5

I get 34 MPG overall including thruway miles at 72 mph and mountain roads. I'm a big guy, 5'11'' and 280 pounds, there is plenty of headroom and overall the drivers seat is comfortable. I do start to get uncomfortable after 7 hours in the car or trips over 150 miles without getting out. I put the back seats down and carry a full load of product in plastic containers. My product is very light so I don't know how it would be for heavy loads. This model is FWD, not AWD.  AWD was not available in the 2007 Vibe, you would have to buy the Toyota version.  Mileage is very important to me and overall, I am very happy with this car.",4.75

We have had 3 sets of tires due to cupping. Pontiac did cover the cost but faught us on finding the cause. The result was the rear alighnment was out by 1.5 degrees. Tires cupped in 3,000 miles. Fit and finish wehn delivered was bad also. Then the icing on the cake... We had a passenger side floor that was flooded. And what did Pontiac say? It was normal to have some water enter the passenger compartment when going through a car wash with high p.s.i. water or heavy rain! I could not believe they said it was a normal occurance. They offered no fix, we are getting rid of this car and going back to Toyota!",3.375

I researched and test drove many vehicles. This car met the needs of our family. My wife and I are recently retired and went down to only one car. The Vibe gives us a roomy interior for carring home groceries and for hauling materials for my home inprovement projects. The gas mileage is pretty much on target. I do lose about 2.5 MPG when I use the air and also when the air temp. drops below freezing. The head room is amazing, I am 6'-3"" and even with a sun roof there is more than I need. Leg and hip room are also quite adequate.The Vibe seem to handle very well and the engine is responsive. The style is also great.   ",5

I can get  28 miles per gallon driving on the highway/around town, which is good for a crossover car. I am more impressed by the space inside. The other day I went surfing, and I fit my 9'6"" surfboard all the way in the Vibe with the back hatch shut. It is also very stylish. One negative comment would be road noise while driving on the freeway. It can get quite loud compared to my old Infiniti I used to drive. Other than that, this car packs a big punch for the price tag and I feel Pontiac will keep making the vibe for many more years to come.",4.875

Just had a baby so needed something 4 door with room and great gas mileage. Did not want a minivan. Only have 2k miles on it, so far no problems other than a slight rattle on the dash from plastic piece vibrating loose? Hence the 7 on build quality. Hesitant to buy Pontiac, my dad was a Grand Am fanatic and they always had problems, don't know why he kept buying them. Found out it was basically a Toyota Matrix and I was sold.

This car is so fun. I feel like I'm in an SUV because I sit up so high. The interior has more room than my 4 door sedan but the body is about 4ft smaller. Acceleration is steady, braking not too hard. I've drive 160 miles and used a bit more than a qtr. tank. I do not have the engine noise that I've read about in some reviews. Maybe I'm just not that spoilt. I drove a lot of cars and read a lot of reviews...this is the car I bought.

That was the first criteria on buying the car. The dogs love it, the way it is designed they can easily hang their heads out of the window. The second was fuel economy which is good. The last reason was a car which I would find satisfying and on this score it has exceeded my expectations. Our family has a Civic, a Honda CRV and a Mustang Convertible (its a large family). This car is everyones favorite, because of its versatility. The Mustang makes a good second car, however it gets left behind for long hauls, shopping trips, taking friends out etc. The car does everything very well, without trying to the best in any one feature.",5

I was initially concerned about the automatic transmission of the G8 taking the fun out of driving, but I was very wrong. Even with an auto trans, the G8 accelerates very well, handles like a dream (minimal oversteer), and shifts smoothly in normal and sport driving modes. I detail cars, so I keep mine pristine all the time; and I've received more compliments for this car than my previous 4 cars combined. Pontiac did a great job with the exterior styling modification of the Holden Commodore platform. I've put 25,000 miles on the G8 in 2 years and haven't run into any major issues, just basic maintenance and cleaning. Although I love the way it drives and the exterior styling, the interior is less than impressive. Cheap plastic, a crappy Blaupunkt audio system, and low-budget red graphics leave a lot to be desired. Aside from the interior, it's been a fantastic vehicle, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a full-size sporty sedan on a budget.",5

The performance and handling is awesome. I could've got a V8 G8, but the V6 is enough for me. To this day it's quite the head turner and I love the fact folks have trouble believing it's a Pontiac. I get 32 mph to the gallon on the highway, 18 in the city. Compared to other owners I'm doing just great on gas mileage. I have all the options with the exception of the leather interior and V8 engine. I talked my son into buying a GXP version to keep him out of mine....LOL.  Plenty of power, but I'm very happy with the V6. No major issues. I've only had to replace a couple of sensors and that's to be expected over period of time with any car. If Pontiac hadn't gotten the axe. I know this car would have evolved into a force to be reckoned with. My G8 will never be sold or traded in. It will be with me until the wheels fall off.",5

Performance wise it's still one of the best. it's a nice suttle ride with a quiet comfortable cabin. People just look and stare they don't even know what kind of car it is and that's the best part about it. I preferred this over the Chargers, challengers, mustangs and camaros.The cars you see every 5 mins on the road.

Yes the BMW has a nicer interior but it's also twice the price. I've had the car 3 years and love to drive it. If you can get your hands on one, get it while you can.

All four wheels and the steering wheel were out of alignment. After that, it developed a vacuum leak in the fuel system, an engine mount came loose, the brake lights stopped working, and the front fascia came loose. Then, it needed a new steering rack, and all new control arms in the front. The car vibrates like a guitar string at all speeds. It squeaks, rattles, and buzzes in various places, and the steering has a lot of slack, despite all the new parts up front. The V8 engine runs OK, but the transmission is very slow to shift and never seems to find the right gear. A lot of wind and road noise, but little engine sound. 32046 current miles.",1.75

Not enamored by the interior, radio has some odd controls, no power seat back adjustment or garage door controls either. Minor complaints. Car accelerates great but agree that the tranny could be smoother. Driving on the turnpike, it's not surprising to look down to see I'm going 90 and not realizing it.

We needed four doors and we didn't want to break the bank.  I stumbled upon this Pontiac, and what luck!  The only con I see to this G8 is the cup holders in the front.  They sit too far back.  There are no cup holders in rear of the cabin which is inconvenient.  And a lack of a navigation system is disappointing.  However, that all melts away when you smash down the accelerator.

Some computer chip issues which were resolved by the dealer. I got big 19 inch snow tires for this baby since it is not really driveable in snowy weather. That reduced the mileage factor slightly. I used to have a problem accessing the highway ramp in my old Buick Park Avenues. With this car you have zero problem..regular or snow tires the car's acceleration is nothing less than fantastic.

For those who complain about the overall fuel economy, remember that no one twisted your arm to buy a performance car. Can't have the ponies without having to feed them too.

This is a roomy, fast car that can quickly and comfortably eat up hundreds of miles at a stretch.  The seats are extremely comfortable and the ergonomics just fine.

It is an incredible value and I have no regrets on the purchase.  The car is refined yet powerful in a way that no other sedan in the 20's (real world price) can touch.  The torque is always available and free flowing and lets the car cruise at highway speeds effortlessly.  Mileage is acceptable on the freeway, quite bad (10 or so mpg) in stop and go.  The interior doesn't match the exterior style-wise and there are a few cheap plastic bits but I can live with it and the styling is nowhere near as tacky as some past Pontiacs.

Model was a burnt orange 3.6 with a fair amount of features for the year and I have to say I was pretty impressed. RWD is definitely the way to go if you're a driving enthusiast you just have to be careful when things get slippery. The car rides very well and is extremely planted on the road. You can feel EVERYTHING you drive over due to the suspension setup and wide sporty tires they use on this but this was made with that in mind so be warned.  Road noise is slightly excessive but bearable as you can hear the engine (which does sound pretty decent) and on the highway wind noise is also tolerable.  Fit and finish of the car are really well and alot of surfaces are soft touch which I do commend the automaker for but they do make the vehicle extremely heavy so the engine does have to work pretty hard from a stop to get moving quickly but again thats something you can easily fix with the GT model of this car. Steering is slightly numb but better than the typical GM fashion that normally goes into vehicles. For a ""sporty"" sedan though it does lack slightly. Overall the car is a great value and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a sportier ride yet needing to keep in mind space in the back and some sensibility.",4

Did I mention that I only have 30K miles on the car. I miss my 2004 Grand Prix GTP, hands down a better car. As soon as the suspension is fixed I am getting rid of this car. ",3.25

While the V was definitely much faster, the G8GT is very aggressive and a very comfortable sedan. Overall, only a slight concession at half the price. I frequently travel I75 in Florida, this car cruises VERY nice at speeds of 80-85 mph. I have driven this car in excess of 120 mph a few times and it stills tracks nicely without vibration or float. Cars are my weakness and have had many - this 2008 G8GT is probably my overall favorite. I have removed all the badges on the car and people often ask what kind of car it is. ""that looks great"" and ""I never heard of that"" are usually the comments made. Lots of bang for the buck!!!!",5

Well, it was and it made my G8 even more fun.  The exhaust made the car sound great, with out making everyday driving to noisy like other systems I have had.

It's mostly my weekend and pleasure ride and I can tell you, it's more fun (and practical with kids now) than my last sport's car, an '89 Corvette! It's too bad that Pontiac and the G8 will soon be history.  GM finally got it right with this car and sadly, they are getting rid of it.  My only hope is Fritz will listen to Lutz and will rebadge it as a Chevy or Buick and promote it, like Ford is doing with it's Taurus SHO. No one, except enthusiasts, really knew about this car.  Buy this car soon before it is gone! It's spirited performance and awesome handling will have you hooked!  Lastly, everywhere I go, I get lots of positive looks and feedback.",5

It is bigger, much cheaper, and nearly as much fun. It was just what I was looking for.  Owning it has been a delight. I have never had any problems with the car, and the car does everything I expect from a sports sedan, and does them all well.

The horsepower and torque are perfect. I like to drive spirited and the car handles perfectly. The factory tires don't hold in wet road conditions but that will be rectified with new ones. I get 18mpg city and 24.5 hyw. I've had no rattles, or any maintenance issues other than the usual oil changes and such. I had the factory stripes put on mine and let me tell you the flat black on red will turn many heads. The gas mileage definately went down when I put them on (just kiding).

The only weak areas of this car are the brakes, lack of navigation, no memory for the driver (my 98 vette has it, why can't a 09?), the manual knob for the seat back, and the lack of bluetooth in lieu of Onstar (boo).

I would like the V8 to sound a bit more like a V8, but the wife doesn't know what it is all about this way. Overall this car has been the most pleasing to drive out of all my vehicles.

Last month we had the worst snow storm in Oregon in years. The remote start and the heated seats made it a lot better to get out in it.  With $1100 invested in studless snow tires I got every where I needed to go, the limited slip and traction control made driving in the snow no big problem.

I learned one thing this weekend, the G8 is not all about going fast. Going home from work yesterday on freeway was doing 50 came around a blind corner and traffic was stopped.  With the braking performance of my 96 Monte Carlo (I traded in on the G8) in my mind I was hoping that would be just a light crash. Three things happened. I hit the brakes, I saw someting fly on the pasengers side and I was stopped 5 car lengths behind the car ahead of me.

Even after 9500 miles I still look for excuses to drive it, sometimes making 3-4 trips to the grocery store (my wife thinks I'm reformed)!  I have installed several bolt on high performance upgrades (cold air kit, tune for premium gas, shorty headers with high flow cats keeping the rest of the exhaust system completely stock).

No matter how bad my day at work has been there is this little back road on the way home that I can detour on to and just let the G8 hang out in the corners and all the stress of the day is gone. My 96 Monte Carlo never gave that to me. It just wouldn't handle the 30 mph corners at 60 like the G8. The G8 has to be the best handling american car under $30K not just the most powerful. Oh by the way yesterday I showed a Taurus SHO owner you don't go heads up from a stop light with a G8. If God drives he/she would drive a G8.,5

Thank God for Costco who has the best price on Mobil 1, and Auto Zone for their price on Oil and filter.  I have figured that $62 every 5K is very acceptable for what this super sedan gives back in return in performance and just fun to drive.

The car is amazing to drive from the plentiful power to the superb handling, it makes you want to take the long way every where you go.  The G8 is very comfortable and roomy in size and will easily accommodate taller individuals. Fuel economy is excellent considering this is a 4000 lb vehicle with a 361 hp V8 capable of comfortably hauling 5 full size passengers.

There are minor flaws I have found if you can call them flaws.  The most exciting one is that when you step on the gas in anyway less than very gentle it responds like a startled cat, it flat jumps and screams for red line.  I have also noticed that once I shift into sports mode or manual mode and stand on the throttle, the car changes from a docile car to a beast, and seems to stay that way till I shut it off and drive it again.

I live in NYC and the gas mileage is low in the city (10-12 mpg) and when the highways are packed I see the same results. But when the highways are clear I see 20+mpg easy.

It has only gotten better with time.  With gas prices down a little from when I bought it have switched to premium.  The premium is not required but it do bring the G8 GT to life. Merging onto a freeway can be a little unnerving, if you step down on the throttle to aggressively, you go from 6th to 3rd gear and go from 45 to 70 in a heart beat.  For a door factory (4 door car) the handling is awesome.  This car does not fear windy roads.  In manual mode in 3rd gear 20 mph corners become 50 mph corners.

The v-6 has plenty of moxie with just the right amount of cool in the styling. The fuel mileage could be closer to 30+ I would think, being it has a 5 speed auto. The rest of the car is still so new to us that we are still figuring out items. At first blush the one thing that sticks out to me is the tilt wheel. Seems it could have been more akin the tilts in pick ups and suv type vehicle. Not much range of motion, especially when one is in egress mode. Getting in and out is a bit challenging. I was also a bit leery about  buying a vehicle that had the (odd size) wheels. Here's hoping the tires wear well. Expensive.        ",4.25

The fenders around the wheel area are amazing. The aerodynamic feel to it is great. The upshift is smooth as possible. The gas mileage is much of a concern when you know what your getting into (G8). The interior is also awesome. No Navigation or XM radio but the thing is that you are going to have to pay for XM after your first year. And you can a navigation anywhere.

The answer after thinking about it and a month with the G8, I don't need steak every night, hot chili and hot dogs are just fine. The fun of driving a real car that has great performance, is more fun at age 61 than a Japanese car that gets 30+ mpg.  The fact that what ever situation I get in I can get out of.  Can a Honda Civic that is stock accelerate out of a situation?  Hell no. Or stop as fast as the G8.  There is more to a car than gas mileage.

It has 63K on it right now and  the transmission slips/jerks sometimes when it switches gears. I have had it looked at 4 times and the last time they told me it needed a computer update and that would fix the problem. Hate to break it to them, but that didn't fix anything. PPl I talked to says it may be the trans fluid, but theres not anywhere to check it, you HAVE to take it to the dealership to have that checked. They said that wasn't the problem either. When you turn the car to the left the steering makes a clicking sound too. My CD player is starting to mess up on me, I'm just tired of having issues with my car.

Took a closer look and found MOLD in the insulation. Upon closer inspection, found that there are holes where at the front of the rear windows at the top and bottom that lead behind the B pillar.

I dislike the poor visiibility out of the rear window and the difficulty getting into the back seat.  It needs a bit more head room back there.  There have been absolutely no mechanical problems.  The red color makes it hot to touch in the FLorida sun.  The car is hot inside when you get into it.  It needs heavily tinted windows.",4.875

We have put 10,000 miles on our GTP now and I think it is a nice car but I do have a couple gripes; fuel economy, and power.

When you opt for the premium upgrade package that includes the 17"" chrome wheels, 6 cd changer, and sunroof, this car is gorgeous!! The 3.5L V6 has more than enough power for city driving and highways and the comfort for driver and passenger is amazing VERY roomy. The most amazing thing about this car (especially in black) is the way it looks at night!!! With all laser red dash and gauge lights it doesnt get much sexier than this.

I've previously owned a '98 Honda Prelude,'95 300Z,'04 Elantra, as well as some trucks and other cars that my wife had.  Make no mistake this is no sports car!

Once reconnected, all is well. I love driving the car but wish it got better mileage. My old V6 (Dodge Avenger) would get 300+ miles per tank full. This one just gets 240-280, unless I take a long highway trip, then the mileage jumps. I like automatic but wish it were a 5 speed, or 4 spd w/overdrive.

What a great looking car! The G6's styling, quality, and performance are all way above par. Thank goodness GM did away with all of that plastic cladding they had on the GrandAm. If you buy a G6, go with the GTP. It's worth the extra investment since the GTP model with the 3.9 V6 is a mover! The only complaint that I have with the car (and it's a minor one at that)is that GM could have done a little better job with the finish on the interior surfaces. It's a shame that GM isn't marketing this model much more aggressively. ",4.625

Although the G6 uses a 4- speed transmission, gas mileage is pretty good.  The G6 ride is firm and responsive, but there is a moderate amount of road noise.  The interior is much improved over previous models, but still not perfect.  The chrome outlined dash layout and controls are very nice, but there is way too much hard plastic that gives a cheap feel.  Especially the steering wheel.  It is hard, uncomfortable and will slip in your hands.  The cup holders are put where drinks will restrict your driving. Overall, a well equipped and stylish vehicle for the money.

The only downside of this car is fuel economy, I have a hard time getting over 23.5 mpg (another reason to get a manual), although for vacation driving on the highway it will get around 25 mpg if you keep the cruise on.

I was wanting some power and was expecting the mpg to not be that great with a sporty ride. The problem is, as the car gets older the already poor mpg gets much much worse 16 in city (more like 10) and 24 highway (more like 18). The coolant system is a patchwork mess of connectors and hoses and none of the plastic connectors can be found anywhere but the dealer (for as long as they make parts). This system has leaked since I bought it and no mechanic was able to find a leak no matter how many I took it to.Drivers wheel hub assembly went out right at 60 thousand just like clockwork like so many others (with the other side to soon follow).  Paint peeled off outside windshield panel on drivers side. Should have took a longer look at the paint quality when I bought it cause it is more poor than even the cheapest cars. The leather is durable but didn't ever feel high quality to me. Felt more like vinyl to me.  Seat leather was starting to split but was repaired. Exhaust started to hiss when accelerating. Interior should have been looked at longer when purchased cause there are no good materials or even good plastics here. Just hard hard cheap plastic that needs to be kept in a garage cause the sun and age has made it look horrible after three and a half years even with using visors in front and back.   AC control group back light burned out and the cheap leds are soldered in and can not be changed out easy. Have to get a new control panel for the AC controls. Gear shift lights went off as well and can't see the gear you are in without turning on overhead lights. I overheated on the highway and I soon realized my slow leak was a busted heater core at 110,000. All this was despite always having the maintenance done regularly all fluids changed on time. The engine was still solid though  (not sure though if any damage was done to the heads cause of overheat). The fun factor is awesome with the top down though, except the door sill is rather high and you have to raise your seat all the wait up and you still feel like you are in a bathtub with wheels cause you are still low inside the car. The top has always rattled when driving over rough roads and the dealer said it was normal and that they all did that even when new. I found paperwork in the glovebox after purchase that said original owner had top repaired under warranty. I never had engine or transmission problems but after reading the horror stories and realizing that the magical 150,000 mile mark for the transmission to fall out (as 80 percent of owners will tell ya) was soon approaching, I decided to drop it like the dying horse it was. It needed  at least a couple thousand in parts to make it just reliable again on a car that was in its ninth year already.  Some parts were starting to be hard to find and I wasn't wanting to see what was gonna go next. I had been very lucky already not to have had the powertrain go yet.  It's currently sitting on a crummy used car lot at an absolute insane price 10 grand after tax, tag, and title. 10 grand for a dead brand that is made cheap  and usually never sees much over 150,000 miles.  Most pontiacs are in the junkyard and that's sadly where this brand should go.  GM really went cheap on a car that could have saved the company. I wanted to support America and buy American, but they are all junk next to even the cheapest foreign cars and my livelihood depends on a good car So I went asian as so many others have.",2

Since driving off the lot the roof has rattled,trim has come loose, paint quality is poor,and the muffler has developed leaks twice. However the engine and transmission have been trouble free.The 1st year of ownership resulted in at least six weeks in the dealer for the mentioned quality issues. Complaints through customer service resulted in a waste of time as no one really cared. Having owned many GM products in the past it comes as no suprise that the company's lack of quality and customer service resulted in the demise of the Pontiac brand. No one wants the cars and I have, as we all do the ability to buy elsewhere that is not GM.    ",3.25

The pontiac dealership never made claims against my warranty, so never fixed it. I've since gotten it fixed. But they were scared it was going to cause my brakes to go out. So now I've had to pay out of pocket for front and back brakes. I've purchased Extended Warranty. I now have a hole in my muffler that isn't covered on that.

I've bought Pontiacs in the past for improved style, comfort and roominess but had been shied away until this hardtop convertible came out. I like the idea of being able to either have a hardtop or convertible, like two cars in one. The hardtop doesn't leak water as in most convertibles tend to have and is much warmer inside in colder weather. The remote control start feature works great on days when it's cold outside and you don't want to sit in a cold car waiting for it to warm up. The heated seat feature warms up faster than on other cars. The GTP has more styling over the GT models.",4.5

It performs amazingly well for the price. It has great pick-up. I love the sporty look inside. It does look plasticy, vinyl inside the door instead of leather trim. But where they chose to cut corners in order to acheive the affordable price was right on.  It rides smoothly. The retractable top is so cool. The only thing I don't like about it is you have to hold the button in until it is complete, and the placement of the button is overhead by the map light. So you have to hold your hand up. It would be much more comfortable if the had it by the gear shift. And there is absolutely NO trunk space when the top is down, minimal when it is up",4.75

You can see where they cut corners to keep the cost affordable, but its not terrible. I miss the memory seat, home link, and leather trim on the doors. But you can live with it. Having the retractable button overhead is uncomfortable also cause you have to keep it depressed til it is complete.

My used car dealer called and said he had the car for me but I had to come look at it.  He told me it was prior salvage title with only 14,000 miles on it but he wanted me to see the damage before it went to the body shop. Light hit right front fender, no frame damage. We decided whoever the previous owner was must have worked for or been related to someone at the insurance company as there was no way this should have been prior salvage! The body shop I selected did an awesome job at matching the paint. Beautiful burgundy with subtle metallic. I now have 107,500 miles on this car.  I've owned it since April 2009 and I have never done anything to this car except put new tires on it (the original tires lasted until it had about 65,000 miles on them) and have the oil changed every 3000 miles. Never had any motor problems, (not even funny noises) or tranny or other issues. Loved the way the V-6 responded as I am a bit of a lead foot driver. Still, mileage was pretty decent, city/hwy averaged about 21 mpg and strictly hwy driving averaged about 25-26. Maybe less than estimated but better than the Grand Prix. When washed and waxed this car still looks gorgeous! The only drawback on the interior was the fabric seats. They showed stains from just plain bottled water, not happy about that. Otherwise it had plenty of room up front in the bucket seats, back seat was roomy and comfortable and the trunk also had plenty of space to haul stuff around, and I did! It has pretty much all the electronics and extra features you could want including the electric sunroof. (it was not the accordian type I had seen sitting on a lot when I first started looking.) Now that I have over 100,000 miles it has developed a few rattles but still rides great. Too bad GM isn't still making the G-6 as I would purchase another one in a minute!",5

It is fun to drive and the sound system is great. Getting in and out of the backseat is difficult, but this is not a car you buy for a family or for frequent trips with groups. Getting groceries is ok with the top up, but of course with the top down the groceries have to go in the back seat because the top is in the trunk. Surprisingly good trunk space with the top up though! Overall this is a great convertible and the hard top is a great thing for those of us with cats! The only negative is that the trunk is very heavy because of the roof lift mechanism, and the trunk eventually ""wears out"" in that it won't stay up when you lift it.

In general the car is a great car but what really got me was the safety. I always swore if I got in an accident in that car I would be dead or extremely injured, due to the bucket seats and the car sitting so low. Last month I was in a 4 car pile up on a highway 301. I was the middle vehicle (the smushed one) and had an F-150 slam full force into the back of me and ultimately on top of me. Because of the body of the car the trunk actually caught the F-150 and stopped it from going any further on top of my car (opposed to a Honda Civic or Toyota Camry which the truck would have driven right over and crushed the backseat). Although the car was totaled (obviously, I was SMUSHED BAD) it did everything it needed to. The engine shut itself down to prevent a fire from a gas leak or anything else, the underneath of the car took most the damage from the front, opposed to smashing everything into the dash. Not a single window broke. Right after the accident everyone involved got out, including myself, and just stared at the car in amazement that it held up the way it did. I never write reviews or go to the extent of doing this but it's the least I could do for the car. Hands down I would buy the car 100x times over. I miss it SOOOOOO much. I've been test driving all different cars and have been in 3 different rentals since and nothing compares to it. Everything about it was great (minus a few electrical issues like windows rolling up or down or random lights coming on and off but that's a GM thing and those issues usually fixed themselves over a course of 24 hours or so).

I think that the exterior makes the car look more expensive than it is. My big problems with this car is the lack of keyless entry and the fuel economy.  There is only one keyhole on the drivers door and it only unlocks that door-a big pain with full hands.  Also I only get about 21mpg which is a big let down to me.  I feel like I'm filling up all the time.  I'm glad it's a lease.  I miss my 06 Hyundai Elantra; it was cheaper had keyless entry and much better fuel economy.

At that price nothing really competes.  I was able to get the dealer to add cruise, and for those that really want remote locks that can be added as well.  Note the gas mileage will be less if the car has the 3.91 axle ratio, but will have more pep.  So if you are shooting for 30 MPG be aware of the ""optional"" axle ratio issue.  Easy to drive, but a little hard to get in and out of as doors are narrow top to bottom.  I do 90% highway cruising, and this is quite and very smooth for its size.

Have never looked at Pontiac till I saw this convertible and had to have it.  3.5 v6 powerful enough and very smooth.  White diamond tri-coat with taupe leather, what a stunning car.  I knew there would be no trunk and bought it anyway instead of a mustang convertible.  Intend to keep this car for at least 10 years.   ",4.875

The only drawback is the tiny trunk when the hardtop is stowed, but, for heaven's sake, it IS a hardtop convertible! The thing must go somewhere! Fit and finish seems excellent.  Several storage cubbyholes in the cockpit are very handy for stowage of manuals, remote controls and other ""glove box"" items. ONStar and XM radio are wonderful additions.

Mazda was too small, Chrysler was not good, the Eos is worth a look but to get one with all the great features the G6 has would require spending about 3K more. I loved the G6 during the test drive but some of the negative comments I read in professional reviews were discouraging. After buying the car, I know those comments are unnecessarily over-critical.  Comments on the lack of trunk space when the top is down are silly.  Its a hard-top. Where else does one expect the roof to go?  Many people have commented on the poor quality of interior material.  I dont get it. The interior is just fine. I highly recommend this car",4.875

All expectations have been met or exceeded, & it has been relatively free of ""surprises.""  Noticeable negative is interior plastics.  GM really ""stretched"" to make this a truly affordable, modern 4-seat convertible, & for the most part, it succeeded.  Top mechanism is unbelievably complicated, so an extended warranty is likely to be wise purchase.  Power of 3.5L engine is fine, but occasionally feels sluggish at highway passing speeds.  Surprisingly, fuel economy exceeds 17 city/26 hwy EPA estimates by 10 - 15%. Tranny is well-mated to engine. Wide turning radius, but otherwise handles well. And best of all, a rock-solid ride.",5
3851, on 06/13/08 00:19 AM (PDT),Greg & Mindy ,2008 Pontiac G6 Convertible GT 2dr Convertible (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Worth the wait., We purchased our G6 convertible in January 2008 and then patiently waited for warm weather to arrive. During that wait we found that the remote starter on our G6 works great from inside my office while the remote starter on my co-worker's BMW would not work from the same office. The car is a joy to drive with the top up or down. Many co- workers thought it was a sporty coupe until the top folded into the trunk. We are pleased with the gas mileage we have been getting. No long trips yet but around town mileage is averaging close to 20 MPG. The trunk is basically useless with the top folded down but we knew that when we purchased it. We are very happy with our Pontiac G6 convertible. Enjoy!,4.875

It was the first convertible I've ever owned. The G6 caught my eye it has 3 packages available, Premium, Sports and chrome (though a lot of the stuff seems to overlap).  After test driving it, I was hooked, its still the winter so I'm sure many dealers aren't selling convertibles right now, but having a hardtop you just feel like your driving a regular car, its not as noisy, or cold as a soft top.  I can't wait till the summer so I can enjoy this car to the max.  ",4.125

In the handling departement, it competes well with Japanese models. It doesn't compete with the German cars, but it's a lot less expensive, and sportier looking to boot. Anyone looking for a convertable would do well to consider the G-6. The seats are comforable and well designed. The lack of a power recline feature on the power seats can be overlooked. The height of the arm rests are perfect. So far, we havn't had any probles with this car.  This car looks and feels great. Some one else mentioned last year that college girls love this car.

It been a great car," I purchased my pontiac with in 2010, it was 5 years old and had a very good maintaince history and 95k miles.  It had just had its 100k tune up with new plugs wires fluids etc... It's been a great car I cannot complain at all. The car has fantastic power and the drive train Is very reliable so far. The interior is very nicely put together unlike some of its predecessors at at gm. After almost 200 k I have no tears in the seats, cracks in the dash, no paint coming off of switches or any of the sorts. The interior is one of the best interiors in my opinion. The dash is clean and straight forward, not busy like most newer cars which is not my style. Red led gauges illuminate cleanly unlike previous red interiors from gm. On the outside  the quality seems to be just as good l. Paint still looks great and shines like new after 12 years.  Suspension has been fair. It does handle very nice and is a comfortable car but it's had its problems which I will go into detail soon. Now for the problems. At 10k It developed a leak in the Hester core that was VERY expensive. 1200 to replace only to have the new one do the same (independent garage uaed au to zone parts o fear)..... the third Heater core has been good to me so far. At 160 k I had to replace the fuel pump as it had developed a crack in the line molded to the top of it. Pump still worked fine but required replacing the whole unit because of the tube. At 180 k I  had to replace tie rod ends and left lower control arm but I believe this had to do with terrible oklahoma roads,  not poor design. The steering column has a rattle when you hit a bump the I could never fix. Also the headlamps and connectors required rwplacing as thwy had corroded in the connector and shorted out. Last of all it has developed a small oil leak I noticed when changing the oil and I have yet to access and fix this problem. This has been the problems I have gotten so far. For a car I paid 8000 for I have probably put 2000 in repairs and have had almost 6 years I would call this a great buy. I love the car. I hope I get as lucky as the guy below me and make it to 338 k. I know for a car that is fantastic mileage",4

One complaint is the suspension, for the last 200k miles, it makes lots of rattles in the suspension. I'm sure it's an easy fix, but it still works good. We did replace power steering around 250k miles. Other than that, we have had amazing reliability with this car.

I'm very thankful I bought an extended warranty.

I'm getting 31MPG in mixed suburban driving and 34MPG @85mph on the highway.  My RSX got 33/36mpg. I have a hell of a lot more room and an AT.

It doesn't notify you when there is low coolant or any other fluids except oil and even then it only comes on the radio bar, not even in the driver's line of vision. No oil light. She has some real get up and go in her if you let her accelerate properly and goes very fast which I like but it is a problem in icy environments as you need to start very slow and she likes to take off. I've replaced my sparkplugs which was no biggy but now my suspension is having issues and making horrendous noises and GM is giving me a hard time with a lack of diagnosis, just that it's the suspension.

Just last week I had my car in the service department at my work, and all of my head gaskets needed to be machined and replaced, oil was leaking everywhere!!

This car is very quick and my friends are impressed with the superb road holding.  It also gets decent mileage (I'm averaging 24 mpg city/hwy).  The 6A is awesome (won't find that on Accord or Altima) and the trip tonic will hold gear even if you floor the throttle. 18"" wheels typically scratch easily but the treadwall height on these tires is enough that the tires absorb impact upon curb contact. The 8-spkr Monsoon is awesome.  Excellent cargo capacity with folding rear seats. No reliability issues so far - car has only needed oil changes and tire rotation.

I've just tried to protect it from salt and that kind of grime. It handles the cold temps just fine and is plenty warm (insulated well) with the hard top. I've had minimal issues with it outside of normal replacement of brakes and such and with over a decade of use. I will say the one thing that has bothered me is that you lose the trunk when the top is down, but the back seat can be used as the trunk if needed in those instances. I've taken it on long road trips, and have been on the highway with the top down, and have enjoyed the ride with only a bit of cowl shake. The stereo and speaker system suits the car fine when the top is down. Finally, it does not handle like a sport convertible (Camaro for example), nor does it ride like one. It handles and rides like a regular car, which I'm fine with. It gets up and goes decently and rides smooth.",5

Didn't think the styling and quality of American cars was as good as the foreign cars. Times are changing. This convertible is a blast to drive. It is one of the best looking convertibles out there. I get so many looks driving down the road. And when I stop to raise/lower the hardtop people just stop and stare. It is a very comfortable car to drive. Roomy, good seats, very good instrumentation, very smooth and quiet ride for a car this small. The fit and finish of this car is first rate. I got mine with the premium and sport package and it is a very solid buy. ",4.875

It took the dealer three attempts to quiet the clicking, rattling window noise. It only happened with the windows all the way up, and was fixed with an adjustment to the top closure which was covered in a manufacturer's bulletin.  This car is fun to drive and is truly like having two cars in one with the retractable hard top. Gas mileage is excellent given the performance level.",4.75

This car is so much fun to drive and I stole it from the dealer. It is fun to drive and great with the top down. Had a rag top and you guessed it, the top got cut  and it rotted. So much for rag tops. Now I am so happy with my convertible and if it turns out to be lemon I don't care. I will love it anyway. My son and I love it and now he wants me to buy him one.  The top movement is so smooth and no problems like the Sunliner had. Tubes/switches bad",4.625

All it took was looking at that sporty coupe turn into a great looking convertible with the push of a button and I knew what would be in my driveway! I love having two cars in one!! When the top's up, you can't even tell it's a convertible, inside or out. It looks great going down the road, and then I put the top down and you know that everyone is looking at it, whether they want to or not.  ",5

I got the G6 GT Convert w/the 3.9 V6 Sport & Premium Pkg, adjust pedals, side bags, the works. I am a big man (300+ 6'1"") and still fit well in this car. When the top is down, I am even comfortable in the back seat. My wife is much shorter and with the adjust pedals and tilt tele steering wheel, finds a comfortable position too.  The ride and handling are great.  I drive a daily round trip commute of 70 miles and this car works fine. Turn off the traction control, stomp the gas and you burn the tires but this is a cruiser, not a dragster. I don't have a garage and didn't think a cloth top would wear well. A steel top was my only option and Pontiac has delivered! I love this car!",4.75

Push one button and you go from hard top to convertible - no latches to loosen or canvas covers to snap in place - the top automatically folds into the trunk in about 30 seconds. Most convertibles are quite noisy with the top up (only canvas between you and road noise) but this car is as quiet as any sedan when the top's up. Can't wait to tow it behind an RV and enjoy the vacation scenery from a vantage point only a convertible can provide. I have a Bluetooth phone which I can use when the top's down. There is hardly any wind noise in the front seat. ,4.875

I live in the Chicagoland area and purchased this car for summer time use only. After breaking in the engine, I took this car on a 1,500 mile, 5 day, 5 state road trip to the Smoky Mountains N.P. This car was a blast to drive on the interstate. With the top down, conversation can easily be made even when traveling 80-90 mph. With a large displacement of the 3.9L engine maneuvering through traffic was a breeze although this car could really benefit from a 5th and even a 6th gear, because it only returned 23.5 mpg on this particular trip.",4.25

The day I drove it off the lot though, the roof rattled loudly and didn't retract. I returned it immediately and I have to give the dealer credit. They apologized profusely, gave me a loaner, and repaired/adjusted everything in a few days.

It's not a sports car, or all that high performance, but it is fun.  Handling is very good for a car its size and the back seat roomy enough for adults.

My parents bought this car off a friend they knew well. At first, I hated it outright.

But I have to say, since I brought it home, It grew on me. Don't get me wrong, this car is no sports car by ANY means, but this has over 265,000 miles with the original engine!! After 14 years of families, work, and now high school students, this car has survived every test that has been thrown at it! It maybe considered the worst car ever made and you may turn a few heads (not in a good way), but the folks up at GM and Pontiac meant what they said when they said it is ""Quite possibly the most versatile vehicle on the planet"". When car shopping, don't let its looks turn you away. Look underneath the plastic cladding and see how well it will fulfill your every need. They are also very cheap, so basically it's a steal!

Recently had a few significant repairs. Over all am quite happy with the purchase. Runs well.  Good gas mileage 18-24 mpg for a 6 cyl AWD model. Excellent in deep snow! This car lives in New England outside and has served well.  Only minor cosmetic drawback is that it does not come with gas cover. Many people over the years have asked what happened to it.

Even the ones that were replaced had to be replaced. 3 times to service for the same defect, once each year for the first three years I owned the vehicle.

But i know when im gonaa run out. It is in the shop because the air conditoner compresser fell off but what can u expect. Every car will need work done to it eventualy. I have treat this car like crap and it has only broke down onec. Everyone says that it is good on the snow but i have ran into many curbs and bent the rims. All in all this is the best car that i have had and i plan to switch to the torrent when this one goes out. Very roomy. Hope this was helpful. ,5

I put nearly 30,000 miles a year on it and it has never given me any trouble. My Aztek is fully loaded with the exception of AWD and heated seats. The heads up display is a cool feature. The storage tray is convenient although if you set anything on it while drive it will slide around. I think the storage tray should have been coated with a rubber surface. The onboard air pump should be standard on all vehicles. I can pump up an air mattress, basketball  or all of my tires. The 6 disc in-dash CD player and factory 10 speaker Pioneer sound system are great. I would say the engine is a little under powered for the weight but overall I love my Aztek.",4.75

It is easy to find in parking lots bcause of its size and rarity. If the car had a more appealing exterior, I would probably own TWO.    ",4.75

We also have luxury feataures of DVD, heated seats, built in ice chest, etc. and especially felt much safer with the Onstar. In fact, used it to get directions and when couldn't find the keys they opened it for us from wherever. So far, we are very pleased with our Aztek.",5

The only unknown is how it will hold up over the years. Right now I'm quite happy with it.  The exterior appearance takes a bit getting used to.

As such, the brakes wear down pretty quick. Have replaced brakes/pads/rotors 5 times so far. Have also replaced entire ignition system, fuel tank, fuel pump, and various other things. Bought car new for $14k and, so farm have spent about $7- $8k in repairs over the life of ownership. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING THIS CAR. ",1.5

I was especially happy when I moved from to a state where it snows and my car handled incredibly well in the snow. I lived on a very steep hill and my neighbors could not get up the hill in the snow but my Pontiac went right up the hill.  This car looks nice,I like how it looks sporty. Handles well,gets good gas mileage. I always thought it was pretty roomy until a car seat would not really fit well in the back seat. Stroller also takes up the entire trunk.  I have only had to repair the fuel pump and that was at 125,000 miles. All other work on the car has been just routine maintenance. My only complaint would be that it's little noisy inside",4.375

I've always had maintenance done on time, cleaned it often, and simply took greater care of it than others found reasonable. It still keeps up with my lead foot, is still running and looking like new after three fairly serious accidents, drove smoothly between California and Massachusetts four times, and its fun-to-drive rating becomes ""10"" with the right custom suspension and engine upgrades.

Researching a bit, I found numerous consumer complaints, and several Tech Service Bulletins issues by Pontiac regarding the brakes. One additional item:(might vary by state) in MA, the GAGT is very expensive to insure-same as a BMW, due to repair cost.

First of all it has some very old school 1960's era styling cues such as astro vent balls as A/C vents and that classic Pontiac grille. The 2.2L Ecotech engine rated at 140hp at 5,600rpm and 150lbs-ft of torque at 4,000 rpm delivers decent power in the upper rpm range and good power in town. I put it up to 107mph while rushing my wife to the hospital and it never acted funny and still had half pedal. I have no idea where the governor is set at. The driver's window control came loose at 69,000 miles but nothing super glue couldn't fix. It has a problem throwing Service Engine Soon lights if the gas cap isn't turned at least 3 clicks.

Comes with all-season touring tires that are also speed rated, which adds to the handling of cornering. It's a great little performer.

Now at almost 105,000 I had to get the ignition switch changed because the car wouldn't turn over a couple times. All in all I love this car, I've always wanted one of these since I was a kid lol. It is a blast to drive I haven't driven it in the winter yet obviously but hopefully it is as good as people are saying it is. The one thing that kind of bugs me is the turn signal ticking when I'm not using it. But that doesn't bother me as much because I either have the radio turned up or the windows/sunroof open or both.

Very comfortable for being a guy who is 6 foot and 230 pounds, I was quite surprised at how roomy it was. Ran good despite having power steering problems, and I did have a problem with the volume knob on the stereo for some reason. But other then that, it was a good car to have. Had to get rid of it in November 2016 due to braking problems so now its in the used car lot at a local car dealer. Sad to see it go, just didn't feel like pouring $450 into a 18 year car that was practically on its deathbed.",4
4639, on 09/30/16 13:54 PM (PDT),J Matthew ,1999 Pontiac Grand Am Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,"Runs smooth, but a lot can go wrong."," I really don't know where to begin with describing this vehicle. I inherited this from my parents who bought it relatively new. So let's flashback a few years: When my parents owned it, the power winders broke. I read that this is a common problem with these models. They were fixed, then a couple years later the rear ones broke again. They work now. Now that I have it, very occasionally the driver side window knob won't function, but after I play with a few times it begins to work.  Let's start with the repairs I've put into it the past few years. The power steering went out whilst I was driving a couple years ago. I pulled into a mall market lot, walked to the nearest Auto Zone, and put power steering fluid in my car - only to notice it was falling right out onto the street. No small leaks, just a straight out fall. So I ended up having that fixed which was $600. Then, a few months later, the belt and crankshaft malfunctioned while driving. This was another $600 fix. Then just a few months ago, the engine started misfiring on the way to work. I found out one of the spark plugs blew, so I had them all replaced with platinum spark plugs, and from that point on, now it's running great; I can't really blame the car for this, I suppose the car was due for new spark plugs.  A few ""minor"" problems: The AC wiring went out in the summer, sort of. It works, I just have to turn the heat on first, then back to air, and play with the knob a bit. The display on the radio has been out for quite some time, although this is an easy fix. I just have to guess what radio station I'm listening to; also, the right front speaker is blown. The lower intake gasket has been leaking anti-freeze for several years now, which I read has been a major problem in these cars, and since this is a $1000 fix, it's not worth it. As long as I keep refilling it with anti-freeze every couple of weeks, it's not a problem. The engine tends to run hot, also a common problem. The car overheats in stop-and-go traffic, but this can be nullified by turning on the heat. Yes, I have to drive with the heat on often to keep the thermostat level. It tends to burn oil - I discovered this when my ""low oil"" came on several months back, and put a quart of oil in. But the bright side to this is, you can go longer between oil changes since you are putting in fresh oil. When it rains, it leaks water on the inside of the car under the steering wheel. After a rain, when I turn the steering wheel right, water will leak and get my shoes all wet. I read online that this model gets 19/30 mpg - HA! No, it doesn't. This car eats up gas like crazy, especially in stop-and-go traffic. But I think this is because it has over 180K and the fact that the oil and anti-freeze leak.  As far as physical: As many have already noted, the front dashboard is warped. The cupholder is a horrible design - it sits behind the gear shifter, and when the car is in park, your drink is locked in there. I have to use the passenger side cupholder. As far as positives: The engine runs great. At 180k, the acceleration is good and the ride is smooth like a new car. I started putting synthetic oil in it for the past few changes, which helps a lot. The transmission also shifts well despite being the original transmission fluid, although I added some synthetic fluid to the existing fluid.  Honestly, at this point right now, I'm surprised the car still runs as great as it does. And the anti-freeze problem seems to have fixed itself. But I have put my last dime in the car: I can buy a new car anytime I want, but right now I'm just waiting to see how long I can take this so I can get my full money's worth out of it.  I'll buy a new car when the next major problem comes.",3

The dealers response was don't ride the brakes. I downshifted every opportunity and with 90% highway miles, that never really was a problem. So after about 6 adjustments and rotors I purchased slotted rotors. 48000 miles and no problem.

The 4 spd auto trans. is great for the miliage, but you need to use the 3rd gear to get the car to hold back on steep down hills or you will use up your brakes. In the 105,000 miles we have driven it I have replaced the front brakes once and checked two weeks ago still have 90% and the rear is still at about 40%. The car just turned 250,000 and the engine & trans. work great. I change the oil every 3,000 miles and I still have no need to add oil in between oil changes. For trips it is great with all of the room in the back.",4.875

Have had to do 3 major things that ran over $1,000 to it and now it won't pass emissions. Plastic inside is cheap and cracks easily, headlights are always foggy not matter what we do. Even purchased extra 2 year warrenty, not worth the paper written on. See tons of them on the road always in red. Must of been a popular color that year. I think we got the lemon, should have painted it yellow. Will stick with Chevy or Buicks from now on. Also will have the next one researched. Owning this car is like having a piggy bank you just keep putting money in but never get anything back. It is hopless. 2 more years to pay on, that's the sad part. ",2.625

4760, on 03/26/02 00:00 AM (PST),Jessica  Scott ,1999 Pontiac Grand Am Coupe SE 2dr Coupe,BIG MISTAKE FROM UNHAPPY CUSTOMER, If you are considering this car but having doubts Do Not Buy this vehicle. I made the mistake of buying a Grand Am brand new. I have had nothing but trouble. This car isn't even 3 years old yet and has been in the shop at least 5 times. It doesn't handle well at all in curves and the brakes and tires wear quickly.I urge you to Learn from my mistake.,2.125
4761, on 02/26/02 17:28 PM (PST),gurgstar ,1999 Pontiac Grand Am Coupe SE 2dr Coupe,Fun to drive," I leased a 99 Grand Am SE for 3 yrs. and was very happy with the car.  The V6 engine was powerful, and this car really came packed with a lot of features for the price (power windows/seats, steering-wheel radio controls, cd player, cruise-control, etc.).  My only complaint is that the car handled poorly at high speeds (it seemed to have a mind of its own).   In the 3 years that I owned it, I had hardly any service problems (a couple  minor things that were resolved with 1 trip to the dealer).",4
4762, on 01/10/17 23:23 PM (PST),Taylor ,1998 Pontiac Grand Am Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,An Alright Car," I bought my '98 Pontiac Grand AM almost 2 years ago, with only 93,000 miles. An elderly woman owned it before me and her son took good care of it, but left it sitting for years, so it took several oil changes before it quit looking dirty. I'm not much of a car person, no one has ever showed me much about maintenance, but since I've had it, I've had the serpentine belt replaced, a brake pad, and had Freon put in it. That's about it. Maybe I've gotten lucky, but no major issues have occurred. Now, the A/C didn't work from the get go, but I didn't mind it until a really hot summer. The ABS light has stayed on since not long after getting the car...mechanics said it was just a sensor and turned it off, but it came back. Occasionally the battery light comes on, but I've never had a problem with it starting. The radio knob fell off, so it's kind of hard to adjust the volume without busting your eardrums. I WISH I had plain crank windows, because being a 19 year old car, the power windows barely work. The driver window luckily works the best out of all of them! Car is somewhat noisy, especially on highway. The headlights are great, super clear with no fog. AS OF 2017: I slid in a curve due to snow, and ran up on a short rock wall, and dented in a chain link fence. The body is TOUGH! Only scratches, a busted fog light, a dented plate holder, and I knocked the long plastic piece off that runs under my doors. (I just popped it the rest of the way off since it was dragging.) Underneath: I was told I broke the stabilizer/sway bar, and that the car needs to be aligned. (My brakes had also started to grab before the accident, so I'm having those looked at too.) I'm having it fully looked over to estimate the damage, but I honestly think (after research) that it will only amount to no more than $400, without any cosmetic stuff done. (I don't care, as long as I can drive it.) Insurance estimated WAY up there, actually more than the car is worth, mainly because of the scratches. Overall, she's a tough car. I hope to keep her, but I always am hoping to get a newer one, that's not so low to the ground.",4
4763, on 03/29/16 07:12 AM (PDT),Allen ,1998 Pontiac Grand Am Sedan GT 4dr Sedan,A fun Ride!," Where to start with this car? I owned a 1998 Pontiac grand AM GT V6. I bought the car in 2012 when I first turned 16 at 132,000 miles. I'll start with the good. The V6 engine in the car gets up and it is pretty loud for a nice vroom vroom feel. I drove this car hard during my whole 4 years of owning it and not once did the engine or transmission show any signs of wear. In the winter the car will start with no problems. I had co-workers with 05's and up whose cars would not budge at all in the cold weather, my Pontiac would turn on and be driving down the road about a minute later.  Now electronics are obviously not going to be top notch in this car as it is a 1998. I came with a standard radio and a cassette player so at least you could use a cassette to MP3 player for music(I replaced the radio).     Now the bad, keep in mind I did not get a carfax before I bought this car and the shady dealer I bought it from did not do any work before hand. The car was in the shop for quite a few minor fixes. I Probably spent around $2000 in repairs on the car. Ball bearings were bad but went to crap about 3 months after I bought the car $400, I had seal for the radiator bust that cost me $600 along with other radiator repairs...In the winter this car does horrible in the snow. Even with good tires and new brakes it is terrifying to drive in any type of snow, but if you drive careful as you should it will get you to your destination safely. The window motor on my driver side window went bad so it would only go down halfway. The passenger side window motor would not go down at all. I have read reviews before about he window motors on the make and model so I would be wary of those...Besides that I finally got into a new car this year in 2016 leaving my Pontiac with 180k miles. The Pontiac was still running and would probably still be running for another few years. I would recommend this car for a first car or for something reliable and fun.",4

I did do some window shopping at the Camry or Accord, but those cars are fairly bland.  The Grand Am, especially in GT form, can get you anywhere you need.  Read any review and you will likely see ""piece of crap"" and ""unreliable"" associated with this car. This is not the case.  Treat it like gold, and it will last.  Since Feb 2007 i have had only two problems.  The EGR valve and an exhaust manifold leak.  The car runs like a dream and the 3100 V6 is as fast as a V6 powered camry or accord, but for far less money. The car is safe, too, with dual airbags and ABS.

Power windows dying a slow and painful death, one of the fog lights going out periodically due to bad wiring, the cd player display malfunctioning and it wouldn't play cds for about a year (I was about to have it replaced when it magically started working again), fan/ac giving off a high pitch noise, and the all-to-common leak problem.",3.5

Already replaced broken motor mount that caused car to ""growl"" when accelerating, bad alternator that drained battery and left me stranded in the middle of nowhere, temp sensor and thermostat because car kept overheating, front shocks b/c car started squeaking and bouncing over even the smallest bumps, keyless remote, front brake rotors and brake pads. Right now I am having numerous electrical problems with the car. I really like the car, but I have to get rid of it because I can't afford the maintenance. Wouldn't recommend buying one unless you have the money to maintain it.",3.875

Drove it from NYC to Florida, to Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland (love the roadtrips), and never had a problem save normal wear and tear.  The engine was ridiculously fast (and it was cherry red.. yes, I got many speeding tickets), and it STUCK to the road.  I hated to get rid of it, because it was still in excellent condition, but I couldn't afford to park it in Manhattan anymore ($400 a month.. ouch).  Really do love this car, though.",3.625

Always got me where I needed to go, never left me stranded. The AC always blows cold, and I have never had to do any major maintence besides brakes, and fluids. The engine is fast, and gets great fuel economy. But, one day we took it up town, went in the store, came out, and would not start. Car had 242,000 miles on it by then. Was a great car, and we were expecting it to go. Guy at the shop said the engine was blown, and we had the option to crush it, or rebuild it.

First off that oil pressure sensor at the top of the spark plug valley. It will seem like the valve cover leaks but more likely the switch. It leaks from inside of it. The housing for the spark plug they like to crack. Sometimes it's not even visible. Water pump just watch that mother. This car is definitely for mechanical inclined. I'd use 5w20 since it has small oil wells. Deff do ur oil changes every 3000 to 5000 miles at most. Other than that has okise mpg and power  they ride well and shift good.

They are made very poorly, and nothing is easy to get to when trying to fix it.  It has broken down 4 times already and nothing has been cheap to fix.  It still runs and I am still driving it but I hate it.

The car has just under 105,000 KMs on it and I have had to replace the brakes 3x, not only that the front AND rear struts/springs have had to be replaced 2x!! The next thing blew my mind!

The v6 makes enough power to smoke the tires if you're interested to know.  Mine happens to have 130,000 miles on it and I get throttle happy with it sometimes anyway.  It makes Tauruses look lethargic, and Honda Civic, hah, is that a sedated hamster under the hood of those things? In all seriousness, for being rated at a rather low 170HP, the 207c.i. v6 has more than enough torque to compensate. There's also performance parts if stock just isn't good enough. If you think American cars are crap, you're wrong.  I've had no problems since I've had it.  Pros- it's quick, girls like it Cons- still FWD",4.625

If the year of the vehicle is 1995 or lower then it's not worth investing your time into. Second, the oil should always be changed EVERY 1500 miles. If it's a 3.4 L, then the engine will obviously burn more ( but not a large amount) fuel and oil on cold starts. Third, if your inspecting a Grand Am to purchase and you can easily make a corner of the vehicle bounce up and down without a lot of strength (or with one arm), then the suspension is bad, and isint worth getting.

I have had very minimal repairs. Great car, paint still looks great with the exception of minor paint chips in the hood and bumper. I love the fact this car gives me all the power and response i need. Ive driven friends new Mercedes c230 thats feels gutless and slow to respond compared to my Grand am. I plan on driving the wheels off this car. After being 11 years old, i still catch myself looking at it and admiring the beauty of it.

Driver's widow motor went out 2 years ago, then air conditioner stopped working a little later.  Repair estimates came in starting at $800 so I drove around with no air in Atlanta's worst heat in history! The one honest mechanic left in the whole world (Poston Motors, Cumming, GA) bypassed a switch and voila - air! And an oil change: Less than $100.00!  Now, dashboard coming apart, both outside mirrors bout to fall off, automatic door buttons & mirror adjustment have fallen through the door panel & yesterday, interior rear view fell off!

I had to change brakes every year, rotors about every 18 months. The clips in the drivers side window broke several times, leaving me without a window to use. At 90k the car just fell apart. First the wheel bearings and rack and pinion needed changed. Then the power steering pump went. Not two weeks later, i had to have the intake manifold gaskets replaced. After that the fuel pump went out on me. Not reliable at all. But fun to drive.",4

This car is in great condition thanks to the previous owner. Maintenance goes a long way when done properly and on time. Braking seems soft, even with new brake pads installed. Very fun and sporty, and so far I get about 29-31 MPG highway. Great handling on winding roads, even with sub-par tires. Tires for the GT can be a little pricier and is hard to find good all seasons that don't change tire size, which means recalibrating the speedometer. Overall I am very happy, and make sure you do your upkeep! Acceleration can seem sluggish at times, and @ 110K mi. time for new belts, hoses, and a good tune-up.",4.5

Yes I have had to do normal maintenance and a few extra but other then that It has done broke down on me. It now has 237,000 + miles on it and the fuel pump has finally died. Everyone about dies when I tell them it's never been replace before now. The gas mileage is also great . The only downside is that brakes and rotors don't last long with the mileage I drive every year. Also If you buy one look under the spare trunk lid and see if it says NC1. I live in Indiana and my car has never been in CA and that is where it was built for so if you ever need to replace heads , and other parts you cannot buy them in other places in us.",4.25

I'll never forget how fun it was the 1st time I test drove it. I'm a sucker for fast acceleration, and that alone attracted me enough to fork out the 3100.00 price. It wasn't long though before realizing what every one else does. Its an electrical nightmare and found out recently the 1998-2000 models have been known to catch fire without even being started (DO NOT PARK NEAR HOUSE) The cheap plastic control knobs break easy in cold weather. The CD players are famous for flashing ""error messages"" and quit working around 120,000 miles. Blown head gaskets are very common around 90- 100,000 miles.

It was what I could afford. The turn signal switch worked when it wanted to,  so I went to Freight Harbor Tools and purchased my fist tool box and fixed it. The AC started working after the Ac relay was replaced under hood and has never quit working. As a maintenance tip, I run the AC for several minutes in winter time for proper system lubrication. Replaced tranny fluid at 182 K. Right after that I made a trip from Phoenix to Kansas City and back (2460 miles) and got 32 mpg. I replaced the factory fuel pump at 210 K ( $ 58 on Ebay). After several ten minutes waiting for passlock system restart, finally I bypassed it with a resistor (you can look it up online). Breaks were replaced with ceramic pads (do not used semi-metallic ones ) and it´s been two years now and no problems. I went ahead and replaced timing chain, water pump and thermostat as a preventive maintenance last year at 218 K, but I was not having any problems with them. Never had random lights on dash but whenever I see Service Vehicle Soon, it means there is a blown bulb or fuse. My only complaint: rough idle but with almost 223 k miles I guess it has given me a lot for the money.Update:  I gathered the resources and replaced all the mounts, even the ones that look ""good"" : end of the rough idle. Before that , I replaced the front wheel hub and that eliminated the ABS light and the wobbling. The a/c quit working. Before you do anything crazy, go ahead and check the pressure switch in the line on top of the radiator. It was that simple. My friends who have newer cars say mine cools the interior faster than theirs and it is true. At 246k I had the tranny rebuilt (it was the original one) because it was slipping between 3rd and 4th gear, but drivable. Now it is almost 255k miles 6 month later. The enigne is still good. I put synthetic oil to cope with the Phoenix heat. No favorite brand: I just go to 99c stores and pick whatever synthetic at $2.99, not bad. I don't drive like I stole it, specially when first start it. I guess all of this makes possible to keep the car.",5

Initially I named it the lemon (I never liked it, but my husband did) after getting new tires, new fluids, getting rid of rabbits chewing wires and some other normal things, I made a deal with it. It takes care of me and I take care of it. Yes, they have quirks, but if you take really good care of it, it will run like a champ. It thinks it's a sports car. I drive it at least 51 miles everyday.

The drivers side power window went out. I was driving down the highway at 70 mph. and it just quit for no apparent reason.

This is the perfect first car, it is sharp and not tacky or too sophisticated at all. Runs great, sounds quiet, handles well and easily.

It's most recent behaviour is to either stall of have the engine nearly choke off each time you step on the accelerstor. I've had the system gone over with a fine tooth comb and you guessed it.

Well that was until the engine started leaking antifreeze from the head gasket, which is pretty expensive to fix and if done wrong could cause more serious problems.

Most of which are quite expensive to have replaced and/or serviced, but in order to maintain this vehicle you end up sinking hundreds even thousands of dollars into it.

It's an SE not a GT but there wasn't a choice for a 2 door SE, 6 cyl 3.4. It is now 2015 have 123k miles. Two repairs while under warranty, one was an oil leak and one was the ignition switch. Very little maintenance over the years other than oil changes and brakes. Did not do any of the other recommended maintenance. Replaced the alternator, tie rods and a sensor. Replaced the original battery at year 8 and still driving on the second. Starts right up with no hesitation. Still has speed and handles well. I am getting 26 miles/city more than when it was new. Biggest annoyance is the power Windows. Both had to be replaced and you have to replace the whole thing window and all. Over $300 per window even though the glass was still good as well as the motor, just the clips broke. Less than $2000 in repairs over 15 years. Not bad at all. Best car I ever had. Biggest complaint would be the rust (seems like all of them rust in the same place between the doors and the back tires). Started about year 7 and is pretty bad now. I do have to say I live in Chicago and the car has been outside it's whole life and I did not rust proof or undercoat and I probably haven't washed it in the last five years. Other than that area the paint and body has held up good. Time for a new car as I know I have some major suspension work that needs to be done. I'm hearing some mighty loud and strange noises when going over bumps in the last year. The service engine light goes on and off and the air conditioner blows hot this year. Leary to put any major money in a 15 year old car. All in all considering the original cost of the car, loan interest , repairs and maintenance it's has been an average of somewhere between $1600 & 2000 per year for this car, so tops $166 a month (not counting gas of course) to run this car. In all that time it only didn't start once (ignition switch) I was driving when the alternator went out so with some fancy driving I was able to drive home the 5 miles. The battery I replaced before it totally died but was taking a couple tries to start so I had some warning and after all it was 8 years old. As a woman it's reassuring to have a reliable car. It actually makes me sad to get rid of it. This was my first new car purchase on my own about a year after my divorce.

The factory battery lasted 11 years. Took it on a road trip this summer and actually got really good mileage. To recap, it's been paid for since 2005 and has never left me stranded. ***Update*** After a year of taking up space on my driveway I decided it was time to part with the old girl. My only regret is not getting the windshield replaced which would have addressed the water issues. The car still fired up on the day kidney car drove it into the flat bed for recycling in 2017.

The only part I really didn't like was that the turning signals didn't always work, but they were covered under a recall, and were fixed free of charge.  Corners and handles very well, and hasn't let me down in the snow yet.  Heat, A/C, Cruise, Power Locks and Windows.. all work great.  The gas mileage isn't too bad considering the get-up-and-go it has.  Most costly fix was the headgasket after I first got it, which was $600, and the hubs ($400).",4.875

Overall, and aside from the intake manifold problem (which our wounderful dealership repaired free of charge), our Grand Ams have been excellent cars. Not once have either of them ever let me down. Proformance and comfort at superb with the tourqy 3.4 V6, and the leather seats make long trips relaxing. The stock sound system is absolutely amazing, and the red backlit dash is easy on the eyes. I plan on keeping my GT for as long as possible, and im thankful I havent recieved the problems others seemed to have had. Only other probem Ive had was a loose electrical wire, which was fixed in minutes at my dealer.",4.875

The car was a good and fun car to drive, but it did have issues. First, the engine went after 120k miles when the timing belt went. Then the Body Control Module went costing me another $1000. The wheel bearings started going after 75k miles. The window regulator on the drivers side went in less than 4 years. Finally the blower motor went in under 4 years. The car did provide a good smooth ride and got great gas mileage (30MPG).",3.875

I bought it new in 2000 after owning a 1984 V8 Camaro.  The performance of the GrandAm GT1 with RamAir was nearly the same as the Camaro, but with much better fuel economy.  It has great low-end torque, and accelerates fast.  I like to drive hard, and this car handles it nicely, although I upgraded the wheels to aftermarket R1-Racing ZR18's because the stock wheels felt a little flimsy on hard turns.  Besides the exterior beauty and sporty performance, I love the interior cabin.  The Monsoon sound system is sweet. Passengers routinely comment on the quality of the sound.  The dash is nicely laid out and lit in Pontiac red.  The leather seats are awesome.",4.375

I didn't really expect to enjoy driving it so much myself!  I quickly found it was fun to drive, easy to park and made me smile when I saw it in the parking lot!  It was reliable and served me well!  Recently my daughter was looking for a good used car and I decided to sell her the Grand Am.  She was excited to purchase a great looking car! I was sad to say goodbye to the only sports car I'll probably ever own - and I'm really glad to know it's still in the family!  I highly recommended it for a fun, reliable and sporty ride!  ",5

While it only had 18,000 miles when I acquired it from a private party known very well to me who kept it very well maintained and garaged, both window regulators broke, the heater knob busted, constant ""Check Engine"" lights, terrible grinding from the front end (no it wasn't the brakes).  Tried to change a headlight bulb yesterday, after an hour and half of trying to get to it ( I finally did) the headlight retainer ring broke.

It looks like what it claims to be; a sporty mid size coupe that's fun to drive. The interior says the same. And granted, yes, it is. When it runs. I bought mine at 32000 miles when it was 2 years old. Since, I've had nothing but problems such as:  -Bad wheel bearing immediately after warranty expired : $800 -Brake caliper froze: $300 -Brake sensor burnt out, cluster needed to be replaced: $400 -Intake seals popped, leaking AF everywhere: $1200 -Fuel line leakage: $200 -Brake caliper frozen again: $300  And now the fuel pump is blown.

The car is very electrical and I had two major electrical problems in the two years that I owned this car.  The first time an engine lock fuse shorted and my car wouldn't start.  Luckily I was still covered by my warranty or else I would have had to pay over 400 not including towing.  The second time I paid about 400 again to have the thing fixed.  This car isn't so great on gas (but then again I did have a V6)  Also I received a notice from the manufacturer that there was a malfunction with the hazard lights.  I noticed this also with the signal lights every time I used the turning signal it would still click even after being put back,3.375

I am getting really tired of having to sit in parking lots for up to an hour waiting for my car to start, how will I go grocery shopping when it's hot!?

5065, on 01/07/18 08:42 AM (PST),Snowflow ,2002 Pontiac Grand Am Coupe GT 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 4A),Regret trading this car in...," I got a 2002 Grand Am GT coupe with about 60k when it was 10 years old and sold it last spring with about 120k. If I’m being honest I miss the car. For starters the car was very nice looking and the paint was in excellent shape with no fading, chipping or peeling (on the metal and plastic molding). The steering had a very nice feel to it and the car was easy to drive from slow to fast speeds and the ride was fairly smooth. The car had enough power to get off the line and merge quickly without worry. The interior could’ve been designed and pieces together better (lots of uneven gaps), but for the most part it was very durable and cleaned up nicely. The inside was roomy and the car felt very open especially with the sunroof. Now the reason I got rid of the car is I got tired of fixing the same stuff... over and over. Once the car hit 110k+ the front wheel bearings went (multiple times), both brake calipers went and the front driver one went multiple times, the mounting brackets on the new calipers caused the brake pads to slide very frequently, the car started to burn oil and then leak oil too. Basically I got rid of the car because the replacement parts are a joke and GM clearly isn’t standing behind the quality of their service centers. That much being said, I like the look and driving characteristics of the Grand Am more than the Impreza I replaced it with (believe it or not)... Grand Am had better steering feel, more power and looked cooler.",4

But then at 117k miles, I had to get a WHOLE new engine due to it overheating BADLY. Then at 125k miles, I had to get a new ignition coil. 134k miles, it needed a new head gasket.

The brakes were so rusted I needed to have a mechanic fix them. There is this horrible annoying, nonstop clicking from the blinkers that is apparently common with these.

The first 2 years it was in the shop 3 times for the water pump, brake fluid leak, and complete tune-up. Since 2008 i have been driving the car and my wife got the upgrade. Since i have been driving it the a/c compressor went out, the driver side mirror fell off (thank heaven for super glue 2 years and still holding), mirror control switch fell into the door, and the exhaust is leaking. My wife biggest complaint is the lack of braking power, meaning you have to push really hard not a big deal for me though.

The shocks had too little travel, and bumps were bone-jarring. Then engine ran frighteningly hot in summer, and no cause was ever found. Gas mileage was so-so (24 city, 26 hwy). In fairness, there were some good things. The V6 engine is very smooth, if a bit underpowered for its size. And the car had surprisingly excellent handling on icky, icy Dallas freeways in February. Ultimately, lack of reliability became too much of a factor, so 2 years and 40K miles later, I went back to my old brand. ",3.375

Power is a joke, 12 seconds to 60 MPH, and fuel economy could be better, and other cars in it's class (from the same year model) get better gas mileage and still have better performance.

The 4.6L Northstar V8 is super powerful but leaves me with a little more power being desired (Because of the fact that GM has the 2.0T and 3.6L which make about the same power).

If I were to have any complaints about this car it would be the ill advised Intermediate Shaft in the steering column carried over from the Olds Aurora.

I am very happy with this car.  It does everything I expect of a car. Interior...the well around the console has a plastic that will tear easily, they could have done a better job. Also, although I haven't experienced it with this Bonneville, you have to be aware of a GM flaw with a failing head gasket that allows water into the engine.

I know what I'm getting from the Bonny - its just what I'm NOT getting that I miss. What I'm not getting is what Pontiac pretends to have different than the rest of GM ... namely performance. The Bonny's no dog; but with such a mean- sounding exhaust and the potential for American muscle, this Bonny should have more power behind it.

Salt on the roads has put some rust on the wheels wells and rocker panels, there's fade on the hood, fuel lines have rotted a bit, but no major repairs after 125,000 miles.  The 3.8L V6 with the 4-speed is smooth and very reliable, ask any mechanic.  Fuel economy is a bit low but it's a big car, and very roomy and comfortable.  Interior has held up ok, GM interiors from that era had some quality issues but aside from some rips on the drivers seat everything works perfectly and looks alright.  Heat takes a little while to heat up.  Parts and maintenance are inexpensive, and existing Buick GMC Chevrolet dealers often have parts in stock.  Based on the Buick LeSabre/Oldsmobile Aurora but more performance oriented.  Steering is big car good, not too hefty and not too much understeer for a FWD.  Decent in bad weather with good tires, though I wish it had 4-wheel disc brakes.  Acceleration is very good and exhaust makes a great note.  Transmission is smooth, some clunking when changing from first to second but nothing too out of the ordinary, it is 18 years old.

What could have been an expense fix turned out to be nothing. Other than that this car has been fantastic.

I have a friend with an older model with over 200,000 mi. and he has had only had to replace the alternator on his at about 150,000 mi. The only bad thing is that they do not hold their value well.

We spent very little on it for repairs. We did maintain it as recommended. The ride is a bit stiff, but it has good handling and control in evasive maneuvering. It has good road feel and takes curves and corners extremely well. The seats are very comfortable. We had the optional 60/40 split bench seat and were the only ones of our friends who could take two other couples out to dinner in the same car. We averaged about 25mpg highway (65mph) with the overdrive (auto) transmission. Not shifting into OD would lower gas mileage considerably. We averaged around 20mpg around town.",4.375

Now have over 90K miles  Always liked the style but never owned a Pontiac. Wanted a large car for golf with a somewhat sporty look. The inside leather is luxurious. The response and handling is great with the 3.8 V6. Just a great car. The mileage on trips has never been less that 30 mpg at 70 mph. I have a 95 Lexus ES 300 and a 2006 Corolla S. Both the wife and I enjoy this car as much as either of them. I can only say this vehicle is very well built and an overall great value.,5

I only wish they still made them so I could get another new one.,4.75

Replaced water pump at 17000 mi, replaced ABS system at 38000 mi. Replaced tie rod ends, brakes at 52,000 mi. Replaced right rear window power motor about 55,000 mi. Radio has a mind of its own sometimes.  Steering column continuously makes clunking noise when turning. GM says it needs to be serviced, but OK/safe to drive with the noise. Overall, I've spent less than $2000 out of pocket in 6 years. Engine and transmission seems to be the best part of this vehicle.",4

Dealer replaced at their cost, but forgot a few bolts during the repair. Yup fluids all over the engine and driveway. Rear window came off the track 2x's. Sunroof was completely replaced(glass and all) because of wind noise. Wonderful steering noise started just after 39k miles(sorry warranty done). After that my ignition key doesn't always want to turn (happens to both of my keys), and leaves the million dollar question- will it start today. 2 alternators later and 4 weeks after the last one car died again. To make if even better it was on my Birth Day (9/16). I only have 57k miles on a 6yr old car-why I ask do I have so many issues.",3.375

After driving it, I had to have it!  Deceivingly roomy, yet drives and performs outstandingly. The creature features are just enough to pamper me but not too much to spoil me. I'd rather have a responsive ""big"" car in today's deteriorating roads, jam packed with inattentive (aka cell phone handicapped) drivers.  The 3.8 liter V6 is the perfect bridge between typical 3.5's and less that cars around this weight class usually get, and the gas guzzling V8's. I don't know if it's on purpose, but Pontiac dual exhausts have always ""growled"", which you won't hear in a Buick!",4.625

I think a fifth gear would be nice and a little more grumble from the exhaust. An aftermarket battery should be made available.  As of now, you go to the dealership.  It is either all or nothing with the stereo system too.  Modular aftermarket components would be a nice option for upgrades.

The dealer was more concerned as to what caused the problem rather than just fixing it.  The heads-up display was scrambling and needed replaced as well.  The StabiliTrak system is amazing and works well especially in the snow, although a sensor had to be replaced twice to keep it working.  Other minor annoyances were the A-pillar trim panel keeps coming loose, the sunroof needs tightened occasionally but never leaks.  Even still if you drive one you'd likely buy one!

True, it lasted over a decade without any major problems, but I don't think the car was meant to last more than 15 years or so. It's nice for someone who is just starting to drive. The accelerator is nice, especially with the V6 engine, but braking is a little sluggish, especially now that the rotors and pads are starting to become faulty. Doesn't take that much oil, which is nice, but with being about 20mpg and the dial for the gas tank being broken since 2014, you'll have to fill up about once every two weeks.",3

It is such a shame to see the Bonneville line discontinued after 48 great years - but at least it went out with a BANG!  So far, the only shortcomings are the lack of aftermarket performance items available for it and a little lower gas mileage than I expected. But we do drive it enthusiastically as it is just a blast and the exhaust note is incredible for factory-spec.  The GXP handles exceptionally well for such a large sedan and yet offers great ride quality.  Luckily, I found one of the last NEW GXP's with every available option in White-Gold Tricoat. ",4.875

Proving the Bonneville is a great car and once you get one its very easy to get another one. The Bonneville with the 3800 Series II OHV V6 is plain peppy and is plenty of power for me and I was stepping down from a small block V8 powered GM car the six seemed almost as gusty. Part of that was due to the cars good gearing and performance axle ratio which was another reason I wanted an SLE. But I admit I love the GXP/SLE styling, it will age well! ",5

There is also that performance axle ratio which gives it alot of off the line kick. I truly love driving this car. Took it on a 2500 miles and drove it in the mountains with the FE2 ride this car was alot of fun. My fuel economy was okay. My 3400 Impala will do better. But thats the cost you pay for performance.

This car is smooth. As far as being some OHC motor from a Avalon or TL its not, but the Bonneville is good at being different and is never afraid to show its American roots. The interior room with the seats all the way back can be tight but if adjusted a little the back seat can be a pleasent place to pass time.

The interior looks much more inviting than most of GM's bench seat in the front of their sedans.  However, looks can be deceiving.  The seats are very uncomfotable and traveling long distances make riding a horse seem more appealing.  The vehicle has good acceleration once you get out of first gear and the exhaust has a nice rumble when you hit the gas.  It is fun to drive on winding roads due to the wider wheel base.

At 7 seconds 0-60 MPH according to the magazines, it is actually faster than some of my mid- 70's Corvettes. The car seems faster since the power band is broad and instantaneous due to the supercharger. Engine has been flawless since owned.

The suspension is adequate but you won't be winning any autocross meets anytime soon.

True dual exhaust, hood scoops and a 6.0 rocket engine under the hood. Mine is a red on red six speed pavement pulverizer. Gimme a break this is a 13 second car out of the box. It's a vette with a back seat and trunk with a high quality cowhide interior.  None to the GOAT. RIP GTO....

I wouldn't buy it again though due to the following reasons.  1) the car has no steering feel and it doesn't communicate with you at all so you cant drive with precision  2) the back seat has a lot of room but getting in and out is big problem and trust me it is. 3) Resale values are horrible but I didnt look at this when I bough it brand new. 4) Moding can be expensive and there are some mods you need right away like shifter and springs and shocks/ struts. Better tires.  Acceleration is great and so far it's faster in STRAIGHT LINE than these: 350z, evo,mustang, srt8,E46 M3, Speed6, S4,C55 AMG. It's a lot of car for the money ",4.125

The drive is kind of bumpy due to the sporty suspension.  I love the small block v-8.  Runs better when driven hard, like most corvette engines.  Dislike the locking mechanism for the door locks.  Wont let you lock the doors with out pushing the button.  The passenger seat is horribly slow to move forward and back.  So getting people or children in the back is not fun.  The shifter feels long, and the exhaust note is great at higher rpms.  The headlights should have been xenon.  The blaupunkt cd player distorts easily with bass.  The steering is heavy on fast corners.  straight acceleration is phenomenal.  Ill never buy another one, but ill keep mine.",4.75

Less than a week later I am the proud owner of a brazen orange 6- speed that gets great fuel mileage and second looks from those not knowing what had just passed them. Getting on the local interstate is just some of the fun when those 400 plus horses are put to the test, the feel of the engines torque really sets you in your seat just proving the power is there, Pontiac sums it up best We Build Excitement (oh just to mention 23 mpg highway/18 around town occasional flogging is my est mpg) having fun",5

First test drive hooked in less than one on ramp to the interstate. Excellent gas mpg 18/23 and with the power you've got this thing is sick. I changed out the stock suspension with the Pedders Street II and the ride quality is about the same but the way it handles through the curves is crazy fun. I cannot tell you how many times I've had looks from people - every stoplight it seems, and even from Lamborghini drivers. If you haven't bought one, and you're still undecided, you better try to find one that has less then 10K on it because once these babies are gone, they'll be talked about years from now, as the car that got away.

Under any other name, it would have been a hit, especially if the price had been competitive with the Mustang GT. Purists didn't like the exterior, non-muscle car styling, so the GTO died after '06.  Those of us who own a modern GTO know the truth: this is one of the fastest sleeper cars ever built. The 400 HP V8 sets the Goat on its haunches with a toe-twitch. It handles superbly and the stiff feel of the steering wheel is a huge improvement over the numb and the mundane.  Forget the Mustang GT. Forget the Charger RT or SRT8. None of those three muscle cars can touch the all- round performance, handling and power of the '06 GTO.",4.875

The people who were turned off because it didn't have the ""retro"" look lost out. I was thrilled by its looks. Who wants to spend this kind of money to have a car that looks like its 30 years old.

In addition to that I take it out often on social occasions. Needless to say I spend a great amount of time in this vehicle.  This is the best sports car you can buy for the price. The performance is immaculate, and a year and a half after purchase, it still surprises me. Another surprise was the quality of the interior. Leather all around, comfortable electronic seats, and a stylish dashboard. No part of the interior looks cheap or plastic- looking like many cars today.

Coming from a supercharged 2000 Honda Accord EX V6, this car's performance really blows me away. I'm still afraid to go full throttle with the traction control turned off. My only complaints are that the interior lighting would have been much better if it were red like the rest of of current day Pontiacs, instead of the green that it is, and that they put wider wheels and tires in the rear. It's just too easy to break traction by depressing the throttle a bit. But for the price of the car, you just can't get as much power and comfort. I love it when people stop and stare at her.

A hoot to drive, the vehicle is well balanced with the tight crisp steering, firm handling and strong brakes expected on a 400 hp sports car.

I think the cars looks are great, the interior is well crafted especially for a 30K car and my car has been reliable. From a performance and driving perspective, I have not driven a better car.

Had an airbag light go on for no reason and it seemed to fix itself. Rode like crap, handling was mediocre, and build quality was less than spectacular. But it sure sounded good.

For those who look for a performance daily driver this is a good reliable automobile. If you want to step it up a notch and have the coin.

I needed to put the test on it. I drove it from North Carolina to California and back. No problems the entire trip. When I got back there were some electronic issues. Nothing a few hundred cant fix.

Having owned many cars from early Z-28 (1968), Corvette, 400 CI Firebird, Tuubo-Coupe Thunderbird, three 5.0 Mustangs (still have 2), that are considered performance cars this may be the best balance.   Bought as a GM Certified Used car so far so good. I'm over 6'4"" & car is roomy for 2 adults.",4.875

It handles very well especially with the right rubber under it. I have super charged the LS2 and it is a beast. The torque and power band is unbelivable. It is a true sleeper as the body style is under stated and there are not many on the road or track. I actually had a guy in a C-5 Corvette that got upset when I passed him and kept pulling ahead of him with 3 people in my car. He could not catch me let alone keep up.

You'd be hard pressed to find a more luxurious inviting interior in a car within this price range. It's smooth enough for daily commutes and long trips, and can hit you with the violence of all 400 Hp at any moment.

I first looked at what's under the hood..and boy it was beautiful. The engine itself was proably the size of the Goat's  trunk..Once I test drove the car, I realized that the pickup was incrediblely fast. The steering was responsive and tight.. However going over bumps knocked the car around a little bit. but how can I complain with 400 horses and 385 torque at a resonable price? I feel like a king driving around in the GTO.

I do a lot of driving with it and have taken it all the way up to the mountains of North Carolina from Miami and back. Not one issue except for a burned out brake light. The power is amazing. The suspension is taught and sporty but not as razor like as I would like. The trade-off though is a super comfortable ride. If GM could have put some bigger anti-sway bars and stiffened up the springs/shocks/struts just a tad bit...I would be in heaven. Overall, I am very impressed with the GTO inside and out. Sound system is a little weak and there are no dedicated doorlock buttons, but overall I love this car !",4.75

The interior is amazing, best in its class. It's rare to find a performance vehicle with a nice interior. Very comfy seats with a high quality look and feel. The GTO is a sheer thrill to drive.

Also it has  a larger tank at 18 gallons which takes up the trunk space.....the Australian version probably has a lot more room in the trunk.

Pontiac said it was our fault...seems like it uses oil like an old lawnmower. Actually folks, the secret internal memo to Pontiac tells them to warn customers of GTOs to check the oil every 500 miles. And, yes folks, this GTO even with a new motor (and that's a whole other story) burns 1 quart of oil every 500 miles. So check your dipsticks regularly. The big thing now is that there are NO part available for these Holdens.

The LS2 engine is a dream come true, 400hp right off the lot, and it was $25,000 to $30,000 cheaper than a Corvette. The suspension reminds me of a Bonneville or Park Avenue (to soft).

I am really, really pleased with the performance, handling and comfort of this Austailian/Chevrolet/Pontiac automobile and am convinced that a car with similar qualites from Mercedes or BMW or Nissan (M45) or Chevtolet (Corvette or SSR)would cost upwards of $45,000.00 - $60,000.00. I belive that it compares very favorably with the SRT- 8 Charger and 300C SRT-8 which cost arouind $ 10,000 more and can out perform some even more expensove cars.

I am very impressed with the new leftover 2005 GTO that I purchased in March. The car is great, powerful, soild, great handling and brakes. I've driven a 2005 Mustang GT 5 speed and was disappointed with the Mustang. The GTO is hands down a better car overall. It does come up short of the Mustang in two areas: #1. Exterior Styling is not quite on the mark. #2. the front seats are not as comfortible as the 05 Mustang GT's are.

It's a comfortable hiway car with a decent ride and maybe the best bucket seats I've found in an American car. Hiway gas mileage is pretty good (25 mpg for me) for a big coupe with a 6.0L V8. In town, it's a hog (12-14 mpg for me), and the ride is more brittle on rough pavement or in City driving. Acceleration is phenomenal, and braking is good for such a heavy car. Handling is acceptable given that this is a 3,800 pd coupe, not a tossabout roadster. Mechanically, the ""weakest link"" is an awful shifter for the 6- spd, gated way too wide and with a rubbery feel. Conclusion: Go fast in comfort, don't worry too much about gas mileage, & have fun!",4.25

Wow, what a car.  The build quality is excellent, it feels more like a european luxury car than a typical GM econobox.  I realize it costs close to 30K but I still think you are getting tons of quality for the money.  I like the interior better than I like the new MB E350 or CLK350. Handling is great for the size and weight involved.  After all it is a performance luxury coupe and not a bareboned racecar and yet still puts up great skidpad numbers. For the money you won't find better performance in a new car.  For right at 30K dollars you get a 400 hp engine that will pin you to the seat back.",4.875

Gut wrenching acceleration, great handling, good stereo, comfortable interior, quiet on the highway. An A+ for GM.",4.625

I have owned numerous ""fast cars""  Buick Grand Nationals, Mustang GT, as well as a 427 powered '67 Chevelle for old school muscle.  Nothing comapres to my GTO.  The fit and finish are outstanding for $30,000.  Oh and did I mention 400 HP?  Disappointments are few and far between...  Small trunk space, slow seat movement for rear seat ingress.  Who cares!  I didn't buy it to haul stuff in the trunk or the back seat.  Which by the way will fit a 6 foot tall passenger with ease once you do get the front seats out of the way.  Pontiac hit a home run with this bad boy.  If other car makers followed Pontiac's lead, I'd need a bigger garage!",5
