0, on 03/01/06 18:08 PM (PST),Chuck ,2005 Aston Martin DB9 Convertible Volante 2dr Convertible (5.9L 12cyl 6A),Understated Performance Car, It's a head turner but fun to drive even at longer distances.  Not as many on the road as the Ferrari. The convertible is a pleasure after having the DB7. I love the car.,4.375

I was originally skeptical about ordering an AstonM after their merger with Ford a year or few back and losing their designer to Jaguar. However, AstonM has not lost their edge. Soon as I started the car after its initial delivery, it purred so solidly (the only way to describe it). There was no way to say how getting in the car and whisking away, becoming the center of attention on the mediocre streets of reality feels.This car let loose effortlessly as I took off, tearing up the onramp going from 0-80 in only a few seconds.",4.5

At 150 mph you feel confident this could easily handle 200 mph! just not in the states!",5
3, on 11/09/06 23:48 PM (PST),T. Patrick ,2005 Aston Martin DB9 Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.9L 12cyl 6A),Simple fun with refinement," Great car! Fun to drive for a GT! If looking for sweet ride you can take anywhere, this is it. Comfortable and fun for long distant driving. Loves the road at high speed. Had no problems with car except for an occasional low tire warning and head-lights were replaced. They are automatic leveling and got stuck in down position. Replaced with no cost. Aston Martin Headquarters called to apologize personally for the inconvenience and gave me another Aston Martin until it was replaced. Interior is first rate with every convenience.",4.5

5, on 07/09/05 22:42 PM (PDT),sjc-dal ,2005 Aston Martin DB9 Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.9L 12cyl 6A),"Not one of the ""crowd"" anymore!"," I was driving an ""03 SL500 Sport.  I had ordered this silver beauty 1.5 years before they started arriving.  Really a nice car, but in North Dallas, I passed 13   Sl's in 2.5 miles to work...and 8 were silver. So...Aston Martin as a little more ""independent"" make.  I thought the beautiful but classic styling might blend in without causing the over-the-top hoopla of a Ferrari, or Lambo.  WRONG.  Everywhere I go it gets comments. I really rarely use the 900watt+ stereo, because I am hooked on the sound of the engine!    It IS hard to stay within speed limit. This car DEMANDS that you remain engaged   in your driving...even if just going to the closest 7-11. So far so good!",4.75

Aston Martin," Defintely the most beautiful car designed by Aston Martin so far ... and one that does not disappoint in terms of handling, engine power, or finishing. Owning the Aston DB9 is a pure pleasure and it gives me a thrill to see it from the vantage point of another car driving beside it. It is a sight for sore eyes on any day, and gives the driver fantastic control and responsivness. A perfect 10 !!",4.625

The DB9 was the dream car for me to own and it took me a good 2- 3 weeks to fully realize just what a splendid car I was driving. Sexy, elegant, powerful, responsive, distinctive and manly are just some of the adjectives I can attribute to this car. ",4.5

The most superb exhaust notes I've ever experienced.  The ONLY draw back I've found is a quirky automatic AC system that seems to have a little trouble keeping the cabin as cool as I select, but you can easily compensate by setting it a little bit cooler than you would normally.",4.75

10, on 02/13/09 14:35 PM (PST),astonman ,2008 Aston Martin DB9 Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.9L 12cyl 6A),World most amazing GT," I always wanted an Aston but wasn't sure of the build quality.  When I walked into the showroom the salesman urged me to just drive one and I was sold.  I could feel this was a solid car and I was right.  It has been the most reliable car I have ever owned and I have owned several exotics.  It is also the biggest head turner anywhere. Superb fit and finish.  Amazing engine, perfect wood grain, the finest leather.  Don't even think of comparing this in any way to the much lesser poser car the Vantage--the DB9 is a true Aston.  If you can afford it, buy it - you will be glad you did.",4.875
11, on 01/18/10 05:29 AM (PST),chippern73 ,2009 Aston Martin DB9 Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.9L 12cyl 6M),My First Luxury Sports Car," In December I purchased my first true sports car: Aston Martin DB9 2door coupe.  I was able to get it in black with black and grey interior.  To say the least, I was blown away!  I have never owned a fast car like this before.  I had to learn to drive all over again. Keeping it under the speed limit is the hardest thing to do when you can step ever so lightly on the gas peddle and have it up to 120 in no time.  The specs says 0-60 in 4.7 seconds, I'll tell you that its true.  Passing cars is a breeze.  They never know what hit them.  Great car and worth the price.",4.5

14, on 06/25/11 19:02 PM (PDT),meteoritedb9 ,2006 Aston Martin DB9 Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.9L 12cyl 6A),Prettiest Car on the Road, I bought my used '06 DB9 about 3 weeks ago with 1890 miles on it. Owning and AM has been a dream of mine & I'm thrilled that I decided to spring for one. I love this car! It is beautiful inside & out. The power is awesome and the experience of driving it is pure heaven. There's not a better looking car on the road.,4.875
15, on 07/29/06 19:36 PM (PDT),Richard ,2006 Aston Martin DB9 Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.9L 12cyl 6A),Superb long distance grand touring car," I was seeking a distinct and intensely pleasurable driving experience on my road test and wasn't disappointed. The car combines heft and agility with more performance than I need. Both the sound and smoothness of the engine are an experince to be savored and remembered. The fit and finish are exquisite (10+). The seats give great support. Most limitations relate to storage and are: small trunk space (luggage will be shipped), poor cup holder placement, a miniscule glove compartment. Poor local mile age (11.8 MPG)is also a compromise, but hwy milage is better than promised (21+). It's truly an uncommon beautiful car that makes a powerful and unique impression at any speed. It's worth the money!  ",4.75

It is fast, corners extremely well and is a real head turner. It may not be quite as fast as some super cars, but it is more comfortable and a joy to drive on long trips. Did I mention you also get a great deal of attention?",4.75

You can use it again and again. You will always be amused by the behavior of people when they see it. It is definItely the gentleman's supercar.",4.25

After driving this very rare and stylish car it is hard to find any manufacture that can match or exceed the Vanquish's potiental. Its smooth handeling and break-neck speeds make it one of the funnest cars to drive.

Its performance is great, power available all the time, and the perfectly weighted steering works excellently, and carves into the curves like a superbike. The 12-cylinder powerplant will offer Niagra-torque anytime anywhere. For a sports car, the rear vision and trunk space are also quite good. The interior is also luxurious and excellent. I have never purchased a new car before and I can see how great this modern machine is.",4.75

The build quality is better than any Mercedes, and the car feels so solid yet nimble on the road! I have been a new Ferrari buyer/owner since 1982, and a Bentley/Rolls buyer/ owner since 1987.

Must say that it's get up and go could be better, but is never any problem what so ever.  Talk about perfect in every aspect.

The 2006 has a nicer interior with more features than you can learn in a weekend.  Starting and driving this exotic muscle car produces the greatest sound.  Steering and ride are precise and comfortable.  It delivers choice in settings and although a little rough at low speed shifting for my wife.  Driving is effortless.

The interior is spacious (back seat is a little tight but works well) and beautifully crafted.I have had this car for over four years with no problems except a minor exhaust part. I have about 21000 miles of driving pleasure. It is beautiful to look at, has fantastic pipes and drives wonderfully.I bought the car used with 3500 miles. I have had my Rapide for five years and it is an outstanding vehicle. 23000 fun miles. No problems at all.Update 2/17. Car is still the best. It looks great and is a fun car to drive. Dynamic looks will keep it fresh for years to come. Prices have come down to a very affordable level.Still a magnificent car. Admirers always think it is a new model. Few people are familiar with the Rapide so that may be why it is thought of as a new model.Update 2/18. I like the car better than ever. It continues to perform wonderfully and it looks great. Prices for 2011, 2012 models are very reasonable.",5

It has excellent handling and it's sharp styling turns heads wherever it goes.  Compared to other sport coupes it gets excellent mpg and low cost of ownership.  My only regret about buying the DBS is that I wish I just got the DB9.  Except for some crome accents, rims and sport seats it is the exact same thing...Just a whole lot less!",4.875

I absolutely love driving it! Putting the top down and listening to the exhaust is pure bliss. Who needs a radio when you have this 4.7L V8 symphony? It's extremely comfortable, I've driven it hundreds of miles on day trips and never felt tired. The trunk space isn't much but it's plenty to fit my golf bag, shoes and backpack at the same time so it's good enough for me. The only real complaint I have about the car is the transmission. In auto mode and in normal driving it's slow and jerky but in sport with the throttle down it's much better.",4.25

I LOVE my car. It's a great weekend car. It's not as fast as most other exotics, and the ride quality is VERY stiff. Handling is exceptional, as is braking. It's an elegant, beautiful piece of machinery that produces smiles everywhere you go. You feel like you are driving something special and you feel special for doing so. I have had the car for approximately 9 months and put a little over 7,500 miles on it thus far (I acquired it with 3,242 miles). Mine is not a garage queen, but rather a work of art to be enjoyed. So far I have not had any mechanical issues with the car.",5
61, on 06/07/17 18:00 PM (PDT),James Rogers ,2015 Aston Martin V8 Vantage Coupe GT 2dr Coupe (4.7L 8cyl 6M),A great car for the right person," First, you should know that I bought this car used--barely!  It is a 2015 with only 6000 miles on it when I bought it.  Price was about 2/3 of new and the car seemed to be totally as new.  First owner owned it for a month and then traded it in (!); second owner five months.  Personally I plan to be buried in it!  Why did the other owners not seem to like the car?  My guess is the clutch, which is very difficult--just about like kicking a rock.  But I am in shape and have no real trouble with it, even in traffic, so it is not a problem for me.  This is a great driving car--more acceleration than you can use on public roads, super steering and brakes, wonderful road holding--but with that comes a quite stiff ride.  Despite the substantial beautiful engine sounds you can have a conversation with your passenger, no problem.  Storage is limited, and my car although it came with Bluetooth buttons has no Bluetooth!  Sound system is nice, navigation close to useless.  Overall though just a great car as long as you are OK with the clutch!  And what is really nice is the reaction of others to the car; they just love it and no one gives me the attitude you might get if you were driving a not-to-be-named Italian car.Update:  I am using this car as my daily driver, with no issues at all.  So far highly reliable and a genuine joy to drive and own.",5

When your about to drive home from a long, bad day at work, the comfort soothes you. The v8 vantage may be Aston Martin's most affordable vehicle and may be known as ""a poor man Aston Martin"" but its technology and luxury design tops many peoples lists and gets them raving, like me.",4.75
63, on 05/03/08 11:03 AM (PDT),kansashick ,2007 Aston Martin V8 Vantage Convertible Roadster 2dr Convertible (4.3L 8cyl 6M),Sportster Even More Fun," I traded my 2006 coupe for a leftover 2007 roadster and could not be happier. The '06 had several of the early production problems -- sorted out by AM nicely. This car, OTOH, is simply perfect. IMO, it looks even better than the coupe and the sportshift (once you get used to it) is even more fun than the manual and allows for even more aggressive driving on the twisties. The top fits well and the car is quiet with it up. Wind buffeting is not much of a problem top down.  I get even more thumps up and admiring looks in the roadster than in the coupe. This is a very special, very exclusive car. To the best of my knowledge. there are only three in KC and I have yet to see the other two. ",4.5

A gently pre-owned GT is the way to go. When new they were a relative bargain; used, it was a no-brainer for me. The fact that it's not the fastest for the money is of no consequence on public roads. You can still scare yourself silly if that's your goal. This car eats miles like no other I've been in including a friend's 911 GT3  and a 1964 Shelby FIA 289 Cobra (mine). This car cruises at 90 like the average car at 60 mph. The ride and the grip are amazing and the wind and road noise is low at speed. The exhaust note is wonderful especially with top down. You can drive a 600 mile day and not feel beat-up at the end. The quality of materials and the hand-craftsmanship is the icing on this very yummy cake! If it were 500 pounds lighter I wouldn't complain however the luxury touches would be compromised and I'm not ready to make it any less compelling a purchase. I'm not concerned with depreciation; this car is a keeper. I dare you to walk away without looking back; beauty never goes out of style!",4

It is very quick, handles extremely well, and is a treat just to sit in.  There is nothing quite like it in that regard. It is a thrill just to see it in the garage.  And it is a blast to drive.",4.375
66, on 03/09/10 17:35 PM (PST),Ken Jaggers ,2008 Aston Martin V8 Vantage Coupe 2dr Coupe (4.3L 8cyl 6M),Constant Transmission Problems," I loved the car for its curb and higway appeal. But both the manual and automatic transmissions were simply not reliable. I first had a 2007 standard transmission Vantage Coupe that stalled on a freeway or highway five times. After being frightened out of my mind, I was able to get the car to limp back to the dealer. It was a lemon, so Aston Martin replaced the car with a 2008 Vantage that was equipped with an Automatic Transmission. That transmission was always rough at the start of the day, with the vehicle shuddering at each stop. The dealer never recognized the problem and said I did not know how to drive the car. At considerable expense, I paid off the lease early and got rid of the car",3.75

The car is a perfect combination of beautifully styled aluminum, state-of-the-art technology and enough HP to raise your blood pressure more than enough for everyday driving.  It is a joy to drive as it is a highly responsive and compliant sports car.  You will pay a premium to get into an Aston.  But, hey, once you go past a four-banger econo-box its all a matter of personal preference, isnt it?

But none of that matters because when you drive this car you feel like the king of the road.  Sure, there are faster cars and more technologically advanced cars, but nothing gets attention like an Aston Martin, and it's attention with class.  It's not flashy like a Lambo or Lotus - it's all class, and the sound it makes is astounding!  The sound coming out of the exhaust is worth the cost of the car entirely! ",4.375

The key in my mind is that the Aston is pure motoring bliss.  It looks, feels, and sounds other-worldly, and is completely classy.

The Aston is a high performance car for sure with a reliable and truly excellent engine the rest does not live up. The road holding is OK and no problem on regular highway driving, but the suspension is an issue because there is no ""ABC"" feature that inspires confidence, so in fast and tight corners, an average driver will have to deal with a nervous car and will be more shaken than stirred. It is an unsophisticated car with a washboard ride, but I buy one again!",3.5

The clutch went out on it and it had to be picked up by a flatbed.  Dealer needs it for 10 days, the part has to be ordered from the U.K.  How do you ever trust a car again after it strands you.  I will sell it as soon as I get it back. In addition, the leather above the speedo / tach is coming off, you could actually see the staples that hold it down on the underside.

How right I was!!! While the Aston Martin Vantage 8 may not be the perfect car, you'd be hard pressed to convince me otherwise.   In my opinion the workmanship, performance, and curb appeal of this beast would stand up to any other make or model. The drop jaw good looks and driving experience makes this an investment worth every penny spent!  I recently showed it at a regional car show and even with more exotic models of Porches, Ferraris (sp), and others my Vantage drew the majority of the raves. Do yourself a favor: buy one!",4.75

The last 10 years I had 5 different Porsches including the latest 997 C2S. Exclusivity is the key. Porsches are extremely common and Astons are so special.

For me, this is the treasured prize. The quality of the interior and refinement of the exterior combined with the reliability I have experienced to date make this the finest auto I have ever owned.  One article described it best - it is 95% of the performance and 200% of the ""WOW"" factor of the Porsche Carrera.  The cornering and straight acceleration are a notch inferior to the Porsche, but the pride of ownership and fit and finish ar far superior than anything else.  Try it... you'll like it.",4.875

This car is quality and stunning in every way.  It exudes the fact that it is hand built from bumper to bumper.  The low growl when pressing the start button, and even much more so when reaching 4000 rpm, is exciting.  Some say the 380 horse power engine is not enough.  They must be on drugs because for a non-racer like me, it has plenty of responsiveness.  The amount of positive attention and accolades you receive in driving this car is often downright embarrassing.  I could write a book on overwhelming positive public reaction this car draws. ",4.625

I absolutely love the ride, the quality, and the beauty of the car.  I have owned Porsches, BMWs, and a Ferrari, so my expectations for the Aston were high.  I can say that the car has met and exceeded those expectations.  The biggest surprise has been the handling, which is better than I hoped. Although not as tight as the Carrera, it is extremely easy to drive the car on winding roads with lots of confidence.

Failing gearboxes, lack of torque and smouldering clutches followed by lamentable excuses for the lack of quality from AM technical people were some of the resons why I got rid of the car after eight months. A porsche 911 S with a sports exhaust and the sport chrono option is not as pretty as the V8 but will go quicker, be reliable, make noise, retain its value and is cheaper. Watch AM V8 residual values drop as the quality issues come to light.The car is slow, that is why everyone says it needs more torque.The build quality is not what you would expect.
