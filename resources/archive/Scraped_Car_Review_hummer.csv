0, on 03/17/11 17:53 PM (PDT),fantastic1 ,2010 HUMMER H3T Crew Cab Luxury 4dr Crew Cab 4WD SB (3.7L 5cyl 4A),Good Quality.," I have owned several pickups so far and believe this H3T is the best vehicle I have ever driven/owned.Outside looks are unique, build quality is superior to my 09 Tacoma or full size Dodge. I'm 6'6"", 274 and like to hike, kayak, camp, explore and hunt. The H3T has more room than the fullsize and better built than any smaller truck including the toyota. The H3T is a mid size, can tow enough and is comfortable for me.With 20,000 miles on it, I intend on keeping this vehicle for the next 15-20 years. With taller narrow tires and driving speed limit, I get 20 city mpg and 24 highway. Wish GM still built these but with a 5cyl diesel in it. GM bring it back please!!",4.75
1, on 02/21/17 11:48 AM (PST),Doug Sturdivant ,2009 HUMMER H3T Crew Cab Alpha 4dr Crew Cab 4WD SB (5.3L 8cyl 4A),Soon to be a Classic," This is my second Hummer. I previously had an '08 H3 and loved it but always wanted the 'T'. Being a limited production vehicle, I finally found one I could afford as the resale prices have started to rise. Like the one before, this also is an Alpha. Same color, Solar Flair. The smoothness and power of the V8 far outweighs anything you give back on fuel mileage. I've driven an I-5 equipped H3T and there's really no comparison. The size of the cargo bed is quite handy and really not an issue as I didn't purchase it for hauling large loads. That's not it's forte. Driving it does take some getting use though because the average truck has for more square feet of glass to look out of but when you get acclimated to the interior it's quite comfortable and the setting sun, because of the short overhang of the windscreen, is never an issue.  It could use more storage space and cup holders for the rear seat area. I do remember there was an insert available on my H3 for the back seat that had a cup holder in it. Don't know why that wasn't offered as standard equipment. Overall, I truly enjoy driving the truck. Chances are you'll never see another one at a stoplight. And just like the first series early Bronco's, these will only increase in value.",5

I have 2,659 miles on it.  This truck is very nice to drive however slightly uncomfortable for long drives as the driver's side leg room is awkward.  I find myself adjusting every 5 minutes.  The sound system is pretty good however my H2 has a Bose system that definitely sounds a ton better.  Speaking of which my H2's seats are like a Lazy Boy Recliner where as the H3T seats are not as cushy more firm not as wide.  The truck does drive very comfortably and handles extremely well in the snow.  My biggest gripe is that the EPA window sticker states 13 mpg  city 16 mpg highway.  At best I have gotten just under 13, and I drive mostly highway",4.25

It's my first truck and I was a little worried going from a sports car (Nissan 350z) to this, but so far I love it. Mine is black,the dealership threw on black Hummer rims, and this truck in black on black looks awesome. Not fast by any means, but thus far I'm getting about 420 miles on a tank with the i5 which is fine with me. Didn't get it to work on a farm or anything hardcore, but for running around the desert trails out here in Arizona it has been great.",4.625

This truck is amazing! Lots of room, handles great and with the 5 speed manual its super fun to drive. Build quality is great and I am getting much better gas mileage with the I5 then I used to get with the piggish 4.3 V6 in the Jimmy. Has enough power for my needs and off road or in snow this truck is a dream. To top it off having the pick up bed makes this truck so much more practical and useful. A+",4.5
12, on 12/26/08 20:07 PM (PST),David ,2009 HUMMER H3T Crew Cab 4dr Crew Cab 4WD SB (3.7L 5cyl 5M),Nice Truck!," I traded in an 08 Silverado crew cab for the H3T. I opted for the 5-speed manual and adventure package. This truck is a true pleasure to drive. The five cylinder has plenty of grunt and is at it's best when mated to the manual transmission. This is not a race car by any means though! The interior is nice and the seats are top notch. The mileage so far has been good, 16.5 mpg with mixed city/highway driving. This is better than what i averaged with the Silverado. The H3T benefits from the longer wheelbase (better ride) and the full size rear doors. We also own an H3 which helped seal the deal to purchase an H3T.  They are both unique vehicles that not everyone would appreciate.",5

The functional 5' bed, along with it's ability to haul 5 adults makes it quite a utilitarian rig. Pros: Exterior styling, level of optioning, quality of build, V8 power, 4X capability.  Cons: A little tight in the interior (i.e. 2 large guys sit pretty near shoulder-to-shoulder; rear legroom is quite cramped), no lock on tailgate, gas mileage (i.e. The best I have obtained is 12 city; 14 hwy), weak auto shift b/t 3rd & 4th gear. All noted, as a truck/SUV guy, I can not think of a vehicle in this price range that compares. Given the mid price point, you get what you pay for...perhaps even a little more.",4.125

When I reached the 100k I took it to the mechanic asking to check it for any maintenance since the mileage of the car and basically just replaced the spark plugs. Nothing else. I change my first set of pads (brake pads, no rotors} on 110k miles on the front wheels, and on 130k miles on the rear wheels. Just had to believe but true. Sold it on 2013 with over 170k miles and running perfect. I missed it so much that I just bought my second h3 a month ago same year with just over 100k miles. Took it to the dealer to do whatever needed to have the peace of mind and runs incredible smooth (even better that my last one since I put four new Michelin on this one). Super smooth ride and very happy with it. I m just buying all the option that I used to have on my first one. I recommend this suv to anyone. The look is great, the comfort, the driving position, everything. Some complaint for poor visibility but with big rear mirrors as it has and back up camera that I added I feel very confident parking or anything. Not very powerful acceleration but small engine gives you better MPG so something has to give up. Anyway is enough power for everyday needs.",5

I bought the vehicle used in 2009 with approximately 30K miles and an existing factory warranty. Hands down this is the best SUV I've ever owned.  It's extremely comfortable, performs as needed and has been nothing but reliable.  I've never had anything other than routine maintenance performed (knock on wood).  My only complaint (if I had to give one) is that it doesn't have a ton of cargo space.  My wife and I didn't have any children when we bought the car.  However, we recently had our second child, and with double strollers, etc. are in need of a bigger SUV.  However, I am not going to trade or sell the H3;   I'll be keeping it forever!",4.625

Every one gave me hell about having a hummer but I loved it. Driving it makes you feel like a kid driving a tonka toy. The Mpg's where average for its class 18-22 mixed driving. It was comfortable on short and long drives.It never gave me any issues and it never got me stuck off road. If your debating between an h3 or a wrangler, get a h3. You get more for the money and insurance is less. You get better Mpg's and a nice comfy ride when you're not plowing through the woods or mountains. It's a solid ride.",4

39, on 05/03/10 03:08 AM (PDT),hummerfan ,2006 HUMMER H3 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (3.5L 5cyl 5M),Nothing Comes Close , Bought the vehicle used but fell in love with it ever since I test drove it. No other SUV will give you more driving power than the Hummer. It's certainly a head turner and no doubt be ruling the lanes (if you signal and make a lane change) cars beside you will yield to you (That's the fun part of it). Though I have had some problems with the sun roof drainage system which gets clogged when you go off road and cause a mess INSIDE the passenger side and gets it all wet. But you can clean it out easily with low pressure air blown at it. definitely an envy during the winter or winter storm season. Every vehicle gets stuck will wish to be in your ride. ,4.5

It is flawless in snow and mud..goes anywhere you want.  While it has been dependable, it has also been irritating at times.  The passenger compartment is too cramped.  It is a fight to get my arm between the seat and the door to adjust the seat.  The heated seat buttons are hard to reach on bottom of seat.  It would have been so much better to have them on the dash.  A baby seat behind my wife's seat barely leaves her enough room to be comfortable, knees on dash.  Despite negative comments, we both still like it.  We have rescued stranded friends and pulled tree stumps out of yards with no problems.  We would buy it again.",3.5

I feel cramped when I drive it. (I didn't choose this car, my parents did.) The windows are too small, the seats are hard to adjust, and the area is not spacious what so ever. The tiny 3.5 inline-5 doesn't perform to my expectations. Its slow, bulky, and when I go in the mud, it covers it in mud, (The mud flaps are a must). The CD player doesn't play homemade CD's, which really irritates me, so I must spend $300 on a new iPod. I am very disappointed with Hummer and GM for making this car so small.

Giving the consideration to the 5 cylinder Engine it is forgivable. 2009 Alpha would be better with V8, but then it is far too expensive. Strangely I liked the fabric seats better than leather.

When I first heard of the H3 I felt it wasn't going to be ""manly"" enough for me, but the first time I drove it, the car changed my mind completely. It's extremely spacious, and the interior is perfect for it's off-road, military look; yet it's very modern and designed well for the not-so military-type. Speakers are great as well as the subs.

86, on 03/31/16 17:41 PM (PDT),C Elliott ,2007 HUMMER H3 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (3.7L 5cyl 5M),My Wrangler is getting JEALOUS..!," I really wasn't in the market for another vehicle, but when my wife kept up how she found the ""perfect"" vehicle for me I went for a look-see.  That said, my Wrangler YJ is sitting outside getting jealous, as I haven't driven it since getting my H3.  Regardless of others reviews, it is a true ""Hummer"" tried and true, just in a slightly smaller package.  Weighing in at 5,885 lbs it has a very solid drive feel, but is extremely nimble when cornering or having to maneuver through traffic.  The exterior draws looks in parking lots and I've had people come up and say, ""I didn't know that they still made these?"".  That's when my pride shows through as I tell them it's a 2007.  On the mechanical side the 5 cyl engine coupled with the 5 speed Automatic gives peppy performance for such a heavy vehicle.  If it had a larger V6, well that would have been nice, but I've had it on the highway up to 85 without any issue.  Mileage is what should be expected for a ""tank"" of an SUV and I go nearly 410 miles on a 23 gal tank, so 16-18 mpg.  With the off road package it has two locked diff settings one 4W Hi / one 4W Lo and take it from me 4W Lo will take you ANYWHERE you dare to go.  Approach and side slope angles are better than the Wrangler as it has a lower center of gravity given the short windows.  Interior comfort is great with deep, contoured seats in front (mine are charcoal/tan bulletproof cloth) and reasonably deep seats in the rear.  Truly, won't use them as ""NO KIDS"" so they will spend time flipped and folded which is a great little feature giving more room to the cargo area.  Overall, I wouldn't trade my H3, unless that is they do start making them here in the USA again.!",5

H3 is locked and loaded to take on the street or off road.   Bottom line, if you are into towing weight, buy a diesel pickup.  If you want acceleration, buy a performance vehicle.  If you want a tough, fuel efficient, SUV, buy a H3.   Weve owned it all, Excursion, Jeep Wrangler, Ford Explorer, GMC Sierra K2500 Duramax, Jag, Vet, BMW, and the H3  rocks them all.

Don't be foolish and buy new... you can buy a certified used for about 20K less and have the same warranty without the depreciation. I bought mine loaded with only 10K miles for $39K MSRP was $58K. Enough said. The drive and comfort can't be compared to any other vehicle. I get 13.5 MPG around town and was only getting 15 with MY H-3.

I have owned many 4x4 vehicles including Toyota and Jeep and this Hummer is the best combination of everything a person would want. Don't mind the gas mileage. It gets only two to three MPG worse than the Yukon XL I have with the same engine. The fun factor is worth the extra dollars spent on gas.

I was seeing 10mpg for the Qx56 and 9 mpg for the H1. My new H2 averages 11mpg city and as high as 18 on highway at 60mpg. This truck really is fun to drive. The touch screen nav,large sunroof,Xm radio,heated seats,power mirrors really make this truck a pleasure to drive.

I upgraded the features a few times such as radio, dvd player, rear sensors with camera, gps, etc  I tried to be proactive about maintaining my Hummer and I would say I spent a little $10000 taking with maintenance and repairs over 10 years.  Not bad.  Every year I wonder if I should trade this in, but honestly there is still nothing better than my Hummer.  Sure the gas sucks, but you got to pay to play.   Parking can be a challenge at times but the comfort in driving is still incredible.  And you can't beat that spacious back.

They look as if they are trying to see what guy is driving and they pull up and see it's a girl!!!!!! So funny and everywhere I go men always comment on its uniqueness. I absolutely love my H2. I feel very safe and it is much more comfortable than I could have ever imagined. When I first took it for a test drive I was somewhat intimidated by the size of the vehicle and knew that it would feel bulky. To my surprise it was the smoothest ride and I felt as if I was sitting on my living room couch! Maneuvering the vehicle was mind blowing as well! Changing lanes and turns to me are no different from a car. There is a blind spot but an easy fix! Buy one of the small mirrors that can be placed on the rear view mirrors! Of course the gas mileage is not the greatest but we don't purchase Hummers for fuel efficiency! I am a true H2 fan and when it need to be fed, I am feeding her no matter the cost! Since I've had my truck the only thing I have had to replace is the battery due to my after factory remote car starter and alarm draining it. Other than that I have had no problems! I put synthetic oil in and periodically have the mechanics check for any issues!. I put it on the road from Michigan to Atlanta about 6 months ago and it performed like a trooper and luckily during that time the gas prices dropped dramatically so I was good!

I saw one at test track in Disney's Epcot, then rented one in Denver. I was amazed at the changes. As a result of being so impressed, I recently purchased a new 2008 lux model, had the dealership add chrome bits from the trade-in, and I love it.
