0, on 08/05/18 06:43 AM (PDT),Gary ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Still  a lot the improvement to be done. Overprice, Car is extremely overpriced. Some models do not have spare tires and  you can not get one. They charge for color brakes. Ridiculous. Overall car can not compete with Q5 and X3,2

2, on 06/26/18 16:50 PM (PDT),steve engles ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),This is THE SUV to drive!," After doing a ton of research from car sites, car magazines, owner reviews, I took a test drive and was hooked.  The Stelvio turns heads---as you pass other cars on the freeway--or in parking lots.  If you use the Dynamic mode, you will witness ""Star Trek"" in this SUV......it moves!   But, if you use Eco Mode, OK, a little slower but saves on gas (premium only).  DON'T buy a base model--there are cool extras (safety, rims, trim, nav, moon roof, etc) that cost a little more but WORTH every penny on the Ti and Sport models.  I have 2500 miles after only 60 days of driving and can honestly say "" this is one of the best cars I've EVER owned ""  and will trade this 2018 in on the next Stelvio version.  Only drawback--you may have to really look for your desired Stelvio with the equipt you want-----they are not plentiful , especially in the western US.",5
3, on 06/25/18 20:34 PM (PDT),Alexis ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Amazing bang for the buck!, This is a luxury SUV that drives an handles like a sports car!  It is one of the sharpest looking SUVs on the market.  The exterior and interior design are top notch.  I have the beautiful metallic green exterior with tan leather interior with the sport seats.  They are supportive and very comfortable. The interior is well insulated with minimal road noise.  This SUV takes off like a rocket so merging onto the Interstate where everybody is doing 75-80 mph is not a problem. I enjoy driving this vehicle even more than the 370Z Nismo I used to own and that is quite a complement. The only thing I can even think of to improve upon the Stelvio is that I wish I have a few more presets under the favorites section of the radio but it is so easy to browse and select other stations that is a very minor thing.  The visibility is excellent and since the Stelvio is so responsive I feel very safe while driving it. I made an excellent decision when I decided to lease this car.  I will probably buy it at the end of the lease unless I decide to get the new Guillia coupe coming out in late 2019.  I love Alfa Romeo and it sister company Fiat.,5

Actually it's not bad at all. Similar to Audi Q5, bigger than Mercedes GLC, Land rover Discovery Sports.  The bigger SUVs with more cargo space are Mercedes GLE , BMW X5, Land Rover Velar. Those are much bigger SUVs with much worse Gas mileages, and also will cost you much more ! Plus, they do not have the Stelvio's ENGINE , Handling, and the "" Look "" !!

The salesman got confused sometimes. Ti got spacial wood trims. One thing I like to point out : there is no place for the front license place. The NJ / NY law requires two plates, one for the front, another one for the back. My sales lady said that all buyers so far are taking their chances. ( by leaving one plate inside.)",5

I got the tropheo white with red interiors. It truly is a delight to your eyes. Not a big fan of their infotainment/ navigation system. It seems a bit dated for the car. Handling is decent. I wish if the had a six cylinder with output in the 300s. The sport seats really have you tucked in. The rear view would take time to get used to. ,5
9, on 05/02/18 13:53 PM (PDT),Joe M ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Alfa Stelvio all the way to go, If you are looking for a plain and simple looking and performing vehicle forget about getting the Alfa Romeo Stelvio. The vehicle is quick with the 8 speed automatic transmission around town and is very impressive looking. I am sure it will be the best vehicle I ever had. If you have the bucks get the Quadrofoglio. With over 500 HP it is currently the fastest SUV on the road.,5
10, on 04/28/18 14:48 PM (PDT),Lloyd ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Alfa is here to stay-a blast to drive," Alfa Romeo has hit a home run with both the Stelvio and Giulia. I was going to lease another BMW 3 series x drive but the salesman was so pushy and annoying I decided to give Alfa Romeo a look. I was impressed with the looks of the Stelvio. A few days before I had test driven the Lexus NX 300 and while it drove OK I did not like the looks of the front grill-big mistake on Lexus' part. I leased a Stelvio, with Navigation--The vehicle comes with a lot of standard features and is priced well. Simply put, it handles great. It is fast and has no body lean on the turns. The breaking is a tad too responsive so it takes a bit of getting used to but this is a minor quibble. The steering is sharp, precise and smooth. I am glad I got out of the BMW as the Stelvio seats are way more comfortable. Also, the front cabin is roomy and has great headroom. My only complaint with the vehicle so far is that the radio has only 7 presets and the Satellite radio does not maintain the group of channels when one station is selected. I will give a nod to the BMW radio setup in that if I was listening to the comedy channels on the Satellite radio, the screen would maintain those channels so I could switch back and forth easily--the Stelvio only has one station listed and defaults back to the beginning if you want to browse through the stations. Otherwise, it is better in every respect and is a joy to drive. I took the car in for a service check and got the Giulia as a loaner. It too handles unbelievably well. It accelerates with no effort. It is makes driving fun again and I would have been happy if I had leased this car--I highly recommend either car and they price out very well compared to the competition. Bravo ALFA",5
11, on 04/18/18 08:40 AM (PDT),stephen smith ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),sports car suv," The stelvio handles great.  Like the other cars I have had, the controls (nav, radio, phone etc.) need getting used to.  Considering the professional  reviews, I think the interior is better than was reviewed.  The front seats have a sports car fit and the leather seems very good.  The electric brakes take a little getting used to as does the adaptive cruise control.  I keep getting stopped to complement me on the car, so that's nice.",4
12, on 03/29/18 21:09 PM (PDT),k2002 ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),You should indulge in Alfa," If you need an SUV for you to indulge and drive hard then do yourself a favor and get the Stelvio. The front two seats on the sport trim with bolsters are the best. I tested out a GLC AMG43 and a X3 M40i, they are great cars and maybe a step above the base Stelvio but also cost a lot more...for the money and with current offers Stelvio is a steal. Love the precise steering, acceleration, and braking (will take time getting used to as its electronic). The red interior stands out compared to the other options. This is a better driving and handling suv than the regular X3, GLC, and Macan.  If you get the sport, the ride could be a little stiff and passengers in the back seat could complain that its bumpy if the roads are less than perfect. Get it for the sport more than the utility and luxury. I am finding more excuses to drive and its been a while since driving was this fun.",5

Lots of compliments! Much more fun to drive than the BMW. Simple logical controls. Love the interior aesthetics. Was concerned about the perceived reliability and quality. So far no issues at all. Only complaint is that the voice commands don’t work as well- perhaps I need to learn Italian. The infotainment system is also slower to respond than the BMW. It is so much more entertaining to drive that I don’t mind a bit. It’s also nice that it is unique as opposed to the sea of German and Japanese models out there. Exclusivity was not a factor in the purchase decision, but it is nice not to have the 8th Q5 in the parking lot.",5
14, on 03/22/18 14:18 PM (PDT),RR ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Stelvio Bellisimo...," After what seemed an exhaustive search for a sporty SUV to replace our aging, parts consuming 06' Cayenne, we drove a Stelvio. In a word, Awesome! Despite the subtle marketing, lackluster dealership attention and our own time crunch, the car sold itself. It is a quantum leap in ""bang for buck"" (and I mean bang!) value above the BMW, Volvo, GMC, Audi and even the new Cayenne. After 3 months of driving in town and freeway we get 24mpg in the ""A"" mode and less in ""D"", but that's the sport in this sport SUV. It's a well rounded, family utility, yet fun sports car all in one. Don't believe me? Drive one! Highly recommended!",5
15, on 03/08/18 23:08 PM (PST),LeeF ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),a driver's compact SUV," I read just about every review I could find on the Stelio. The I test drove it 2 times. For the most part, I agree with most of the critics: as far as SUVs go, this thing is a blast to drive (I moved from an Audi A3 and A4), with the ground clearance that makes you not have to worry about dragging on that curb or speed bump.  My fear is that Fiat Chrysler may have made an error by picking a Ferrari guy for this project.  What I mean is, to make a best selling SUV (which I understand to have been their goal) you probably need to prioritize things like space, back seat room, luxe finishes, the latest tech, etc.  Only car guys care that they're driving a 2 liter aluminum engine with a carbon fiber drive shaft for under $50K!  My priorities were probably more aligned with those engineers, which is why I decided to go with the Stelvio.  I wanted a great handling SUV (for ground clearance and better visibility) with a great sounding stereo (I think the Harmon Kardon premium system beats my Audi's Bang & Olufsen premium sound in the Audi).  My 2 small dogs typically occupy the back seat and the not-so-huge trunk passed the Costco test last weekend when we bought toilet paper, paper towels, water softener and various groceries that all fit in the back!   Admittedly, it does not have the room or the sweet note of the supercharged V6 in the Jaguar F-Pace ($20-$30K more) and I have not driven the Porsche Macan because it $30K more (similarly equipped).  My vehicle was loaded with just about every option and in the TiSport trim but was discounted almost $10K below MSRP (to around $43K).  For that price, it was a no brainer!",4
16, on 03/06/18 17:16 PM (PST),Nathan K. ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),The SUV that zings!," This is one of the most fun cars I've ever driven.  I've had a 911, a 3 series BMW, and X3, and a Hyundai Genesis 3.8 HTrac, and the Stelvio has such spirited driving.  I look forward to getting into the car and going.  It has a great shape.  It is stylish, it has some utility, and it is down right fast in dynamic mode.  Love it!",5
17, on 03/05/18 00:47 AM (PST),Dave ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Performance minded," Bought a fully loaded Stelvio sport 280hp for my wife and helped parents buy an F-Pace 25t fully loaded. For slightly different reasons each vehicle is the right choice. While excellent discounts are available for the Alfa Stelvio, they are not for the Jag F-Pace. If sport driving experience is your #1 purchase reason, buy the Stelvio. It has an amazing lightweight, nimble handling, power and road feel you may not find on another vehicle. The F-pace is also sporty and fun to race even with the base engine but is a more luxury sport (Jag) feel. It is beautiful from every angles and has better infotainment and Nav. The Stelvio's layout  of interior and infotainment matches its sport character. Both vehicles are too new to rate reliability but only the Jag had an initial plastic part needing refit so far. Quality on both look good. Had 3 weeks of hard rain, and I could not wait to get the Stelvio back on wet roads. I can't believe the traction, and the feeling of confidence I had in that terrible weather. So far I've put 2/3rds of the miles on her car, and she is starting to complain.  Getting good MPG for a lead foot.",5
18, on 02/27/18 17:20 PM (PST),Domenico ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti Sport 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),"Love the Car, but there something you must know"," I bought this car to replace a Maserati Quattroporte, my back was asking me to do it. I fell in love with the reviews, the design and the fact that I was moving to another Italian car, although an SUV, believe me it drives like a sport car. However, I do a lot of business in the car and must say that the failure to have been informed that Stelvios built before December 2017 come with Apple Car Play was very disappointing. Th e dealer in Van Buys CA never said a word about this, and the owner’s  manual in the car is not much help either. They do have the instructions about Apple Car Play but they are basically useless, make believ, as the feature in not available, unless you purchase a Stelvio built from December 17 and on. Worst yet, when you call Alfa Romeo (forget the dealer as they got your money) they tell you that there’s nothing they can do about it, even though the instructions are in the owner’s manual. And to add insult to injury, they even tell you that there’s no plan for an update to your system either, so you have what you got and that’s it. I love the car, so I will cope and figure it out, but I feel other buyers who have a need for Siri in the car to work and assist while driving, need to know that he/she will not be there, if you are purchasing a vehicle before December 2017.",4
19, on 02/07/18 12:53 PM (PST),Morgan ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV Ti 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Fast if you are into that type of thing," This is a great driving SUV.  It feels like driving a sports sedan but has more trunk space and sits up higher.  It is fast and fun to drive.  It doesn't take bumps as kindly as typical SUV, but then again if you wanted a typical SUV then you wouldn't buy this car.   I wanted a sports car and my wife wanted an SUV.  This has been a great compromise, especially because it handles the potholes here in the northeast WAY better than our Mercedes sedan did.   General drawbacks - Some features feel a bit cheap in a way Mercedes would never have skimped.  Specific drawbacks 1. some nobs feel cheap 2. heat seats are more like seat warmers, not hot or fast. 3 back up camera feels pretty 2012 not 2017 4. parking sensors are a bit sluggish and not as accurate as I would like.  Overall this car is a beast and I love it.",5

We were ready to pull the trigger on an XC60 but when we looked into the Stelvio, it checked off all of the boxes for both of us in terms of luxury, performance, and ride/features both right-brain and left-brain. Carve a few curves in Dynamic mode and you'll see why! Stelvio is well-equipped out of the wrapper and obviously designed with attention to detail and elegant engineering, yet full of 'surprise and delight' features- example memory seats, theater lighting, alarm system, puddle lights, , auto climate (nice, quiet, unobtrusive fan), 290 hp, AWD and more. I appreciated that you aren't forced into lots of expensive packages to get the few things you want. She loves the understated luxury and we both flipped for the rich chocolate brown interior.  Interior room within inches of XC60 (actually larger cargo area). The joy of ownership to me is more than contrived and emotionless design- this vehicle is truly art in motion and a beautifully and elegantly designed machine!",5

I am really enjoying this SUV like no other, it performs like a sports car, and rides like a luxury sedan.  Never thought I would own an Alpha Romeo, but they really did their home work on these vehicles.  I still have a 9-11 Porsche and have owned a couple of them over the past 18 years, this vehicle may be more fun than driving the Porsche, I'm torn on this one, it is that good.  If any one is thinking of buying a vehicle in this category , you really need to drive this one, it is fast, handles like crazy, solidly made and great looking.

They almost scared me off from the Stelvio. But I bought one and WOW what a vehicle. It's incredible. Skip BMW get an Alfa. No fake leather in an Alfa.

Before I bought this car I drove Audi Q5, Jaguar Fpace and Mercedes GLC. Stelvio beats all of them in styling something new it’s fresh u prolly never seen something like this on the road. Wherever u go people stare at the car. It’s fun to drive. If u really want luxury feeling get the red interior it’s makes lot of different. Can’t say much about reliability yet since I have the car for only 2 weeks. I would say one thing if u really looking for luxury compact SUV give this one a try and I bet u will take Stelvio home with u. I’m looking forward to Alfa Romeo see what they have for future so I can have another Alfa when this lease ends.",5
25, on 09/30/17 17:18 PM (PDT),H. Meltzer ,2018 Alfa Romeo Stelvio SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),The New Stelvio," I've had the car for two weeks now and, so far, I am very satisfyed.  It is a very good looking and handling car.  The interior is not full of bells and whistles, which I like.  Not a lot of buttons.  Everything is logically layed out.  Comfortable seats and a comfortable ride which could be turned into a sporty ride with the turn of a knob.  Some nitpicks: There are only 7 presets on the radio - in total.  My last car had over 20 presets.  The voice activation does not work for the phone.  It seems that the early batches of Stelvios do not come equiped with Apply Play or Android.  All phone calls have to be made manually - not through any voice activation.  I called Alfa Romeo to ask if when the software became available, would I be able to download it onto my car.  They didn't know, so, my feeling is that I won't be able to.  Not happy about that.  The view out of the back is a bit limited but that is not surprising as the ""swooping"" design of the rear of the car is one of the things I liked about it.  Because of this, the safety package is something you should consider.  The dashboard view of the backup camera should be larger and it seems that it should be a bit brighter or have a higher resolution.  Again, these are some nitpicks on a SUV that I am very happy with.",5

28, on 03/17/16 21:54 PM (PDT),bob ,2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe 2dr Coupe (1.7L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),"If you like 80's exotics, this car is for you."," It's been said before -- this car is not for everyone.  But, if you love driving a light, tight, awesome looking, sensory overkill fast sports car, this is your vehicle.  The 4c is unlike anything else on the road today -- and thank heavens for it.  Now, if you want comfort, quiet, listening to your tunes while drinking a latte, and wanting to be unseen when puttering around town, then this is not your car.  Enjoy your Lexus.Pros:  Just a blast to drive.  Its ""honest"" which in itself is unique today.  Nothing is covered up or added simply to fool anyone.  It's the real deal, not fake.  It's exciting, refreshing and unlike any other car made today.  It's obviously hand built and fit and finish is better than most exotics. The beautiful carbon fibre interior will make your eyes water every time you look inside.   The noise from the turbo charger waste gates will make you laugh out loud. It sounds a like 80's rally cars and seems to go like one as well.  Performance is more than fine for city streets.  You can floor it and run it through the gears without being tossed in jail.  The F1 style gearbox works remarkably well -- better than a Ferrari F430.What's also surprised me is how reliable it has been.  In a year of ownership, not one thing has gone wrong.   To say I was expecting something different is an understatement.And the car is just beautiful, along with being completely unique. If you want people to look at you, buy this car.  Between the noise and the looks you'll be a rock star on the boulevard.  Service is also very reasonable.  Yearly service on the car is only $240.  Try that in a Ferrari or Lamborghini.Cons:  Ok, it's noisy,  And the wide body and doors do make it difficult to park in a normal parking space.  And it's a pain to get in and out of.  And it's a bit difficult to see out the back of. And the trunk is ridiculously small.  And the trunk latch is in a silly place.  And the seats are tight. And the seats don't move a lot. And the seat belt warning buzzer is annoying.  And it has no GPS. And the seat belts rub against your neck.  And there's no glove box.  And there's these silly wires coming out from under the dash to charge your phone.  And the cup holders don't hold larger drinks. And it has some turbo lag. And if you want to put things in the trunk, you have to put them on the ground first because you need both hands to open and latch the rear lid. And it has no power steering so parking can require some actual muscle use.  And if you're over 6 foot 3 you're going to say it's too small.  And if you're too wide the seats are going to be uncomfortable.  And it doesn't come with a manual gearbox.  And there's no climate control. And the Parrot radio is a complete joke.So if the Cons have turned you off by now, then you know this car is not for you.  But if you love the idea of driving an 80's exotic with all of it's drama, feel, personality and looks BUT with AC and brakes that actually work in a car that doesn't fall apart before your eyes and is reasonably affordable to own, then this car is for you.I personally love it.  You can thrash it unlike you can other more expensive sports cars and it only costs about the same as the 10,000 Corvette C7's you see everyday.Thank heavens for Alfa Romeo. Someone was nutty enough to make a car a real drivers car today that doesn't seem like every other car you drive.  I don't think we will ever see anything like it again that us normal folk can afford.  Its a modern classic with a classic personality.  Now, how cool is that?",4

The best comment I ever heard that perfectly describes the 4C was by a mom who asked if her son could go over and look at my ""Hot Wheels"" car.  That captures the essence of the 4C.  It will bring out the kid inside of you!",5
30, on 01/20/16 05:38 AM (PST),bruinnut ,2015 Alfa Romeo 4C Coupe Launch Edition 2dr Coupe (1.7L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),A true exotic that you need to drive to believe," This car is not for everyone. It is not for those who want to drive a ubiquitous people mover from point A to point B. It is not for those who want to be in a cocoon separated from the road and without feel for the spirit of enjoyment on the road. But if you want a car that inspires, that will keep a smile on your face, that allows you to understand the relationship between road and machine in the most intimate and spirited detail, then the Alfa Romeo 4C is the only car south of $300k that will punch your ticket. The 4C is beautiful and masterful inside and out. The cockpit is made entirely of carbon fiber. The panels are made of high strength and lightweight sheet moulding compound. The engine is a highly tuned turbocharged 4 cylinder mid-mounted masterpiece, that delivers a cacophony of sounds that will let the driver know exactly how much fun it is having. The gearbox is a choice of paddle shifters or automatic, with a driver-selected all weather, normal, dynamic, or race mode. The cockpit is made for the driver. The controls are tilted to the left; the steering wheel is not a joystick with volume controls, bluetooth buttons, navigation, or cruise control. It is made to steer and to allow you to easily shift gears.  The seats are firm, comfortable, and supportive. If you want a bunch of buttons to move it up and down, inflate a back bolster, or cradle you with cushions, circulating air, and heat, look elsewhere. If you want simple and comfortable functionality, then this seat is perfect.When on a drive, please plan extra time for taking the long way home, to the office, to the gas station, or anywhere else. You'll want to take that extra turn to stay behind the wheel. And when you park it or stop to get gas or groceries, get ready for folks you don't know to spill out and engage you in conversation as they daydream about driving your car. Yes, it is that amazing.Update after 9 months of ownership:  The 4C still puts a smile on my face every time I start it up. I've taken some day-long trips and the supercar has performed flawlessly. So far, there have been no technical or mechanical issues with the vehicle. The 4C is a rare vehicle and will certainly continue to turn heads for years to come, both for its sheer beauty and design, but also because it will prove to be a timeless sportscar. By the way, the 4C won't be around for ever. If you want to experience a true supercar at a BMW coupe price, now's the time.",5

It’s top of the line. Engine is flawless. I would say if you own a Quadrifoglio you would agree that it feels more like a $200,000 car than an $85,000 car. I have Porsche owners come up to me and surprisingly tell me that the q.v. is faster than their Porsche. Not the 911 turbo of course. It eats M3s, AMGs and just about every other car you would see in a normal everyday drive. There is absolutely not a single car that could match the performance of the Alfa and still cost less than $150k. Molto bene! If your looking for an actual engine performance car then there is nothing close. Is the interior as nice as a Bentley?  No. Does it handle good in snow? No. But niether does 99% of the cars that are sub 4 seconds 0-60. It’s got 510 HP...Why is Alfa being judged harshly to such a high standard when BMW and Mercedes have had a 30 year head start and just got punked in Alfa’s first production of saloon cars?

I loved the car when I drove it and was terrified of reliability. So I got a short (24 month) lease. I've got 3K miles and the car has been flawless. Solid, fast and quiet. Not a squeak, smell or rattle. I know 3K is still early but I have been reassured that there haven't been ""little"" issues that might be leading indicators of future bigger problems. Beyond that the car is a joy to drive and so fun to be around. My neighbors think its exotic and wonder if I won the lottery (they have no idea that my lease is in Honda Accord range). Downsides? The non-sport seats are a bit unsupportive and the navigation is outdated (so I use Google Maps via Android Auto). Other than nav the infotainment isn't bad (although Audi is better). Sensor features like adaptive cruise control are surprisingly good (I sort of figured Alfa wouldn't do that well). Front collision sensor is a little too sensitive but that's minor.

The last 7000 miles have been flawless  (9000 overall).  It's my second Alfa and being Italian, reliability issues are expected.  I will say this though, my wife's Mercedes has had five service trips in the first 20k miles, including four recalls and brakes replaced under warranty.  From my experience, the Mercedes has been less reliable than the Alfa.  I read an earlier post about the sunroof, mine has stopped several times but is easily fixed...the fix is easily found online and takes about a minute to reset.

My Giulia is my 15th car in 23 years.  I had been researching for months a replacement for my E350.  I have had all the Germans and a few Asian cars along the way, nothing like my Alfa.  It goes like hell, turn the wheel and it follow your lead.  So much power, yet very efficient.  My local dealer was running great lease deals and until the Alfa I have not ever leased. Went to the dealer late on a Saturday night and drove the Giuila and Stelvio back to back, it was game over. I don't recall the last car I had that was so much fun to drive. I also love that it is unique and few others have them.  Also appreciate that with a couple of packages it as all I need and the standards list is long.  It has leather seats for example that so many of the competing cars offer at a hefty cost if at all. I am also a big guy over 6' and have ample legroom and am very comfortable inside. Within a week, my huge panoramic moonroof decided it was not going to open anymore.  Took a week to get appointment at the dealer.  The dealer does not offer loaners which made me apprehensive but they made the repair and had me on my way in a couple of hours with a wash.  Few weeks back, went to leave in the morning and the trunk would not even open, the car was dead.  Alfa customer service was very nice, tow truck came and jumped the car.  I have not ever had to call roadside let alone be stranded by a car and was very angry about it.  Headed to the dealer, they could not find anything wrong, washed the car and had me on the way.  As soon as I opened the roof and got some music going on the fantastic Harman Kardon system, I could not stop smiling.  The car is quirky but has so much character.  The Mercedes dealer where my last car was serviced was so nice, fantastic service, appointments within hours as needed, free loaners and free car washes 5 days a week.  The Alfa dealer is nowhere near that caliber but they are trying very hard and it is evident those who work there are passionate about the cars.  If in the market for a sport sedan or SUV, go drive the Alfas, you will not be disappointed.",5
37, on 03/26/18 14:09 PM (PDT),AlfaOut ,2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan Ti Sport 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),"The Good, the Bad, the Alfa"," If you want a flat-out sports sedan, and worry about nothing else, this is 100% the car for you.  It will drive better than anything else out there.  However, if you want something you can drive daily and not have to worry about breaking down, then this is not the car for you.  Here are the pro and cons: Pros: Best handling.  Period.  Cons: electrical controls will intermittently work and/or not work.  The vehicle is missing sensors.  There is an intermittent smell of something burning--burning oil and/or rubber smell.  This is either not found by the dealer, and/or a dealer will tell you ""something"" needs to burn off.  There is a warranty--great, but when the electronics and burning smell appear, the dealer AND Alfa itself has no idea (or flat-out-lies).  The warranty therefore is useless.  They will try to fix it, but either not find a problem because it's intermittent, not find it, or claim it ""may"" be working as designed, manual and common sense to the contrary.   Overall, a great car, but not ready for ""show-time.""  The dealer network is deficient, poorly-trained, and Alfa itself is clueless.  The driving dynamics are not soo great or that much better than a BMW, Audi, or Jag to warrant buying/leasing this vehicle.",3
38, on 01/26/18 07:43 AM (PST),Maupiti ,2018 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan Ti Sport 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Amazing vehicle," I compared my loaded Giulia Ti Sport with other sports sedan I owned and recently test drove (Audi A4 and BMW 3 series, Maserati Ghibli). The Giulia gives a different feeling when you drive it and everyone obviously is highlighting the driving dynamics and the handling of this vehicle, but I want to stress its engineering and its quality control, that are usually exposed to old cliche' from people who actually nevere owned an Alfa or maybe had a bad experience back in the '80 so are not updated at all. The Giulia has a brand new engineering and platform and doesn't share anything from Fiat/Chrysler group. A profusion of aluminum and carbon fiber is used throughout the vehicle and the engine, steering and trasmission are a masterpiece. This, added to the racing expertise of both Alfa and Ferrari combined in this new project, reflects how wonderful is Giulia in and out. The seductive exterior design and the driving pleasure are both taken for granted by now (considered the best looking sedan with the best handling in the market) so I want to describe its quality: the interior is refined with the Luxury package added. Fit and finish is perfect, no noises coming out during the ride and the parts assembly is very accurate. Reliability has been incredible so far, not a single issue (even beating my Subaru which had a minor issue right after the purchase and a few annoyances during the time I owned it. The glitches reported on some of the earlier test models have been resolved by software updates few months ago and I purchased mine already with the SW update. In my ownership experience so far I can say that it is the best sports luxury sedan I've ever had and everytime I take it for a ride is a big pleasure for me! One last suggestion for interested buyers: pick a Ti Sport with full leather package and 19"" rims. The exterior and interior style and feeling improve a lot!Finally, I wanted to address the negative ""predicted"" reliability that some automotive magazine and blogs like CR are always mentioning: I suggest to keep current and have a look at what is actually going on with updated surveys in Europe, where Alfa Romeo has been present continously, and actual consumer ratings, not to mention the Motortrend and Car and Driver most recent tests that lead to awards:https://www.whatcar.com/news/reliability-survey/http://www.jdpower.com/.../Giulia/2017/consumer-reviewshttp://www.motortrend.com/.../alfa-romeo-giulia-2018-car.../https://blog.caranddriver.com/a-brief-treatise-on-what.../",5

I did lease one, and here's what I think.I have 3,500 miles of flawless performance on mine.  This car turns heads. People stop to chat and ask about it. If you want to blend into the background, maybe it’s not the car for you. From every angle, it looks properly proportioned. The interior is beautiful, and is there a more striking logo than Alfa’s? I say “No”Best for last. Driving it.  It’s not a weekend toy. I commute interstate, NY to NJ every day. Forty five miles each way. Hence the need for the adaptive cruise and forward collision warning. This allows the car to stop and go on its own in bumper to bumper traffic. Nice.When the roads are open, and that happens even in NY, it is wonderful. The chassis feels carved from stone,  yet is somehow compliant over rough patches. It is inexplicably able to take curves flat at speed yet still be comfortable. This is not a big car. It is in looks and feel more like sports sedans before they became heavy and bloated. The Giulia is light and quick and instantly responsive. My 2002 BMW 3 series 5-speed was something like that, but this has that beat.Get an Alfa.",5

Unfortunately for myself and I weigh 167 lbs the bolstered seat are not adjustable on the part where you sit. It was the most uncomfortable seating I ever had in an automobile. For that amount of  money. You do do not get a loaner vehicle for oil changes etc. and the waiting area is sub par compared to Lexus, Audi, Mercedes etc. Apples to Oranges Just because it’s car or the year ,it does not give them the right to think they have what everyone wants . Better options elsewhere considering all the factors. ",3

I have had 3 A4 over the last 10 years and they have been practically trouble free. The Giulia is a delight to drive and has more unique styling than most cars on the road. It handles very well and is exciting to drive. But I each of the Giulia's I test drove (drove 3 different cars over 2 months)had some glitch that the salesman said just needed a software update. Why would you have any new car on your lot that needs an update? Nevertheless, I would have given it a fling if the dealer had been more aggressive on price. Ultimately, given the uncertain maintenance outlook, I was not going to pay a premium for the Giulia. And my Audi dealer made a great deal to keep me loyal, so I have my 4th A4.",4

Believe me if Alfa or anyone else thought the car had a brake failure and run the risk of a fatality gimme a “brake”.  My guess is there are a lot of folks that either this is their first car or really need to buy a Toyota.  I have had my QV for 17 months and not one problem other than a flat tire.  It is the most fun car and I don’t see myself coming and going on the road as every other car.  For a new model year I was very sensitive and concerned.  NOT ANYMORE.  The car is great.  Alfa Customer Care follows up on every appointment and if the problem is not resolved they escalate for you. I am having a very hard time believing that there is not an issue like the previous poster described.  I read it twice and knowing the car and the rules these stories are a bit far fetched at least the one where they are so afraid to drive the car because the brakes failed and the dealership said there was not a problem with the brakes.  I guess they need to apply pressure to the brake peddle. For the car going into neutral on its own I would say the shifter is tricky for the newbie.  Might want to make sure you don’t reach over and move it when driving.  Neutral at 70 plus a mile speed is not dangerous anyway.  Getting a flat at 70 is.,5

If my E92 M3 had double the power it had I would've kept it for longer than 4.5 years but E92 had NO POWER and sounds sooooooo good!!. once you drive the Alfa you will forget about and German cars TRUST ME. if you don't take my word for it you will waste your money on anything you buy. enough said",5

I am baffled by some reviews from journalists in that I think that they have never driven the Quadrofogilio. 505 horsepower. 4 different driving modes including race, ceramic brakes and a carbon fiber driveshaft, roof and hood and movable front aero an interior that is far superior to BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Jaguar. My son is 6ft tall and is more comfortable in the back seat than the BMW 3 series or the Jaguar xe or even the Mercedes 300. The infotainment and navigation is better than my Porsche which cost $160k. For a performance vehicle in a sedan who outperforms BMW, Jaguar, Mercedes, and handles as good or better than my 2017 Porsche 9114s for $80 k plus a warranty that is the best in the industry how can you not like the Italian design, handling, comfort and price.  This car looks like a regular family sedan but is built for the track. It is funny how BMW's , Mustangs, and even Corvettes, want to race you and you have the last laugh when you fly past them and they have a look of despair. Up date after 8000 miles no change its like a mad hornet on steroids. This car is amazing way under priced to compare to the competition,it is the fastest 4 door sedan out there today. No mechanical problems unlike the 2017 Porsche which had many electrical problems. Every time we drive the Giulia we all have smiles on our faces. We take long trips in this car and its very comfortable , my son is 6'ft tall and can fit comfortably in the back seat not so in the BMW, Mercedes, or Jaguar.

I have a relatively well-optioned car including the carbon ceramic brakes, MSRP about $87k.    This car gets a LOT of thumbs up...get used to it!  You can dial the personality you want this car to have...in Dynamic mode (haven't tried ""race"" mode yet, want to break in the car properly!) it feels really tight...in ""natural"" mode, a comfortable daily driver....but you always have the feeling this car wants to run fast.  Unlike some reviews online, i found the interior to be of very high quality...the dashboard looks like it came from a Ferrari.  I am considering a set of Michelin Pilot Sport high performance all season tires, as I can already tell the Pirelli PZero Corsa tires will not last more than about 7,500 miles on the high end!  I have the standard seats, but if you purchase a car with the optional carbon fiber seats, definitely try them before you buy....the basic seats have plenty of bolstering and more power adjustments.  Not that it matters...but so far, in relatively gentle driving (again...trying to break it in for the first 500 miles or so)...average MPG is about 19 according to the on-board computer.  I have the Rosso Competizione exterior color...it looks fabulous...but i did notice that most dealers first Quadrifoglios were Vulcano black.  Although the black looks nice, IMO it doesn't do the car justice, as the carbon fiber bits kind of get ""lost"" in a sea of black....Overall impression...it's even better than I expected!!!!",5

The Alfa turns my commute into a day at the track with the precision handling, incredible tire-chirping acceleration, which is especially aggressive when passing.  The cost was comparable to the SHO--I ended up at around $35k once all the incentives were included (No trade in.)                                                                                                   The fit and finish of this car is amazing.  Tight, quiet, luxurious to the touch.  Get the glass roof.  Without, it seems somewhat looser, more warehouse-y.  The trunk room is pure Alfa Romeo ""What do you need luggage for?""  And things like cup holders are designed for afternoon tea, not a days' worth of coffee in a Yeti.  Bigger containers make adjusting some of the controls a little cumbersome.  No more so that Alfa has done to themselves.  Very frustrating controls for things like the fan motor.  It has a rotary control, but it's brain is attached to the dash display, so rotating the fan one turn only ""wakes the display"" but doesn't do anything for the fan speed.  Not the biggest deal, but you wonder why the two different systems to control one item.  And when you're in reverse, nothing else can be controlled...radio, temp, etc because the reverse view camera is occupying the display.  Like I said, cumbersome.  But that's my only complaint.  My dealer is awesome--they understand a certain level of service is expected here with Alfa--unlike my ford guys.  The is a slight steering wheel rubbing that they are having a time trying to figure out--so until then it's just more volume on the radio (unless I'm backing up!)",5

After that it has happened numerous times once on highway at 70+MPH and multiple times while making left or right turns.I have to instantly move the car to drive mode to avoid a collision with an incoming car at the intersection. What has followed in the past  few months is software updates, shifter change and brand new transmission but the critical issue remains.No complaints with dealership as they are merely third party to this end. The service staff is courteous and has maintained good communication with us all the way.But Alfa Romeo Corporate response is unbecoming of a premium brand. They moved our case to a Third Party Dispute Resolution Center, who offered us pennies as compensation for putting our lives at risk.A better and smarter company would have seen the seriousness of the situation and quickly replaced it with a new tested vehicle with matching or upgraded features.

The quality of the Alfa Giulia is outstanding, especially in the higher trims with Luxury and Sport packages like mine. Handling is superb,  driving pleasure is the best you can expect and everything is well made outside and inside. Alfa has come back stronger then ever and the numerous international awards are confirming it. Many talk about the reliability issue but statistics prove that Alfa does not have more problems then the competitors. I had zero issues so far.",5

63, on 11/22/17 10:46 AM (PST),disappointedOwner ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Worst quality and warranty ever," I have owned bmw 335i and audi q5(still owning it). This is first time owning an Italian car. In fact, I only have it for 6 and half days (only drove 160 miles), it broke. Two engine lights on. Brought to dealership and they refuse to cover it in warranty claiming that there is a wire chewed lose by rat and I have to pay for it! I have 2 other cars parking in the same parking lot/garage for past 4 years (still parking there every night) and never had a problem. This car sit in their parking lot for about 6 month (built in April 2017 and I bought it in mid Nov 2017) and sit in my parking lot/garage for only 6 nights, they blame on me for rat damage! Oh, another thing, on the day of delivery, the power seats wasn't working, but restart the car solved the issue. Unbelievable quality and unbelievable service. For luxury car, the most value the badge carries is the service. And Alfa Romeo failed on that. I deeply regret getting myself into this trouble. Luckily I only leased it for 27 month. Word of advice: stay away from it.",1

65, on 10/04/17 07:45 AM (PDT),Gary ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Most enjoyable to drive," My first Alfa. Coming from a string of Germans and one boring Asian luxury experience. This is likely the smallest sedan I've owned, yet seems to be sufficiently roomy as a daily driver. The drive is what this car is about. It is so light, responsive, and eager to turn, that I find gravitating toward it much more often rather then 3 other vehicles we have access to. Exterior is ok. Distinctive, without flashy. Interior (mine is red) is stunning even in base model. Base seats are average - should've gone for bolstered versions. Putting mildly eccentric controls aside, including the nagging driver seat which insists on sliding back when car is shut off, the DRIVE is what this thing is all about. I compared RWD to AWD and opted for RWD. It feels significantly lighter and more responsive. Speaking of responsive, the base 4-cyclinder is hugely responsive, especially when engaging 'Dynamic' mode via control knob. The car feels quick for sure and I dare say, border line FAST. Emphasis on the feel, not actual numbers (whatever they are). After wondering about looking for a fun to drive vehicle, this appears to be a perfect choice after the first few weeks.",5

68, on 08/02/17 11:49 AM (PDT),Cordog ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Good but not great - Won't recommend to a friend," I leased my Giulia about 1 month ago for 24 months and I am so glad I didn’t buy it. There are some really impressive things about the car. The performance/economy from the 2.0L intercooled/turbocharged engine; the handling, the sexy looks (I have metallic silver with red interior that really grabs attention). But, having lived with the car for about 700 miles, I already see things that make me glad I didn’t purchase this car. Performance/Mechanical: About that fuel economy… the trip computer on the instrument panel overestimates economy by about 7% (it says 33.5 MPG when it was really about 31.3 MPG). This isn’t that big a deal but my Mazda 3 (half this price) is within 0.2 MPG of reality. The sunroof on my car is currently inoperable. It did open once but now won't tilt, won't retract the interior screen back or anything. I’ve read one review where an online magazine said Alfa admits having some SW issues that contribute to engine and sunroof issues. The engine stop/start feature doesn’t have a hill holder so even on the slightest of inclines the car begins to roll backwards upon releasing the brake pedal – before the engine starts and engages transmission. That doesn’t happen in my BMW. Nice feature is the ability to lock the doors from the rear of the vehicle as you close the trunk (an extra button there). The engine has plenty of power, though when in advanced economy mode, if you punch the gas pedal while already rolling maybe 20 MPH, there is considerable lag until the car actually responds. I put the pedal to the floor and I have to believe it was a full second before the car accelerated at all. I’m not talking turbo lag here… I’m talking accelerator lag. The car just rolled along at the same speed for about 1 second before it even began to accelerate at all. Then it snapped our heads back and flew! Braking is sure footed and outstanding. One feels confident and in control – same with the steering for the most part. Suspension is the right blend of sportiness and softness such that you have confidence in control yet not too firm that the smallest bumps jar you. Transmission shifts seamlessly and almost imperceptibly. Alfa’s recommended service intervals are at 10,000 miles and they are now providing a free first service. So, with my 24 month, 20,000 mile lease, I won’t pay for anything except gas. A word of warning, they did tell me the first service would be $900 if it wasn’t free for me. That seems a little steep to change the oil and “check” things like tires, etc. Interior/Fit & Finish: The “B” pillar is very large and obtrusive and makes it difficult to do a head check over one’s left shoulder. All I see is B pillar and seat belt. Looking at my other vehicles (Kia, Nissan, Mazda, BMW), it seems this Alfa pillar juts out into the passenger compartment much further. Not sure if this is for the seat belt assembly but my other cars have adjustable height (this one doesn’t) and they do not protrude as much from the frame as this one. The main dial for the infotainment options is right near the shift selector and arm rest. It is VERY easy to tap this accidentally and that will create various distractions depending on which infotainment option you are currently using. For example, in Nav mode, it brings up the destination selection/cancel while in use. You then have to dismiss the route cancel by selecting again. Speaking of the Nav system… its’ pretty elementary. In fact, I compare it to a 2005 vintage Tom Tom system. While it boots up quickly, it takes a long time to replan routes (if you miss a turn, for example) and it seems to remain fixated on going the original way it wanted you to go even if, based on your missed turn, a new way is shorter. I have tried using “most economical”, “fastest” and “shortest” and I can’t make sense out of some of the routes it gives me. A route I travel frequently (having used Google maps and GPS within my other cars) resulted in this system continually trying to tell me to turn off the expressway I was on to take some other route. There is no shorter, faster or more economical route than what I was taking. I may drive that some weekend just to see where it wanted me to go but I sure can’t figure it out. Now I doubt it’s capabilities if I’m ever anywhere where I don’t really know what I’m doing. Also, I haven’t found a way to store a recent or current destination as a favorite. You have to enter each favorite in manually as if entering a destination. AC blows REALLY cold air and cools the car down fast! However, even on low speeds the fan noise is excessive – like a budget car. I expect more for north of $40K. I haven’t driven more than about 2 hours in any single day yet so I can’t really speak to long duration driving comfort but with the 8 way power driver and passenger seat, I expect a comfortable position can be maintained. The touch of the fabrics and the feel of the interior is as expected. Overall glad I'm leasing but will enjoy my 23 remaining months.",3
69, on 08/01/17 15:49 PM (PDT),Mr. Auto Expert ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),A 4-door Ferrari.....for regular folks," I have owned 67 cars since 1974.  Many of them were high performance or luxury vehicles.  From all the world's major companies.  (BMW x4, Audi x2, Mercedes x2, Lincoln x2, Cadillac x3, Porsche x3, Saab x2 to name only a few)  In that collection which I have bought and sold, I owned 3 Alfa Romeo's pre-1995.   This new Alfa Romeo Giulia sports sedan is BY FAR, the best car I've ever owned, period.   While it is way too soon to write about reliability issues, which seem to consistently plague Italian made vehicles, I am basing my 44 yrs of car driving experience and knowledge on the car's basics.  Looks, performance, handling, and practicality.  I give this car the highest marks possible in each of those important categories. If you are considering leasing or buying a new 3-Series BMW, C-Class Mercedes, or Audi A4 or Lexus, please drive this car first, so you will be impressed by the overall stupendous drivability and performance of this fantastic Italian masterpiece!   I can not recommend this car highly enough.   But I will reserve my long term commentary regarding quality and reliability, for another day.",5

In dynamic mode,using paddle shift,this car is so much fun to drive.Steering/braking performance is first class. Get ""thumbs up""from other drivers every time I go out.

There was a glitch in the voice recognition portion of the phone blue tooth funtion that was fixed after several attempts and is now functioning flawlessly.  I have owned MB, BMW and Audi's and this car accelerates, stops and handles better than any vehicle I have ever owned.  People are always stopping me to admire the car and ask about it. It looks as good as it drives.",5
73, on 03/30/17 16:04 PM (PDT),s.cassell@hotmail.com ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Not the Alfa of old," First take the car for a test drive, this is not a BMW, Mercedes or Audi, it was never meant to be.  This is Italian at its best.  Some reviews out there mention comparisons to the infotainment and lack of rear leg room however for myself it has been totally the fun and excitement to drive.  I will admit the rear leg room can be limited however, it is ample enough for short trips with people in the back seat.  This car is so much fun to drive, the pick up is great, the sound is intimidating, even for the 4 cyl.  having owned since the middle of the February I was one of the only ones in the area that had one.  this meant only 6 in the whole area.  It has a very sexy design and gives the driver that feeling of being a part of a specialized crowd.  I love it, although might not be for everyone, but it is definitely meant more many.",5
74, on 03/16/17 09:23 AM (PDT),Art Haskins ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan Ti 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Had to buy it," The Alfa Giulia is a fun car to drive. Has plenty of pickup. Using the paddle shifters is a blast. Car holds the road well and the cabin is comfortable.  However, I do wish I had purchased  the sport seats. Had the car for about 10 days and went on a road trip of 600 miles. Gas mileage was as advertised at 30-31 mpg. Ran it up to 110mph and it had a great deal more to give. The steering takes a little getting use to as it is so responsive. Have had numerous compliments.",5
75, on 03/07/17 19:38 PM (PST),ECCalfa ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan Ti 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Love it," Love the design. It's eye catching. The handling is incredible. The 4 cylinder sounds like a V6 and has a good growl. It's a blast to drive. It has a lot of cool features like auto wipers, collision warning, and headlights that light up the corners when you start a turn. The Harmon Kardon speakers sound great.  The tech package is very simple, but it works really well and takes no time to master.  My guess is while it's more basic it's probably going to be better than most systems that they try to force too many features in and they are glitchy. Slam on the breaks and the car stays flat, zero noise drive.  The quality is top notch, not single defect or rattle. Only had it for a few weeks - really hoping the reliability is there too. The front sport seats are a tad hard and seem to be built for smaller people. The shifter is taking some time to get used to. That's about all I can find on the downside.",5
76, on 03/07/17 14:23 PM (PST),Jason J. ,2017 Alfa Romeo Giulia Sedan Ti 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),"Love the car, if the electronics only worked"," The bluetooth in this car hasn't worked since day 1.  I've now hat it a week and a half and it spent the first week in the shop with them no having a clue how to fix it.  They finally flew an engineer in to work on it.  It worked for a day and now works about 1/3 of the time.  I'm taking it back into the shop tomorrow.  So, on Friday I will have had the car for two weeks, but have only actually been in possession of the car for four days.  Alfa ""Premier Customer Care"" is zero help.  the dealership offered to find me a replacement but then they couldn't actually get one here.  There's one just like mine sitting on a lot two hours away and that dealership refused to release it to this dealership, and Alfa Romeo corporate can't do anything to make that happen.  The have manage to drop the ball at every turn on this debacle.  I've heard nothing but excuses and they still don't have a clue how to fix the car.",2
