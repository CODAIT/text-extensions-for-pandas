0, on 04/16/18 01:23 AM (PDT),Reginald Gayden ,2017 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Best Value Hybrid," Bought 2017 Optima Hybrid in November 17. It was the only Hybrid Optima on the lot out of dozens of gas ones. I had been comparing Accord, Camry, and Malibu Hybrids and read the Optima Hybrid got 46 mpg on the hwy. That was only 2 or 3 miles per gallon less than the best of them so I did some pricing. My choice was for the 26,800 premium with pretty standard features, good radio with Android Audio and SiriusXM, dual zone climate control, tilt, cruise control,pwr    windows and Door locks. At the time of purchase, there was a $5,000 rebate offered. I could not believe it. All this car for less than a Prius prime.  I have driven it to over 18k miles in 6 months after taking several trips and I really enjoy and appreciate this car. My first trip was from Phoenix to Vegas. Did it on one tank of gas. The car went 828 miles. Very impressive! Really like having a 6 speed transmission instead of a CVT. Driven properly there are days when it averages 60 to 61 mpg city hwy mix. It can go up to 80mph in electric mode. 10 year 100 k warranty and a 5star safety rating I think the value is unbeatable.",5

3, on 09/21/17 00:18 AM (PDT),Aric Pease ,2017 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),25miles per gallon hybrid, At 11k now in a lease for 39 months and it only gets 25mpg in city.  3 times dealerships say it just not broken in yet.  Do not buy!!! Very poor service follow up.  Filed case with corporate and still have yet to hear from them. Over a month now.,1
4, on 07/03/17 08:35 AM (PDT),Chris Doan ,2017 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Best PHEV," I've owned BMW, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz in the lasts 10 years and have been shopping around for a PHEV for months. I was considering and test driving the Ford Fusion Energi, Chevy Volt, Totoyta Prius, Nissan Leaf, BMW i3, Huyndai Sonota Hybrid, Tesla Model S but finally traded in my Mercedes for a KIA Optima EX PHEV for its styling, infotaiment system, technologies, range, price/value ratio, long warranty. This car met all my expectations: stylish, smooth/quiet/comfortable interior, reasonable EV range. It did deliver the 29 all EV range as advertised. I've installed a 240V outlet and used an inexpensive level 2 charger I bought from Amazon.com for less than $250, it charged the car from empty to full battery in less than 3 hours.  Well done KIA!",5
5, on 08/22/17 09:15 AM (PDT),Josh ,2015 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Only thing good is warranty," Car does not get anywhere near advertised mileage, it varies depending on which gas station you use. but my V8 Mustang GT gets better mileage on the highway. The taillights fill with moisture all the time, had them replaced 8 times still do it. The trunk comes open when it wants, the bluetooth does not sync have the time. Worst of all is resell paid 36k after 10k miles it is worth $16,500 should have never switched from Toyota",1

7, on 03/30/17 12:57 PM (PDT),Tesh ,2015 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),This thing has 4 wheels and an engine!, I don't think KIA knows what the term hybrid means!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can get a 6 cylinder Honda sedan that will give me the same mileage as this junk!  Passenger seat feels like your liteally sitting on the floor! you see jack from the seat!  The rear view from the drivers seat is a joke as well!,1
8, on 11/05/15 17:04 PM (PST),Jim ,2015 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Love the seats," I have sat in both the front and back seats and I there great. I have a bad neck and on long drives my neck never bothers me. This is coming from a man that traded in a Cadillac for the hybrid. The mileage is exactly what the review say, a bit lower than other of the same size, especially in colder weather. Overall though I am very happy with the car",4
9, on 10/27/15 16:38 PM (PDT),Luz Mendoza ,2015 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Seats are horrible & not comfortable, The back seats are so laid back you cannot straighten yourself up.  The passenger front seat is so low that you feel like you are sitting in a pod.  If someone is seated behind this seat you cannot move it back either.  So most time your knees are touching the glove compartment.  It is exceptionally good with gas. All other things are ok in this car.,3
10, on 04/25/18 10:23 AM (PDT),B Lucas ,2016 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Kia Hybrid is poor man’s hybrid," Couple of things.. passenger seat is terribly low, radio has terrible sound, lighting is bad on instrument panel (red lights don’t show up well), seat track breaks every 20,000 miles. Mileage is effected by weather, lower mpg in cold weather. Hybrid gearing is dangerous. Starts with little hp In first gear. Slow to speed up.",4
11, on 09/19/17 01:38 AM (PDT),CAllen ,2016 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Ex Hybrid FAIL!!!, 3 times to the dealership with documented mileage.  No support or fix. I get 25mpg in city and about 33 on the hwy.  the hybrid doesn't work. It's running mostly off the engine. Dealerships excuses... it's just not broken in yet.  I now have 11k miles.   FAIL!!!  Do not by the hybrid.  My sisters non hybrid does just fine at 36/40 mpg,2
12, on 09/07/17 01:13 AM (PDT),Last hybrid I by from Kia ,2016 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),No so high-brid, 25mpg in the city 33 hwy on the 2016 ex hybrid. Taken it in twice stating poor mpg and was told it's just not broken in yet. I have 10k on it when is it going to break in?  Liars!!,2
13, on 05/16/17 21:38 PM (PDT),Ken ,2016 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),A hybrid with good styling," If you are wanting a hybrid, but don't want the ugly as dog poop Prius, this is a car for you to check out.",5
14, on 04/14/17 06:54 AM (PDT),Tod Bowermaster ,2016 Kia Optima Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Love the 2016 Kia Optima Hybrid (even more than th," They changed the interior in the 2017. They did improve the comfort of the seats/headrest, but for me, they went backwards in terms of the interior styling- very bland and generic.",5
15, on 04/26/18 10:10 AM (PDT),Nick ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),Glad I only got the two year lease...," Maybe it's just my car - and I know it has JD Power initial quality award for the segment - but I'm having a few issues that started when I initially got the car.  The door rattles, the dashboard makes noises in the heat - occasionally the temperature gauge starts out showing an exterior temp of 32 degrees even when it's well over 70, and sometimes the rear camera stays on ten second past pushing the car out of reverse into drive.  The car handles ok, acceleration is poor though.  Excellent use of space and nice panoramic roof...  No SMS notifications in infotainment system which my last two cars had...  This is my first Kia, and I'm disappointed - it will be my last - like I said before I was debating between a 2 and 3 year lease - I'm glad I went with the two year.",3
16, on 04/21/18 18:15 PM (PDT),Bill Carbon ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),Catchy review," A really good car; had a 2017 Premium with luxury pkg.  Missed some of the good stuff and traded it for a Limited, same year, after a month.  Really enjoy the added toys.  Only been driving this one for a week, but think it is a great car and glad I made the latest move.  Hard to find but definitely worth the effort.",5
17, on 12/14/17 05:20 AM (PST),Bruce ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),Gotta Have A Cadenza!!!!!," As my lease on my 2015 Chevy Malibu was almost up, I started car shopping and I HATE car salesmen.  I looked at several cars including buying a Malibu, Sonata, Cadillac and more, and I had a salesmen suggest I drive a  new 2017 Cadenza, which I did.  I am glad that I listed to him.  I loved the ride, but I was not going to pay $46K for the top of the line model.  The lease deal they had seemed great, but at the end of the day, it was still way too expensive.  I knew I wanted a 2017 Limited and preferably white.  I found a 2017 used (8200 miles) exactly like I wanted and I saved almost $17k from what it would have cost new.  I LOVE THIS CAR.  The ride is great, the looks are great and where I was concerned about my gas mileage (the Malibu averaged about 26 mpg around town and I got 32 mpg on the highway), this Cadenza is right there even though it's rated for only 20-28.  I drive it like there is an egg under my accelerator and once I get it up to speed, I just hold the gas pedal in place, I don't have to keep feeding it like I did on my Malibu.  On a recent highway trip I averaged 37 MPG (YES 37 MPG) and I am getting about 26 mpg around town.  What more could a buyer ask for?   Great Deal!!  Great Looking car!!!   Great MPG!!!  If you are looking for a nice upscale luxury type sedan, you need to look at the Cadenza.  I would highly suggest trying to find a used one and save yourself mega $$$$$.",5
18, on 11/05/17 08:52 AM (PST),Vinnie Scott ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Technology 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),Buy one," I've owned 3 lexus suv's and 1 sedan. The kia cadenza is very equal if not better then lexus. I'm very impressed with kia. Style, luxury, handling,pricing. Couldn't be more happier with my decision. As the old saying goes. Try it you may like it. Vinnie. New Jersey.",5

21, on 08/27/17 06:40 AM (PDT),jeff ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),2 for 2," I leased a 2015 cadenza, for 2 years after leasing a infinity. The cadenza was a better all around vehicle. I now lease a 2017 cadenza and l love the new style,I have not had a single problem with either car.Plush interior and great performance!",5
22, on 08/20/17 10:12 AM (PDT),James Townley ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Technology 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),Great large car, This is a great car at a good price. Can't beat 0% financing.,5
23, on 08/14/17 08:24 AM (PDT),Cindy ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Technology 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),Big Car Great Value, Bigger than BMW 3 or 5 Series. More Comfortable than Mercedes. Better warranty than everyone. What a value!,5
24, on 08/01/17 18:15 PM (PDT),Tom ,2017 Kia Cadenza Sedan Technology 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 8A),Surprisingly Great Tech Package update," I have owned BMW Convertible, 5 Series M Sport, Acura TSX & many Toyota's & Honda's. The 2017 Cadenza is the most comfortable car I have ever owned. Full of High Tech in Tech package. Smooth ride, excellent seats (better than Volvo).August 2018 updateTo date this is the best car I have ever owned.  No repairs in 1st year and 21,000 miles. No adjustments of any sort. By comparison my BMW’s needed 3-6 in first year. Tread life on tires is good but tires are too noisy once broken in. Seats are superbly comfortable. Averaging 27 MPG with 50/50 split on highway vs city driving. List price for my car was just under $40000, got it out the door for under $33000. What a great car & what a bargain. Have only less than 10 of them on the road in last year. Nice!",5
25, on 01/07/18 14:13 PM (PST),JF ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Surprisingly a nice car," I traded in a 2014 Chrysler 300 and purchased the 2015 premium with the technology and luxury packages with 15k miles.  I was looking at the Buick LaCrosse, Chevy Impala, Azara.  The car is just as roomy as the 300 and surprisingly drives much better.  The car with the 19 inch tires is very stiff, and you can feel the bumps as you drive.  The car is very comfortable to drive, i especially enjoy the option of the extended seat for the back of the legs on long trips.  i didnt think much about that until i used it and it was very comfortable.   As simple as this may be, the headlights on the car are very good, and you can see a good distance with them.  I find that the navigation and UVO system is very finicky and i am having trouble with the voice recognition (how does call home turn into call Paul?), maybe i just do not know how to use it yet, but i would think it would be self explanatory.   The car has very good acceleration for the V6, especially when you are at highway speeds.  I have the paddle shifters, but havent used them nor am i sure why they would be on this car, i cant see too many buyers of this car using them.  I am currently getting 25.5 mpg in normal mix driving of highway and city, so that was a surprise to me, was expecting less.                                                                            Overall the car is very good very comfortable, good gas mileage and very roomy.  all the controls are in easy to reach places and are easy to use. The ride is stiff on the 19 inches, but the handling is very good as well; not a sports car handling but very good.   there are a few things that are annoying 1) how does a car like this not come standard with a remote start 2) the universal remote buttons on the review mirror do not light up when the headlights are on 3) the car is lower to the ground than i expected vs some of the competition 4) this car with the 19 inch low profile wheels are HORRIBLE in the snow, you will need snow tires.  I would recommend this car",4
26, on 03/19/17 08:34 AM (PDT),TD Guest ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),"Nice, BUT..."," Car has power and is extremely quiet, however, transmission is not smooth, nav/electronics not very intuitive and set up of front seats for comfort is poor for long trips.  The AC is nice and operates well.  Also, backseat is roomy.  The absolute WORST part of owning this car vs every other car I've bought/leased is the dealerships.  I had problems with the two I dealt with on several levels.  Overall, performance is great, comfort is poor and would like easier-to-use electronics.",4
27, on 09/04/16 20:59 PM (PDT),anon ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Decent but Disappointing," The car itself is really good mechanically but i have to agree with a previous reviewer who noted that the navigation system is horrible.  Acceleration is consistent with other cars in the category.  Handling is just ok, certainly not up to Audi A4 standards.   Interior is great, the roof is great.  I've had some problems with Kia Finance as well and recommend avoiding them, if possible.",3
28, on 04/16/16 14:34 PM (PDT),Cliff Shields ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),You don't drive a Cadenza? Shame on you!," Just purchased my 2nd Cadenza Limited. This is my 7th Kia since 2001. This is the perfect car for price, warranty,  options. You will pay a great deal more for same options on BMW, Lexus. Mercedes-Benz. Don't waste your money for the name and prestige of such. Test drive this car. You will purchase. Get the SX Limited. Excellent road car. Burn only premium fuel and you will get 30+ mpg on road trips. Over 500 miles on one tank of gas. Check out the 2017 Limited. Many added features and actually a slightly lower price. You just will not go wrong with any Kia but particularly with the Cadenza Limited. Test to drive it, you will buy it.",5
29, on 03/06/16 20:20 PM (PST),Michelle Milton ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Saved our lives!, I loved my car & it saved my daughter and myself lives when we were Tboned at 60mph- we had minor injuries the curtain side airbags protected my daughter the car held up to such a hard impact I'm impressed- I will be replacing it with a 2016 Cadenza- so grateful for all its safety features and I will miss my black on black- great car!!

31, on 02/06/16 10:12 AM (PST),Al Bryda ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Is it really a KIA?," I test drove the Cadillac CTS, the Lexus ES 350 and the Cadenza.  Absolutely love my Cadenza.  I've owned many new higher end GM and Toyota cars but have never enjoyed driving one as much as my Cadenza.  Apparently I'm not alone with my feelings as I am seeing more and more KIAs on the road.It is now 9 months later and I still love my Cadenza.My only additional comment about my Cadenza is that with the 19 wheels and a somewhat taut suspension, I feel that 18 inch wheels or higher profile tires would have been a better choice for more comfortable driving over some of the New England roads that are in disrepair.",5
32, on 01/30/16 11:48 AM (PST),Anon ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Mostly Good," I have about 2K miles on a 2015.   The Car looks nice, drives well and has good acceleration.   Pricing was good.   However buyers should know a couple of things:1.  These cars depreciate  pretty quickly.   Do you own comparison.  Suggest a lease2.   The handling is comfortable but not sportyMy one disappointment has been the built in GPS  which simply consistently make VERY strange routing systems.   The system allows you to pre-program selections such as ""avoid tolls""  but it has just been horrible.   I am disappointed that i use Google on my smart phone for navigation although its not a huge deal.   Positives are the roof (cool), the look (nice...looks a lot like a Lexus) ,   the acceleration is good,  comfort is good. Very spacious.",4

Then drive an Avalon, a Regal, a Maxima, a Chrysler 300 and an Accord.  The Kia Cadenza is the best ride - quiet, smooth, powerful and comfortable.  The price is competitive too.",4
34, on 01/25/16 09:30 AM (PST),Mason ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),A great car and value," I purchased a Factory Certified 2015 Cadenza Limited.  So far I have really enjoyed the car and received many compliments on it.  I would say my only slightly negative comment is that I was surprised that the car does not have daytime running lights.  I didnt even think to ask because they are so prevalent on cars and most all other Kia's seem to have them. Otherwise, I would certainly recommend this car to anyone especially as a used purchase as they are a great value.",4

36, on 01/14/16 08:10 AM (PST),Ron ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Less than expected, The voice recognition system is really bad. My wife and I both have no accent whatsoever and it can't recognize a single name we ask it to call. Also the voice commands for music is very limited. It will not let you say paly a single artist or song (just shuffles your library.,3
37, on 11/29/15 06:14 AM (PST),SA ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),No comparison!," I love cars. I love cars that are considered underdogs. I love cars that you don't see everyone driving. I love knowing that I have made a great deal and my car is worth every penny I spent. The cadenza is just that. An underdog that is better than its competition. No comparison. The impala, 300, Taurus etc. I owned two of the three competitors. Not that they are bad cars or alternatives. They just are not the best.  I drove the Toyota Avalon, bmw, Acura, and Lexus. For the price range the cadenza blows them away. Not to mention the styling and standard features! Kia comes with the 5 year warranty and 10 year powertrain and a specific premium service for it cadenza owners. I love that there isn't one every time I turn the corner. As a matter of fact KIA should be paying me to advertise. Lol. Every where I go people are always wondering what the car is and when I tell them a KiA they are instantly intrigued and ask me questions. its a beautiful car, quiet, handling, safety, and standard luxury features. Kia is in the rise and its quality is great. No recalls.  No repairs. No issues!! I haughty recommend.  They have hit this one out of the park. From what I hear from other Kia owners, it is the norm to have high quality and no recalls. They have made it into the luxury market and are moving forward quickly. I hear the K900 is also beautiful and hard to compete with, you won't be disappointed. Give Kia a try. You'll be impressed to say the least. Trust me.",5

This is car continues to impress me and my friends. Roomy, quite, smooth ride, and  lots of luxury amenities that comes standard at half the price of BMW and Mercedes. Kia has step up to the plate with this car.",5
39, on 10/16/15 12:50 PM (PDT),David M Stevens ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Better than BMW and Mercedes, Superb handling in a Beautiful Package.  Road Handling is a little stiff which reminds me of premium european sedans.  We now have 15K miles on our 2015 Cadenza and have no serious complaints and nothing has broken.  Additional sound attenuation would be appreciated but the noise level is better than most comparable vehicles.All in all Kia has hit it out of the ballpark with the Cadenza.  This may be the reason that virtually no dealer has any 2015 models remaining unsold.,5
40, on 04/01/15 20:24 PM (PDT),swpcadenza ,2015 Kia Cadenza Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Cadenza Premium," I purchased my Cadenza Sept 2014. Overall, I'm very happy with my selection. I was certainly torn between choosing the Cadenza over the Chevy Impala. They were identical in terms of what I wanted in a fully loaded full size sedan, however the Cadenza had just more of that ""it"" factor I was looking for. There is no way possible I could get this much standard luxury at the price I paid in a BMW, Lexus, Mercedes, Audi, etc. ",5

Spacious, hugs the road.....until....I was driving down the street and started to hear a loud clicking noise.  Towed it to the dealer and was told that the car needed a new engine!  I bought the car with 37k miles and the car was under 60k miles when this happened.  I had two oil changes on the car and was very careful with it.  THE KIA WARRANTY IS COMPLETELY HORSE****!  They will not honor it....but will come up with ways, at the cost of the owner, to suggest things that need to be done for the car....all so they can say it was your fault.  I will NEVER buy a KIA again just by the way they do business.  This was my only car and the financial setback to me was MAJOR!  NEVER AGAIN!",1

I have been a loyal Toyota fan, and have owned multiple Avalons, but the current design of the Toyota models did not appeal to me.  This car had all the same features that other luxury models for less than half the price (I bought this car used).  With only 12K miles, it was as good as new, and I got a great bang for my buck, even though I paid additional for a long extended warranty.

I never had one bit of trouble with it and it ran like a dream.  My ONLY criticism was getting in and out of the vehicle.  Because the car was low to the ground and I have a back that gives me trouble on occasion, it was a little bit of an effort to get in and out.  Once seated, I had no problems.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to ANYONE, and that includes luxury car owners.  I can make that statement, because I have owned Cadillacs, Lincolns and other high end vehicles.  My advice is simply this, if you can afford a Cadenza, buy it and you will not be disappointed.",5

I had to return to the dealership FIVE TIMES for service, often after the engine light would come on during a period of sluggish acceleration and very low idling. It happened again on a 600-mile road trip less than two weeks after one of the ""fixes.""One of the injectors was replaced (at no cost), but the problem persisted. Finally, about two months ago the dealer persuaded me to spend $300 to have the fuel system cleaned out. That seemingly fixed the problem - until I was driving last week and the problem returned. The engine light didn't come on but acceleration was sluggish. Of course, I was on the freeway 150 miles from home when it happened. Fortunately, once I restarted the engine after stopping for a Five Guys hamburger, the problem went away.  I only burn ""Top Tier"" gas and have a CASE of Techron in my trunk; I add it to the fuel tank every 1K+ miles. Still, I have little confidence that I might not once again have this problem.Also, since my last review, I've had to spend nearly $200 at the dealership to have the rubber/plastic front bumper undercarriage repaired after it was almost torn off by getting hung up on a concrete parking lot barrier.  In Kia's quest to lower overall mileage, it reduces wind drag on the car by lowering the front end. But it's too low, making it vulnerable to frequent scrapes with parking lot barriers and steep driveway gutter interfaces.  I still enjoy playing my 6,000+ mp3 music selections on shuffle off a thumb drive in the UBS port (I can even include album art)!Would still prefer another couple of inches of driver headroom.Tight suspension is too hard for my liking.Creaking noise in the front quarter-panel on rough roads.Trunk lip leaks rainwater into the trunk.

It was almost perfect at lease turn in but it wasn't inspected for two weeks and there were several charges that took some major effort with the selling dealer and the factory to waive.  The factory was immovable on this, so my only conclusion is they must have a lot of deadbeat customers or something wrecking their leased cars. But i did like it so asked if I could lease another for two years.  However since it depreciated like a boat anchor, even the selling dealer had nothing to offer in terms of worthwhile incentives for a new one.  They had no choice but to send it to the auction because there was no equity in keeping it or buying out the lease.

Safety without reliability is not safe.  The alternator went out at 36k.  I lost the ability to steer or accelerate on the freeway at night.  The warning lights came on about 1 minute before the car failed so I was in the exit lane and luckily rolled straight off the freeway exit without power, and rolled into a gas station.  Sure the warranty covered the repair and Kia towed it for free-but I was almost killed along with my unborn child, 2 other children and the babysitter in the car.

Since then, the rear brake cylinders leaked (no brakes), the radiator has leaked badly, the power steering is stiff on cold mornings (bad power steering pump).  Recently had the timing belt changed, and in the process they also changed a leaking hydrolic tensioner (extra $200) and then the air conditioner stopped working again the next day.

There is ample storage in the multiple compartments.  I am at 43,000 miles and have not had any mechanical problems whatsoever.

Good build quality, fit-and-finish, looks, comfort, and rock solid value all make the Sedona minivan a good choice for today's families.  There are just a couple of refinement issues, but they are negligible.  The one thing that DOES suck, though, is the mileage.  You're doing well if you get 22 mpg on the highway, cruising at a constant speed on flat land.  Trouble is, we have LOTS of hills/valleys here in Cincinnati, so mileage here tends to be awful - normally around 15 mpg in the city.

You said gas mil. is bad, but traveling on the highway at 65 to 75 mph, we get at least 25 mpg We never really use it for city driving. What made us choose this type of van was the seats were more comfortable than other vans we tried ( we have leather) and the road side assistance / 5 year-100000 mile warranty can't be beat.

It's a great ride, has good acceleration and comfort and has a host of safety features that make the ride safer. I wanted a minivan that could hold all the professional gear that I need to carry with me on jobs. It has a bit less space than the Dodge Grand Caravan that I had earlier. The only thing that I miss is the fold down seats in the 2nd row that the Caravan had. The other manufacturers like Honda and Toyota also don't have fold down seats into the floor so I chose the Kia for its safety features. It has been a wonderful purchase.",5

Being neither a soccer mom nor what we consider ‘old’ we were on the fence for awhile, but so happy we made the move! We’ve had an SUV since they first debuted, and we were always pleased with the versatility and style of them, from a small CRV to our last, a Lincoln MKX. The decision to try a minivan was based on our decreasing mobility and the height of the vehicle, the comfort of the seats on long trips and the versatility of the cargo space. We love the fact that each passenger has their own AC vent, usb plugs are abundant for the kids and there is plenty of leg room for my husband at 6’2” and for all the sports equipment and lawn chairs we haul most of the year! Safety was by far our most important consideration both for us and our precious cargo- KIA Sedona has an impressive 5 star rating and we feel as safe as is possible. The ride is quiet, it takes bumpy roads much better than my Lincoln did and we are averaging 22 mpg around town, and 24-25 on highway. I will say the one drawback seems to be sluggish acceleration when we are in ECO Mode, so we seldom use that setting on the highway.  We have less than 1k miles on the Sedona so far, but we are very pleased with our purchase.",4

271, on 04/05/18 11:36 AM (PDT),H. Simmons ,2017 Kia Sedona Minivan SX 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Good as a Honda," I never wanted to be a minivan mom, that being said life happend. Now I have 2 kids both under the age of 5 and an 80lbs dog and a husband with physical  disabilities. Looking at our options it's was either a truck or van but having a significant other with very set requirements for a vehicle and a limited budget made our vehicle search tricky to say the least. Enter the Kia Sedona. We'd compared the Honda Odyssey and Chrysler Pacifica each had great room, decent gas mileage the only problem was to get everything we wanted put us at about 45k. We discovered the Sedona in Lowe's parking lot and looking at it neither of us were that off put buy it's looks (you know what I mean the typical minivan look). We researched it heavily and for us the only thing we didn't really like was it has a 6 speed vs an 8 speed transmission like its competition. That being said we've still been able to get 26 to 27mpg average per tank of gas. Going from a 2013 Chevy Cruze to the Sedona was amazing. I can't say enough good things about the extra amount of space for hauling around my tiny terrors. Like traditional vans the automatic sliding doors make it easy putting my 3 year old and 5 month old in and out of the vehicle. Also because of the height of the vehicle my 3 year old can easily cilmb in and out without assistance. The front seats are comfortable and supportive with the added bonus of being heated and cooled. My husband loves the cooled seat feature. The second row captains chairs are comfortable and supportive and just the right size for 2 full size car seats. The third row is spacious enough for adults if they were to be relegated back there. Usually we just leave our third row down for extra hauling capacity. For long trips the extra space is wonderful for our dog who is finally able to escape the torments of our 3 year old plus plenty of room for suitcases and coolers with room to spare. Another favorite feature is the built-in sunshades in all rear windows. Looking back I wish we'd considered/ made the move to the Kia Sedona sooner.",5

We had a '09 Odyssey followed by a '12 Odyssey. These cars were good -especially the 2009- but felt the 2012 was harder to use, and [much] worse to drive. We looked at the Pacifica (didn't like the driving) I didn't love Sienna's interior quality, so I didn't want another one. Honda's redesign was mindblowingly ugly (for me at least), so it was either Sedona or Quest. My parents and I ruled out the Quest after I did research on it and didn't like things about it. When I told my mom our best choice was a Sedona, she asked what brand it was. I said a Kia. She didn't stop laughing for 5 minutes. But after talking about it and seeing it at the LA car show, she opened up to it like crazy. We had eyed one Cerritos, and we recently purchased it for about 375\mo. We mostly do the back and forth of driving to the store, school, work etc. so mileage is pretty bad. Really comfy though and everything works good. One downside is how far the 'Tune' button is from the driver. it is far enough that you can't reach it while driving. Another is Lane Departure Warning & BSM. We want to keep it on because it can be extremely helpful, but it makes annoying beeps if, God forbid, we are within 2 inches of the yellow line. It also sometimes thinks it 'sees' things that it doesn't, which results in the LDW going off sometimes while pulling into our driveway. All in all  though, awesome car",5
277, on 12/21/16 14:50 PM (PST),Peter Beinetti ,2017 Kia Sedona Minivan SX Limited 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),KIA Sedona is a fabulous vehicle," Reviews complain about gas mileage, but I don't know why. My wife and I took an 8000 mile road trip and got 24.5 mpg -- loaded with people and luggage. The last two days we took a 400 mile road trip and we got 26.7 mpg. We were in the mountains on the 8000 mile trip and I used the manual shifting a lot. No manual shifting on the Pacifica, which we compared with the Sedona before we bought it. Sedona handles extremely well with a very good turning radius. Pacifica about 3 feet larger radius. We test drove both and the smaller Sedona radius was obvious. Dash layout on the Sedona is well thought out, and attractive. The nav system is the best I've ever used, by far. Vehicle is extremely quiet, and tracks perfectly on the interstate. It's quick -- I saw car magazine reports that rated it at 7.4 seconds 0-60. That's fast for a large vehicle. I keep saying vehicle because it looks and acts more like an SUV than a minivan. Nappa leather is great, airplane type second row seats are a true luxury. Dual sun roof really lets the light inside. I've driven the Pacifica, Odyssey and Sienna -- I think the Sedona is the best vehicle.Update to my review one year later:  I still think the Sedona SXL is a great vehicle. We have over 16,000 miles on it, and have had no problems. We are currently on a 12,000 mile road trip around the USA, with about 3,000 miles completed. Average MPG so far on the trip is 24.7. Handling on the interstate continues to be perfect, ride is excellent. No complaints whatsoever.It is now January 2018 and we have 28,500 miles on the Sedona. Our 12,000 mile trip ended up to be 12,600 miles, and we averaged 24.5 mpg. I can't figure out why the Sedona is rated low on gas mileage, I think it's fabulous. So far we have had zero problems. I've never had a car before, with over 28,000 miles on it, that didn't have something go wrong. It still rides great, and handles well. I thought our 12,600 miles trip would be very tiring. It turned out to be just the opposite. The Sedona is comfortable, and easy to drive. Lots of power, no problems in CA keeping up, or passing, on the freeways. The last car I had, a 2015 SUV, had what I call 'high effort' steering. It made for very tiresome driving. On our Sedona we can choose between two different steering efforts. I'm 78 years old and it's a joy to drive the car.Update July 2018. We are on another road trip, so far 4400 miles. Again, the Sedona has performed perfectly. MPG on this trip is 24.9 to-date. There is really nothing more to say, except that my wife and I love the car.",5

God bless that dealer!  For most of the first year he had the van back and forth trying to get and keep the engine light off.  Everything from power steering just letting go to exhaust o2 sensors.  They had a hard time just trying to get the parts needed.  Here is a list of some of the work done to the van:  throttle repair, piece by piece until the whole unit was done,  almost every o2 sensor on the car, power steering master cylinder let go, exhaust work, lubed manual sliding side doors multiple times still having problems, starter died, drivers power window motor stopped working, valve cover gasket leaked oil into spark plug well.  And in my opinion one of the worse problems with the van are the  blind spots!  Something you can't change or repair.  I have noticed a large blind spot on the right front view.  Where the rear view mirror is and the roof support are mounted.  The two put together make a large area where you can't see anything coming.  I almost had multiple accidents because of this.

It only uses a quarter tank up and back from my house to my mother's house which is about 80 miles away as long as you keep the mph fairly steady. Keep that in mind.",4.25

There seems to be a rust issue with the rear heater hose which I feel should be a recall because it's a design flaw. This was a $375 repair OUCH. Just hit 74K miles and the O2 sensor is shot.

Overall it's okay.  However, the rear brakes make a groaning noise that the dealer can't seem to fix.  The horn works intermittently.  Every so often the A/C stops working.  There is not as much cargo room as I had initially hoped.  Unless you are a child, getting into the back seat requires you to be a contortionist.  The paint must be the lowest quality possible, it gets scratched just by looking at it.  The fuel mileage isn't horrid, but you can get comparable mileage from a Suburban.  Which is what we are looking into trading in for.  Do yourself a favor, avoid Kia.",2.75

We keep one captains chair out in order to have extra room and we have a chirping noise that happens when we first start the van in the morning or after it has sat for awhile.

Bucket seats are much too small and not at all comfortable for any length of time. It is very difficult to turn around. The headrests in the rear are in the driver's vision and you cannot see clearly around them. Hope we never have to travel very far in it, as it gets miserable to sit in the seats very long at all.

The interior of the Toyota Sienna look too bland for my taste. Honda Odyssey too ugly for me. Test drove Chrysler Town and Country and it felt like it was going to break down. Nissan Quest poor crash ratings so I did not bother. After two years of driving Sedona I had two issues. One was side power sliding door it would not completely close until 2-3 times using remote. Dealer greased  power latch and it was corrected. Second transmission shifts harsh one time 1-2 gear when cold then it drives very smooth. Took in for inspection they found nothing and just reset trans cpu. Still have this issue. Electronics are easy to use including gps. With several kids interior is still looks new. Seats are comfortable on long trips. Leather is very nice. After a couple of road trips I still don't have any rock chips so the paint is excellent.

No DRLs, mileage is 18-19 mpg in city, but great acceleration and brakes.

Overall very pleased so far, last van was  2004 Odyssey.3-month follow-up:Follow-up after 3 months - still very impressed with Sedona especially after replacing tires with Bridgestone equivalents (from Costco), now quiet ride.  Transported two twin beds (mattress, box, headboards and rails) all in one trip after moving middle row seats all the way up.  Noticed brakes were not as solid as I braked one time hard with seven passengers onboard and the van didn't quite stop as quick as I wanted as the brakes faded, no harm, but need to have dealer check it out.  All in all, still impressed and pleased with my purchase, will see what my first check-up experience will be with the dealership is like at 30K service.18-month followup:Still enjoying the Kia - no problems to report.  I checked the brakes at the 30K service, dealership said no problems on brakes, but I know that they fade when I brake hard with full van of my 5-6 kids due to weight?  I may replace brake pads soon and hope this remedies this problem.  I really like using the Android Auto with the Kia big screen - works nicely with touchscreen.

Then we had our first kid and I convinced her to go with a wagon for the extra cargo room and grew to really appreciate it. So when we had our second child a few years later, the wife readily agreed to a minivan upgrade after having had seen the light. It just made sense since having to deal with multiple child seats, strollers, kid gear, and hauling parents/in-laws with a single vehicle. But since I'm the primary driver on the weekends, any old minivan wouldn't do. What I really like about the Kia Sedona SX-L is the SUV-like styling (exterior, cockpit, center console), luxury accommodations (cooled seats, soft-touch surfaces, Napa leather -- something not even offered on a 3-series BMW, but available as an expensive upgrade on the 550i), safety/convenience/technology features (360 camera view with rearward turning radius, blind spot monitoring, collision warning and rear cross-traffic alerts, proximity keyless entry/start, smart lift gate), performance (strong engine with passing power, relatively nimble handling), and value (cheaper than competition with long warranty). There's plenty of room in the third row seats for adults to boot. We've owned it for 13-months now without any problems or reliability issues. Things we don't like: drive-by-wire throttle input delays; tiny interior conversation mirror; occasionally laggy infotainment system; difficult to move second row captains chairs; cheap-feeling plastic chair controls; Lack of steering wheel transmission paddle controls; poor visibility of blind spot indicators in bright sunlight; lack of sunglasses holders; LED ""positioning lights"" only come on with the headlights; and the rear suspension bounces over bumps even when fully loaded with passengers.",5

Coming from a 2008 Honda Odyssey there are some distinct differences.   Most noticeable is how much quieter the interior is in the Sedona.  You can have conversation with people in the back seats at highway speeds in the Sedona without shouting, unlike the Odyssey.  The body structure of the Sedona feels very solid -- no rattles, or flex over bumps, like we would notice in the Odyssey.   The layout of the instruments and controls in the Sedona are very user friendly and intuitive, more so than the Odyssey.   With the console mounted shifter the driving position in the Sedona is less ""minivany"" than Odyssey. Both vehicles have a comfortable ride, with the Sedona having firmer seats and slightly firmer suspension, which gives it a more stable ride, with less wallow than the Honda.  Both are great road trip cars, but the Sedona definitely feels like a more of a luxury car than the Odyssey.  Tracks better on the highway too.   Real world MPG is about the same, around 24 highway and 18 around town.  In terms of driving, the Sedona is more satisfying on the road.We were first considering a Sedona SX model, but after looking at the SXL my wife really liked the extra features -- lounge seats, nappa leather, flashy chrome wheels, and especially the technology package with surround camera.  The camera is an amazingly amazingly practical feature.  We've owned  Mercedes, BMW and Infiniti, Honda, Land Rover, Ford, Lincoln and Chevy vehicles over the years. This is our first time buying a Kia and we are still surprised how much we like it.  While it likely won't hold it's value like the Honda, for us it was a better overall value than the other vans.Odyssey advantages:  The engine and transmission in the Odyssey felt slightly smoother and more refined under quick acceleration, and the Odyssey has more third row room (since we only use the third row occasionally this was not a big deal). We looked at the new Odyssey and Toyota Sienna as well before we purchased.   We also had a Town and Country rental for a week and were surprised that we actually liked it.  Side by side it's not quite as good as the Asian minivans but considering that you can buy one for $9K less than the other vans I understand why so many people buy them.   All these minivans are great family vehicles but the combination of unmatched features, styling, drive quality and price swayed our decision to buy the Sedona.   Of the four we ranked them Sedona, Odyssey, Sienna and Town and Country.",5

OEM Yokohoma  tires got noisier and noisier as they wore down, so replaced them early at about 49K miles with Generals which are much quieter with no loss of handling.  Only thing I really miss is the fold into the floor center row seats found on the Chrysler minivans.  I just take mine out and leave them home in the garage but would rather have the flexability of being there if I need them.  Folding up against the front seats is available, but takes up too much needed room in my application.  Dealers constant attempted upselling of servicing is annoying but follow the factory recommendations and it's not much of a burden at all.  Would I buy it again?  In a heartbeat.",5

We now have 20k on the car & changed to a decent tire-Cooper CS4 at 15k. Drives beautifully. OTOH the autolock/unlock is an idiotic security nightmare, hoodlums will love it, you are a sitting duck when you park..July 2016 update: the idiotic auto lock/unlock control is still a security nightmare [ALL doors unlock EVERY TIME it's put in park] & the dealership is hopeless/worthless to fix it. Doubt if they give a flip. OTOH  the window down-door-stop dangerous idiocy [manual sliding door only opened part way if window was down a little] was an easy fix. - just remove the stop. This was important as if you opened it vigorously it bounced off the stop & closed -very hard!!- on  adult or kid's fingers/hand/arm/head... ER visit or worse!! Options issue: in 2012 heated mirrors only came w/over-priced packages with junk we didn't want.  An important plus is the excellent all-direction visibility , thanks to large unobstructed windows, is better than ANY other van we've driven, then, or since then.  Luckily, once you are rolling down the road it's a great car, so we're keeping it.  However, thanks to the locks & heated mirror issue, we are very unsure about buying a KIA in the future. I would suggest if, in one of these vans, you are attacked in a parking lot or hurt by the sliding door, you contact a lawyer.January 2017. we again have re-shod with brand new Cooper's CS5's and the open road handling is even better than the CS4's. it's still smooth, comfortable & has enough power to easily spin the wheels [which we do rarely] . We have generally learned to quickly re-lock the car after putting it in park, but it still infuriates me. Idiotic designs always do. However, we're still keeping it.  The overall car is still quite good.",5

The dealer won't fix it on his dime either. I have only 1800 miles on the car and it has been in twice for repairs. I live on a paved road! I can't afford to keep paying for brake repairs.

Nothing was hidden and everything was clearly explained. Received great financing at 2.9% for 60 months and substantial rebates as well.

I even recommend them to friends that are in the market for a van. I like that the Kia has light truck tires on it. This isn't so good for a ride, but is great in a rural venue. It also lends to a more durable tire. I feel that Kia has kind of skimped on the interior of the van. It could have more options, but I think they were trying to keep the cost down and threw some of them out the window. There are several issues to be aware of... 1. the AC pump is prone to going out at least once in the vans life. And even when it is working properly, it makes a rather annoying noise. 2. Be prepared to replace the idler pulley at least once. I have owned 2 vans and this has happened to both. 3. The paint job is kinda cheep. The handles are starting to peel and stuff... could have done better. 4. The bucket seat arms are always coming lose and require me tightening them up once a month.... rather stupid. For my major complaint.... 5. at 100K miles be prepared for something to happen. Right now I am dealing with the oil pressure sensor that is leaking oil. The shop wanted $500 to replace it so I decided to tackle it my self. I think $500 for them to do it would have been a better deal. Wicked pain in the butt!! This being said, I hope to have it fixed and back on the road. I would like to run this bad boy till the wheels fall off.

I get 20 mpg in city/highway driving. On the open road, at 75, I get 24-25. Great bang for the buck! Downside! The residual value on this vehicle is horrible. Comparing it to other minivans with comparable equipment, mileage, and initial purchase cost, the Kia is $4k-5k less. I trade every 2 years, and expect to pay to get right side up. However, this van is costing me too much to trade. Cost new; $24k. Now; $6500! What a hit in 2 years!",5

The remaining warranty was for only 60k (only original owners get 110k), and only had to use it once to replace the fuel pump at 23k, since it was giving off a humming noise.  Dealer replaced with no haggle.  My trusted mechanic has been maintaining it and is impressed with it's quality. Yes, it isn't the top of the line in luxury, but we purchase our vehicles for the long haul and want reliability, comfort and safety over the high techie offerings. I know this minivan will go the distance with me for another several years and thousands of miles.  My other 2 minivans (1988 Dodge Caravan & 2000 Chevy Venture) needed new transmissions at 100k, but this baby is still going strong!  Mine came with Sirius radio which I just recently enrolled in, I have a single CD player and one USB port and I love the backup sensors which I've never had before.   I'm sure it isn't the quietest ride around, but I truly enjoy the look and feel of this model and the cargo capacity works exceptionally well as an additional truck for my husband's upholstery business.

Twice in2 years we've had issues with it.  First time while sitting at red light the van started surging forward.  I jammed both feet on the break pedal.  Scared me to death.  Today while pulling into 3 lanes of traffic one again it surged forward.  My husband was driving and was furious.  The first time we had the van towed to the dealership in Columbus ohio. They found no problems. This time we will take to the dealership in WV. We could easily have hit some other car or a building.  I think we will take a hit and get rid of it.

465, on 07/13/15 12:18 PM (PDT),Chris ,2014 Kia Sedona Minivan LX 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Not happy," Where to begin. First, for my first mini-van, this is a true let down. On the on set, i was really impressed with the roomy interior, seats, and the power rear doors and hatch. But the let down and buyers remorse quickly came after. First, the positive. This van has a lot of power, surprisingly so. If you want it to move, it will. The van is pretty spacious, so no complaints there. The seats don't collapse into the floor, at least not my model year. Visibility out the windows is good too. Comfort is ok, not too great and not too poor. Now, areas where I am not happy. First, the van said it has seat warmers. Let me begin by saying this was sold to me as seat heaters, and as the upper model, not base, I took it at face value. We didn't test it prior to buying so I take that on me, but let me tell you, they are not seat heaters. The dealer replaced them as they didn't seem to work. they even got kia corporate involved. At the end, I was told they are just warmers, not heaters, and thus, they don't do either. It feels maybe a tad warm, and then its done. So that was a disappointment. Technology in this is out dated, but I knew that obviously buying it. What I did not realize is the bluetooth is very touch and go, and works when it wants to. I have tried different phones, brands, and operating systems, Android and iOS, doesn't matter, it behaves the same, and dealer response is we don't fine anything wrong. Next is fuel mileage. This is perhaps the biggest let down. My wife drives this van, and drives it like grandma, and this van, in the city, empty - no cargo or passengers, maybe gets 15 MPG. On highway, 19 or 20. Never have I got anywhere near EPA sticker. Ever. And that is driving it like Ms. Daisy. Currently the locking mechanism had to be replaced as it wasn't locking properly, and the dealer took care of it. Another issue was the rear windshield wiper, right after purchase, the rubber separated and scratched the rear window badly. They had to replace both the rear glass and the rear windshield wiper. Now, out of nowhere, inside the van a new issue has emerged and the dealer doesn't want to take care of it. Lets see what happens as Kia corporate doesn't seem interested in helping either. This is the first issue where they don't seem interested in helping. But from my perspective, this van has been a true disappointment, and a let down. If i could go back, I would not purchase it. Too many issues, and currently my odometer is sitting at 10,000 miles and have had the van just over a year. Another thought, is resale value. All cars loose value, but Kia seems to be like a boulder dropped in the ocean...the value drops that fast.",2

Its still a van, but its nice to know Ive got a highly rated vehicle for safety with two small kids.  Yes, Kia has a low resale value, but that allowed me to buy this for $15k.  It was a great buy.",4.25

I carried heavy loads that frequently approached maximum design limits.  This minivan did very well as a cargo and people carrier.  Passengers were surprised by the quiet, composed ride, even at 80mph.  One friend, after we were under way at night on CA S.R. 14 had to ask what make the vehicle was.  He just didn't expect the smooth, quiet ride he was getting.  Head and cross-winds didn't bother it much.  Torrential rains and temps. from 20 to 105F were handled well.  Kept up well with an RX-9 up Tioga Pass from US 395.  Very well balanced.  ",4.125

Had some problems with tires being low-  call Road assistance- responded quickly. Took in for service- they found the problem. If I could change anything- I would change the Headrest. The ones in back seat are very uncomfortable. If you raise them up the driver cannot see from rear view mirror. Would love to see darker blue. I have the glacier blue. We went to Tennessee several times in it and use it for going to and from work. Love the foot rest -great when traveling long distances. Brakes and rotors need changing- you replace both when brakes wear out. But I love it. ,4.625

Having a family size of 8 the cargo space and storage is great!!! Gas mileage is also good in comparison to similar vehicles. The Sedona is equipped with great safety features such as side curtain air bags, back up camera, and proximity audible alarms for rear and front. For the price and safety features you can't beat a Kia Sedona!!!!",5
481, on 07/14/17 07:46 AM (PDT),Peter ,2016 Kia Sedona Minivan SX Limited 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),"Fabulous vehicle, still after almost 40,000 miles"," Had for over one year, two huge road trips. On 12,000 mile trip at the moment. Getting 24.5 mpg. Looked at Pacifica, didn't like. Turning circle much better on Sedona, didn't like transmission knob. Sedona can be shifted manually, was great in the Colorado mountains last week. Sedona looks and operates more like a SUV than a minivan. Zero problems.Update January 2018: The Sedona still has not had one problem. It has nearly 29,000 trouble-free miles, and has averaged 23.9 mpg in all types of driving. For some reason car reviews knock the Sedona for bad mileage. Lead foot maybe? Normal driving gets excellent mileage. Plus it's quick. Car and Driver clocked it at 7.4 seconds 0-60.  I had an upscale 2015 SUV as my last car and it didn't handle as well as the Sedona, was less comfortable, had much less cargo space, had poorer visibility, and on and on. To me, the minivan makes a lot more sense than an SUV -- unless you plan to go off-road, which few people do. There are other good minivans to buy, but I wouldn't trade my Sedona for any of them. Plus, it has the best warranty in the car business. Easy decision, at least for me.Update July 2018: Just returned from a 6000 mile road trip. Again, everything was perfect. No problems whatsoever. MPG was 24.9 for the whole trip. Now have over 39,000 miles, not one problem.  A friend came up to me today as we were near the car and said, ""I thought you had a minivan""? I said, ""It is a minivan"". He said, ""It looks like an SUV"". The car does look more like an SUV inside, and out, but has all the conveniences of a minivan. I am 79, my wife 75, and we LOVE our minivan. It handles well, has incredible room, has three uncrowded rows of seats (vs most SUV's), has rear entertainment for the grand kids, has a very tight turning circle, has great manual shifting for the mountains, etc. I could go on and on. Oh yeah, and the price was better than the competitors.",5

I get 17.1 MPG city and 25 MPG in the mountains, very little highway miles at this point.Update: Six plus months now; with two great vacations. Very happy with the Kia Sedona. 28-30 HWY MPG. The middle seats kneel forward allowing for the folding raised platform I have that supports a full-size tri-fold mattress with storage underneath, push button side-doors,  wonderful for camping and cargo. I am very pleased with the high quality of the Kia Sedona.Update: One plus years now; Very pleased with the Kia Sedona LX. The Sedona handles very well at highway speeds. On a recent camping trip I averaged 22.9 MPG. Safety, quality, passenger and cargo capacity are all wonderful. The Kia Corporation and the local Dennis Dillon Dealership have also proved to be wonderful to me.",5

I only drive or on weekends,  my wife drives it everyday and we both love it. You can get a great deal on Sedona because it doesn't sell as well as Honda or Toyota. Make sure to negotiate the price. Besides the best value for what you get it Sedona doesn't feel like you are driving a minivan, the interior and height makes it more like a SUV.  The EX gives you great options. I only wished it had front sensors also to help with parking. The only other thing I would have liked is the fuel efficiency. The big engine uses a lot of gas. I get about 18mpg on average but I do like the power of the engine. If you have little kids minivan with power sliding doors is the best option. You won't be disappointed.",5
484, on 04/18/17 12:00 PM (PDT),Jmartinez ,2016 Kia Sedona Minivan SX Limited 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Do not recommend to anyone!," As for the sales reps everyone was welcoming but as for the KIA name in general the vehicles suck! My husband bought a 2016 KIA Sedona not even a year old yet and it seems like I've gone to get it services every month. First off the vehicle was full of little ants from being under a tree at the dealer and nothing was done about it then about a week after we purchased it we got some heavy rain and the water was leaking into the back tailgate, I took it in for service twice before they could figure out what was wrong with it. So now my van smells humid :-( on top of that they put a scratch on the tailgate and wanted me to take it back a third time to buff it out and eliminate the odor inside, I was already there for over 3 hours and I understand they are busy but my issue should of been a priority especially with me living 2 1/2 hours away so nothing was ever done about that. Well to continue after about a month my husband noticed that the navigation screen was pushed in from one side and popping out from the other side so I took it in for service and they said some screws were loose. Then one day my kids wanted to watch a movie on the DVD player and when they tried lifting the screen it was jammed again I took it in for service and they said some screws were loose that didn't allow it to open back up. I recently just took it in again because the traction light was coming on and the brakes would make a cracking sound and jam up, I was told the hubs needed to be replaced so they ordered parts and I have to go in once more to get them put on. I'm sorry but their service sucks and I will never buy a KIA again or recommend it to anyone. They need to better prioritize their customer service and I believe I deserved a full tank of gas and complimentary detailing for missing work and driving 2 1/2 hours to and from the dealer numerous times for non sense issue that a brand new vehicle shouldn't be having!To add to my issues with Kia the lights on the interior of the van don't work either, omg idk what's next or if it's even safe to drive this Sedona anymore.",2

486, on 01/07/17 09:29 AM (PST),Dad that Drives a Minivan ,2016 Kia Sedona Minivan SX 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Competitive Minivan and a great value," My lease of a 2014 Town & Country 30th Anniversary addition was coming to an end and needed another minivan. The Town & Country was a decent minivan and but was feeling dated.   I have a wife and three kids and minivan is a more practical choice for my family.  They offer more space than a crossover and getting and the ease of getting in and out is so much easier. I thought I had already made up my mind and was going to lease the 2017 Pacifica. But I decided that I should drive a couple other vans to make sure.  I drove the 2016 Honda Odyssey and left the space, comfort and ride quality was better than the Pacifica.  However, the technology of the Odyssey was very disappointing, the infotainment system was not what I would expect in an almost $40,000 car.  It was very dated, even more so than the Town & Country.  I decided that I would drive one more van and then make my decision.  I went to a local Kia dealer and drove a 2016 Kia Sedona SX trim.  As soon as I sat in the driver seat I knew this was the most confrontable of the three.  I'm 6'2 and I had plenty of space.  I was able to get in the seat behind me and was very confrontable.  I was also surprised that my knees were not touching the seat in front of me. Next I climbed into the third row and was able to fit in the back seat, I would prefer the send row but would be ok riding in the back. The list of features on the SX is simply amazing at this price point.  The SX trim comes with blind spot monitoring, backup sensors, backup camera, 8inch touch screen, with navigation, Apple Car Play and Android Auto, heated and cooled seats front seats, heated 2nd row seats, power sliding doors and hatch. Upgrading to the SX you get an Infinity® 8-Speaker Audio system and the sound quality is amazing, so much better than the radio in the LX and EX trims. There is also an abundance of USB ports, two up front even a quick charge USB port, one USB port in the second row and 115-Volt Power Inverter, Center Console more than enough to keep all your technology powered. Now onto how it drives, it was to be one of the most confrontable easy driving vehicles that I have ever owned. Driving around town, maneuvering the parking lots is a breeze. There are three driving Modes ""Comfort, ECO, and Normal"" When you select the Comfort setting the steering wheel takes almost no effort to move and low speeds. On the highway, the road noise is almost nonexistent. From the front seat, you feel like you are driving an SUV, which for me is another positive for the Sedona. If you are in the market for a minivan I recommend driving a couple different ones to see which suits your needs best.  For me the decision was simple the Kia won hands down. If you are looking for a van a comfortable ride, with an abundance of features, good looks and great value the Kia Sedona might be for you.",5

It is so roomy with tons of storage.  We love the front console, kids love the captain's chairs.  It got great mileage on our last road trip, and performed well in snowy and icy conditions.  The only ""con"" if you can call it that, is that stock DVD/Entertainment systems are not available through Kia.  However, we made the best of it with our portable devices.  The Sedona was so much more affordable than the competitors.  This is overall a great purchase.  Seriously parents, if you are doing the van vs SUV thing (I did), this will by far exceed your expectations with style, comfortable seating, mileage, storage and lower insurance rates.

I previously had a 2015 Dodge Journey and I'll tell you what, the Sedona is a luxury ride compared to that.   The Sedona has so much room, easy to get my kids in and out of car seats, the air conditioning works excellent in the back seats which is so important for me since I live in Phoenix, AZ.  We have the 8 passenger, so we never need to have the rear seats up and that leaves up with a lot of cargo room.  It rides smooth, handles nicely and is comfortable.   My only complaints are, I already had one of the motors replaced on the rear sliding door. (mine is a 2016 with 18,000 miles) Without  a warranty it would have been over $1,000 at the dealership I went to. Also,  The sound system is beyond cheap.. totally poor quality & there is no navigation and no power lift-gate (which I feel should be standard on a minivan)   All in all my husband and I were those people that said we would never drive a mini van yet we are both  bummed we didn't purchase this before we wasted money when we bought the dodge.",4

I like the interior style and trim.  Maybe I will get asked for an update on my review in 10K miles and I will have a different opinion. For now, it has enough good stuff to make me feel like I was smart to buy a Kia, and this was a good pick. It seems solid plus I also like that JD Powers has been tracking quality metrics and it has trended up and up and is right up there with the the top the 4 BEST in class. That means Kaizen and Six Sigma. That means serious business. Update 3-17: Not even 3k miles yet, still love it. Update 9/17- Just over 5.5k now, I like the GDI motor.  Have been camping a couple of times, that is one of the reasons we wanted a mini-van. It holds a lot of stuff! Update 3/18 Still like my van very much.

495, on 08/04/16 13:49 PM (PDT),Steve ,2016 Kia Sedona Minivan LX 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Quickly became disappointed in our Sedona," We owned our Sedona for a month but quickly grew tired of it and then eventually replaced it.  We initially purchased it because it was more current than the Grand Caravan and more affordable, better driving, with a better second row solution than the Odyssey.  Some important missing safety features I later kicked myself for missing that I was careful to check on other vans was NO third row LATCH connectors and no daytime running lights (DRLs).  DRLs are standard on most cars today and the dealer tried to lie to us and tell us parking lights were DRLs.  I find it ridiculous a FAMILY van is missing third row latch connectors.  Even the aging Grand Caravan is standard with the above.  We had the LX model with the Convenience Package, not a cheap van, yet it had a very small center 4.3"" (I believe) LCD in this day and age was a joke to all that entered the vehicle.   We had quality issues with the power steering and fuel system that were intermittent and the dealer could not help us with.  The steering after 1000 miles softened giving it a less precise driving feel, the plus side is we started driving slower since we trusted the handling less.  In favor of the Sedona we found the second row solution much better than the Odyssey's lift out solution.  The engine was also stronger than what was in the Odyssey making highway passing easier.  Fuel economy was the lowest of any minivan I have put significant miles on.  Handling was similar between the two vans.  This van proved to the be the worst car we have ever purchased and probably our worst financial mistake, even though it cost us we are so happy to be out of it.  We had not given the new Pacifica a try during the first round since it was so new when we were shopping.  I suggest giving it a try, we were amazed how much better van it is in every respect, so happy now.",2

Wow, first off this minivan has the most quiet ride of all minivans we drove, period!!  And it doesn't look like a minivan, it has a bolder stance and just down right cooler looking!   Tons of features! Love the cooled seats.. Navigation system is one of the best we have had in any of our cars!  Easy to get in and out of with three Children.   Memory driver seat is great because my wife is 5' and I'm 5' 10""....   This minivan has too many awesome features to list.  We purchased this mainly for an extra vehicle and it will used mostly for vacation road trips.  The only downside and it's really not a negative is that you may need some time to figure out all the technology that it has.  I can predict this will be the number 1 minivan on the market once people give Kia the opportunity.   We also have a Kia Optima SXL and it's been perfect in all ways.   Will follow up in a few months.Update: after 6 months and only 2995 miles it has been amazing!  Two road trips and the highway mpg is great at 25-26.  Our three kids watch the built DVD with wireless headsets and then play on xbox 360 while my wife and I can listen to music and talk!  Kia did an awesome job with designing this minivan for families!!!  Very pleased with this purchase, my wife needed a very safe minivan with technology and this was by far the best on the market!  She doesn't drive much, just the kids to school and around our area for shopping.   At first she thought it was a little too big, but with the cameras she just loves it.  I like it so much that I may sell my Optima SXL and buy another for me.Update after 1 year:   This has been an incredible minivan from day one.   It is super quiet while driving with very little road noise if any.   We have taken it on several road trips and I'm amazed that it gets 26 mpg on the highway!   Still enjoy all of the technology and most of all the safety features.  We feel very safe while driving this minivan.  I really don't have anything negative to report.

I've only been in the passenger seat twice but when I was in it it felt just as good as the driver's seat. The power sliding doors are heaven sent. Also the power life gate is a must if you have children. The leather is very easy to clean spills off of, bonus!!

We spent a lot of time looking at minivans and trying to find the right one that would be safe for our family. After driving the Sedona we knew it was what we needed.

We only considered the safer MPV's, Honda, Toyota and KIA, the other's were considered too much of a health hazard to their passengers.    All 3 we tested drove very well, the KIA Sedona just has had a firmer, more confident driving experience. The fuel economy of the Honda was the best of the bunch, but was let down by the poor access to the 3 row seating, very dated interior, the price would be considerably more to get some the basic standard features of the Kia, and the concern of falling to 10th place in brand reliability, only average, by consumer reports . So our choice was between the Toyota and the KIA in the end. The Toyota is good, but only gets a acceptable rating for the small overlap front crash test, which is more important than it sounds, reliability is rated 2nd place behind Lexus, very good. The dash board looks and feels, if come from a different generation in the past, and price for a similar spec was nearly $5000 more than the KIA at list price. The Sedona just has a more modern design, inside and out, taken the best features of some the other's, and made them better still, then backed by a ten year warranty, became a easy choice. Update, we have had the Sedona now for 12 month and 12000 miles, and is still problem free, I can understand why the Kia brand is rated number 5 for reliability by consumer reports..",5
503, on 11/17/15 10:13 AM (PST),Joseph Lee ,2016 Kia Sedona Minivan SX Limited 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Highly recommended car," I would get the 2016 Kia Sedona. It is an awesome car. It has the highest safety standards. Very comfortable. The blind spot detection, rear view parking camera, and rear cross traffic alert are a must when you drive a minivan. It does not have navigation, but you can get it on Amazon and hook up on your car without any difficulties for $130. One thing my wife loves about the Kia Sedona is that it is not as ugly as the Toyota Sienna or Honda Odyssey. I have not driven a Honda or Toyota equivalent, but I like the Kia Sedona because of the price and its highest safety ratings. I think a Toyota or Honda equivalent is around $3000 more than the Kia Sedona. Korean technology is going to be one of the best in the world. It will be ranked in the top 4 with the United States, Japan, and Germany. Already, Korea has the best wireless technology in the world since many of the components in the Apple iphone is made by the Samsung group. Koreans are a very jealous people. Kia does want to be like the Samsung group as a global renowned company in automobiles manufacturing. I am very sure Kia will catch up with Honda and Toyota in a short time frame. I saw the Tesla Model X for $150,000. This is the only model which can fit my family of 4. It is 5 to 7 times more expensive than the Kia Sedona. I am spending about $60 per month in gasoline expenses. Let's say I spend $1000 per year on gasoline to make the math easier. If I continue to drive my Kia Sedona for 100 years, the Kia Sedona + gasoline is still a better bargain compared to the Tesla. This is extremely sad even though the gas mileage for the Kia Sedona is around 15 to 20 miles per gallon.",5
504, on 09/13/15 19:44 PM (PDT),YY ,2016 Kia Sedona Minivan SX 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Great minivan.," We have been very impressed.  Ride is excellent.  Handles like a car.  Looks as good as a SUV.  We had a 2012 Honda Odyssey Elite previously (lease).  This Sedona SX is better.  Ride is better.  More tech inside.  Definitely enjoying the surround view camera, the vented seats, the automatic high beam (useful when driving on a mountain road not having to worry about flipping the lights when paying attention to the curves).  These are features not available on another 8 seater minivan currently.  Also we like the fact that Kia comes with a much more reasonable warranty.  Honda and Toyota both has only 3 year 36K mile warranty - this is low in the industry.  And ... to those who says Honda and Toyota don't break ... guess again ... they do!  Our 2012 Honda Odyssey had transmission problem - fortunately just before the warranty is up.  That is the reason we are not keep it beyond our lease.  Very glad with our 2016 Kia Sedona SX right now (8 passenger tech package).  The only grip I have is: why Kia doesn't make a 8 seater loaded and with the panaramic sunroof?  Our $40K Sedona is loaded - but has no sunroof?  Fortunately my wife hates the Sun and does not like to have sunroof.  I on the other hand would wish that being available as an option.  The SXL comes only in 7 seat.  Why?  Otherwise we would have bought a SXL.Update: Apparently the SXL comes in 8 seat now.  Wish we had known about that.  Vehicle still running great.  We had been very happy about the purchase.  Drives better than our prior 2012 Honda Odyssey with a more upscale interior.

505, on 09/05/18 12:22 PM (PDT),ahightower ,2016 Kia Sedona Minivan SX Limited 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 6A),CUVs are for chumps," If you need three rows of seats every day, and do not have $65K for a new Suburban, minivan is the ONLY way to go.  We had downsized from 2005 Yukon XL to a 2014 Pathfinder, and that was fine for a while.  But when surprise baby #4 came along, we realized the limitations of the CUV.  Access to third row was a daily nuisance (constant flipping and folding of seats - easier in the Pathfinder than most of the competition, but still a thing that has to be done), and most importantly, cargo space in the way back is very limited.  We took our annual Florida trip with two adults, four kids.  Luggage stuffed to the gills, and a cargo platform hanging off the trailer hitch for extra capacity.  We had some serious saggy butt.  It handled alright, but clearly was not designed to actually carry a full load of people AND stuff.  This was the trip that convinced me it was time to return the lease a bit early and get into a van.  Wife wasn't quite ready to go dork mobile, but she eventually admitted if there was a really nice van than looked okay and had all the features she wanted, she would consider it.  The Sedona and new Pacifica made her very short list.  3 minutes walking around the Sedona and marveling at the space and luxury finishes, and she was sold before I could even test drive.  This one evidently has a bit less room behind the third row than Odyssey and Sienna, but it is downright cavernous compared to even the biggest CUVs (Chevy Traverse).  And loading the baby is so much easier with sliding doors.  These are all things I knew, but Mrs. Cool needed to live with her Pathfinder for a few months before coming around.  We went for the SXL Tech 8-seater in dark blue - it's actually a really nice looking vehicle, and not just ""for a van"".  I've stored away that 2nd row ""jump seat"" to create an aisle for two of the big  to easily walk through to the third row.  But I did want that 8th seat, just in case we have an extra passenger (grandma) for a long trip, or perhaps we will want to fold half of the third row to max out cargo space for beach gear next summer.  And, I didn't really need the sun roofs, which we never used in the last car, and which they say compromise headroom in the third row where two of our growing young teens reside.  Also didn't really care about the ""lounge seats"".  One of them just has a baby carrier on top, and honestly there's not enough leg room back there to really utilize the ""ottoman"" feature for a teenager, unless he scoots all the way back and steals all the leg room from the third row.  Just not something we would ever get any use out of, while the 8th seat has potential uses.  Anyway, this is quite simply the most luxurious vehicle we've ever owned.  The interior materials are beautiful, and I hope they are durable as well.  I'd prefer darker leather, but other long term tests I read say they hold up well.  The gadgets are ""Sofa King"" cool - I've never had many of these features before.  Xenon headlights, automatic high beams (this really works!), radar cruise control (again, this actually works great - it can't do stop and go traffic, but it will take you down to about 5 mph and back up again), blind spot monitors, birds-eye-view camera for parking.  I don't love the chrome wheels, although they look sharp it's going to be a lot of effort for the boys to keep them clean :)   The bluetooth audio doesn't seem to work with the newest iPhones, you have to plug in to USB to get any sound from your phone.  Nor does it read texts as it says.  Wish it was apple car play instead of UVO.  But the navigation is decent.  I thought Nav was stupid, since that is free on everyone's phone anyway.  But having it integrated into the dash is nice, and its directions on the info screen between the gauges driver side is cool.  When we get the XM activated, will see how good it is at traffic.  Cooled seats are a Texan's best friend.  I'm 6'3"" and have plenty of leg and knee room, even with the bulky baby carrier behind me, and his seat scooted forward a bit to give the third row boys some extra space.  Wife is 5'1"", so memory settings for seat and mirrors were an essential feature for us.  We had the dealer install remote start, and it works fine with the factory key fob, though it will only run for 30 seconds once a door has been opened.  We had been used to starting up the AC and taking our time loading groceries.  Instead, you have to jump up front and hit the ignition if you want it to keep running, but that's a minor complaint.  The ride is very quiet, and it really smooths out with a full load.  Enough power, transmission is responsive.  Steering is very light at low speeds but firms up nicely for the highway.  The price was very fair, lots of features for the money.  I am a little bit hesitant about Kia long term reliability in general, but we will be covered b2b for the duration of the lease, so I was willing to give it a chance.  Overall, we are both very pleased with this vehicle.",5

I knew going in that gas mileage would be bad, and it is ... about 16-17 mpg in mixed driving. Highway we get about 19. Interior is okay; my wife bought it because of leather seats and cheap price. Flexibility, however, is compromised because of very heavy third-row seats that do not fold flat. Reliability has been okay. Check engine light has come on a few times and the alternator went out at 42,000 miles. I think the transmission is starting to go. When colder than about 25, it hesitates before going into gear ... revs like it was in neutral. A/C fixed twice. All except the transmission have been fixed under warranty. We'll keep it to 100k as long as repairs are free. ",2

KIA says it's on you now. 63,000 miles and they want $565.00 to repair; that includes alternator, belts and labor. It's not a repair you can do either, seems AC lines are in the way. Do you think KIA planned it? Ask them about changing spark plugs the rear 3, seems you need to remove the air intake manifold? That will require new gaskets? Not sure of that cost.

I bought my Sedona at 123k miles, and it is 11 years old at this point (2006 model, it is 2017). So far so good. I have not had any problems with it so far and love all the space I have now compared to the mid-sized sedan I was driving previously. I especially love how the 3rd row seats actually fold down into the floor, giving you flat space back there. I was amazed at all the storage space. I also really love the little pop-down back seat viewing mirror, so I can see if my two kids are fighting/sleeping/whatever. The automatic head lights and tinted rear-view mirror are very helpful too. This is just a downright cool van compared to my previous car. The downside:  I don't like are the wind noise when going high speeds - I have to turn the radio way up to hear it. It also has a harder time accelerating and the engine makes weird noises, guessing they are normal because I've had two mechanics check the engine out. Also the side doors don't always stay open and lock in place, making it hard sometimes to get in/out.",4

We changed out the head unit for a more modern system so the entertainment and Bluetooth is better than stock.  Replacing the spark plugs was not fun but not impossible.  Rides as smooth as silk.  Very good engine & transaxle - no issues.  Kia did this one very right.,5
581, on 04/22/16 08:23 AM (PDT),G ,2006 Kia Sedona Minivan EX 4dr Minivan (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Best van ever," Never had any major problems, bought it brand new in 2006 has great performance good gas mileage plenty of room and has been 100% dependable I put one set of tires on it into batteries and just regular maintenance",5
582, on 04/04/16 08:31 AM (PDT),Alex G. ,2006 Kia Sedona Minivan LX 4dr Minivan (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Very good vehicle for its time and even today," I bought this minivan after having owned a 1994 Grand Caravan and then owned a 2001 Dodge Caravan. What attracted me to this van was value. At that time (10 years ago, in 2006) the Chrysler products offered only stow-and-go on the higher trim levels and captains chairs in the middle row, and rear air-conditioning and heat was not available in the base model. The Chrysler twins: Grand Caravan/Chrysler Town and Country, only offered the bigger engine (the 3.8 liter and later the 4.0 liter) on the upscale models with more options. The base engine (3.3 Liter at 185 HP pushing nearly 5,000 lbs) was sluggish and the base model had rear drum brakes and not disks. Also the car had a leaf spring rear suspension, not independent rear suspension.  To move a 3.8 Liter engine, (at about 225 HP) and rear disk brakes, middle seat as a captain chairs and not a bench and a stow-and-go seating , instead  of removing a very heavy rear back seat ) required going from $21k to $29k in the Dodge Caravan and to go to nearly $32k in the Chrysler Town and Country. A jump of $8k in price is very significant.  So for me, I wanted to be in the low 20's in the purchase price, not mid 20's or low thirties . The Kia was available only in trim levels: EX and LX with all the same options, but basically the LX added power sliding doors, leather, and wood grain accents to HVAC area. So for around $21k  for the Kia, you were getting rear-air and heat, and big engine, and better handling and power than the mid-to-higher priced Chrysler. You need to spend at least $10,000 more to get the same options from Chrysler. To me, it was a very good value. After owning the car for 10 years, here's what is good about it and bad about it.  On the plus side, the big 3.8 Liter engine puts out nearly 250 HP and this van, really moves. It's not a sports car, but for a mini-van, it has very good power. It's handling is very, very car like and you feel like you are basically driving a big car. It handles better than the Chrysler. The Dodge Caravan (Dodge is Chrysler) is basically a big box on wheels. After 5 or 6 years, you start hearing crackling and noise, but the Kia is still quiet inside the cabin at 10 years of age.  I did basic oil changes and I changed the transmission fluid at 60k miles and again at 120k miles. There was an electrical harness problem, but the dealer fixed it under warranty. While under warranty, the repairs are none out of pocket. The repairs however cost a lot more money once the car ages. For example to do a simple tune up, because the car has a D.O.H.C wide engine, you need to take off the intake plenum to get to the rear spark plugs. The E.G.R system is expensive and very complex, with a lot of sensors. One annoying thing I found is that the steel cable under the car that lowers the spare tire is very, very hard to pull the spare tire up once the car is jacked up and you have a flat. The factory supplied jackstand is a joke, and do yourself a favor and buy yourself a hydraulically assisted jack stand that can lift a truck, because that's what you really have in terms of weight. The new Kia's don't even come with a spare tire! What a joke not to provide a spare tire!  The cable that lower the spare tire snapped on 3 occasions in my case ($300 each time) and is a non-warranty item. i started carrying my spare in my trunk. If the cable snaps and the spare tire falls into the car behind you while at high way speed, this will kill the passengers in the car behind you on a highway. So the cable snapping that supports the spare tire is no joke.  It may have never happened to others, but over 10 years it did happen to me. The car never overheated. Has proven to be very reliable overall. The car with good care can easily go past 150,000 miles. The cost to maintain is high once you get past the warranty stage. It doesn't have the transmission problems I had in the Dodge Caravan's I've owned. Those had reliable engines, but not so reliable transmissions, which both the 1994 and the 2001 I had required a rebuild (first one at 75,000 miles) and the second one at 90,000 miles).  The Kia so far never missed a shift. I also like it's non-CVT transmission so many, many repair shops know how to deal with it if you do have a problem.  The Dodge products required a new water pump in one case, at 65,000 miles. Not the Kia. I still have the original water pump. The engine is chain driven, not belt driven, another way to make sure you don't have the cost of replacing a timing belt.  So in sum, it's a great family car. It was a great value in its time relative what was available in 2006. I got a fully loaded minivan, for the price of the no-frills model in the Dodge Caravan. (I've owned two of them previously). The van had none of the problems of my previous Dodge Caravans: No transmission problem, water pump failure, or other super expensive repairs. The interior remains quiet and free of rattle and wind noise even 10 years later.Recommend.",5
583, on 02/09/16 10:01 AM (PST),Justin ,2006 Kia Sedona Minivan EX 4dr Minivan (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Not a bad value," Bought this car in 2010 when family expanded with twins. Rear passenger power door works about about 10% of the time. Only a few trips to mechanic for some leaks, oil and radiator. But expensive repairs when needed. Blows signal bulbs and headlight bulbs every three months, which I learned to fix proficiently on my own. Drove this van on numerous family trips all over, and some very long distance trips as well. Never once did it break down and leave us stranded, never once did it fail to start. Not the highest quality, but great value. I couldn't afford a Honda or Toyota, but those have their own problems too, just research them. Also we were severely rear ended with all of my kids in the car, including a three year-old in the third row seat. The rear window blew up but the door stayed solid and didn't come anywhere near the third row. At the end of the day I would trust a Kia with my family.",3

On the downside, the cargo space is not nearly as capacious as that in a Leaf. And the hatchback release on the key fob only does that: release the hatchback. I am constantly annoyed at having to unlock the doors after I've already unlocked the hatch when I walk around to get in the car. The extended range is noticeably different from my 2013 Leaf, and the driver only AC as well as the ventilated seats are a huge energy saver. The UVO EV Services are functional if not entirely well-executed. And I wish I could get out of the car with it turned on and NOT have it beep as loud and as long as it does.

I was sold on the Soul EV less than 5 minutes into my first test drive. Even though it is shorter than a Leaf, the Soul feels so much roomier inside, with a much better driving position and more comfort in all the seating locations.

654, on 08/31/17 10:47 AM (PDT),Auto-holic ,2008 Kia Rondo Wagon EX 4dr Wagon (2.7L 6cyl 5A),A total surprise - I LOVE it!," I come from a dealership family and we currently own several vehicles in our household plus 4 motorcycles so I switch cars frequently.  I'm an ""auto-holic"" with lots of experience with all types : sports, sedans, trucks, SUV's, etc., everything from luxury to econo, 4-banger to V8, stick to automatic, and foreign & domestic.  I recently wanted a car with better MPG for work but had a limited budget.  I obsessively shopped online for vehicles that I was already familiar with and could afford but had never even considered a Kia Rondo.  Frankly, there aren't enough of them on the USA roads to even notice (though more popular in Canada).  When I saw an ad for an '08 with 68K miles & competitive price, I agreed to look at it per the urging of my husband and mechanic-son.  Was so unimpressed with the exterior that I was hesitant to drive it, but when I did, WOW, I was almost embarrassed for overlooking this gem for many years!  It was extremely responsive, nimble, comfortable, more than enough power with V6 for competitive, congested highway driving, SUPER smooth transmission and handling, all the creature comforts (leather, sunroof, 6-CD stereo, Aux jacks, etc), and awesome visibility, 3 rows - 2 fold flat for much cargo space.  Handles like a much newer car, feels solid, and zero performance or reliability hiccups.   The Rondo is quiet, too, transferring very little road noise to the interior.  For my needs in congested city traffic, and high-speed long distance driving, this car has not disappointed!  When I hit the gas, it instantly gives me what I need for passing and maneuvering.  I only wish it were brand new so I could keep it longer because they're not sold in USA anymore :-(   But from where I am, might travel to Canada for a newer one to enjoy longer.  MPG is impressive at 25city/29hwy, much better than advertised, and I am NOT easy on the accelerator.  I have owned this Rondo for 6 months now and it is currently my favorite car to drive.  Cars currently in my household are Chevy Bronco, 2x Nissan Maxima, Mitsubishi Outlander, Mazda B2000 truck, Cadillac CTS, and my personal fav Kia Rondo.   I wrote this review because I feel the vehicle never got the recognition it deserved and was seriously overlooked.",5

I think it's not the nicest to look at. It reminds me of a wagon. But the way it grips the corners, gets up to highway speeds and truly is a hoot to drive.

At the time it was exactly the car we were looking for, as it had the third row stow-and-go seats. We had reasonable performance from it for the first five years, although it did have a few factory recalls in that time. HOWEVER, two months after the five-year warranty expired, the engine failed. Despite the fact that I had followed the warranty maintenance schedule, KIA Canada would do nothing to assist us with this matter and we ended up having to have a second-hand motor installed. Apparently KIA create disposable cars and are not prepared to back their products. Like a previous poster, I too am a bit embarrassed about having recommended KIA to friends. ",2.125

Add's a lil boost that some other crossover wagon type veichles dont give you.  all the usual stuff, power windows, power doors, am/fm/cd, ac/heat.  The rondo is very spacious in the back.

Not cheap looking and its loaded,remote,power windows,locks,cruise,ESC,ABS. Lots of storage space. The 4-cylinder gets to 65-70 smoothly and is surprisingly quiet. Gas mileage isn't great for an engine this size though. I'm a little worried about the recall on the fuel pump.

We were replacing our 98 Ford Windstar, we wanted better gas mileage, but still versatility.  So we rented this vehicle for the weekend, highly recommended.  Took it to the ocean and for the weekend and got 25mpg (200m 60% Hwy & 40% city).  It handles worlds over a minivan, fun to drive, and parking lots are easy.  Purchase process, we talked to the car sales arm of the rental agency, said we wanted dark as possible interior and 7 seater, they brought in a Silver exterior, with black interior.  Ultimately we purchased it for $13,000 with 7,000 miles on it and we have gotten 21.8mpg strictly in town driving, that is what we expected.",4.375

Styling is bland compared to the Mazda5 but it does seat 7 instead of 6 (although very tight) and has ESC which the Mazda didn't, among many other good safety features.

Overall it drives nice and there is plenty of room in both front and second row.  The 3rd row is for children, but how many adults ride in a 3rd row?  There is virtually no room if the 3rd row is up.  As most vehicles in this size there is not room with a 3rd row.

I sought a vehicle that was a good value, had a practical aspect for light duty hauling, and that would be reliable with decent gas mileage.  I have been happy with the Rondo and it has mostly met the above criteria.  Bonus features that I found are that the V6 has good pickup and handles around corners well. Also I am 6'5'' and about 210 lbs. This car provides excellent headroom and decent leg room.  I like that the driver sits up fairly high with good visibility too.

WE traveled I-10 going to CA. and I-40 coming back as we went to the Grand canyon and all.

I traded in an 11 year old Subaru with 130,000 miles and was getting an average of 15 mpg doing the same type of driving.  Granted most of my trips are less than 4 miles each way, and the air conditioning is running.  Hopefully, when fall comes, and the air is no longer needed, the gas mileage will improve.

With the chair like seating, outstanding visibility through the large side windows, its a joy to drive.  The performance of the 4-cylinder never fails to impress me (it outperforms the 2.8L V6 on my previous vehicle) and provides great economy and very smooth shifts.

718, on 03/19/16 12:36 PM (PDT),Jason Robinson ,2007 Kia Rondo Wagon LX 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Great Economical Family Vehicle," We are the second owners. First owner was an Idaho Ed. Association rep that drove it around Idaho, so it got almost all highway miles from 0miles till we bought it at 110k.Since we bought it, we have driven to Austin, TX (from Boise.... with a 3yr old and a 1yr old) and to San Francisco from Boise (again, with a 3rd old and a 1yr old). But for the other 99% of the time, the Kia was a city car, shuttling my wife and kids across the city and back again. On a per mile basis, the car has spent ~61% of its time with us on city driving, and ~39% highway (very rough guess).About Acceleration:This is a gas sipper, but don't let that fool you, it really can get up and go. You can chirp the wheels on a turn if you mash the gas. The manual override shifting is a bit too much fun (could be too fun for teens I suppose, but it is a Kia, so they can't get into too much trouble).About Speed:Don't let an inline 4 cylinder fool you. This car can tick off those road trip miles.  On our Texas road trip, between New Mexico and the hundreds of miles of nothing in North West Texas, we were getting passed often...... and that is while we were going 90mph! Even 90mph isn't fast enough for some people in Texas. Who can blame them. That was a solid 7hrs of absolutely nothing to see. For one brief stretch I had the car up to 110mph (clocked via GPS) so I know this sucker can go even with a fully loaded car.About MPG:This thing is fantastic on MPG. We tracked mileage on Fuely.com for every fillup. For most of our use, the car was driven in city driving; the worst mileage possible. Crossing the city, sitting at stop lights, stop and go etc etc, over and over again.  Even in those situations it still got 18mpg. Imagine that... 18mpg is the worst this car can possibly do. The best was 34mpg on the long Texas trip. The faster you go, especially over ~55mph, the worse the mileage because wind resistance increases with the square of the speed. As a result, this little 4 banger was working pretty hard to get us up to 100mph, probably above 5k RPM. As a result, for that stretch of road, it got about 10mpg. On the other hand, my 1990 Chevy Suburban 6L v8 gets 8mpg no matter how fast or where you drive. So it could be worse... you could be filling up my truck!About Babies & Car seats:The Kia Rondo has the Latch system, so modern child seats are easy as cake to take in, out, in, out, move to the other side, and back over again, etc. I love the latch system. If you have child car seats, you will love the Kia and the Latch system.About Storage:Yes this is a compact car, but man does Kia know how to maximize storage in this frame.  With a hatchback and fold down second row of seats, I transported a table saw, a miter saw, shop vac, and compressor while I worked as a carpenter.  This thing has a lot of room back there.  With the seats up, the truck is still pretty spacious.  It fit all the suitcases and stuff needed to take a 8 day road trip to Texas and back for 4 people, including a baby stroller and two child car seats.  The trunk has two large storage compartments and two side smaller compartments for even more stuff.  Some people are afraid to leave cameras or purses in a vehicle that doesn't have a separate locking trunk.  The trunk compartments don't lock, but no one suspected that I had a DSLR, a laptop, and other camera equipment in this vehicle because theses were stowed out of sight in the below trunk storage.  The Kia also has a standard luggage rack on the roof, so many common car top carriers, bike racks, etc, can be installed for even more storage.About Technology:We had a base model, so there wasn't a lot of frills here.  Standard CD player and radio.  No XM, no bluetooth.  No USB ports or AUX input for the stereo.  No No DVD player or dual zone stereos / AUX inputs. But you can pay several thousand dollars more for those features.  My family is practically a professional road trip family, so we don't need to be cocooned in our own little entertainment world, even for 3 days of driving. Talk, listen to audio books, look at the scenery or nap (for passengers).  Nothing wrong with those options.  No review cameras or parking assist. But I know how to drive and park, so I don't really need to car to do that for me.  These extra frills",5

My 2007 Rondo LX is the best car I've ever owned -- better than my Pontiac Vibe, Acura Integra, 99 Rav4, Chevy Prizm or many Corollas. Car is the most versatile thing on the road, comfortable, good balance of power and decent gas mileage.  Have had no problems whatsoever after 3 years 40k miles. LOADS of safety features (6 airbags, antilock brakes, skid control). Can't beat this car w/out spending $10,000 more.  Only thing I don't love about it is of the 4 doors plus hatchback, there is only ONE keyhole.

The car gives a nice ride with great visibility.  The seating is very comfortable, especially on long trips.  I seem to get about 33 mpg when the freeway is functioning as intended.  The wide 16"" tires give a pretty good ride over our dilapidated roads.  We have plenty of room for our family of three to pack up all our camping gear and head for the hills. We bought both on sale ad at $12,999 each, look for sales.  Highly recommended.  Cons:  warped brake pad causes vibration when braking. Newer problem as steering has light knock when turning wheel left.    ",4.125

After the first week, return to dealer to have brakes fixed. Next, back to the dealer to fix banging noise. Front pass. strut was falling off. Next, back to the dealer to have BOTH front wheel bearings replaced. Car still howls like a demon because of bad bearing or u-joint, dealer can't/won't find and fix. Window deicers quit and the lights flicker at night when braking. Low profile tires make turnpike driving miserable. At 13k need to replace brake pads AND rotors. Seats stain when you look at them. Door locks have mind of their own. Car is a loser in the winter. Antiskid computer fights you.",2

I love all the space it has its the cheapest car that can fit a washing machine in it. I can haul almost anything in this car. I love all the leg room it beats out my wife's Toyota mine van from that stand point. I had the dealer drill holes so I can push the racks all the way to the front thereby make it so I can carry 3 large suitcases on the roof cant do that with any other cross over. I have been doing 28 mpg around town with the windows down. On a personal note if you need even more space you probably need a truck my fave being the m35a2 by Am General,5

The Rondo has been a good Car. Now has 27,000 miles on it. No repair needed.  I have grown to dislike the car however because  it handles so poorly.  The steering wheel has some uncomfortable vibration at around 65 mph, and the cabin is noisy at highway speeds.  I have to crank up the volume on the radio to hear anything. I could have bought a much nicer car for a little more money.  The worst part is the resale value.  If you want a small van that will hold its value better, the Mazda 5 is much better. ",2

Build quality is good (I've owned 10 Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas and Mazdas to compare with), although carpet in cargo area is cheap. I'm OK with the MPGs, which range from 19 to 27.

I have brand new all season radial on this car and still it cant get out of its own way.

The dealership detailed the interior several times to clean the stains which led to additional stains, each time trying new protectants which they stated should take care of the problem. According to the service manager Kia could replace the seats with the same fabric, at the time we decided to try the new fabric protector. One year later my interior looks like we have poured liquid all over, every stain shows, many from water.  I am very frustrated, would not recommend fabric interior.

We use it primarily for getting around town (avg = 20 mpg) and an occasional trip (avg = 24 mpg).  For a 4 cylinder automatic and I'd hope for higher gas mileage because it's such a LITTLE car compared to our Suburban.  We're in our sixties and drive conservatively. That's our only disappointment.  No squeaks or rattles in 11,000 miles. We change the oil regularly.  It is a VERY dependable car.

I wanted a car offering good visibility, top safety features, good styling, heated leather seats, easy to get in and out of, not too glitzy, good compartments for storage. I did not need a 3rd row of seats. I drove the comparable cars, as well as other Kia models; chose the Rondo because it offered everything I was looking for. I would not compare the Rondo to minivans, no matter what reviewers say - it's in a class of its own. I get compliments all the time. It's sporty, attractive exterior styling, and roomy interior. It holds a lot of cargo! I've owned my Rondo for over a year, and I'd definitely buy another one",4.875

Never considered a Kia. We looked at the Vue, Mazda 5, HHR, and Dodge Caravan before stumbling on the Rondo. Surprising to see so few on the road! Nice comfortable vehicle to drive. Lots of storage areas in car, and easy to configure car to store larger items. Our goal was a fuel efficient vehicle with lots of safety equipment, and this care fits that bill. Excellent vision out of the front windshield (minivan-like). Definitely recommend this car for families on a budget, but whom don't want to sacrifice safety of you & your kids!! Give this vehicle a try - glad we did. ",4.875

It gets great gas mileage, we are getting an average of about 23 mpg. We love it. It is easy to get in and out of, great visiblity and handling. Our only issue with it is when you have to drive through puddles of water, you temporarily lose your power steering. But there is a button you can push, and then you will not lose it. We live here in MI, and the last few days we have been getting blizzards, and with the ESC, it is great, it automatically pumps the brakes and keeps the car in control when you start to slide. I would recommend this car to anyone.",5

I thought I wanted a small/mid-size SUV until I tested them and discovered that they lean in curves too much for my liking, and what I really wanted was car-like handling with SUV space/flexibility.  The Rondo is the vehicle that offered that combination with a higher seating position and decent gas mileage.  I like the Vibe/Matrix, but the engine was not powerful enough, the backseat had no leg space and the cargo area is much smaller than the Rondo's.  Great deal for the money!",4.25

I took it to the dealer and they say that they found no problem.  I almost got into 2 accidents at 10 or 20 miles an hour.  I might try snow tires.  I was given no help at the dealership.

It test drove very nice w/great handling & enough ""get up & go"" in the 6-cyl to get out into traffic in a pinch.  We were able to load it up w/ALL of the bells & whistles.

To say I am pleased is an understatement.  I traded my 98 Legacy wagon on it, and though it lacks AWD, the Rondo is quite adept at handling our snowy December (our dealer added a set of studded winter tires on rims as part of the deal). I like the handling, the acceleration, the brakes, the looks, the comfort, the practicality, the quality - I like everything!  The 3rd row seats are great at toting an occasional 5th or 6th passenger, and provide lots of space when folded.  Everything works so smoothly and efficiently - the seats tumble or fold so well, the controls are smooth, etc. What a car! Truly one of the best values in autodom today.",4.625

Drop into 4th or 3rd when passing and you have NO worries on hills or passing - make the six cylinder work!  It can handle it.

No mechanical problems at all with this car.  We love it.  We have 8,000 miles on it.  The only drawbacks are that it never gets the advertised hwy mileage (we only get 24-26 MPG tops), and the road noise is evident when on a bumpy highway/road.  The features of this car were better than the traded vehicle (at half the price)--antilock AND stability control AND airbags all around.  Feels very safe, and I really enjoy driving it.

What the?," I am leasing this car for three years. After 3 months, I took it in for a recall (something to with the battery voltage protection device) and first oil change. The service department notified me that there was a milky substance in the oil. They could not diagnose the problem and had to call their own tech support for help. To make a long story short, my car has been in their repair shop for a week now. Hopefully, I can get it back in a couple of days. The service department took 5 days to diagnose the problem and they are replacing a high pressure pump. Even with this replacement, they aren't sure if this will solve the problem. The irony of this is I really intended on getting an all-electric vehicle because of the low maintenance required of electric motors. I settled on this plug-in hybrid because it allowed me to drive in all-electric mode for up to 29 miles. My commute to work is only 24 miles so the all-electric range was acceptable. I have driven the car for 3 months and still had a full tank of gas when I took the car in for service. I can't understand why the ICE engine has this major problem when I haven't even used the ICE engine when driving.Update: 7/10/18. I got my car back after being in the shop for a week. See the previous paragraph. After driving for a few weeks, the warning indicator light begins to blink on and off. The Hybrid system warning light also turns on. The manual recommends that I get the car back to the Kia Service Department. Again? You've got to be kidding me. I have driven this car for about 4 months and it is telling me it needs repair. Also, when charging the battery, the fan turns on and is quite loud. The fan never turned on before the warning lights started flashing so I'm assuming when charging, the battery is overheating. Pretty scary! I hope it doesn't catch fire. Anyway, I scheduled an appointment with the Kia Service Department and they can't look at the car for another week. I hope this problem is solved right away and the car is not in the shop for another week. So far, terribly disappointed in the reliability of this car.",1

To that end, the car is working exactly as advertised: for my frequent around town trips, I use almost no gas (I think 7 gallons over my first 1,000 miles of driving). So, while I love the car for its electric range, appearance, and comfort, the infotainment system is driving me absolutely crazy. I wouldn't have thought a poor touchscreen experience would be a big deal before I bought the car, but just imagine having to wait 15 - 30 seconds for it to boot up before you can adjust the climate control, use the backup camera, or listen to the music you want. Infuriating! Also, you have to plug in your iphone to use apple car play (no bluetooth capability in 2017? give me a break). Also, the app is a joke, it takes FOREVER to connect to the car for monitoring battery charge, security, and turning on climate control (so long that I usually sign in and walk away from my phone because I know it will take an eternity to connect, and even then it still fails quite often). On top of that, the Kia financing website where I pay for my lease is a joke as well, always seeming to have some excuse as to why I can't set up auto payments (again, unacceptable in this day and age). So overall I am enjoying the car for what it is, heck, even the acceleration and handling aren't too bad, but all of Kia's tech issues are going to scare me away to another manufacturer for my next car.",3

811, on 06/06/17 13:14 PM (PDT),samson ,2017 Kia Optima Plug-In Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),best plug in out there," KIA OPTIMA PLUG IN HYBRID 2017 With  so many cars on the market, one has to compare the many choices of the cars they are wanting to purchase. I had a Nissan Leaf for the last few years and loved that car, except I had to have another car to go out of town.  That changed when I met this plug in Optima Kia in 2017.  First, I got the Consumer Reports  April 2017  Car issue in order to make the right decision as well as read, articles in Green Car Reports.       I chose the 2017 Kia Optima  plug in EX hybrid, based on many factors. First, the Kia warranty on their cars are the best in the industry, 5 year 60,000 miles bumper to bumper.  Next, according to Consumer Reports the new car prediction and reliability is much better than average, this car is  recommended as a car to purchase. Further, the price given to me from Kia was great and well below sticker price and also I am able to get a tax rebate for the 9.8 KWH battery of $4919 on my tax for 2017.  Lastly, this Kia has an interior that is made of good  quality and design. This mid sided sedan has  plenty of room for the family.          I have been performing tests on the cars performance.  The main test was how many miles could I get out of a full charge of electricity.  There are several modes of operation, HEV, EV, and CHG and eco mode.  Driving in EV mode and (eco) for economical I was able to drive between 34 and 37 miles on electric only, and it did not seen to make a difference driving slow or a bit faster, however with this EV mode once you floor the gas pedal or accelerate a bit too fast the EV mode goes off to the HEV mode and then returns to EV mode.  If you drive normally the EV mode remains on electric until the battery is about  14% charge, then the car switches to HEV hybrid electric vehicle.  In HEV mode the car goes back and forth from gas engine to electric as all hybrids do.  The interesting mode of operation is the charge mode CHG which charges your battery to full just by driving your car.  This charge mode takes anywhere from an hour to two hours to charge the battery full. The kia Optima is probably the only car that has this great benefit. The CHG  mode barely affects the gas mileage.   I have not tested the car in the non- ECO mode but the acceleration in ECO  mode is fast enough for anyone. The car also has a 6 speed manual transmission if your a real racer.      In summary, as of year end 2017  the Kia Optima plug in EX hybrid is the  best car for the  price, quality and reliability.",5
812, on 02/25/17 11:11 AM (PST),Grant Calkins ,2017 Kia Optima Plug-In Hybrid Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),Great plug-in Hybrid!," This car is everything you could want in a plug-in hybrid, with a few (relatively) minor exceptions such as no programmable garage door opener buttons, charging door tricky to close after charging.  It's pretty much a grown-up Chevy Volt (which I also own and love!), but one thing Kia should have done differently: for smoothness in EV mode, have the electric motor directly power the wheels (ie eliminate the 6 speed auto trans in EV mode).  Also take note that KIA sells cars in non-traditional ways - apparently they do not allow their dealers to order any specific vehicles; they only sell what arrives on the car hauler truck.  This makes it difficult (sometimes impossible) to connect with the vehicle and dealer you like.  That said, the dealers apparently can ATTEMPT to identify and divert vehicles immediately after manufacture.  Also, Kia's web site makes it very convenient to view all dealer's inventories for specific vehicles.  All said and done, I would definitely buy another Kia.  Grant Calkins, Bend, OR",5

814, on 07/18/17 11:53 AM (PDT),Amy M ,2013 Kia Forte Koup Koup SX 2dr Coupe (2.4L 4cyl 6A),The little car that can!," I have owned this car since I bought it new. I was skeptical because KIA used to make, well, cheap stuff. I always thought of them like a geo metro or dodge neon arena.  But this car is solid feeling. It has held up wonderfully. It looks just as good as it did new still minus the floor mats, the embroidered red lettering which of course is not so red these days.  The first thing I did in the KIA was to fix the stiff handling by having performance suspension installed, it's a little bumpier but man can that sucker corner now! I have let the rest remain stock, the car has some punch, and it is a BLAST to drive it.  The seats are for short people, I am taller and so I cannot drive long distances in this car without my back hurting unless I add my own lumbar support in the right spot so I don't take this car on long road trips often.  The car is lower than stock and looks sleek and because I removed the KIA badges people often mistake it for a Lexus or something much more expensive.  People really dig the lines on this car design and I get a lot of compliments on it.  I paid like 15k new for this car and I feel it was well worth the value I have gotten out of it in driving enjoyment alone.  I have never had a mechanical issue with the car.  This car came with a 20-year powertrain warranty.  Its a fun zippy little sports car for cheap, I would buy another.  I traded a Mazda P5 in on this and while it doesn't sound as cool as the Mazda engine did, it outperforms it in HP and acceleration, but stock it did not in handling and never will in comfort.Update 07/2018: This car is a champ. Not one mechanical issue with this car on the 4th year of owning it and it runs as responsive and well as it did the day I bought it. Kia has been wonderful at keeping it maintained and making sure it is in regularly for service. I am thinking about trading it in for a newer car because I am looking for something that will go better in snow but this car has been one of the best cars I have owned hands down.",4

The radio went out at 95k, which was kind of frustrating, but not the end of the world. My only real complaint is the resale value. Depreciation is an issue with all financed cars, but Kia's resale value is ridiculously low. It'd make a great cash car.

824, on 11/30/15 19:28 PM (PST),Nicole ,2013 Kia Forte Sedan SX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Great car for smooth flat roads Awsome MPG," I had this car a year and a half now and drove it on a 3 month cross country road trip by myself. This car gets excellent gas mileage 39 mpg on highway the lowest in the city was 22mpg but i think thats because the tires got a little low. This car has a lot of great features, bluetooth to sync with phone, usb and Aux inputs were great on long roadtrips to listen to flashdrive or another device, and cd player too, sat radio is available too. I loved all the controls on the steering wheel to control stereo, phone and cruise control. Loved all the storage space in front as well. The front and rear seats are comfortable, the headrests are adjustable in all directions which is nice. Im pretty tall so having a telescoping steering wheel is really nice to have less strain on body. The cons are the suspension, shocks or maybe the tires i am not sure what the cause is but can feel every single crack, bump and rough part of the road. Its ok if you live in the south where the roads are smooth and flat but once you get on roads it kind of rough on your body. The shocks were so bad that after exploring on some rough dirt roads that one of the heat shields broke on my trip.  Also when i was in the mountains it seemed to have trouble going up steep hills maintain constant speed with cruise control and had to put the gas to the floor to get up some of them when people behind me seemed to want to go faster. The fan for the air conditioner heater is super loud but not as loud as the road noise when going on the highway add them both together and people cant barely hear ya when you try to make a call using bluetooth and you have to yell to talk with someone next to you. Overall this is a great car to get around town in or if you live where their is nice smooth roads!!! This car doesn't work for my lifestyle at the moment so im looking for an SUV with better socks, less noise, more cargo room, but i think i will have to sacrifice the excellent gas mileage of this Kia Forte has.",4

835, on 08/02/18 14:46 PM (PDT),Dan Davis ,2017 Kia Forte Sedan S 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Suprisingly good car," I've been traveling a great deal and this is one of my favorite small rental cars.  Electronics/entertainment with the upgraded S model are great, with a very functional Apple CarPlay.  Climate controls are simple and easy to use.  Handling, the car has very easy turning and control.  In the S trim, I felt a significant difference from the LX.  This is probably due to the alloy rims and wider tires on the S vs the LX.  I would definitely opt for an S if I were in the market for this type of car.  It's great for non freeway roads, parking, small turning radius, things you want if you're looking for a runabout or short freeway hop vehicle.  Response from the engine is good up to normal speeds, a bit sluggish once you start trying to pass people at 70+ (or around 80) as is common in larger metro areas.  As the engine is not a turbo, there's no turbo lag and power delivery is very smooth.  Excellent gas mileage too.  Seating in small cars is usually a big deal for me, as I'm a bit overweight.  However, this was very comfortable compared to other small cars.  There is only one car in this category I've liked better (excluding the Accent, which is essentially the same) after driving a slew of similar vehicles from many manufacturers, and that was the Chevy Cruze.  The Cruze has more power, more style, and better electronics.  However, Cruze also has auto engine stop and a small displacement turbo, which may be maintenance issues in the future.  It's also slightly more expensive.",4

Some days it wouldn't accelerate good and it was not cranking right.  Then on June 17 2018 the engine light came on and flashed six times which is a sign that something wasn't good.  I took it to the dealer and they thought it was the ignition coils they changed them and I left the lot.  An hour later the engine light came back on and I took it back wound up being the whole engine was useless.

The Forte is eye catching and the interior is spacious and comfortable. I have never owned a Kia before but I must say it has not disappointed me. It rides well and stops very well due to the 4 wheel disc brakes. It does have a firm ride but not too firm. The trunk is huge and there is ample room for passengers in the rear seating area.

I'm 5'8"" and my boyfriend is 6'5"" and we agree that the front seat is really comfy and accommodating for tall folk.I adore the outside of the car, too - the little front windows between the windshield and the mirrors (what do you call those?) are so charming to me. The only kind of off-putting thing about this car is that the display lights up even if your headlights aren't on. That took some getting used to, and I definitely accidentally drove with my lights off a couple of times the first week.I have the LX with the popular package and I think the technology is perfect - I really enjoy having a back-up camera and the displays are all really user-friendly and aesthetically attractive.

It takes forever to clear windshield. windshield washer solution often freezes on contact so driver cannot see.  Large blind spots in front and back that totally hide a car or a person. Pulling out is dangerous; it has very slow pick-up, especially if starting on a hill or pulling out in traffic. Tires spin on wet roads, similar to a Honda. Headlights do not automatically turn off when engine turns off. The only indicator is a tiny light on the dashboard screen that can be hidden by the steering wheel (no beep). Dashboard lights up even when headlights are not turned on; one has to be careful to remember that headlights are not on at dusk, even though dash is lit up. I find this to have been a dangerous car for an older person to use. I dislike this car very much, but, of course, its resale value is so much less than purchase price.",1

Many complain about the acceleration but it is a compact sedan, not a sport car. However, she has adequate power to pass even the sports cars if need be. The interior of the cabin is comfortable. The controls are easily acessible. And surprisingly, the MPG gets 32 combined as promised by Kia, even when I'm feeling heavy footed. When I'm cruising, sometimes I average 44 MPG.

I previously owned a 2015  and a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage, which professional reviewers hated.  I never understood their complaints about those cars until I bought my Kia.  I suppose when you test drive cars for a living, there is a huge difference in the ride of a low-end (cheap) vehicle versus a top of the line luxury car.  But bottom line is cars all do essentially the same thing.  Yes, I know that heated seats and navigation systems and leather interiors are nice, but they really are not necessary.  The only thing I would be willing to pay more money for is a safer vehicle.  (There is not one car out there that can guarantee I won't be hurt or worse in it, so nothing is worth the cost of a small house!)  That being said, I got a lot of bang for my buck with this Kia.  Great looks, nice ride, awesome gas mileage.  I do see the difference in the handling vs my Mirage.  I do now know why horsepower (or lack of) is important. Still, I don't need a Lexus or Mercedes to get a comfortable ride and nice interior.  I'm definitely experiencing Kia love!",5

From the second I started the test drive I knew it was the car for me. It has great handling and is pretty quick for a 4 cylinder. The interior has nice materials and easy to use controls. Even though it’s a new car and needs to be broken in, I have been getting around 30-32mpg almost all city driving ( but I do tend to drive a little fast.) The only con I have with this car is that even on the EX model (without the premium plus package) the drivers seat isn’t electric and there is no auto dimming mirror. It’s not a deal breaker but they would be nice without having to pay ~$5k more. Overall this is a great car and offers great value for what you pay for.",4

After back and forth with my salesman, we decided I would test drive a 2017 Kia Forte, a car I hadn't even considered all day.  It was great!  Spent some time after that dickering the price down to something I could live with and hit the road in my new vehicle.  I haven't had it terribly long yet, but it drives like a dream so far.

855, on 05/19/17 13:29 PM (PDT),joe mccorry ,2017 Kia Forte Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6A),pleasantly surprised," first let me say tis is the first brand new car I purchased/leased since 2001.  Until oct. 2014 I was driving a Chevrolet cavalier.  in 2014 it was going to cost me over $4000 just to get it ready to pass inspection.  surprising to mea s it only had about 80,000 miles on it.  so I traded it in on a 2008 Hyundai elentra.  very pleasant surprise.  it got about 6 mpg more then the cavalier.  had the elantra for about 2 and half years.  had 78,000 miles on it.   when I traded it in on the 2017 kia forte lx it had a little over 86,000 miles on it. as you can see I don't do a ton of driving in a year.  decided to check out a deal I heard on the radio from a local Pennsylvania dealer.  very misleading ad.  in the ad they stated that they would guarantee $6000 for your trade and $9000 off list price of a new 2017 sonata.  called the dealer as I did not want to drive over an hour for nothing.  the salesman told me I had misheard the ad.  it was either the $6000 trade in or $9000 off list price. I was not the only one who heard the ad the way I did. so I started looking at other Hyundai dealers. after talking with the sales people they informed that an elntra might be a better fit for me.  as the incentives were better.got some ok deals. then remembered that kia was the sister company of hyundai so   I called a couple of kia dealers and asked about the optima.  but since I wanted to stay at roughly the same monthly payment I was at they recommended the forte.  took one out for a test drive and found I liked it better than the 2017 elentra I had test driven. comparing the elantra and forte to me I found the forte better handling and as good a ride.  the interior of the forte again to me seemed better quality.  got the forte on 4/7/2017.  have had it a month and I am very happy with it.  I am getting over 30 mpg in what is basically local driving.  would recommend this over the elantra.  also have to like the 5 yr warranty.",5

Was not aware when we purchased it that cruise control is not standard on all cars. Since we have had the car the front bumper and left headlight had to be replaced apparently due to shipping. They were both scratched up and not fixable without replacing them. Now at less than 2500 yes read that again less than ""2500"" miles the transmission has to be replaced!!! Apparently there have been 26 Kia Forte's that have had this problem and now I am # 27. I like the feel of the car, the color, all the Bluetooth options and the roominess but so far I have not been impressed at all with running of it.

The kicker is the 5 yr. basic warranty vs the 3 yr warranty on most other makes.  The car drives well,  looks great, feels solid, and is highly dependable.  The only ""distraction"" I've encountered is the ""lag"" in acceleration when trying to moderately increase speed at around 40 -- 50 mph.  There's a slightly noticeable dead zone.  Additionally, there might be an anomaly with the emergency autonomous braking system -- it sometimes fails to warn of a possible frontal collision, but it may be just me.  Kia says they can't check it out thoroughly.  Other than that, I see nothing but a great deal and happy ownership with my Forte 2.0 liter purchase.",4

I am very happy about the car. Fuel economy is great, interior is good and when it comes to exterior it does not look like a cheap car at all. Brake system exceeded my expectation. However,My comment on performance is different. Acceleration for this 2.0 L engine is weak. When it comes to merging into traffic make sure you have enough room with incoming cars because you are not able to speed up quickly!

862, on 11/15/16 13:22 PM (PST),Forte Pro ,2017 Kia Forte Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6M),My second Forte," Bought a 2010 Forte LX (5 speeds manual) back in 2010. 160K miles later, I had to trade it in for a 2017 Forte LX (manual 6 speeds). What an improvement ! First of all, not one problem, itch or snooze on my previous Kia. Never opened the hood. All oil changes done by professionals. I already had great mpg, but this new one ? Even better. Manual says 32 city/39 Highway. I get 41 city/45 Highway. Of course, my commute (120 miles per day - 20% city and 80% Thruway) is pretty much on flat road (no hills) and the temperatures are constantly over 40 degrees. Good dry conditions. Speed of 70-75 mph when Tach read 2,750 rpm. This car purrs and swallows the miles one by one. Comfort is what you can expect from a ""small"" car. Everything being new, you need some time to get used to it, or for the car to get used to you. Now, odd enough, no spare tire nor donut in the back trunk. Just some kind of fix-your-flat-yourself-kit with a plug-in pump (and patch?), enough for 50 miles to get to a station (?).The dash boards illuminates nicely and I still have not figured out why the outside temperature reading starts flashing when it get under 40 degrees F (or everytime it drops under 30, 20 etc...). Acceleration is nice, although there seem to be a soft spot when starting in 1st gear which obliges you to push and reach 4,000 rpm or shift into second very quickly. The sound is definitely not premium. Automatic windows is a nice upgrade from my previous Kia and the electronic lock/unlock is also a nice addition. I hope to have it last a long time. From previous experience, it will.Update after owning this Forte for 7 Months:Winter is over. No special tires, just the ones this car came with and no problem on the snow (and God knows that Rochester, NY, can have plenty of it). No sliding. Really happy about the mileage per gallon. Constantly hitting the 47.5 mpg, although this little car doesn't seem to like the rain (or the cold). At 2,500 rpm, on highway, you should easily get 50 mpg without pushing your gears too much (of course, no extra weight/passengers/luggage). Still a ""dead spot"" when starting in 1st gear and I suspect a ""bad"" electronic distribution, but not enough to put that car through computer testings. So far so good. Reliable it is.A year has passed. Mileage per gallon is still the same 47-48 miles per gallon, although I suspect that this will change with the cold weather coming. Still, no problem and hood is staying closed (besides oil changes done by pros).  Still very happy with the purchase",4

865, on 10/26/16 10:51 AM (PDT),KiaFan ,2015 Kia Forte Hatchback Forte5 SX 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Little Unknown Hot Hatch!, I bought this car new in 2015 with little known about it. Kia doesn't advertise it at all. The SX model is well worth the extra money in my opinion with a pretty powerful 201hp turbo 1.6 liter 4. I travel 100 miles a day in this thing and average 30mpg on premium gas. This car DOES NOT like cheap gas!! It performs poorly and idles even bad on 87. I do on occasion run 89 octane which it does do ok but I do still feel a difference. The car handles great and brakes are super strong. Very stable car!  I like the manual trans but wished they didn't use economy gearing. It has plenty of power for a lower ratio which would equal better mpg.  In 40k miles now it has been pretty trouble free. Biggest grip on this car is the steering which is electric and hard to get use to. It tends to wander on the road because there isnt a center feeling to the steering and the slightest input you do and will veer off.  Car shows no wear besides the few rock chips. You really cant beat the warranty with KIA and Hyundai brands. This is my 3rd product from them and I am very pleased.  Great thing is you rarely see another on the road because they are unknown.,4

I didnt even know Kia made this car until some online new car browsing. Got a great deal and was actually pretty hard to find one which means you stand out since rare to see another. Turbo engine has great pick up at any speed or gear! 6 speed manual trans is alittle too geared towards city driving vs hwy. 5th and 6th just isnt a hwy gear it should be. I average 30mpg with high octane gas. Car hates cheap gas. Great build quality and warranty!! The zip and handing makes it fun. I even embarressed a GTI on hwy. This is a low car so getting out and in provides some hand support from the seat. Options galore on the SX model like heated and cooled seats in front and heated in back which is rare for this class of car. Heated steering wheel . Mine didnt come with the Nav and Hid headlights but not spending the extra $$$ on a in dash Nav with phones these days. Only two main gripes with this car is radio just sucks for sound and loudness and steering is electric with is very touchy with any input makes you wander. Also it seems to have a ""sticky"" feeling when driving straight . Its brief but alarms you when u go to turn . Otherwise been a great,reliable fun car! **Update** -- I now have almost 50k miles of no mechanical issues what so-ever. Has never let me down and still feels and looks new. I do get alot of road noise but mainly due to replacing tires with something that wasnt as quiet. Not the cars fault.",4

It's probably the best car I ever owned. Are there things about it I don't like? Yes, that's why I only gave it 4 stars (didn't know how to give it 4 1/2 stars). Having said that, I would buy another one in a heartbeat.PROS1. This is the 2nd KIA I've owned and both of them have been perfect mechanically. I haven't had one mechanical issue. It just cannot get any better than that. I also know two other people who had KIAs for at least 3 years and neither one of them had a single mechanical problem.2. The car is sleek and people constantly tell me how cool it looks. I love looking at it every time I approach my car.3. It's extremely comfortable and I thoroughly enjoy driving it. Is it fun to drive? I think so.4. The A/C  system works great in a very hot, southern climate. It even came with front seats which can be heated (I don't need that where I live) and/or cooled.5. The UVO system is terrific and very easy to use.6. The instrument panel is clear, easy to read, and very informative. I could do almost everything I wanted without ever looking at the manual.7. I love my Sirius XM Satellite Radio.8. Lots of storage space with 5 door Hatchback plus the special storage container under the normal floor in the rear is very handy.9. My KIA dealer treats the customers like gold.10. Very affordable but it has the quality of a more expensive car.11. Very good highway mileage12. Nobody beats the KIA warranty. I feel great because I had no problems, but if I did, it's always covered under the warranty.CONS1. Wind noise, especially on the highway (seems to be a problem with KIAs)2. Poor city stop and go mileage. Maybe it's because I'm always taking very short trips with lots of traffic lights where I accelerate briskly?  It's hard to tell if it's my driving style or the vehicle. I think it's a combination of both.3.  The standard tires are just OK but very noisy. I'm used to riding on Michelins which are far superior.4. The instrument panel is very cool but one gauge says MPH instead of MPG for the average miles per gallon 5. With one exception the navigation system works great, plus it has a large, easy to read screen. That one exception,unless I have a specific address to punch in,  is it's often difficult to find what I'm looking for . For some unknown reason it's hard to find venues. In other words, it isn't user friendly.",4

Couldn't beat the financial incentives at Kia, and this car is an extremely attractive package for the money.  Fit and finish is fantastic, base equipment exceeded our expectations.  Was a bit concerned about the smaller engine/turbo combination, but it has proved to be a perfect powerplant for this car:  keeps it light and more than adequate acceleration.  Ride quality, even with the low profile tires fitted, is several levels above the car we replaced, a 2010 Kia Forte Koup.  At this point, admittedly early on, we are completely satisfied with this vehicle, and love the practicality of the 4 door hatchback design.",5

One of my favorite cars was a prior GTI even though it was also the least reliable car I've owned.  I never thought I'd see myself in a KIA but they have really stepped up in recent years.  Their designs and reliability are some of the best in the business now.  The Forte5 SX with the 6 speed manual is a blast to drive.  The power is readily available at low RPMs.  The interior is spacious and fits my 6'7 frame well with plenty of room to spare.  I don't even need to have the seat all the way back which is exceptionally rare.  The ride is quite comfortable.  I'm averaging 31mpg(hand calculated, computer says 32-33) in mixed driving.  The power folding mirrors may seem a bit gimmicky at first, but they sure are nice to have in a narrow 2 car garage.  It's not quite as quick as a GTI nor does it handle quite as well, however you can buy one of these in SX trim for under $18k with a long warranty to boot.  Put a little of that savings into some suspension and power upgrades and you're on par.  If you're looking for a fun hatchback definitely give one of these a test drive.",5
871, on 10/27/15 09:10 AM (PDT),James Bridges ,2015 Kia Forte Hatchback Forte5 EX 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 6A),"The ""I'm getting to know it better!"" review"," After purchasing the car I felt as though you wanted a review too soon. I hadn't gotten to know the ins and outs of the car yet. Now I can give an honest and detailed review. 2017: I've gotten to know this car better since I bought it in 2014. First of all, the acceleration, handling, steering they're all good. But, I've noticed that the brakes tend to lose pressure if I am applying the brake while encountering a severe bump or pothole, or even a patch of ice. According to the service department my brakes are fine so there must be a problem in the engineering or design.2017: The brake response to loose gravel, ice or rough patches when applying the brake hasn't gotten any better. But I've learned to adjust my braking in order to accommodate it. I hope, in the future, you have an ordinary driver test your brakes and give you an honest opinion. If they do, you're bound to change things.Second, this car is noisy! I have all windows closed and it still sounds as though they are open! And, even with new tires I get bumps aplenty when traveling even new paved roads. I don't know if it is suspension or tires but it rattles my teeth.2017: The noise hasn't improved. Besides the rattles the car is developing, the wind noise and road noise is still pretty loud. I've even considered having thicker carpet installed, or maybe an undercoating. The windows are still very touchy.Speaking of the windows, they don't work very well. If you try to raise or lower them just a bit, the motor takes over and they open or close completely. Inconvenient and potentially dangerous in the wrong situation.Third, and this is VERY important, the dashboard lights up even when you don't have your lights on. I'm old enough to know that a lit dash board is a sure sign of your headlights being on. When the dash is already lit you can forget to turn them on. For inattentive drivers this can be disastrous. Also, your headlights do not melt snow. In most of this country you get snow in the winter. If the headlights don't melt it you can't see and the other driver can't see you. It's dangerous. 2017: With the increasing number of cars out there with light up dashboards, I am seeing an increase in unobservant people driving with their lights off. I hope you reconsider and turn off the dash lights in future models. I also hope you go back to incandescent head lamps so the snow will melt from the heat and make driving safer. I do like the back up camera. I was confused at first but now I truly appreciate it.The remote. This overly large remote is so sensitive that it sets off the alarm if I bump my pocket. It needs to be smaller with recessed buttons, or have a cover over the buttons to prevent accidental operation. The trunk door. This door can be opened from the outside if I am in it with my remote in my pocket THAT is dangerous for those who prefer to keep their doors locked. You REALLY need to look into that.The windows fog up in the winter if the fan isn't blowing full blast. The windshield wipers do not do a very good job, especially the rear wiper.2017: The back up camera is still an improvement but the remote, the trunk door and the defrosters are still a problem. If the inside windshield is the least bit dirty, the defrosters don't defrost. The service department in my area is GREAT! These guys do an amazing job keeping the car in good condition, but I notice that the engine still sounds rough sometimes even after a tune up. I'm at about 28,000 miles I hope this won't be a trend as it gets older.I wish it got better gas mileage. I get about 30 mpg on the highway and around 25 in the city but I thought an engine this size could be better.I'll worry about the resale value later.All in all I like the car for what it is, an economy car. But I hope your future cars can address these points I have indicated because there is a good chance I will buy another KIA in the future.2017: I am going to be hanging on to this car for a few more years yet so you have time to consider my concerns.

In addition, when an opportunity presents itself, the manual shifting turbo engine is wickedly good fun.  Is this a car to take track-racing?  Of course not, but the upside is that it's a pleasant and fun daily driver.  However, know that the stiffer suspension disallows this car from being a comfortable highway cruiser when the pavement gets dicey.   Nevertheless, if you're in the market for a fun-to-drive hatchback with space  for 4 (not just seating, but actual space!) definitely check out the Forte5 SX. So far, my mileage has been about 3 better than the rated MPG from KIA, and that's in 50/50 mixed driving.  I've also gotten (mostly) used to the much-maligned flex-steer.  I rarely take it out of the 'normal' setting.  On occasion I'll use 'sport' on a crowded, twisty interstate, and even less frequently I'll use 'comfort' when cruising on a well-paved, empty highway.  Worth noting, even though UVO works well, the stock speakers are absolutely terrible.  Given that UVO is such a key component of KIA's marketing, they should immediately discontinue the current speakers and use the Infinity upgrade materials they have available for other vehicles (but not the Forte . . .?).Finally, given KIA's incentivized sales approach, there is no way not to get a good deal.  Especially on this under-marketed, under-appreciated, and undersold car.  Based on all the info I can find online, I ended up paying less than inventory price by a couple hundred dollars.",4

I bought this vehicle from my local KIA dealership on 7/10/2015 brand new off the lot. This car has a nice list of features/options you are able to get and customize like any other car. I was always a ford vehicle customer in the past until I purchase a 2010 CHEVY Malibu (JUNK) which was a complete nightmare I hated that car so I end up trading it for this.I purchased the EX Trim of the Forte, because of the options I seen on the car I was impressed with the price value of the sticker.Comparing to other compact cars this is a great value that not many can compete with.Pros:-Warranty-(Keep this in mind if you are purchasing a KIA dealers may try to add on extras not needed)10-year/100,000-mile limited powertrain warranty5-year/60,000-mile limited basic warranty5-year/100,000-mile limited anti-perforation warranty5-year/60,000-mile roadside assistance plan-Luxury Side-Automatic Folding MirrorsPush Button StartHeated/Air Cooling Driver SeatHeated Passenger SeatsDual Climate Control-Technology Side-Back Up CameraSatellite RadioUVO System (AMAZING)NavigationWith the UVO System you can log into your account and see your driving score and base on the score it will give you tips.-Performance-Handles Great around turns2.0L Engine Gas Direct InjectionHighway Driving I have seen 34 MPGAround my area is rural I usually get approximately 29-32 MPGCons:Acceleration is a bit slow at timesIt would be pretty cool if the GPS screen is a pinch to zoom type of screenFeature list on website is limited even for the ex trimWish it had some interior lighting for at night like on most the newer ford carsResale Value isn't all that great on KIA'sCarpet Floor Mats is a option that should be standard not paying extra for it (Pay $75 for it)Back up camera can be a bit foggy at times",5
876, on 08/09/15 19:29 PM (PDT),Marie OKeefe ,2015 Kia Forte Coupe Koup SX 2dr Coupe (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Would not buy another KIA," The resale value is terrible. I have owned the car for 2 yrs and things have not gotten better. Mileage has not improved. Brought it in for an oil change and they said they did an upgrade on the tire pressure system. Got in my car..and the tire indicator was blinking Told them what was going on and was told to give it a couple of days to adjust.   5 days later it is still on, back to the dealer ..they tell me it showed a code and was fine. I get in the car..still tire pressure light is on. Go back to shop...only to find out that they now have to order a part.  I didn't ask for the update. I asked for an oil change..once the part is in..it will be my 3rd trip back to the dealer's in less than two weeks. Shouldn't happen when all I wanted was an oil change. Can't wait to get another car.This car vibrates when foot is on the break...dealer says it is normal but I don't see anything that says it is normal. It also hesitates when going from 40 to 50. Gas mileage is awfulabout 18 mpg. Again dealer says it will better better when it is broken in.  I have had the car for 6 months but it only has about 1200 miles.  I am bringing it to the dealer again for its regular check up and hopefully this time they will check it out thoroughly.  Doesn't impress me at this point.",3

879, on 09/01/17 02:53 AM (PDT),Satisfied enough ,2015 Kia Forte Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Not a bad purchase overall," I have had this car for about 2 months now, I loved the sleek style of this car. Silver with Black wheel covers and the darkest tinted windows I have ever seen. Interior design is nice as well and cleans up great. The car has attitude! (visually) I saw the dealer I bought it from listed it on car gurus, as having premium pckg moon roof and leather and it was sharp!   I get there and its a base model, no premium ANYTHING! Not even cruise control. I test drove the 6 speed manual silver Slow poke and realized it was a great gas saver and really, Drove pretty easily. The 1st bad thing I noticed immediately... the power, It has none! Even winding out the engine on the highway to get every ounce of power for just catching cruising speeds can make you feel like your in a damned ford escort from the 90s.  (No attitude there) The clutch engages great but when the car is cold the engine seems to rev when the clutch is pressed and it makes shifting a bit challenging for smooth operation. (I have extensive experience driving manual) this one needs some RPMs in order to get her going from a dead stop. It is fun to drive in town. The tires however are horrible for taking corners. You can not push this car, its a cruiser/gas saver...treat it like that, haha.  Stereo is crap,Bluetooth hooks up after about 30-60 seconds, even when your phone is hooked up. It isn't user friendly. I have another ride with a cheap little replacement stereo that hooks up as soon as the car is on. its fast, I was going to replace the head unit but that's 400 bucks!!! No thanks!  Also, I have Sirius radio and its okay, but the sound overall is very bad. ""Door speakers only?""  yeah that's what i said...  if its going to suck most areas...this area is NOT one of them that should lack, I dislike the skimping for sound systems. Yeah yeah I know, there are upgraded versions. But the base model should still have SOME KIND OF SOUND QUALITY! But it does not. Steering...its tight and is okay, seems a bit ""go carty"" no real center established and likes to pull to the right a bit. Its been aligned. Overall its just a learning curve, I do not really notice it now.  Gas mileage is nice, but I haven't seen 37 mpg yet. I am not much of a highway driver, I am pulling in about 25 mpg consistently. My 2005 stratus got 17 mpg so, its a nice jump. Paid 9k and I am not to upset about it. had 40k miles and currently the only engine issue seems to be valve train rattle on low end of RPMs. It isn't to bad but I can tell its going to be, guess ill have it serviced and try to keep her purring. One more thing I dislike, the suspension is very stiff when you hit larger bumps, the rear end actually tries to swing out from under you...so go very slow over tracks and such. But!...  I would have to say though after driving this thing for a couple months, it is rather nice to look at and it is a head turner even though it lacks in performance she still has that, ""ohh that's nice"" quality.  I find myself climbing into it and thinking I finally have piece of mind about the car I own. Just know its not a performance ridden sound system having corner taking mustang, its great for daily driving or highway travel. (interstate, not so much) with the Interstate being a pot hole haven this ride is not going to handle it. One big bump with the wrong person driving this car, your in the ditch. I guess most of this post is negative, well, I have a need/want for a certain kind of vehicle, I did not buy that..I bought cheap and reliable, this car is just that. I shall buy another ride for interstate driving corner taking and bump absorption.  Now go buy a 6 speed KIA, floor it, and cruise through town like you own it!  Because cruising is all you can do in this thing!",4

That said, this car is incredible. My second Kia. The last was a new Optima 2012 EX, also great. I leased this one after 3 years with the Optima, and stepped down because a) my lease $ dropped from 295 to 165 and b) I couldn't tell the diff between the models on the road until I was right on top of them. Comfort-wise, just about as comfy (great seats and leg room) but a little smaller than the Optima, but no issue for me and I'm 6'2"" and 225. Given the price, I don't see how I could have done better. Good for 5 people, the 1.8 engine is just fine, and on the highway I get between 42 and 46 mpg @ 65-70. Amazing. Around town/stop and go it's more like 23-24.

However, the older I get the less I can take a bumpy ride.  So I began the search for a sedan with a better ride and more comfort.  Since my husband had recently bought a Kia Sportage and loved it, I looked into the Forte.  I purchased my car through a deal offer on Edmunds and am I happy?  You Bet Cha!  I'm getting 31to 32 miles per gallon and the smoothest ride anyone could want.  I got a great price and the Hendrix Group in Concord, NC, followed through on the deal with no bait and switch!

No mechanical problems or issues  at all. It has plenty of room for a compact car. I saw some people said visibility is an issue, but for me ( I'm 5'7)  visibility is just fine. I have the base engine, and granted it could use a little more power, and fuel economy is about average not great.  The interior is really nice especially when compared to other compact cars that I looked at.  KIA has definitely come a long way. PROS: Price, Style, Standard features,  Interior quality. CONS:  Base engine under powered, standard '15 wheels are cheap looking for such a nice car.",5
884, on 10/01/15 15:36 PM (PDT),Jim Shackelford ,2015 Kia Forte Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 6A),Overall a good buy," The Kia Forte has lots of competition -- Corolla, Civic, Impreza, Mazda 3, Ford Focus, VW Golf, Hyundai Elantra (similar) and others.  None of these is best at everything.  We've had the Kia for 42 months now.  An LX base package, automatic transmission.  We wanted a hatchback, but the bigger engine that comes with it uses more fuel.  The standard 1.8 has more than ample power everywhere, and is an outstanding match for the transmission.  The ride, engine/transmission, warranty, price, reliability, and overall design were why we bought the car.  They continue to be its strengths.  In a 160 mile test drive we got 41 highway, 27 city gas mileage.  These figures have held up over the last year.  We generally use the Eco button on the dashboard.  So it is better than average in its class on fuel, similar to a Honda Fit.  (Update:  At about 4000 miles we started getting between 43 and 47 mpg in long highway trips.  At 19,000 miles, we continue to be in the 43-47 mpg area, 40 in the mountains.  Occasionally get 50 mpg on a 200 mile trip.)This car is especially likeable on hilly, curvy highways, or on expressways in the West Virginia mountains.  And it tends to get 39-40 mpg in those conditions, an extra plus.Weaknesses are shared by many newer cars of other manufacturers:  the design limits vision anywhere to the rear of the driver; headrest positions are not great; rear window gets dirty quick; not especially easy to enter/exit the car, shape of car is harder to park than older models.   Not as nimble as a Honda Fit in the city.Looks like the Forte is meant to go head to head with the Honda Civic.  We previously had a 2005 Honda Civic.  This is a better car in most ways, except for the weaknesses I just mentioned, which most manufacturers have adopted.  It handles crosswinds on expressways much better than that Civic.  Rides smoother.  Handles even better.  Engine feels very strong.Based on experience so far, we'd buy it again, though still wishing for a hatch with the standard engine.  We also could not buy one in white that wasn't a hatch.  The Mazda 3, Ford Focus, Subaru, and VW Golf all have a lot of good things going for them, but this seems like the best overall car.  I would compare it to Toyota and Honda in the 90s.  It will not knock your socks off, but it is maybe the best car to own.Two specific gripes:  Driver's side window has always been a little noisy when shut, more like a ten-year-old car.  The Dealer found no fix.  In warm weather on a long trip sometimes the steering wheel will tighten up in the middle, making it hard to make the minor unconscious adjustments you make on a straight expressway.  On curvy roads, we've never had this problem.  So it seems related to warmth and not using the steering wheel much.  The dealer did not experience this on their test drive.  I believe it is a problem with some percentage of these 2015 Fortes.Update April 2017:  Our continued satisfaction with this car has us interested in the new Kia Niro hybrid, which is highly reviewed and not real expensive.  If we were to add a second car, that'd be our first place to look.",5
885, on 09/14/15 15:32 PM (PDT),amanda ,2015 Kia Forte Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 6A),EEGGHH it's ok..but not great," We have had our kia forte for about 3 months now. We took it for it's first oil change which in our contract stated the first years worth would be free. After they were done, they tried to charge us for it. We of course pointed out that they were supposed to be free. Had to wait for them to get in contact with our sales person and verify that yes, it should be free. Apparently they do not notate it at the sale when they promise you certain things so you have to basically fight for it when it comes to actually getting what you were promised. Now, we have a popping sound in the steering wheel for about a week.  Called the service dept and they said to bring it in. Took it in today..was told that it was at least a 2 hour wait for them to get to it just to find out what was wrong. We told them we cannot wait that long and would we get a rental car? Was told that they will only give us a rental car if the car is either kept overnight or if they deem it undriveable.  Otherwise we have to bring it up there, and sit and wait until they can get to it. Awesome service. Because I can afford to take off of work to go sit up at a dealership for hours just to be told whether or not they can even fix it that day or not. And then if they CAN fix it I definitely have time to sit up there even longer and wait while they do. This is a brand new car..our first new car we have ever bought..there is no reason why we should even be having ANY problems to begin with, much less having to hassle to get it fixed. If there is a problem, especially something major, such as STEERING, you would think they would say ""ok, lets get it fixed. Here is a loaner car until we figure out what is wrong and get it corrected""..but that would be in a perfect world right?",3

They rated this car tops in the compact class (overall score) tied with the Toyota Corolla.  However,  the Forte road score was higher. ( My own figures put this car out in front too,  in this compact class.)   Also,  we test drove a Corolla  for a week in 2014  and it drove like a bus in comparison.  So,   CR was  right:  car is a gem.  Over 40 mpg pump to pump in all types of driving including plenty of  hills (we live in the Adirondack Park of NY State.)   Highlights  are:  great ride for comfort and lack of road noise.  (Switching out the OEM tires for Continental Pure Contacts may have helped.)  Also,  we stuck with the original wheel size,  i.e. 195/65R15,  for which there are many advantages such as:  less costly tire replacements,  better ride (more rubber between rim and road,)   better in snow  and better mpg's with narrower tires,  lighter and stronger than bigger rims,  etc. etc.   This car drives like a dream.  Can't think of much to complain about.  I'm 6'2""  but plenty of headroom in front even with seat in highest position.  Could actually go an inch higher,  but driver's comfort and view out is first rate.  Bought this 2018 in end of April and only have c. 1000K on it so much too soon for definitive observations,  but so far could not be happier.  Good choice.  All that research paid off!

You are not going to get ride/room or power of a mid-size car.

Also a great warranty - 10 yr/100,000 miWe live in Texas and the a/c can handle the hottest days. I am 6'3"" and I have room in the back seat.THE BAD - No Water Temperature gauge (has light), head rests are very uncomfortable, and the fuel mileage. If I use the cruise control I get poor fuel mileage.  If I drive into a head wind I get poor fuel mileage.

I live in Tampa, Florida, and dealership support has been poor thus far. The clicking sounds in the engine base ended up needing a tension pulley at 60,500 miles, just 500 out of warranty. Kia USA agreed to honor and pay as it was 600 $ for repairs. I still heard a metal whirling sound, but was told that was a ""normal"" KIA sound...what? At any rate, about 3000 miles later, the whirling sound is getting louder and now it has been diagnosed as needing a new compressor..haha. seriously? I still like the car; it handles a little better than the Honda fit (which is out of my league, it seems pricewise), but the Forte is still the riff raff of the hatchbacks, and honestly? With this happening at 60,000 miles, holy moly, I do not see the car having any value whatsoever at 100,000. P.S. I had an Isuzu Trooper 290,000. It was the sweetest 20,000$ I ever spent.

THey've certainly improved their vehicles in every way. Purchased a certified 2012 Forte EX 5-door at a Kia dealer w/ 27k miles after trading in 07 Toyota Rav. This is a great design as a small wagon. Seems like a best kept secret too, since I don't see too many out there. Great looks, great mileage (30 average, more on hiway), and MUCH better acceleration than my Honda Fit. I was doing hiway speeds of 75 mph, and the tach was still under 2500 rpm! I've had it for 1 1/2 months and already put almost 3k miles, no probs. Can't beat the warrantee either. Way to go Kia.Hi again. It's now been 3 years owning this vehicle (June 2018) and I now have 105k miles on it. So total so far from purchase I've driven approx. 80k miles with no major  problems with the car. I've purchased a set of tires, brakes all around, and regular check ups/oil changes. Still getting great mileage, so it's a keeper for at least another year.",5

Have 64K mile on it, and it has never seen a repair shop.  Oil changes and one set of tires are only maintenance expense so far.  Mileage is as expected, 29-31 in normal driving, 70/30 city/highway.  Did get over 41 mpg one time when I held it at 60 on an interstate trip.  Normally get 33-35 on the highway.  Best features are the seating comfort, both front and rear, outward visibility, cargo capacity, reliability, and economy of operation.  Worst features are the navigation and backup camera implementation.  Navigation commands sound like broken, computer-generated English, making it difficult to understand which road to turn on at times.  Backup camera has a design flaw, IMHO, where it takes 7-8 seconds for anything to appear on the screen after starting the car.  So I start the car, immediately shift into reverse to back out of a parking space, then wait for 6-7 seconds for the image to appear.  Kind of negates the purpose of having the camera.

Within two weeks after i bought the car i asked the Kia service station to look at the car and that's when a employee at Kia service stated that the catalytic converter could be clogged or not functioning properly. (I think Kia hide him because I never saw him again).Since than my check engine light which i actually thought wouldn't even come on if came on as I was on the beltway coming from my office at Andrews going 60 mph it did come on and the engine automatically slowed down which concerned me because this could have caused an accident during rush hour. A day after the check engine light came on i brought it into the Kia service station and Kia said we reset the light and we do know it was a misfire code but we don't know why or if it will happen again.For a new car this scares me. 6 days later i started my car and began to drive and AGAINi noticed the check engine light stayed on but went off in 47 secondsAgain for a new car this scares me and represents a safety issue and for Kia to disregard safety complaints from customers is disgraceful.The dealer Silver Spring Kia was great UNTIL i bought the car I actually brought the car back 3 days later and told the sales Mgr Laura Jerlet the i had a problem with the car and what i can do now to get trade it or get a refund (again this was after 3 three days) she said ""once you buy a Kia your screwed"" the dealership GM Betty ann Mendelsohn Aschenbach a the part of the KING AUTO group should be steered away from at all costs, the customer service after you buy the car is awful. So far I spent at least $1000.00 on this car due to something wrong with the engine operation that can be causing the bad fuel economy and the check engine light to come on and slow down in beltway traffic. (it happened 3 times since i bought the car 9 Mounts)Under the Md State Lemon Law I Asked Kia to Re-purchase or at least help me get into a car that doesn't have issues. The BBB arbitrator actually stated at the arbitration hearing before the hearing started ""Kia doesn't want to do anything to assist you anyway.""I did explain the issues to the Arbertrater (Harold Cohen) and the person from Kia Ted Renfrow explain his side (he lied and covered up issues about the vacuum system and the safety issues i explainedTo be safe Customers that are looking to buy a new or used car must stay away from Silver Spring Kia. and Kia all together.

I was looking for a sports coup.  Looked at Mustang, Camaro, scion tc, and Honda. Mustang and Camaro had great power handling not so great.  Scion tc is a Toyota that is a much as I will say about that. Honda's nice but the interior was dull. The Kia has the looks and handles great and the features you get for the price is outstanding.  The 2 liter give it enough power and the gas mileage is very good.  In the short time I have had this I can't believe the complements I have received.  The price was great List was $17,600.  I paid $15,200.  ",5

The six-speed manual is not for first time stick drivers (I've driven 5 speeds for years and this took a little getting used to).  The car wants to accelerate, the steering is rock solid and responsive even over rough pavement.  I test drove a turbo audi A4 six-speed as well and the forte performed as well in all categories except trim.  In my opinion, if you go with a comparable honda or acura, you're just paying extra for the nameplate.",5

Things I didn't notice on my test drive like the awesome sound of the muffler, very sporty, and pep.  You really need to get used to ECO mode and learn how to drive with it to tell, but my car is quick.  It doesn't feel like it either, next thing you know you're at 70.  All the features you have in this car seem like they should be in a high end model.  No car that I have looked at has the quality and amount of features standard.  I also have to give a shout to KIA, the support for this purchase has been amazing.  They won't stop sending me thank you's and free maintenance coupons, etc.  I am so pleased with them",5

The transmission reacts quickly.  The suspension is firm without being too firm.   We got the car in the Copperhead Orange, and its a stunning car to look at.  The interior is just as nice, with supportive seats and lots of room inside.  The Bluetooth works better than systems in more expensive cars.

The Mazda, toyota and Honda were all over $24,000 with no rebate and warranty that cant compare.  This Kia is built well. And Kia has improved by leaps and bounds since my 2002 sportage was built.

When idling, fully warmed up, i'm noticing a rattling.  Looked at exhaust system and what not and seems solid.  Sounds more like something in the engine compartment.  Not a big deal, thats what warranties are for : )  It's handling is awesome, accelaration is pretty good, a turbo would do this car wonders.  Definitely needs a better sound system though, kinda dissapointed in it.  The little red lights are also a little cheesey but I like them sometimes (everyone feels the same)Gas is ok.",4.625

So far not one disappointment with this car. Now I know it's a KIA and that may be hard to stomach, but please give it a try. You will not be disappointed.

I do have to say, however, that the 2.4 with the 6 speed manual has plenty of pep and is fun to drive - once you're used to first gear! After driving an 05 Spectra5 for 111,000 miles, I was certain that another Kia purchase would be a wise one. My milage is a little less than the Spectra - but the engine is larger...

I had fallen on some pretty challenging financial times and owned a very unreliable used American made automobile.  I shopped around heavily in attempt to find something reliable but also within my financial means to get around to work and to tote my little daughter around safely.  I visited the Kia dealership in Ann Arbor, MI.  They had this model sitting in the show room.  I was looking for something less in cost, but they were very motivated to move out this particular vehicle due to it being a manual, which in that area was a tough sell for the market the dealership was in.  I preferred owning a manual transmission, so I drove it, loved it, and the dealer worked out a great deal to help me help them.  Fast forward to November of 2017 ... I have 225,000 original miles on the engine.  Vehicle runs like it did the day I bought it.  The body is in near mind condition with zero rust.  Most amazing is that I have never had to replace the clutch or any part of the manual transmission!  225k miles with the original clutch!  I've never owned a car where I had so little to repair while keeping up on basic maintenance and service.  I just recently decided to hand over the keys to this wonderful ride over to my teenage daughter who I taught to drive a manual.  She is new at it all, but also loves the car that she grew up riding around in.  I'm not sure how many more miles that quick little Forte SX has left in it, but I'm anticipating many more safe and reliable miles to go.  Hats off to Kia Motors!",5

This is day 5 of having a rental car through Kia and they still can't ""recreate the situation"" or ""fix it"". If you wouldn't put your loved one in it, don't buy it!",1

Subtle design with a hint of class that does ot belong in this segment. Not one of its competitors feel this good and i can honestly say that the only car that stands out above it is the focus. Too me the elantra has a weird exterior. The corolla is extremely outdated and feels cheap, the civic is nice but if you are like me and lean on the bigger than average then your leg will stick into the handbrake and you will feel awkward driving it. For the price nothing comes close, hopefully depreciation is not too bad and in my opinion the only deterrent. 87/100",4.75

I am coming from a 2002 Volkswagen Jetta so the fact that I never have to take my Kia Forte into the dealership for a check engine light every month is a very nice perk. My Forte hasn't had any problems yet. I've had the oil changed once (I love that it only needs to be changed every 7,500 miles) and I will be getting a second oil change soon enough. The inside of my Forte is really classy. I love the materials used for the interior. I especially love the type of paint they use for the interior trim. It doesn't chip and peel.

The build quality is ok, ive had some issues with the mirrors needing replacement for noise. with the 5 speed it has plenty of power. the seats are very comfortable, but the interior materials do feel a bit cheap.Its a very aggressive, nice looking car.

The manual transmission is a little touchy but with a little practice its easy to get used to.

The standard features you find at any Forte model are extra on Honda, Toyota, Mazda and Nissan's. The bumper and powertrain warranty has no match.

I got the fuel economy package and can get almost 450 miles to a tank when I'm driving long distances.  It has already been on several 5-9 hour road trips and there has never been a problem.

I agree that the clutch is definitely ""Different"" in the 6spd Manual, but I think that's the way it is in many cars.  While shopping, I drove a MINI, Civic Si, Genesis Coupe, all manual.  Every one had different clutch characteristics. Aside from that, I really like the Forte.  It has great exterior styling for a compact car, and nice interior arrangement and surfaces for a car of this price range.  The seats are comfortable and the upgraded cloth of the SX feels more durable than the standard cloth seats.  The trunk is surprisingly large for a car of this size.",5

I paid 16700.00 for a LX Civic ,and 15700,00 for a SX Forte that has a lot more standard features. Stability control, and traction control are not even offered on the Honda.

Loved my Civic, but the Forte is a much better car. From day 1 the Civic had a lot rattles and noises, not the Forte. Recieved $1400.00 from Honda for paint defects, Forte paint has no defects. A lot of reviews say Honda civic engine is quiet and refined, and the Forte engine is loud, and unrefined. Forte engine is quiet and smooth. Honda was a nice car, but the Forte has a quiet interior with little road noise or wind, and it is fun to drive, handles great, and is great on the high way even in heavy winds. In my opinion Honda must be paying some one for there good reviews. Honda Civic has a lot of TSB like cracked engine blocks. Civic or Forte. FORTE",4.875

I looks good (black on black). I love the LED lights and the folding door mirrors for looks and the styling is unique and sporty with 16 in wheels.

The service was the worst I have ever encountered in my life, the service department actually fought between themselves arguing right in front of me. I felt very uncomfortable. Then by summer I was getting sick when I was driving my car, it took me a min to figure this out until one day I opened my trunk and oh my god the mold was everywhere and I am very sensitive to this. I have suffered 2 years because Kia wouldn't step up. Well I had enough ( I cant be in my car more than 20 min at a time, I cant have my Grandchildren in my car because they have asthma and are allergic to mold. Cant go on vacations in my car. I cant use my trunk or never could with the water pouring in so I have had to use my back seat causing ware and tare). I stopped by the Kia dealer just to retrieve a statement from them so I could sue them and they only at that time agreed to fix the problem, again the service sucked and ended up costing me $75.00 for a rental car wtf right. Well I got my car back and it rained and I opened my trunk only to find it still has water pouring in. So it was not the tail lights its the damn frame. The only thing different is now my doors make a horrible squeaking sound when opened. And still makes me very sick and Kia now saying they will help me but have not returned my calls.

I have gone out to find puddles of water, wet back seats and trunk, and in the cold months frozen windows (from the inside). The back windows stopped working which I am sure is due to the water damage and I have seen condensation inside the dash board  where the speedometer is as well as freezing in the ceiling lights.Heads up, the problem begins with windows that constantly fog and you'll probably dismiss it with bad defrosting but DO NOT be fooled!The gas mileage is great but the issues that come with this car are not worth it.",2

If you leave it on the default ECO setting, it feels sluggish if you try to push it some.  It's trying to save you gas.  But if you turn ECO off, the sluggishness goes away, but so will your better mileage.The new Forte EX is quieter.  It rides better. The new Forte has the Elantra chassis with the same wheelbase, and curb to curb radius.  It has the same 6 speed transmission, but a more powerful engine.  We have had our car serviced at the manufacturers required service points.  It has not given us any problems at all.  It has been very reliable.

After searching for a fun hatchback I settled on the Forte 5 SX for a myriad of reasons. I have absolutely loved this car since I got it. The turbo makes it fun and sporty although I wouldn't necessarily call it a hot hatch it is certainly warm. I've put 9000 miles on it in a little over 6 months with absolutely no problems. If you're looking for a car with a bit of pep and a very comfortable cabin, look no further.",5

Johnson ,2016 Kia Forte Hatchback SX 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6M),"toasty (almost ""hot"") hatchback"," Got my 2016 Forte5 SX (6-speed, manual transmission) brand new five months ago, and I am still in love with my turbo hatchback.  For my needs, it is the perfect fun-to-drive commuter.  It is not as sporty/fast as a VW GTI (which is arguably the leader in affordable hot hatchbacks), but it is much less expensive, it should be much more reliable, and it has a much better warranty.  Also, the Forte5 SX has the best seat and driving position I found in any compact car I test-drove (I'm a larger fellow, at 6'2 and 230 lbs).  Another plus?  The Forte5 SX takes regular gas (not premium like many turbos).  I had already decided to buy the car before I even found that out.  I'm only getting 27.8 mpg so far, but the gas mileage is slowly getting better the more miles I put on the car.  No regrets at all, and I plan on keeping it for a long time.  For you car guys out there, the driving dynamics may be a little bit different, but the fun-factor/value reminds me of my old 1998 Civic EX but with a comfortable seat.  I'm starting to think that Kia is doing now what Honda was doing in the late 1990s--which is a very good thing indeed.Update: I remain very happy with my Forte5 SX, and I can't believe that more people don't know about this gem.  I can even fit my mountain bike in the back of the hatch with the rear seats folded down (granted that the bike's front wheel needs to be taken off to fit).  The ride is sporty but comfortable--perfect for real-world driving--and the car is so practical yet fun, and it is reliable.  I have also found the Kia dealerships to be awesome; clearly they place a premium on excellent customer service.",5

1099, on 03/12/17 18:23 PM (PDT),Jay ,2016 Kia Forte Hatchback EX 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Unexpected  Winner," We purchased this car, a Kia Forte 5 with the premium tech package, at Jeff Belzer Kia in Lakeville Mn. This is our second purchase from this dealership. Alex was great to work with, -no pressure, answered our questions and sent us on a test drive even though we mentioned we were going to another dealership to look at a different brand. We returned and purchased this car. Prior to purchasing, we test drove a VW Golf, a Mazda 3 Hatchback, several Hyundai Elantra GT Hatchbacks, and this Kia Forte 5 Hatchback. The VW and the Mazda were great driving cars but were somewhat cramped for passenger space by comparison. The Hyundai Elantra GT was roomier but didn't offer an upscale package we liked. Then we drove the Kia Forte 5. It was just a fun car to drive. It is a road handling car with plenty of power for everyday driving (2.0 liter, 173 h.p. and 154 ft. pounds of torque). Advertised mileage is 25 city, 33 hwy mpg. We are currently averaging about 30.5 mpg including cold starts with combined city-highway driving. My favorite feature is the heated steering wheel on these cold winter mornings. Second would be the four heated leather seats. We are getting accustomed to the smart key features with perimeter lighting at night, keyless entry, and push-button start. The technology package included navigation, a sunroof, and auto headlights, all nice features. Add to all this a 5-year basic warranty and a 10-year powertrain warranty and you have a winning package. Most enjoyable though is the way it drives. It is quick, but it is not a race car. It is firmly planted and corners nicely, perhaps due to the 215 45 R17 tires. This is a car with lots of features for the money and I would highly recommend it.Update:We have owned this car for eight months now and both my wife and I enjoy it. It is just a fun car to drive. It has a nice balance between feeling responsive and at the same time being a solid and stable road handling car. In mixed driving, we average between 33 to 35 mpg. (This includes about 20% city, 20% two lane highway, and 60% freeway driving.) EPA rating for this car is 25 city and 33 highway. We are very pleased with our purchase and would highly recommend this car.",5
1100, on 11/28/16 14:43 PM (PST),Pablo Danek ,2016 Kia Forte Hatchback SX 4dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Great Daily Driver but no GTI," I leased this car as an experiment-- I have never owned a Kia before. I know they had made huge strides in design and engineering but wanted to see how far. I love sporty hatchbacks with manual transmissions and I really found the design appealing. I shopped the Mazda 3 (clunky navigation design and wheezy engine), GTI (far more expensive, and reliability concerns) and Ford Focus (don't like the interior or rear-end styling, also huge turning radius) but ended up getting the Kia. Why? For one, it is a rare car-- I've had my car a year and still haven't seen another on the road. Second, I really like the styling. Third, you just can't beat all the content like heated and cooled seats, LED lights, dual-zone climate control, and heated steering wheel. The interior is also very, very nice-- Looks and feels way more expensive than it is. I also was confident I knew about the car's shortcomings-- Abysmal mileage for a 4-cylinder, not quite as refined ride and handling as the big dogs like Focus and GTI, and not quite as fast. But I wanted a nice, clean, fun, reliable daily driver and that's just what I got. Any things that bug me? Not really, but there are a few ways the car could be better. First, I mentioned the mileage. The engine is clearly a little small for this car-- Even when I don't drive it hard (which is rare) mileage is still in the high twenties at best. Second, the suspension along with the 18-inch tires makes for a bit of a hard ride around town. That's about all I can complain about, otherwise I really like the car.",4

As far as looks, space,quickness in and out of traffic, and easy to work on, this is really the best hatch you can get. I thought I would never buy a Kia. Reminds me of Honda circa 1986. The only things I can nitpick on is handling is so so around curves, and stock speakers in the EX are horrible. Ride comfort is neither great or terrible. I drove out of the dealership under $20k for everything. Very satisfied.",4
1102, on 10/25/16 07:36 AM (PDT),Katie ,2016 Kia Forte Hatchback LX 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Pretty good bang for your buck, I was in the market for a used car but ended up purchasing the Kia Forte new because of the rebates. I have never liked hatchbacks but this body type fits my current needs and looks better than most in my opinion. This car is comfortable to drive and even the base model is a great upgrade from what I was in. I was really impressed with the warranty offered with this vehicle.,4
1103, on 09/26/16 09:51 AM (PDT),RonB ,2016 Kia Forte Hatchback EX 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Bye bye '12 Forte SX 5 door & hello '16 Forte5 EX," We shared the '12 for over 3 years and over 80,000 miles until I bought myself a 2015 Sonata Sport 2.0T Limited 6 months ago. Love that car and reviewed it on here also. Got a great deal. Now that we're back to two cars, mileage will accumulate a lot less. While I was getting the 12 serviced 2 weeks ago and ""someone"" took my car to work, I was asked ""Do you think you can get me a deal on trading my car like you did buying yours ?"" So I walked the lot and found a Snow White Pearl Forte5 EX 2.0 GDI - loaded with Premium/Technology package and remote start with black leather with white stitching. I texted the pictures. ""I really wasn't a fan of white until you got yours (Quartz White Pearl) but I really like it. See what you can do. If it works out, I'll come sign the papers"". The 12 was in excellent condition except for the 82,000 miles they beat down the trade in value on, but with the rebate and financing, it was a good deal regardless. The 12 had leather and sunroof. Great little car. No complaints other than it could have used more sound insulation. Compared to the 12: The tech options are great. Stereo is better. Bluetooth streaming is a world better. It's quieter. Much better legroom - we're both 6ft tall. Headroom was never an issue even with the 12 - sunroof in both. The 2.0GDI doesn't have the off the line punch of the 2012s 2.4 port-injected engine but feels fine overall (same 173hp rating) and better fuel mileage makes it worthwhile. Neither are pocket rockets but we're not race car drivers lol. Has plenty of zip. Warranty can't be beat. This now makes 4 Hyundai / Kia products since 2008 and don't regret any of them. I'm a semi-retired mechanic and choose my/our cars wisely. The only 2 gripes with the 16: 1 - gone with the 2014+ 5 door redesign is the split-folding rear seat bottoms which was great when we needed to haul stuff around. A minor gripe really because the 16 is still plenty roomy with the seat backs folded down. 2 - For the 2016 Forte line up, HID headlights were deleted, even with the Tech package. I remedied that with the same brand HID kit I installed in the 2012. Also installed LED plate and reverse lights - nice difference with the back-up camera at night. Experience has us anticipating the same reliability. The 2008 Sonata we traded for the 2012 Forte is still on the road with nearly 250,000 miles on it. Traded with nearly 120,000 trouble-free miles and came across it recently.UPDATE 3/27/2017Six months and 7,500 miles now. Engine has loosened up. Feels puncher. Averaging 31-32mpg which is 7-8mog better than the 2012. Nothing other than an oil change and tire rotation.UPDATE 9/28/1715,000 miles. Just did the 3rd oil change and replaced the cabin filter - I change them once a year. Zero issues. More of a novelty but my other half loves the heated steering wheel on cold mornings.UPDATE 3/28/18A little over 25,000 miles now. Between work, grad school, and internship, the other half has racked up some miles. Nothing really to report. Still runs and looks great. Wiper blades replaced other than oil changes and tire rotation. The only gripe is the OE Nexen tires. While they certainly look like they will go another 15 or 20 ,000 miles, they have gotten a bit noisy. Probably just going to run them through the summer and replace them.",5

Sold a money draining 2012 BMW M3 (extremely poor fuel mileage and California prices for fuel along with Nevada Dealership mechanics not able to routinely repair problems while under warranty along with $900/yr license tags).  As of now I made a great move. Car performs as expected and being over 70 yrs. old is just what is needed - economical transportation.Vehicle performs up to expectations and am still positive about owning and driving it.  Really enjoy  the mileage  per gallon experience and the ride is comfortable.Glad I bought the vehicle.  Might look to upgrade to  a new KIA in the next two years.,4
1107, on 05/12/16 16:13 PM (PDT),Larry ,2016 Kia Forte Coupe Koup EX 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Best compact car for the price!," The price for the base model with popular package (+$1000) is well worth it.  The #1 reason that I chose Kia is that they do not use the CVT transmission that all of the other brands in it's class does. The 1.8L engine has plenty of power even with the air conditioner on high and with passengers. The interior is very nice for a base model and the popular package gets you a lot, including backup camera, Bluetooth, etc. Trunk space is best in it's class. If you can get a 2016 with the PP for under $18K you will not regret it and remember the transmission! CVT 's wear out at around 70,000 miles and cost around $7000 to replace (they cannot be repaired) perhaps this is why Kia chooses to not to use them because of their 100,000 mile warranty, KIA uses the dual clutch transmission. The hand controls are very ergonomic which helps keep your eyes on the road. Kia does not deal with Takata Airbags (look up Takata Airbag Inflators) I cannot express enough about staying away from any auto that is equipped with the CVT transmission. Kia along with Mobis (a German engineering company) have engineered great autos.The Cons: I only have only 1 and that is when driving the Forte all you see is the road which is great for an experienced driver, but for a beginner they are bound to miss judge resulting in hitting curbs etc.",5

I average over 40 mpg. I gave the car five stars in performance because I am rating it against other cars in its class and price range. The manual trans. version (which I drive) accelerates circles around other subcompacts like Corolla, Sentra, Fit (not Hyundai -- same platform). Its cornering isn't amazing, but if I wanted something that took corners great, I'd have had to pay for it. Reviewers who hack on a sub $20K car's performance because it won't compare with that of a $60K sports car are trolls. This is my second KIA, having owned a 2013 Soul which I put 130K miles on with no problems what so ever. Likewise, I have had no issues whatsoever with the Forte.  When this one reaches 100K miles, I'll most likely trade it for another KIA.  The 100K mile warranty is the best in the industry.",5
1110, on 02/03/17 22:03 PM (PST),Captain Dave ,2016 Kia Forte Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 6M),Outstanding Car," I got a fantastic price of $12,999 + tax plus 0.9% financing on the LX manual. I purposely got the bare-bones LX with zero options. This way I could add the equipment/brands I wanted ala carte without paying manufacturer priced packages with unwanted options. Major upgrades were: 17"" wheels and tires $1300, LED daytime running lights w/fog lights $265, rear lip spoiler $106, waterproof floor and trunk mats $108, neoprene front seat covers $239, mud flaps $46, stick on LED map lights $4. With tax et al my in-the-garage cost was $16,206. With the 17"" tires the car handles as if on rails, brakes like a demon and the black 5-spoke rims on the pearl white car look incredible. That is under the MSRP and includes the sales tax! The 6-speed manual has short throws, is crisp and a joy to run through. Care must be taken going down from 6th to 5th as if you are lazy you can find 3rd by accident. I have also increased fuel economy and performance by switching to full synthetic oil and a K&N air filter. I live rural and average 44 MPG. As for infotainment the stereo is fine and a smart phone or tablet interface using  google maps saves $thousands$. I also find 'driver aids' an excuse to pay poor attention to driving and another unnecessary expense. A manual gearbox guarantees full involvement and enjoyment plus extracts as much from the engine as you need. My only complaint which is mentioned by another is the final drive ratio with the manual. Like my other row-your-own vehicle I pull way too many RPM's on the highway due to the gearing compared to the automatic. I get 40+ MPG all around yet under 40 highway because I am at 2800 RPM as opposed to 2-2500 on surface streets. Still a great car and a blast to drive.",5

The transmission is very hesitant, especially on the freeway. The car rattled until on the fourth repair attempt they finally fixed the issue. The car is a nightmare for anyone who has an interest in cars. The engine makes pretty good power but it does not start to really get moving until around 5000 RPM. The transmission is always in the wrong gear. Eco mode just means the throttle will not respond almost at all. When cornering the traction control system tries to intervene and does a horrible job at that (even when the system is turned off it still tries to work.) The brakes overheat and fade pretty quickly in a stop and go higher speed situations. The drivers seat is extremely uncomfortable and lacks support. The plastics look cheap and feel the same way. I have had two bad tires because the stock tires went bad when in both cases a small rock on the road hit the sidewall of the tires. I am very upset and honestly will never own another car from Kia. I would suggest anyone to look at other upscale CPO cars instead of this one. I am not going to bother trying to fix anymore of these issue because at the end of the day it is not worth wasting my time. I honestly have stopped caring about my car. I used to wax it and wash it all the time but with all the problems I have had it doesn't seem like it is worth the care I would normally give to a car.",2

Then again, I've jumped quite a few years into the new-car-world. I've been owning the Forte LX  for 4 months now, and to say the least, it's a great car. Not perfect... but great. It runs smoothly, quietly, and if you want, super fast. I was impressed at how the engine keeps it quiet, like the Toyota Prius's. However, after putting-in over 2,500 miles, the engine starts losing its futuristic engine sound. I'm a music enthusiast and I was extremely overwhelmed with the possibilities of connecting your phone/mp3 to the car via USB, AUX and Bluetooth. However, I am not impressed with the sound quality, but of course, that can be upgraded later in life. The windows are supposedly made to keep the heat out of the sun, but that's not quite accurate. It's like any other car window in its family. Trunk space is awesome! Fold down the seats, and you can practically sleep back there. All-in-all, the car does its job quite well. I forget sometimes to be grateful when I begin comparing it to other cars I should have bought instead.",4

There are three cons -(1) You cannot see the hood or front bumper despite how much you sit up or how close you sit to the steering wheel, and (2) you cannot see the back bumper, and (3) there is a small blind spot in the rear side views. That said, I love everything else about this car.  I especially like the 6th gear and ability to downshift when needed.  The audio could have been better, but I won't complain.  The back seat is pretty spacious, and comfortable.  The cup holders for the backseat are nice as well.  If you have kids you will appreciate the plastic (instead of cloth or leather) on the backs of the front seats where their feet often touch/rest.  This car has reinforced doors and PLENTY of airbags in case of collision.",5

Be aware, it actually only comes with a tire repair kit and inflator as standard equipment. No trade was involved and that price included a $2,000.00 cash back and $400.00 military offer.I can honestly say that I haven't found anything that I don't like about this car. I have mostly been driving in the city and I have averaged a solid 29 MPG over the past 1,250 miles with the a/c always on. The 1.8 L engine has ample power and is smooth. The car rides and handles well and is very quiet. The seats both front and rear are very comfortable and I love the overall driving experience. I haven't found a single fault in this car and I have been over it with a fine tooth comb.I buy all my cars new and I usually keep them for about 12 years. I also do all of my own maintenance. I've owned Toyota, Honda and Nissan vehicles and to date this is the best example of value, function, and quality that I've encountered. I compared and drove all of the other cars in the Forte's class and for me this was the clear winner, even if I ignored the higher pricing of the competition.

Going from a 2013 Kia Optima LX, I was worried about interior room, but the Forte has equally the amount of interior room as the Optima in my opinion. My new Forte EX is loaded with all the bells and whistles, and rides great with a quiet interior. I've gotten quite a few compliments on it so far, and the Crimson Red Metallic color has really grown on me, as I wasn't a big fan of red vehicles before I laid my eyes on this beauty. The 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine has plenty of pep to get me onto the interstate, or just zipping around town. I don't see much difference at all from the 2.4 liter I had in my Optima to the 2.0 liter in my new Forte EX, they both get up and go with ease. This car is awesome and so comfortable to drive, whether it be just across town or on a long road trip. I cannot yet comment on fuel economy as I'm still in the break in phase of the motor only having 400 miles on it so far, but even with my lead foot, I'm pulling in 30+ mpg combined city/highway driving. I fell in love with Kia's after I bought my first (2013 Kia Optima LX), and I'm still in love with my new 2016 Kia Forte EX.

The engine has adequate pep and power to navigate the daily urban commute.  I have been averaging around 38MPG but I do alot of interstate driving.  To nitpick, the steering is slugish compared to other compacts and a little more noise gets into the cabin from the road than I would like.  Still I have been very happy with my Forte.",5

In town I shift from 1st to 3rd to 5th and run in 5th from 30-45 MPH. They could do without 2nd and 4th gears and raise the ratio of 6th and make a nice 4 speed transmission. Might be great in Korea or other countries where one never drives above 55 MPH. I would hate this car in Germany because I would be maxing out engine RPMs in 6th gear on the Autobahn. 6th gear should have the engine running about 2,000 RPMs at 70 MPH which would make the fuel economy excellent instead of just good.  Interior is NOISY, even without my hearing aids. I don't know if it is the NEXEN stock tires or just the engine noise.

The ride is nice, I have taken it on a 1500 mile trip and was very comfortable and got about 43MPG doing about 85MPH on the freeway. I really like that in stop and go traffic it isn't burning gas.

(2014 Black soul) - The Car handles and Drives above expectations.   I drive a Hybrid Optima so I am used to be breaking and quarks of a Hybrid, however the wife (who drives the NIro)  is getting used to it.  The breaks will seem soft to new comers, however they will stop and if you need will stop you with surprisingly response.  Cold weather driving will reduce your Mileage.     In the cold the car has to run the gas engine to keep you warm, and the warmer you want to be the lower your Mileage ex - If in the hot weather you normally get 50mpg then in the could expect a 5mpg drop and if you really want to be warm it can dip as much as 7mpg.  Of course its  all a factor on how cold how long and how you drive but that seems to be the averages I have experienced.   Comfort is at volumes in the Niro,  Long trips seem to be a breeze.  The back seat is comfy and a passenger can relax and enjoy the trip. Noise is easy on the ears and you can hold a conversation from the back to the front without having to yell at each other.   If you like to load up and carry everything you will find lots of space to do just that.   I would buy another should I find myself looking for another Car.  Hope this helps.",5

1141, on 12/30/17 05:33 AM (PST),Retired grandparent ,2017 Kia Niro SUV LX 4dr SUV (1.6L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6AM),All we expected and more," We are at 10,000 miles and the car has been perfect. In trying to think of something negative, the only two things are that the gasoline engine/exhaust may be noisier than a typical 4-cyl but maybe that only seems that way since the car is so quiet in EV mode. The other thing is that it seems the engine is programmed to kick in when battery charge gets below about 50% and it seems like it should be able to run EV until battery gets lower than that.  But how can we complain when we get over 60mpg on most trips.  We learned a few things to nurse those extra MPG:  When accelerating, keep the fuel economy meter below the halfway mark, when you reach cruising speed, momentarily let off the gas to force the EV mode to kick in, then gently press gas pedal to maintain your speed on battery (If you keep foot on gas pedal, it tends to remain in gasoline mode).  When braking, anticipate stops and press brake lightly so that the regen slows down the vehicle without having to use the friction wasting brakes until necessary.  Try to avoid high-speed freeway driving (we found MPG really drops above 60-65 MPH).  In moderate weather we get over 60 MPG but in cold weather we were only getting 45-50 MPG.  For maximum MPG, only use A/C and headlights when necessary, and for short local trips in cold weather, don't turn on the heater (if forces the gasoline engine to run even when your battery us charged in order to produce heat for the passenger compartment.  Unless you need defroster, wear your coat and gloves and leave the gasoline engine off.  I have recently added a small silicon block heater pad on the underside of the oil pan to warm the engine on cold winter mornings so the engine is warm when starting and doesn't have to run nearly as much to produce heat, and expect our winter MPG will greatly improve.",5

It drives in today's world, with excellent results.

I love this car. Love the mileage I'm getting - 45/mpg on snow tires!Update - Summer tires are on and gas mileage has increased to 51 City/48 Hwy. Car is holding up well. Air-conditioning use does not affect MPG as much as heater does in winter. There is no doubt off the line acceleration is not the fastest, but it has enough pep to get you off and into traffic.

The liftover into the trunk of the Ioniq is inconveniently high, and the seats do not fold perfectly flat.  The Niro's space is easy to access and good for as small a vehicle as it is. One pays a small premium in mpg with the Niro, but I think it is the better value (and it's outselling the Ioniq by more than 2-1 in the U.S.)  Prior to getting the Niro, I owned a Ford C-Max for five years, a similar kind of vehicle (hybrid minivan vs. the Kia's hybrid SUV).  The C-Max was advertised as getting 47 mpg but got 37.  The Niro, advertised as getting 46 mpg on the freeway, is getting 45-46 in mostly freeway driving.  The C-Max was taller and felt a bit narrower.  Its pickup from a dead stop was good, but the Niro feels much quicker in Sport mode.  The Niro has a much tighter turning radius.  It is attractive, responsive, quiet, and economical.  Its dash display and navigation synchronizes readily with my iPhone.

1148, on 10/10/17 23:02 PM (PDT),Joseph Bristow ,2017 Kia Niro SUV LX 4dr SUV (1.6L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6AM),An Excellent Hybrid Vehicle," I have driven the 2017 Kia Niro LX for over two months, and I have really come to like the car.  I had been driving a 2006 Ford Focus ZX5 (four-door hatchback bought new in 2006), so this was a big step up for me.  I found the Niro to be very comfortable with an excellent climate control system.  The entertainment system is awesome.  Bluetooth connectivity is perfect for local driving, while Android Auto is great for long-distance trips.  You don't need a navigation system with Android Auto.  Just select the ""Maps"" button to open a map that shows where you are and traffic in your area.  You can get turn-by-turn directions as well.  Voice commands work well, and I haven't had any issues with being understood.  The cargo area is similar to what my Focus had.  It's perfect for groceries and really expands when you put the rear seats down.  The glove compartment is a little small, but I don't have a lot of items to store, so it's not much of an issue for me.  Acceleration in Eco mode is sluggish, as every review says, but Sport mode gives you the option of beefing up acceleration.  I rarely use Sport mode, as I don't care about the slow acceleration.  My goal with the Niro is to get the best gas mileage I can.  To that end, I get about 45 mpg, measured by taking the number of miles I've driven divided by the amount of gas I put in the car (I stop filling when the pump handle pops).  That is far better than I ever got in my old Focus, and to be able to go over 400 miles on a single tank is fantastic.  Probably the one disappointing thing is the gas mileage I get on short trips.  I happen to live within a mile of a commercial center, so getting groceries, eating meals and visiting other stores results in about a 2-mile round trip.  I had imagined that the Niro would act like an electric car in that situation, but it doesn't.  No matter how gentle I am with the gas pedal, I cannot get it to stay in electric mode during these short trips, which results in 25 to 30 mpg per trip, hurting my overall gas mileage.  It's something I do quite often, so I'm hoping that future iterations of the Niro will be better at using electric mode on short trips.  Interestingly, the Niro will utilize electric mode quite frequently in stop-and-go traffic, which makes me laugh at the other cars burning gas while I'm drifting along in electric mode.  Despite my disappointment, I'm very pleased with the gas mileage I get from my Niro.  I leased the Niro because 2017 is the first year for the model and it is my first experience driving a hybrid car.  Given how pleased I am with the car, I'll likely turn it in and buy a new Niro when the lease is up.",5

There is a slight difference during braking due to the regenerative system.  You need to be willing to apply break pressure during emergencies so as to engage the normal brake pads.

I've never lacked for traction in any front wheel drive car (including in Minnesota) so lack of 4X4 option was and is not an issue.  Nothing has needed fixing so far and I don't expect any since Kia began making quality vehicles.  Love this car!   Update:  After 11,100 miles we're still about 50.5 actual MPG for 11.5 months!  No issues of any kind with anything.  Amazing car!",5

On 3/6/17 it wouldn't start and needed to be towed. Kia service told me the car was normal but I needed to drive it more to keep the battery charged.  This does not seem to be a problem with my particular vehicle, rather a design choice KIA made.  I use the car daily for my work commute, errands, etc. though apparently this usage is not adequate to have a reliable operating vehicle. Kia does not inform the public the vehicle will not operate unless it has a minimum daily usage time.  I bought the car assuming I could use it like any car.  As much as I like the idea of an eco-friendly vehicle, I take exception to the concept that it must be driven extra time than my needs dictate to keep the battery charged.  The service provider suggested I keep the engine running for 20-40 minutes but can just leave the car locked because of the smart key.This does not sound smart to me.I spoke directly with Kia Motors regarding my situation and they stand by their vehicle saying it is normal and the only problem is I am not driving it enough to keep the battery charged.  They advised me to drive more.  I would not like others to find themselves in my unfortunate situation.  Please be mindful before making a purchase.",3
1167, on 02/28/17 21:41 PM (PST),J.D. ,2017 Kia Niro SUV Touring 4dr SUV (1.6L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6AM),The Hybrid New Kid in Town," UPDATE: We're now at nearly 8K miles. The Niro has been flawless - - zero recalls, zero software updates, and no initial quality problems. Many times it seems like a new car is infatuating, but over time it begins to show its weaknesses. My complaints with the Niro are remarkably minor; our Grand Touring model has shiny black surfaces around the gear shift, and when the sun hits it, there can be glare in my eyes. Solution: keep a baseball cap over the shifter in sunny weather (this may not affect others who are a different height.) And some of the nanny-state sensors are a bit sensitive; for instance, if the nose of the car is pointing down (say, after crossing a curb) the front parking sensors might start beeping. No biggie; you can temporarily turn them off with the conveniently located switch right in the center shifter area. On the plus side, these sensors will tell you if you're going to scrape the bottom of the car or if you're going to run over a concrete barrier at the front of a parking space. After several extended road trips, we can pretty much assume that our mileage for both city and highway is consistent at around 43 to 45 mpg, even when driving at 70mph or above for long intervals. The comfort factor has really held up, and back seat passengers have made no complaining noises. Cargo capacity is not immense, but the nicely rectangular trunk has few intrusions (holds lots of wine boxes!) Of course the seats go down easily when you need to maximize hauling. We only use Sport mode for entering highways or other ""quick"" maneuvers, but the extreme boost in torque and power is very handy and we have never felt the car is underpowered. Here's a couple of additional pluses: great turning circle; easy to park because of size and auto-dipping side mirrors as well as a backup camera that both shows the steering angle and the actual rear bumper of the car; excellent integration with Car Play from Apple (and Apple Maps have improved radically to the point where they have about as few errors as Google Maps.) Air conditioning is fast and efficient, even on 100 degree days (we seem to be having more and more of these.)Previous review follows. The Kia Niro may not be the car for everyone, but it is certainly the right car at the right time for us. We were driving a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Limited with every package known to mankind added. It was certainly not lacking for both features and comfort, but the six-cylinder engine was sucking gas at an alarming rate. The Niro consistently delivers at least 40 mpg and up to 50 mpg, even in Touring trim for us, buzzing up and down Portland hills and the coastal mountains (more like really big hills.) So it consistently meets its EPA projections, unless you're heavy-footed, in which case you'll still reach the high 30's. The nice transition from the luxurious Cherokee was made simpler by the inclusion of many great comfort features, including a heated steering wheel; heated AND ventilated front seats; adjustable power back bolster in the driver's seat; auto folding and dipping rear view mirrors; HID projector headlights; and a host of safety features. The Touring version includes both front and rear parking sensors, which we love and which are a rare find even at twice the price. There's adaptive cruise control, cross traffic detection, automatic emergency braking and more. All this might seem over the top, but once you're used to these features (the Cherokee had them) they are hard to give up. The seats are firm but surprisingly comfortable, and the ride is pretty quiet (Touring has more sound proofing packed into it.) The wheelbase is stretched out with the wheels at the corners, for a more supple ride than you'd expect. Handling is quite predictable. Controls are super-logical, with everything right where you expect to find it. I am surprised at how good Car Play (Apple) functions; I was expecting to turn it off and use Google Maps and Android Auto, but the Apple system works transparently and (most of the time) gets you to your intended destination with a minimum of errors and a terrific interface. This is not a powerful automobile, but with the Sport mode you can harness the combined power of both electric and gas motors for a pretty substantial boost when needed, and this is easily activated with a flick of the gear lever to the side - - great for entering freeways, or for a burst of passing power. In sum, if you're sick of burning through tons of gas, and having to visit the station more often than you'd like, the Niro is the ideal solution, and provides enough comfort and utility to cover most of the bases for singles, couples and small families. It is not really an SUV so much as a ""tall wagon"" but does carry quite a substantial load with the seat down. It's slightly smaller size compared to many SUVs makes it far easier to maneuver and park in urban situations. The turning circle is quite amazing and small.",5
1168, on 08/09/18 17:26 PM (PDT),Justin ,2018 Kia Niro SUV EX 4dr SUV (1.6L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6AM),Impressed by KIA Yet Again," Before getting the Niro, we purchased the KIA Soul in 2014. By far, the KIA Soul was worth the price and extremely reliable (140,000 miles and no problems). This made us decide to purchase our next vehicle from KIA. Yet again, we were not disappointed. The value this car has it truly phenomenal, most cars/suvs with this level of features range in the high 35,000's. The MPG is exceptional too; we've been getting 50 mpg which I believe is quite astonishing. For room, it is basically the same size as the KIA Soul. That being said, at 6'4 person like me will be able to fit in the front & back. The one thing I'd say is a negative is the acceleration. It feels like a 4 cylinder. If you don't have a heavy foot though, this will do just fine. We plan on getting another vehicle in about 6 months, and it's definitely going to be another KIA.",5

Haven’t owned it long enough for reliability but I think it’s going to be great. Fit and finish on the interior surpass Honda by a mile. Ride is good, feels like a bigger car than it is. Exterior styling is beautiful and doesn’t really look like a typical hybrid.",5
1171, on 07/08/18 21:05 PM (PDT),sal ,2018 Kia Niro SUV EX 4dr SUV (1.6L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6AM),Sleeper Hybrid Winner," We had a Soul that was up on lease.  We really liked the Soul, but in primarily city driving, the gas mileage was terrible.  Having owned 4 Kia vehicles, beginning with a 2001, Kia Rio, the vehicles keep gaining refinement and great features. Build quality is at it's highest level so far. To the Niro, this car is a perfect Soul Replacement.  It feels like it rides high like the Soul, but the gas mileage has been better than estimates.  We averaged just over 56 mpg, in mixed driving in the first week.  It runs so smoothly, the transition between electric and gas are noticeable, but not a hindrance of any kind.  While I doubt we'll win a drag race, the car moves so quietly and easily, you can quickly find yourself over the speed limit.  We opted for the mid-range EX, because it had all the tech we wanted.  The tech package added leather seats and dash trim, but honestly it was way too much car, and the car as we have it is comfortable and has all but emergency braking. The interior craftsmanship is modern and interfaces are easy to use.  I feel Edmunds 3 Star rating sells this vehicle way too short.  Granted, I'd agree the mpg drop off for the highest trim level is unfortunate, but the EX, with or without the Tech package, provides more than enough comfort and safety features for the average commuter.  I honestly can't wait to get another when our 2nd car is ready to be replaced.",5

1174, on 02/03/18 13:19 PM (PST),The Davy ,2013 Kia Optima Hybrid LX Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid 6A),If the tech & transmission were a LITTLE better," I tend to drive decently roughly. I bought this car after minor body work had been done thanks to a tree collision (right, carfax?), and made off with it for $10,000 exactly with only 37,000 miles on the ODO. In my 10 months of ownership, there have been a couple warranty part replacements that Colonial Kia near Richmond VA handled with grace, but NO out-of-the-ordinary maintenance has been required. It’s one of the smoothest riding non-luxury sedans I’ve ever driven, but the suspension is taut enough to let you never forget there’s a road under you. The exterior paint seems pretty cheap, getting substantially beaten up on the front end by simple highway battery, but the Interior is too-notch. The leather-wrapped steering wheel feels fantastic, the controls are very intuitive on the steering wheel and on the dash, and the seats are almost obscenely comfortable, in my opinion (5’6 @ 145 lbs). Materials are the same in front and back, unlike in the Camry, and legroom is ENDLESS. Road noise is decently isolated. Wind noise can be burdensome at very quick highway speeds (like I said, I drive pretty roughly). The engine is quiet and strong, but the transmission kills the acceleration experience, hence the 4-Star review. There is a plateau between when the electric motor peters out and the Atkinson 4 cyl kick in that makes even RELATIVELY rapid acceleration very frustrating. The transmission shifts extremely slowly and smoothly, but at the appropriate times, especially out of ECO mode. I know some people struggle with fuel economy in their Optimas, but I’ve found nothing but truth in the EPA numbers, pulling down 36 mpg combined in the middle of winter in the mountains of New Jersey. 0-60 time is 7.8 seconds on my best runs (don’t ask me how I know this). Lastly, the car is just so damn stylish. Even 5 years after its release, it still looks pretty relevant, aside from that front lip spoiler. Final recap: its 6-speed transmission doesn’t make it feel as wonderful as it seemed during the test drive (especially when you first start up the car), but the electric torque does feel VERY good on slowish starts. The interior is vey high quality for the segment, although the trunk space leaves much to be desired, albeit the hybrid battery. The exterior is beautiful and seldom seen in the unique hybrid styling. It’s been incredibly reliable over the 30,000 Miles I’ve driven it, including a Canadian road trip and months and months of pizza delivery. Lastly, I find it supremely comfortable and relaxing to drive, as long as I’m not trying to burn rubber. In my hybrid. Because I’m THAT guy.",4

Anything else?! No, I change my oil every 4K miles (full synthetic mobile 1), I have put two sets of tires on her, one K&N air filter, 6 cabin air filters, regular fluid changes,  and she still spits out avg 33mpg. I have 99 problems but a Hybrid component ain't one. Now keep in mind I drive 1000 miles a week on avg. she has been in two accidents (cosmetic damages), but has never left me stranded or in distress (knock on wood). I will tell anyone who is looking for a reliable vehicle to consider Kia. I plan on putting another 150k miles on her before I retire her so I'll keep you posted when I hit 200k.

People stopped me in parking lots and at the car wash. They admired the car and asked lots of questions - I could have been a salesman!  Now I have owned it for a little over 3 years and don't feel the same.Pros: It is a beautiful design. Love the heated steering wheel/seats and the cooling seats. Glove box feature can keep a bottle of water cold.  I'm happy with my leather seats and the sound system.Cons: It does not live up to the MPG claims. I typically end a tank of gas with about 21 mpg. I have gotten up to 29 on the highway but not as often. I'm a good driver and very conscious of the mileage. I am 5'4"" and cannot see over the hood. What I can see is 3-4"" of the hood closest to the windshield even with the drivers seat at maximum height. This has caused numerous problems. The passenger seat feels like I am sitting in a bucket – It should raise up and down like the driver seat. The driver's window clearance in the rear has a much too large blind spot at both corners. I should have also taken note that the battery life in the new car is only 2 years; I think that's a poor proposition. Also the tire life is only 3 years. I would advise you to negotiate both of these items plus the cost of the spare tire that isn't there.I want to trade this model in for the past 2 years for anew or late model Sportage.

My usual combined mileage including one 40 round trip highway trip a week is 24 with ethanol fuel. I have only driven about 73,000 miles since work from home and nothing has broken or needed repair other than a squeaky door which started last summer so the dealer greases hinge every 6 months when there for an oil change.  Weston Kia has been great to work with and offers bargain oil changes! Besides oil and air filter changes I needed new front brake pads at about 50,000 miles and new tires about 35,000 as the OEM set rode great/smooth but wore out fast.  Only other complaint is the hood paint - one rock chip has now rusted out the size of a nickel and would cost at least $500 to fix plus a few lost days so it is what it is. Ironically the doors look new as I installed matching color strips when bought. First car I have ever owned more than 5 years and usually only go 4 - but can't justify selling as it's styling is so similar outside to new ones.",4

Low and behold the air conditioning is working great and the window is going up and down without any problems.   Jump ahead about 4 months and here I am again at the dealership and the air-conditioning is broken along with the window.  They confirmed they were both broken and it would cost me about $4,000 to fix and of course I'm now over the 60,000 mile warranty by a thousand miles and is of course no longer under warranty.  I find it amazing things start braking down after the warranty is up.  Now I get the luxury of driving a car in 100+ heat and I can't even roll the window down.   LUCKY ME!!!",3

Between commuting, family visits, and running a business, I have managed to put over 147,500 miles on it at the time of writing this review.  The car is incredibly comfortable and relaxing to drive, with spacious and supportive seats, extremely responsive steering (I never understood these ""numb-steering"" reviews), well-designed tech, and a quiet interior. Up until mile ~147,490 I never had any major issues with the car; at that point, however, a major engine problem did arise. I won't go into all the gory details, but Kia did a fantastic job taking care of me, despite being outside of warranty (it is worth noting that I have been meticulous about staying on top of regular servicing/maintenance). Not many companies would stand behind their product like they do, which is what inspired me to write this review. Just got the car back last night, drove it close to 60 miles over the past 16 hours, and it feels as great as the day I bought it.

1202, on 03/18/16 10:07 AM (PDT),Kris Parsons ,2013 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Not Impressed with the Optima or KIA," Bought a 2013 brand new KIA Optima LX (4cyl) at Cobb County KIA in Kennesaw, GA.  I came into the dealership with my own financing.  The salesman suggested that I should give their credit manager an opportunity to see if he could beat my current financing rate.  I acquiesced and later regretted that decision.  THREE hours later and after almost walking away from the deal, we finally got the paperwork signed.  Apparently Cobb County KIA uses their credit manager to try and re-negotiate the deal.  Extremely frustrated with how they do business.  About a year later, I'm driving down the highway when I realize I have a flat tire.  No big deal...have had to deal with this several times in my life.  So I pull over to the shoulder, get out, open the trunk and pull up the trunk mat to find....NOTHING...where the spare should be is a little box containing a small air compressor and a can of ""Fix-a-Flat"".  [non-permissible content removed]??  So I call the dealer thinking that surely there's some mistake...but no, the service manager tells me that KIA doesn't put spare tires in the Optima LX.  But they do give you a little air compressor and Fix a flat.  Now I'm pissed...I never even thought to check and see if the car had a spare when I was buying the damn thing.  Logical assumption, right?  Managed to get my car over to Discount Tire where they hooked me up in replacing my tire, and gave me a great deal on a cheap rim and used tire to keep in my car as an actual spare.  Take notes KIA...actual customer service.  Which is why I will always go back to Discount Tire but I will never buy another KIA product.  Engine light comes on yesterday.  Take the Optima by an AutoZone so they could check the code.  Guy tells me it's a fuel sensor code and that KIA hasn't released parts to the parts stores so I'd have to take the car to the dealer for service.  Got an appointment this morning with the Cobb County KIA dealership.  They take it back and after about an hour and half they call me up to tell me that the bad fuel sensor was included as part of a recall and therefore there would be no charge.  Great...finally some good news.  We'll drive it around front for you.  While I'm waiting, he comes back and says the engine light came on again...we need to check it out.  After another hour of waiting, he comes out to tell me that another fuel sensor/GDI pump is bad...but this time it's not covered by a recall or warranty (keep in mind I have 79k miles on the car and is still under the 100k warranty).  $1,067!!!!   Unbelievable.  I express my frustration to him...less than 3 yr old car still under 'warranty' and I'm already paying over a $1,000 for repairs.  Keeping in mind I can't go anywhere else since KIA has a stranglehold on their parts.  This is the final straw for me.  I will never own another KIA product and I will tell everyone I know not to purchase one either.",2

Their district manager stated "" he would not look at it"".   Also, too the car into the dealer for an issue with the gear shift.  When the button is pushed I hear the solenoid in the dash board.  I asked for it to be looked at and was advised nothing is wrong.  Drivers window motor has begun to squeal when the window is rolled up.

And this was before they knew it was an engine problem. Why should a customer have to wait that long just to find out what's wrong with the car?What is the average customer supposed to do when they don't have enough staff to fix their vehicles?Took the car to a local person who will fix the car for 3.2k and have it done in a week.

Passenger seat is way too low and cannot be adjusted up? ( PS Noticed that Kia finally offers a 10 way adjustable passenger seat for 2016 ) No lock on glove box? Poor visability over hood. Road noise excessive, will be changing tires with less than 15,000 K on odometer. Bluetooth will not stay connected? Car does look good though, get complements on a daily basis (Metal Bronze) color. Car has lots of features that are not found on higher priced sedans. Heated rear seats and power folding mirrors are two of them. Wish there was a power outlet that was powered when car is turned off, and wish there was one in the rear or in the trunk like VW. Car is extremely low in the front, looks great but have to be very careful when parking near curb or concrete stops. Dealership is not a well managed place. Employees look like used car dealers from Detroit. When going to the dealer I usually see the entire staff sitting around eating. The place looks and smells like a Deli. They are not very professional and if you are there for any reason (other than giving them a blank check) or a lease for a NEW car, they are completely disinterested. Just changed OEM tires and purchased top rated Pirelli P7, road noise and ride did not improve. Must be the cheap suspension components that are causing the noise. Noticed that the color of the dash material does not match the color of the rest of the interior? Guess they saved money by not matching color.  Car has developed noises in rear of cabin and rattles in dash. Good car for the amount paid. Had since Sept.2012. My advice, spend the extra money and get a higher quality vehicle. The Optima styling hasn’t changed since 2011 and is a little dated now. There is really no reason to buy a new Optima since it still looks the same, except for the usual slight change to front fascia and tail lights. Performance is lack luster.

Mid-2015, the CV Boots finally leaked and there is creaking as I drive. I have purchased both axles and struts and shocks. Brake changes 3 times since purchased. Compressor leaked out refrigerant 3 weeks ago. From my receipts, I have paid about 2300 USD in parts and labor for the last 7 years including oil changes. All work except for the checkup before my move were done by me. 191K on the engine. Rear windows stopped rolling down in 2015. No need to fix. They roll up fine once down, but I use this primarily for commute. Interior issues, none. Seals still intact and no air leaks. No tears in cloth upholstery from wear or other issues. I keep the interior clean and do a deep clean about 1-2 times a year. Steering, Braking and Acceleration are great. Only issue is timing for low gear to high. There is a small amount of lag when shifting into low gears sometimes, but the pickup is great. Exterior looks good. Door handles and door trim are plastic and the paint has chipped off as time has gone by. This is not a big issue, but it effects the uniformity of the exterior, but it is a 13 year old car, so I can't complain. Overall, a great purchase. About 685 per year outside of gasoline for purchase and maintenance. I am satisfied and this is a good, solid used car for everyday commutes.",4
1259, on 09/08/15 07:59 AM (PDT),Carrie ,2004 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 4A),"Great reliable car, awesome gas mileage, low maint"," I bought a 2004 used Kia Optima LX  4cy, front wheel drive, back in 2006 or 2007. It had 47k miles on it. This car was bought from a reputable dealership, one owner, and the cost was about $10,000 dollars. It had air conditioning, powered windows and locks, cd player and radio, powered mirrors, and rear folding seats, with a console to pull down in the back for 2 cup holders. And 2 cup holders in the front. It was awesome on gas. Very reliable (if you take good care of it). Change your belts and pulleys when needed or at 60,000 miles! You have 2 belts. One for power steering and ac and the other is something else. Since it is the sister car to Hyundai, the parts between the 2 are interchangeable. Only issue I had was electrical problems when I hit over 100,000 miles. But it was 10 or 11 years old when I got rid of it. Also, if there are heavy rains or big puddles, your belts will squeal, no harm though. Brakes are good. When it breaks down, might be a little more expensive to repair because it's not american, but you don't have to take it to a special dealership or anything to fix it. Plenty of places will fix them. CONS: During the winter it handles about as well as any front wheel drive, but it sits a little lower to the ground. Electrical issues I had at 100k miles was the horn blaring at random times, and radio being funny. My LX 4 cyl, didn't have heated or cooled seats, sunroof, gps, or blue tooth. But had cigarette outlet and outlet for gps or whatever. Not good for very tall people. My 6ft 7 ex husband had a hard time getting in and out, and leg room problems. It's a good car for short or shorter people. According to my husband at the time, he said it had a 15 or 20 gallon tank. I got about 25-32 mpg. Take good care of it and it will take good care of you. Only cars I will drive are chevy and Kia's.",5

I will say the service is by far # 1 on their agenda - they do a good job of pleasing the customer. The only bad feature is outdated colors for the newer cars.

When I purchased it, it had a clean title, had never been wrecked, clean body, clean interior, everything worked electronically, and mechanically. It had been very well kept and maintained. It had 100k original miles, and I luckily purchased it off of a private seller at an unbeatable price that you absolutely couldn't refuse. At first, I was hesitant until I had actually seen the car in person, and had test drove it, I had never owned a newer car like such, nor did I have any experience with Kia's, driving them, or knew much about them. But I gave it a shot and took it for a test drive, mind you it was winter time, and there was plenty of snow on the roads. After my first time driving it I was inlove! Completely! I made up my mind, and purchased the vehicle about a week later. The car drove, and handled flawlessly! Easy to drive, very comfortable, very agile, and to be honest it was a fast little thing! I never had any serious problems with it, only normal wear and tear, and normal routine maintenance. All repairs were very affordable, parts werent hard to come by, nor were they expensive. Labor on the vehicle was always very affordable also, every mechanic that had done work on it said it was relatively easy to repair. This car had never steered me wrong! Very reliable, and very safe too!!! It has alot of the newer, luxury, sought out features, like the AUX port, vallet parking safety feature in the trunk, keyless entry, etc. Its very roomy and spacious for its size, seats 5 comfortably, has multiple cup holders, arm rest folds down in the center seat in the back, the back seats come down for more storage room in the trunk, the trunk is a pretty decent size, etc. It has multiple different storage spaces in the front center console, classes holder by the rear view mirror, reading lights, lights in the visors, as well as mirrors. The heat, and AC work great, and circulate great through out the vehicle. It has heated exterior mirrors, which are perfect in the winter. Automatic headlights, which provide perfect visibility at night. Temp. guage, avg mpg, range, and distance display. It has the manual drive, slap stick option which is great in the winter providing you with more traction and control in lower gears. Overall its not bad on gas at all. Also hands down one of the safest cars I've ever owned, or driven! These cars are built like bricks, unfortunately Ive first hand seen how safe these cars are built, due to 2 separate accidents I was in, in this vehicle, and I would never feel unsafe myself or be hesitant to have my child in this car because Ive seen first hand how safe they really are! this car changed my entire outlook on cars, I am now a die hard KIA fan, and will not buy anything other than a KIA because of the experience I had with this model! I would recommend this car to just about anyone, young or old! Fantastic car, I honestly dont think theres 1 thing I could say thats bad about this vehicle! great car!!!",5

I won't be winning any drag races but if I am passing someone on a 2 lane and drop to 3rd. I get around them well.  The car handles very well except on wet roads.  I have tried different tires but the results are minimally different.  I have to be careful and not try to stop quickly or turn quickly on wet roads or the car will fish tail.  On dry roads it handles very well and the ride is smooth.  Visibility is very good.  The stock radio is fine for me.  The road noise is not too bad.  What I love the most about this car is how reliable it has been.  I have had no major problems at all.  Have replaced the battery 2 times and the tires 1 time.  I started going through oil at @105,000 miles.  I had to top it off about every 1600 miles.  I just had the car looked at and the plugs and belt replaced.  My mileage was 123,500.  The man was able to fix the oil leak problem with a very minor tightening of something but I don't remember what.  The problem has been solved.  I am very pleased with how well this car has held up since I drive it for work so am in it a good bit.  I also bought an 07 Kia Rondo with the exact same engine and it is doing well also.

There is absolutely no style to this car - it is super generic. These things don't detract from how good the Optima is.",4.75

I could see the quality in the car. The lower price sealed the deal. The engine was clean and sounded good. I like the dual auto/manual shifting. I had 2 Toyota Corollas and this is much better. Better comfort than my Crown Victoria. A/C system is stronger than the Crown Vic. The increased MPG from my Chevy S10 will take me one month without fill ups or 512 miles. That's great for a long trip. The 2.4 liter is surprising nice and can handle almost anything. I think this car is a winner for the price.

The pillars on the front windshield can be difficult to see around and I have removed the headrests because of visibility issues as well. The shift gate is an absolute nuisance when trying to go from ""D"" to ""R"". The key fob frequently opens my trunk because of additional keys in my pocket, but that's pretty nit-picky. Stock tires bad -  I put ""winters"" on this year to manage that. All in all, a sound vehicle at a terrific price warranties are questionable only because of the difference between dealerships.

Its somewhat of an adjustment coming down from a Toyota Avalon. However, I am very happy with the balance between luxury and economy in the Kia. The interior and exterior appearance are definitely luxury. The ride and price is definitely economy. So keep that in mind.  The experience buying the car was excellent.

My mileage has steadily increased with each fill from 27 mpg to 29.5 for my driving.  The car is quiet and shifts smooth (although a bit too frequently).

Performance is excellent, the 5-speed manual is smooth as silk, the engine feels more powerful than the numbers would suggest.  Handling is good and the interior is comfortable and quiet (a big change from my old Rio.  It was a great little car, but let's face it, it was a go-cart with doors!).

This is one fun car to drive and I am very impressed with the peppy engine, interior room, and good looks. Great visibility gives a real 'feel' for the road. Our car includes the Appearance Pkg which really adds lots of 'goodies' and well worth the money.

Lots of little extras make the car appear upscale including extended sun visors, steering wheel controls for cruise/stereo, and blue dash lighting. The car has 3000 miles and has had a few glitches.

I was a previous owner of a 2012 and a 2015.  (all the base line of the Ex Trim.) This is a very nice car but I lost a few things from the previous 2.  I lost fog lights, engine power, dual exhaust in my opinion better sounding speakers. you also loose the lit up cup holders and holders in the door.     At first when I got the car I was un happy with it. But as an owner in the last few weeks I'm really beginning to like it.  In my EX base I have very comfortable seats with memory placement for 2 people, a newer dash, a improved Air conditioner, it's quiet and smooth (as far as wind noise)  With this car you do still hear road noise, ( just like the old one)  Very much improved gas mileage, Satellite radio is much easier to navigate, Bigger glove department. This car can drive in 3 modes economy, Standard and sports mode.  As time went on I realised there is a big difference in power driving in sports mode than in Economy mode.  In sports mode and normal mode you get much more power than in economy mode but in my opinion not as much as in the older models. but it's enough.  The older model had 195 horse power vs this model has 185.  One thing thats great the oil changes are done at 7500 miles vs 5000.

To the new 2017 Kia Optima SXL I must say Wow what a big Difference. 2014 Optima was not bad for its age but this new one beats it in every way possible. Yes it has less HP but it seems quicker you get 260 hp tourq at very low 1350 rpm compare to previous which came in about 1650rpm . The New sport,eco,normal modes compared to to previous gen are realy,realy good and noticeable. Steering is better interior cabin is much much quieter plus more roomy . Technology in this new Optima is outstanding I love the smart cruise control , Auto hold and atnomuse breaking all these safety tech features have been engaged at some point of my driving since I owned it . Thank god nothing has happen to me or the car . Only thing I don't like about the car very small and very hardly noticeable if you are a picky person like me . That are the Kia kick plates or cup holder they no longer illuminate , the instrument cluster gadeged no longer go all the way to max RPM upon start of the car. Last but not least thier is a bit of engine noise in the cabin when flooring the the car at low rpms not a bad thing sometimes it's kinda annoys me . Other then those little inprofections the car is great!",5

1471, on 07/30/17 19:19 PM (PDT),Wick ,2005 Kia Optima Sedan EX V6 4dr Sedan (2.7L 6cyl 4A),12 Years and Still Going Strong," Bought this car in 2005 (12 years ago), primarily for my wife's use.  Bought it on the basis of price and warranty with the idea that a manufacturer would not offer a 10yr./100,000 mile drive train warranty on a sub-standard product.  Was not disappointed.  Twelve years later and no engine or drive train problems.   Since I rarely drive, or even ride, in this vehicle I can't say much about handling, comfort, etc. except that my wife hasn't complained.  I do, however, deal with the maintenance  and repair.  We have not had any major repair issues in these 12 years.  Just  normal maintenance and repairs that are the result of normal wear and tear (tires, brakes, etc.)   And after 11 Wisconsin winters the paint is still very good with the exception of two small spots of rust.  But the vehicle's electrical system has been an annoyance in that I have had to replace numerous exterior lights (tail lights, brake lights, turn signals and headlights) much more frequently than on any other vehicle that I've ever owned.  Also have had a problem with the power drivers seat.  The dealership replaced the switch while warranty was still in effect.  It again began to malfunction a few months ago.  At that time the problem was corrected by cleaning the contacts on the switch.   Other than the nuisance problems with the lights and power seat switch, this has been a very reliable, durable vehicle.  A very good value.",5

My car currently has about 47,500 miles on it, less than 2 yrs old, and has had knocking noise when accelerating, white smoke out of tailpipe, and check engine light came on right before it started violently shaking.   I then had to have it towed to a Kia dealership. I have kept up with routine oil changes/maintenance.   After googling this issue, I found that there were MULTIPLE complaints with newer KIAs regarding the same issues.  I am hoping, unlike MANY of the complaints & class action lawsuit I read online, that my engine will be covered under warranty.  This engine needs to be RECALLED (like the Hyundai Sonata engine)!  I also spoke with my neighbor who has a Kia Optima with the same issues (Hers is making a loud knocking noise). I also have received comments from numerous friends on Facebook who complain of the same issue as well.  The dealership says its Oil Sludge.   I took care of my car like I should have & am stuck now in a hardship both financially & physically.  Super stressful!!! Especially when I have previously owned/leased 5 other cars before this with absolutely NO mechanical problems…My previous car was a Toyota Camry with over 100k miles on it and ran perfectly when I sold it to buy a new Kia.  I maintained it the same way I have maintained my Kia and the other cars I’ve had (Lexus, Nissan, Honda).  This is the first time I’ve ever had a major issue with a car I’ve owned… And it was bought brand new (unlike some of my other previous cars)! In speaking with a few different mechanics and friends who know a lot about cars, this seems to be a KIA engine issue, and they know of no cars that get oil sludge being this new and even cars who have gone without oil changes for 15k+ miles.

Lowered the price so there bank would approved me and I got my first brand new car. The car runs great.

1563, on 03/02/16 21:14 PM (PST),Tyler ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),More than I expected from a new mid-sized sedan," I leased this car after my 2002 Ford Taurus was finally put to rest.  I grew up riding in that car as a kid, it was my first car, and I broke 200k miles in it; bear that in mind as you read this review.  When I test drove this car, my first impressions were that the steering was loose, the interior was excellent, and it was far and away the best looking midsize sedan in its class alongside the Ford Fusion.  I liked it, and it was the cheapest lease deal I found, believe it or not.  With taxes/fees etc. I paid $1000 down and $177 a month for a two year lease.Performance-wise, this car met my expectations.  The 2.4L puts down 192 HP and 181 ft-lbs of torque.  It accelerates as hard as I'd ever want or need it to, and I never have problems passing people.  The brakes, as in any proper new car, are fantastic.  Thankfully this car has a true automatic transmission instead of a CVT (which I can't stand) and it even has the option to go into a pseudo-manual mode.  The tranny searches for gears very rarely.  The steering, like I said before, is really loose.  I got used to it, it really isn't that big of a deal.  Test drive one and you'll see what I mean.  The steering is probably the biggest point about this car to be debated.The seats are excellent.  They hold you in when you throw the car through a corner and they keep you comfortable on long road trips.  The rear seats are good too.  There is a good amount of leg room for its class.  It rides as smooth as you'd expect it to for a mid-sized sedan.  The headlights are FANTASTIC.  It has HIDs for the standard lights, and halogens for the high beams.  What's nice about this car is it has fog lights as a standard feature.  Unfortunately, they really don't do a whole lot.  I can barely notice the difference with them on, even in fog/rain/darkness, but it doesn't matter anyway because the normal lights work so well by themselves.  I think Kia just put them there as a way to ""one-up"" other car companies. They make it look better.The rear visibility is not that good, for some reason.  Blind spots and forward visibility is great, but rear visibility seems limited.  You can still see fine, but the field of view is smaller than what I'm used to.  There is no standard rear view camera.  A lot of other new cars have this as a standard feature, which is something to keep in mind.  The bluetooth feature is nice because I've never used it before on my phone.  It is all very intuitive once you set it up at the dealership.  The stereo is...not that good.  It works fine and enjoy listening to it, but it definitely isn't the best.  Changing the bass/treble/middle etc. doesn't help much.  This is probably the worst feature of the car, and thankfully that isn't saying a whole lot.  It came with 3 months of free satellite radio, which I didn't really care about.  I listen to my radio stations, iPod, and CDs.  All are very easy to use in this car.The climate controls are great.  Everything is set up intuitively and it warms up/cools down the cabin quickly when I want it to.  The interior materials themselves actually surprised me.  There is quite a bit of soft and hard touch materials in this interior, and it was designed really well.  It is a really pleasing place to be.  My grandpa wouldn't shut up about it when I took him for a ride, he thought he was riding in a Cadillac.  It's designed really well but at the same time you know you aren't in a high end luxury vehicle either.  To be fair, there isn't a whole lot of cheap plastic - they instead opted for a lot of leathery-like materials and it really looks good.The tires are just a standard all-season, Nexen (Korean tire).  Nothing to write home about, but it isn't anything less than I'd expect.  This car does as well as I'd expect it would in the dirty, snowy, icy winters Buffalo is famous for.  I don't underestimate the importance of the quality of tire you put on your vehicle, and I have to say I'm pleased with how these tires (and the car in general) have gotten me through the winter.  They aren't outstanding, but they get the job done.I get 29 mpg in this car and I drive it pretty hard.  I'd say I have a 70% highway 30% city mix, and I drive fast on the highway (65-75 mph).  When I actually do the speed limit, I get 33 mpg in this car with 87 octane.  I'm pleased with that, considering how spirited of a driver I am.To sum up, I'd say the strengths of this car are how incredibly good looking it is, and how attractive and intuitive the interior is compared to the other cars in its class.  Its weakness is its sound system.  I'm an enthusiast and would rather be driving a Subaru WRX or Focus RS, but for now this is what I can afford that is new.  This car was everything I expected/wanted out of it.  I got this car because I needed something that wouldn't break down, (a new car) something that isn't terrible in the snow, (Front Wheel Drive) and was the cheapest lease deal I could find.",4
1564, on 03/01/16 03:48 AM (PST),Michelle ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Very Happy So Far," I bought this vechile 5 months ago after having a horrible experince with the Chevy Cruise. The car itself is by far prettier than the chevy. I love the look of it and the colour. The interior is a bit light so I sprayed sctoch gard on it in hopes that will persver the life of it. But the seats clean easily and well to my surprise. The inside cabin has a nice and comfortble feel. I like the seats. The passenger seat sits low but that is good considering my husband is 6""7 so this provides him with comfort for his head. Plenty of leg room.My son and his buddies say the backseat is very comfortable. They actually perfer sitting in the back. I do think the seats could had used a little more cushing. Newer cars get less good gas mileage and thinner seats...every year it gets worse. The radio does not have good sound quality and I would had excepted more from the cars price range. But I love everything else.The car itself stops perfectly. I had a car pull out in front of me and I thought well there goes my new car and I hit the brake and came to a comfortable complete stop. I couldn't believe it. The other car kept driving like I wasn't even there. The pick up is great even on the economy. I've taken it off the economy a couple of times for a day at a time just to see and it doesn't really see to effect the gas much at all and gives a nice extra boost. I really like the smooth drive of the car. Very nice. The inside cabin is a big nosier than excepted but I honestly really love this car.I'm so glad I bought it. It is fun, handels well, safe and it looks nice. Inside and out. Plenty of storage in the trunk and the glove box and the arm rest. I really like this car.The only thing I would really consider when buying this is the gas mileage is poor. I average about 19mpg. There is a bar to help you see how you drive for the gas mileage and initially I was getting about 28mpg but the snow birds are here so that makes stopping and going mading and well it has dropped quite a bit. That I'm not really happy about but what are you going to do?Still would buy the car again. Love this Optima.",4

It woukd be fine for someone 5'5 or taller but otherwise you feel like you are in a small cage with only windows looking up to the sky. Otherwise all other seats and parts of the car are great. Wish there was a light in the trunk. Great deal and great seevice.,4

At speeds over 55 car requires constant adjustment to keep it straight.  If you do not adjust the steering wheel constantly you will find your self in the other lane or off the road.

It looks great, the exterior the lights daul exhaust ect.. Problem 1.THIS CAR IS SLOOOOW, forget the exterior profile, stance, whatever. This cars take off, acceleration, both are slow.. even with the manual mode.2. This cars quality is extremly low. Since i got this car a year ago i have have more problems then i ever have befor ever with any other leased vehicle. My car has gone as far as to have water (after rain) get stuck inside the compartment behind the glove box and leak into my passanger seat.. and flood the floor and carpet.MY WINDOWS FREEZE AND LOCK CONSTANLY . And kia dealrship says there doors are ment to do that?The antenna has also fell off.. 3. Kia dealership is hard to deal with ahen it comes to these issues.. Many issues are blown off and said to just be ""a kia thing""The wear on this car for one year is bad. I had my wheels rotated and saw the rust under the brakes, j have never seen a car get that rusted befor in such a small amount of time.. 1 yr.. i guess you get what you pay for but like this wasnt all to cheap either.. .. i really wanted to like this car.. i would definetly not recomend it, the braking system locks up and the car skids.. this happened to me just after getting it, i understand i am a fast driver, never crashed.. but i hit the brakes one day and it skid, not for to long.. but definet clear skid.. it was honestly kind of emberessing....I wouldnt recommend",1
1570, on 01/24/16 15:03 PM (PST),Michael ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Optima LX /w ConvPackPlus," At a little over 8000 miles, the automobile is serving me well. No problems at all. Seating is comfortable. Power's fine at 192 horses.  Gas mileage is good, mine are mostly highway miles. Road noise is a little louder than I'd like, but its not an upscale vehicle, more of a very adequate one.  That is what I sought when I purchased it.Updated on 2/1/17...so, I like the car very much; I describe it as driving like a BMW.  Don't know if that's true, but the car runs well without problems and accelerates adequately.  The dealer, however, in repairing a latch on the underbody engine shield charged $166.  I wonder since I never hit anything whether that was an appropriate charge. Wasn't like I hit a pothole and such circumstances beg the question as to whether the engine latch failed under normal driving conditions.  Plan to write the dealership owner. Other than that I love the car.",4

I love this car. I have owned over 3 new vehicles and this is by far the best one yet. The exterior is very sleek and the interior is great as well. The only complaint i have about this vehicle is the fact that the front passenger seat is very low and does not adjust. Also you can not get this vehicle in a manual transmission. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone and i would purchase another one if i ever had the need for a new vehicle.",5
1573, on 12/16/15 15:45 PM (PST),Debbie Hamilton ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Screwed when left the car lot," The 2015 Kia Optima rode very smooth and I truly enjoyed it. When I first purchased it I enjoyed the car. I drove it home from the dealership and it kept pulling to the right. So, I take it back to the dealership and they said to take to service. I take it back to the service and they were to put it on the machine which I truly doubt it. Because it is still pulling to the right. It is also hard to keep in the road. My next problem is that the engine roars loud and it shakes. I have taken it to the service department and all they do is drive it. The next thing is ""I can't duplicate the problem"". I also have had a sour smell coming from the air condition. But the service department keeps saying it doesn't have a smell. I paid 89.00 to have it serviced for the smell and later they realized that it did have a smell. so that gave me a oil change coupon instead of giving me my money back. It took 3 times for them to actually take care of this. The transmission is another problem that I have been have with this car. When riding in a 30 mile drive condition, the transmission jerks and boots. The service manager has driven and has seen it boot but, he claims it is the way the car is to run. The tires on this car roars so loud when you are riding down the road that you can not hear yourself think. The also has chips of tire missing from the tires. For a new car I have had so much trouble and the service department fail to work on it. All they do is drive the car so the mileage can bill up. Also, the brakes on this car rubs and I feel it is a safety hazard to all men. Kia is aware of all these problems. They just don't want to admit they have lemons. I have a 2015 Kia Optima LX which was purchased with 3 miles. I have replaced my windshield wipes and I can not get any help from the service manager or the maker. The tech from headquarters was to come out but all of a sudden he decides not to come. I have had so many problems and I am so unhappy with this car. It makes me wonder it I received a car that the mileage has been set back. It runs like a car that has been used. How does a new engine shakes and makes the dashboard shake? How can anyone get help from a service department that does not want to help. Kia has cost me a lot of unnecessary time at the service department and has cost my faith in Kia to be none at all. I purchased the vehicle from Victory Kia of Victoria TX and I will not referred anyone to this dealership. Victory is only concerned with selling not their customers. What am I to do with a car that is not doing what the papers and sales people said it would do.  It's been 2 yrs and 3 months that I have had this vehicle. The engine has noise as if the lifters are going bad. The service department  continues say they don't hear anything. I will never buy another Kia or will I refer anyone to buy a Kia. I am truly unhappy with this car. The service center in Victoria Tx needs to be observed. All they do is lie to their customers and beat people out of their money. You are not being represented well.",1

I've got a friend with an Optima - 2011 - he loves it. The 2015 has upgraded engine and performance which was one of his complaints on the 2011 model.The passenger front seat is ridiculously low...close to the floor, and not adjustable upwards. My wife could barely see over the dashboard and she is 5'4"". I found out this is an ongoing complaint for this and other Hyundai and Kia models. I found a set of risers that bolt onto the original set points and raise the seat almost 2 inches. Easy install and corrected the problem. You can find them online...just do a search.Interior is well appointed and quality is fine at this price point. Car, looks, feels and drives like a more expensive model. I've owned BMW, and own a Honda Accord and this car easily competes with both of them at a lower purchase price. Edmunds has done a good review of all the features...I opted for the Convenience Plus Package upgrade which includes rearview camera, acoustically upgraded windows (noise reduction) and a few other goodies. It is worth it. Without the rearview camera you're going to find backing up entails lots of blind spots given the high rear end and a sharply raked rear window. I've driven this car in monsoon like rain at night and the handling, traction control, fog lamps...all served to give us a sense of control and safety. I bought the Sparkling Silver with light grey interior. Its sharp.At the price point",5
1576, on 11/10/15 20:49 PM (PST),Pauli ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Junk car!," Kia (and Hyundai) are trying to rival the Japanese with this optima. But they are not even close in terms of reliability and quality. This Optima may look good on the outside, but the looks are deceiving!Purchased a new 2015 Optima from Mr Fucilo Kia. It had 5,000 miles on it. What an absolute junk car! the dash is cheap and made of plastics that vibrates. Seats are uncomfortable. The transmission is very weak, it seeks gears like if it slipping and it only has 5,000 miles on it. With the AC on the car feel lifeless there is no power.The reason I call it a junk car is because the engine blew on me in the middle of the highway, I had a sudden loss of power while i was in the middle lane, the electronics failed which caused the steering  to be unresponsive and could not change direction. Now it needs a new engine, only after 5000 miles! what a joke!Definitely going back to Honda or Toyota, they are an established brand that has been around for decades. They know how to make cars! How long have Kia and Hyundai been on the roads with this GDi engine? maybe 5 years?",1
1577, on 11/03/15 14:12 PM (PST),Carl ,2015 Kia Optima Sedan SX Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great car so far," I purchased the Kia Optima Turbo SXL and I must say I'm very impressed with the ride quality. The Car is very very fast and gets up to 100 miles with very little effort in normal mode. If you put it in Sports Mode, forget it this thing is crazy fast. The ride is smooth and quite yet its has the sportiness when you want it.  I was going to get the 2106 Maxima but I'm glad I decided on this car instead. The Maxima is a nice car but the Kia has some advantages over it. The Max takes premium gas, the Kia takes regular gas. The Max has a CVT transmission and the Kia has an 6 gear transmission and the Kia has a much better warranty. The Max is 8 k more.All in all i'm happy with my decision and don't regret it one bit.",5

So based on all these miles I've driven there are a few things that have happened along the way. It's a good car I haven't had much trouble with it. I would probably buy again. So here's what you guys look for in a review...the issues . 1. It doesn't come with a spare tire.  (found that out the hard way). 2. At 140 thousand miles the ac compressor went out costing me right at 1000 dollars to fix.  Now something is going on with the front end I have an appointment to have that looked at tomorrow. The clear coat is peeling off in several places and there is a rust spot on the hood. The interior has held up nicely still like brand new. The car runs great overall!  I loved it when I bought it and I still love it.. Just the body issues such as the clear coat and the rust spot have kind of gotten me a little upset.  Overall I give it my blessing after all 145 thousands miles is 3 years is a lot.,4

I was somewhat rushed into this sale so I feel sort of cheated out of my decision. I realize I signed the contract but the finance manager was so rude and when I was not in agreement he would get mad and make faces and pace around like crazy. I felt like the internet sales group and finance manager were just interested in making their cut on the deal. They didn't even let me look around at other vehicles. They just drove one up to the front of the dealership and said this one is perfect for you. My old Kia was good and I only had like 12,000 miles on it. It was practically brand new still. I don't like the passenger seat that does not go up or down. You sit way too low like a low rider ugh! That is one thing I did not notice when I looked at the car. Another thing the only difference in the car I had and the new one is the buttons on the steering wheel and they are awkward.  Other than that and the unprofessional people at the dealership I like the car.Now that I have driven the new Kia. I have found that the passenger seat sits way too low. There is no lever to adjust the height on that seat. You are basically stuck with it. Not really many changes to this new Kia to my 2013 besides the passenger seat being too low and a few extra buttons on the steering wheel. The dealership did not even try to call me or write me to apologize for their finance manager's dealings nor nothing.

Performance is much better than the Fusion...But the stereo and steering wheel controls are just goofy - bad layout and bad function.Update after owning the car for about 18 months:The lack of tech for a car at this price point is disturbing, and what tech it has is poorly designed at best. The radio works, but is nothing special and ipod controls are pathetic. The handling gets squirrelly at speeds over 75. High winds blow the car like it has a sail on the roof.Gas mileage drops off significantly at speeds over 60 and arent great in city driving.That said, the seats are good. The addition of a rear heated seat is nice. Front cooled seats are nice but barely function.Rear airflow is poor and you have to close off at least 2 front vents for the rear vents to have any airflow.Kia warranty is a NIGHTMARE to deal with and if you cant show maintenance receipts they will void the warranty.The requirement to have an oil change every 6 months - even for moderately low mileage - is archaic and wasteful. Dont get me wrong... its a good car. With some minor tweaks and Kia adopting the same corporate attitude as their sister company (hyundai) it could be great.",4

1593, on 03/12/18 10:01 AM (PDT),Viper122 ,2018 Kia Optima Sedan SX Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Keeping up with Honda and Toyota," I've owned this car for about 2 months now (1500 miles) so here are some little observations and quirky things I've noticed.  First, the car is great and I'm amazed this is a Kia.  I opted for the Limited package because I wanted the nice seats and I do love the heated steering wheel.  The car is gorgeous.  By comparison, I do believe an Accord Touring or Camry XSE would have cost me more.  Without the Limited package, the Kia SX is a steal.  A big part of my decision was the 10yr/100,000 powertrain warranty and I did extend the basic warranty from 5yr/60,000 to 10 yr/100,000 to match the powertrain.  That's a win in my book. Now for the car.  Engine is fairly strong. Sound isn't inspiring--just a 4-banger chugging along.  One note about gas mileage and turbos: If you're on the gas, you're mileage is not great.  I'm coming from a 470hp car and while I'm not crazy on the gas pedal, city driving is getting me about 20mpg.  Highway in Eco mode I got 32mpg.  Also, in Sport mode there is a noticeable difference in the throttle response (touchy), shifting and steering and I'm sure the mpg would take a bit more of a hit.  The brakes on this car can be grabby at times, but according to tests, are excellent in stopping.  Acceleration is smooth--it's a quick car.  As far as interior goes, it's great.  Pretty close to entry-level luxury really.  No issues with the infotainment or navigation. Car play works fine, though loading iHeartradio can lag.  One unfortunate thing is if you use CarPlay with Google maps, you give up the turn-by-turn directions in the center display from the Kia navigation.  There is some minor ambient lighting in the car: One small pinhole-type LED light from the sunroof console and two low-watt red lights shining into the door pockets.  Headlights are superb with the SX LED headlights and the beams turn with the car.  Adaptive Cruise control is great; however, if you don't pay attention to your speed, you'll end up driving behind someone doing say 60 when you're cruise is set at 70.  Car will automatically speeds up when you change lanes and get out from behind the slower car. And allegedly, this car is capable of coming to a complete stop with the cruise/collision avoidance system.  I did have the collision avoidance kick-in on me once on the highway.  I was traveling about 70 and came around a curve on a truck probably traveling about 50 and the front radar ""sensed"" the closing speed and I felt the car start braking and watched the speed start dropping in anticipation of a collision.  Pretty neat safety stuff right there.  Blind-spot/Lane Change Warning is great.  Lane keeping assist is good, though if you are a driver that is close to or hits the lane lines alot, you may want to turn it off.  It beeps on the side of the car for the respective lane you veer out of.  Rear-collision avoidance is a plus; has kicked in on me a couple times while backing out of parking spaces.  ""Birdseye"" camera view is awesome to assist in parking.   As far as quirky things, when you walk up to the car the mirrors will fold out and the door handle ""pocket lights"" come on.  That's fine, but if you're outside the car (with car locked), everytime you get close this will happen: they'll fold in, then sense you close again and fold out.  You can, however, turn off the mirrors in the car.  The mirrors fold in when you lock the car. Also, the ""Smart trunk"" can be an issue if you don't pay attention.  If you walk to the back of the car and stand a couple feet away, the car will start beeping and the lights will flash 4 times.  Then the trunk will pop open.  It's nice, but incomplete because you still have to reach down to open trunk completely (they should have some mechanism to do that).  Problem is if you go around the back of your car and stop for more then 4 seconds, that trunk is popping open.  I did this once while talking to my GF and got in the car and trunk was open.  Whoops.  What's missing:  No remote start.  You can purchase and with a dealer install probably about $800-1000.  And you have a separate remote.  Should be integrated and included in a package.  Nitpicky items: Car has no ""puddle lights"" that shine on the ground when you approach/open car.  And my car did not have the ""sport pedals"" which I thought were standard in the SX.  I purchased them separately and it took all of 15 minutes to install.  And after the first washing, my realization that the Limited wheels would be a pain to clean are true. You need a soft brush to get in between the spokes of the wheel.  Most of what you find in the SX Limited is available in other top-of-the-line midsize sedans so for me it came down to styling and warranty.  I do like the new Camry, but not worth the extra money and factor in a warranty and the decision was easier.  Lots of great mid-size cars out there so it really comes down to what you like.  Kia's done a fantastic job with their cars and it shows in their rankings.  I'm super happy with this car.",5
1594, on 02/01/18 12:08 PM (PST),Don Goffman ,2018 Kia Optima Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),BEWARE OF FAKE PICTURES & DISCLAIMERS," If you're researching the car on Kia.com or a dealer's website, you need to know that the picture associated with what you're building or what is available in the dealer's inventory is NOT the car you think you're getting. For the 2018 Optima EX, if you're interested in the basic model or adding the Premium Package please be advised that the picture shown (with fog lights) only comes if you also purchase the technology package as well. In spite of the picture shown, the fog lights are NOT part of the Optima EX without the Technology Package. Unfortunately, I didn't find that out until I went to lease the vehicle. After speaking with KIA I learned that, even though the picture shown is not the correct one or should I say the misleading one, it is mentioned below the picture IF you click on Disclaimers!  BUYER BEWARE!",4

We purchased the 2017 Sorento SXL last spring after considering many other luxury brand SUV's and have been truly impressed. Decided it was a safe bet to trade the C-Class for the Optima. We've been very happy with the Optima thus far. It's a very quiet, comfortable vehicle with more than enough space for a family of 4. (It's not as quiet on the freeway as my Mercedes, but I don't expect that at $20K less than the 2018 C-Class comparably equipped.) You get a lot for the money, especially the SXL trim package, made better by the great deal we got on the purchase price... $4000 below MSRP. Kia's brand reliability (see Consumer's Reports) combined with the value for the money should make other car brands like Honda and Toyota take notice.",5

As far as I know, 2012 was the first year Kia did the Hybrid, and with anything new, there are going to be flaws. I should have done more research prior. I bought this 2012 Hybrid with 64,000 miles. Before I even got my plates, the transmission started skipping. I took it to the dealer here in SLC, UT and the dealer could not diagnose the problem for 3 days. You would think something this messed up would not be blamed on the driver - especially at only 66,000 miles. The dealer had to call the main factory in CA, and after a few more days it was determined that the transmission was messed up due to the fact that it was a Hybrid, it was not engaging correctly with the engine. This was a $3500 fix. Here is where it would be nice for a manufacturer to step up, admit their flaws and faults and fix the problem - not charging the consumer. Too many times manufactures try to duplicate their competition and in so doing have to figure out the kinks and problems - like every manufacturer does...the problem here is Kia expects the consumers to not only tell them what is wrong (by bringing the car into the dealer to get fixed), but they expect the consumer to pay for it as well. Kia is basically getting their research paid for by consumers so that the next year they can fix the flaws and have a better car...this seems messed up and backwards to me. I would have been loyal for life if Kia would have accepted responsibility and resolved the issue. They need to have a recall on the transmissions for the 2012 Hybrids, but unless something kills someone in today's society, no one admits to anything. Again, I should have done more research, I thought that I would not have any problems with a car that only had 66,000 miles. I will never own or trust Kia again, I will stick to Toyota.",1

While driving approximately 55mph the vehicle went into ""limp mode"" and told us to ""pull over and safely exit the vehicle"" (this was displayed on the dash). If I tried to put it in drive it would make a very hard jump, and would not accelerate. Upon contacting Kia I was told that there was no road side assistance because our car was out of warranty. So we loaded the vehicle up on my parents flat bed and hauled it to the dealership it was purchased from in Ocala, Fl (we were in Jax, Fl and insurance wouldn't transport it that far). Thank God for the extended warranty! Because after sitting in the dealership for over two weeks while they were ""waiting to hear back from Korea, because we've never seen this problem"" the car needed a new transmission and new electric motor. If we wouldn't have had the extended warranty I would have set the damn thing on fire because I can't imagine what the cost of that was (our repair bill did not give a price). On top of the transmission and electronic motor going out, the buttons to change the station on the steering wheel do not work properly, and the steering wheel itself is peeling apart. Front air damn fell off going down the road. According to Kia it was because my wife couldn't park, but I think it was never put on properly. Steering wheel makes a clicking noise if you barely turn it while the vehicle is stopped. I'm sure it will break while we're on the highway. Fit and finish are decent but the car does not live up to its price tag or its estimated fuel economy. Our warranty goes out at 100k so at that time we'll trade it in for $1,500 and put that towards a Honda.",3

1607, on 07/24/18 19:22 PM (PDT),Beth ,2012 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Hands down the BEST car I have ever owned," I bought this car in 2013 when it was a year old and it had 13xxx miles on it.   I did exhaustive research before buying and the Optima stood out for safety, satisfaction, price, and options.  The styling is what drew me in, it is just an attractive, slightly sporty looking car.  And I drive a LOT.  I have a weekly commute to work of 450 miles, plus I like to get out on the weekends, so the miles just sort of racked up.   In five years, I had one battery change, two tire purchases, and countless regular oil changes.  That's it.  No really--that is it.  I added about 135,000 miles to this car with really zero repairs.   Just last week (over five years later), I was hit head on and my sweet Kia was totalled.   I am not digging the design changes for the newer (17-18) models, so I am doing exhaustive research again.  I'm also considering finding another 2012, it was that great.   The features you get for the price are unbeatable, it's zippy to drive, and comfortable for road trips.  The trunk is unbelievably huge.   Best car ever.",5

1610, on 02/18/18 20:22 PM (PST),Kool ,2012 Kia Optima Sedan EX Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Smooth Sailing!," I have owned nothing but two vehicles since I entered adulthood after owning a 2004 Chrysler Sebring sedan (2.7L) that had mediocre reliability with the exception of consistently oil leaks, ignition coil number 6, and air conditioning issues, as well as ball joint noises, and squealing brakes -- oh! the driver side window motor was blown, so I had gotten fed up and I saw a Kia Optima EX Turbo on my dealership's lot dressed in Snow White Pearl, with a panoramic glass roof with the black gloss inserts that looked stunning! Ever since a family member rented a Kia Optima LX, I knew from the start I wanted an Optima. And I was blessed enough to purchase that Optima EX Turbo and fell in love with the creature comforts of having climate control seats for either season of the year - summer or winter - as well as rear heated seats for my rear occupants. How lovely! I also enjoyed the heated steering wheel and the Infinity high-definition audio sound system. Among other things, the power folding mirrors are a huge help, turning into a tight parking spot, or entering an automated car wash. The 2.0T moves the sedan like a six-cylinder engine while delivering 4-cylinder fuel economy, but it could be a bit better with an ounce of turbo lag, as well.  With all things, there are some ups and downs, and they are the steering wheel persistent issues with the coupling that caused the steering to make a ""clicking noise when maneuvering left or right"" that was fixed under warranty from Kia Motor Corporation; moreover, I had my clock spring replaced (out of warranty), that ceased my horn, and caused my airbag light to illuminate, and I had to replace my car battery at 60k miles because it had a dead cell; and I had to replace my multi-functional  fog lamp switch to regain function to reoperate my fog lamps. Also, the Infinity sound system sounds phenomenal, but it also causes excessive vibration and noise from the cheap panels in doors and headliner that will make it unpleasant at times. The leatherette on the steering wheel is peeling excessively, even at the time of purchase, and the leather seats are easy to rip and cut.  All and all, I think this Kia has been reliable, but I don't want to speak too fast because I always go back on my word or at least sometimes.",4

My car had exactly 60k miles on it at time of purchase which was slightly high miles, but I was too thrilled about getting rid of my old 2004 Chrysler Sebring that was moderately reliable with the exception of significantly ignition coil and repeated oil leaks issues. Back to the Optima, after one week of ownership, my car kept dying and come to find out it had a dead battery cell and I had to replace it, alongside with my proximity key fobs that were dead after purchasing my vehicle. Several months later, my fog lamps have stopped working and I think it has something to do with the wires and now I need a coil spring to enhance my cruise control and steering wheel features to become accessible again. Most importantly, last December Kia had to replace a coupling part to stop my vehicle from clicking at every left and right turn. With that said, the value and luxury and performance of my car have been great. I love the panoramic moonroofs on hot summer days, and speaking of hot summer days, the climate control seats work wonders not to mention the rear heated seats for the winter months, along with the heated steering wheel.

I did have to replace a headlight, a $100+ job due to the way the way the bulbs are accessed. The car remains trouble-free and other than routine maintenance, car washes and the new tires mentioned below, I have invested no $$ in it. It's the go-to car in the family for road trips due to great gas mileage & comfort. I have kept the Sirius/XM subscription which we enjoy on long drives. (Previous review at 61,000 miles)  I have a 3-day a week, 120-mile round trip commute. Gas mileage and good handling in snowy IL winters were important to me when I made a decision to purchase this car new in 2012. In all but the coldest conditions, I average 32-35 mpg on my highway drives; 25+ if driving around town. Like others, I love the heated steering wheel and seats, cooled seats in summer and the sunroof. Like others, when I have to take a turn in the passenger seat, I find it annoyingly low. Replaced tires at about 50,000 miles. Had the fuel pump go out (under warranty) at about 27,000 miles. Other than that, no repairs; just routine maintenance and regular oil changes (using synthetic oil - my choice; always use it!) I still love a lot of little things about this car - the keyless entry; the way the lights come on when I walk up to the car, the trunk space, the room for occasional passengers, the stylish looks. Handles just fine in the snow and still looks sharp as new on the outside. The tan leather is too light - shows dirt too easily; wish I would have gotten the darker interior.

I provided the warranty company with all my service, oil change and maint records. It's taking a while to get updates.  Future Kia buyers, ensure you do ample research and read owner reviews. I will never buy Kia again due to the fact that my model was very well maintained with Kia service dept and general car owner maintenance duties.

""Leather"" seats are starting to break down. Mileage has not changed or improved still averaging around 23mpg C-H driving.Tires that Kia is equipping the Optima with - horrible. Have the alignment checked (this is a known problem). This Optima has gone out 2 times.So in all not a horrible car, but cheaply made - we are glad it's a lease. We will be turning in and not looking back.UpdateWe traded this car out and got a few hundred toward a new lease of an Accord EX Coupe. The Kia is just not made to last. Due to the Optima being oversold in our area - we needed to go out of the area to make a deal. No dealer within our area even wanted the car. Last advice would be to Lear not buy.

While they might work for most owners, the light beige colored seats are a little too light for my liking.  I should have gotten the darker gray/black.  Passenger seat is built a little too low and does not adjust up/down.  Seat risers are available online.  2016 models now have up/down adjustment.   Road noise is noticeable; could use more insulation.  Driver's leg room is good and seems to be getting worse on newer similar sized cars.  Heater/AC work great!  Sport shift feature is fun.  Music generally comes from a USB stick.  Voice command software/hardware is finicky.  Dash layout is good; controls very functional.  Although it's been decades since I've had a flat, I was uncomfortable with the no spare/compressed air can-sealer setup.  I purchased a new OEM spare tire kit online for $181.  The default no spare setup leaves a lot of wasted space in the spare wheel well.  Easy access to this space would have been a sensible thing to design.  The sensitive electronic steering takes some getting used to and requires more attention at highway speeds.Update 2 - I finally got in a short road trip in (220 miles) and got 35 MPG!  Wow!  And the electronic steering issue - that's now been fixed with a software update.  It's much better now.  And just one last comment - a rattle that was driving me nuts (and sounded like it was coming from behind the glove box) turned out to a pair of sunglasses in the overhead eyeglass holder.  The Nexen tires still leave something to be desired.Update 3 - Now September 2017 with 25K miles.  I have replaced the original Nexen tires with General Altimax RT43 tires.  The ride is much nicer.  Dry grip is greatly improved.  Waiting for some good rain and (down the road) snow to see how they work.  Based on a lot of research, I expect the Generals will do well.  It really pained me to replace the OEM tires so soon!  :-(  Engine has been replaced due to failing recall SC174.  Based on not too many miles, it appears the mileage may have improved a bit after the engine replacement.",4

Also, if you have the LX or EX model in a 2.4 Litre and you complain about getting under 20 MPG there is something specifically wrong with your driving style and habits.

In the beginning, I didn't notice how bad the gas mileage actually was, because I thought it was just getting acclimated with my driving. However, after a couple months, I could only muster between 23-25mpg city, and 27-29mpg highway. Also, the steering is rather lacking, it doesn't feel tight or grip the road as well as thought it would. The acceleration is weak, period. Also, the ""eco"" mode plays a large role in fuel economy, larger than I expected. Without the eco mode, the car handles well, more power, and a much better feel; just how I expected with about 20% worse fuel economy. ",2.875

I have spoken to two consumer service agents, both of whom were unresponsive to the point of being rude.

Our daughter turned 17 on May 14, about a month earlier my wife and I, along with our daughter bought her 1st car, a beautiful 2011 Kia Optima EX. We knew that it had high mileage and was beyond the Kia warranty. 2 weeks after we brought it home the engine blew a rod and there was a 3"" hole in the engine block, the repair solution was a new engine. We have exhausted all avenues for assistance from the Honda dealer we bought if from to NJ Consumer Lemon Law. The only option would have been an aftermarket extended warranty which we didn't have. Now the point of this post is to advise anyone interested, that Kia has a U.S. Consumer Affairs department that reviewed our case for over a month and would not lend assistance to replace the engine. They told me that they are advocates for the consumer and there to help. They were clear that this car was not covered with a warranty and if they offered any assistance it would be ""Good Will"". In the end they stuck to their warranty statement and would not offer any good will. I have owned may brands of cars and some I have driven for over 200K miles. I would tell anyone who may ask that they should not buy Kia, this is a company that wouldn't offer assistance for a 4 year old car. We had the car repaired locally in NJ by a Kia Service Dept. $5000.00 for a remanufactured engine.",1

It was stuck on perma child lock.* The air conditioner worked most of the time.   If it didn't work, that all glass sunroof was murder.* The sunroof worked...most of the time.* Most of the 'hey, check this noise out' was answered with 'they all make that noise'.   That noise, in this case, was the sound of it burning through oil between oil changes.   Had the recall check done, and I'm shocked that they didn't catch how much oil that pig was burning through.

I can still get 35 miles per gallon on the highway and I get around 22 in the city. Over 70 miles an hour the fuel economy drops but I expect that. I've had a few issues with this car common nothing mechanical, and it really only had to change the oil at schedule interval. I thought it a bit risky when I first bought this car, because it was a Kia, but have no regrets! In fact I've been looking at newer vehicles and I'm really not sure how I'm going to part with this vehicle. It has been outstanding and given me many years of enjoyable driving. I have the top-of-the-line SX, with the Technology & Premium Touring packages, and it's still as fun today as it was the day I bought it. My only complaint is the padding in the front seats . When driving long distances, I find myself wishing for a bit more padding, otherwise no issues. The heated and cooled seats are awesome and work great. The navigation is easy to use and with voice activation, it's nearly hands-free. The fact that it works when the vehicle is moving is even more of an enhancement.

Parts for this vehicle range from very cheap to outrageously expensive so I suggest trading before anything real goes wrong. Has been leaking or burning oil for some time. 1 quart every 2500 miles. The road noise will drive you mad on a long trip but the fuel milage has been great. Just a cheap reliable vehicle.UPDATE   Our vehicle failed the Kia engine test so kia replaced the engine and renewed our warranty.  Thru out the process the people at Kia went above and beyond to make it as little an inconvenience as possible.  We are nearing 130k miles. Tranny seems to slip a little now and again.

1691, on 10/02/16 00:32 AM (PDT),Kathryn McDuff ,2011 Kia Optima Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Engine blew out :(," Engine died mid-may 2016. I was driving down a 40 mph, relatively busy, street when I tried accelerating (after light turned green I was able to speed up to about 35, then let go of accelerator before attempting to accelerate again) and noticed my car wouldn't react/accelerate. Immediately panicked and pulled into a parking lot before I stopped up traffic. Battery was fine, but engine was not running. Turned car off and tried starting it back up.. no luck. None of my friends who came to help me out could get it started. Awful experience, needless to say. I go to college 1.5 hrs away from my family.. mom had to drive to come get me (after having to uber my way around town for a week) to go home to get a new car, because you need one to get around my city. Ended up leasing a new car with toyota, which was a big learning process for me. Now I'm having to pay this lease and car shop expenses. My parents got the optima for me in high school to last me throughout the my high school senior year, college, and so on.. until I obviously graduate and can afford whatever car I'd like to purchase on my own. I'm graduating this December 2016 and now I'm stuck with a 3 year lease with a car I was most willing to pay to drive for 3 years (this happened mid-May 2016). I ADORED my optima. I still boast about the car and how much I loved it. I was, still am, devastated about my optima that I had for 5 years. THE BEST THING ABOUT IT ALL... kia sends out letters to 2011 optima owners just a little over a month after I signed my lease saying they were extending warranties to WELL more than the mileage I even had on my car (62,000). My poor car was only auctioned off for $2000. Buying a new engine was beyond what we were willing to pay. Yet because kia sent this letter JUST after my optima died on me, I was left in the dust. Long story, sorry, Im still bitter lol. I don't think this will stop me from ever purchasing another kia in the future, because I really did love my optima and it fit my driving needs so perfectly. But I know, better than ever, especially after learning the ins and outs of leasing cars, how important it is to do insane amounts of research on the product. Just beware, don't purchase this model unless you are certain the engine has been or can be replaced before it's yours. No one wants to get stranded and screwed into spending money they shouldn't be having to spend..",2

In five years I have put only 17,800 miles on it.  In the future I will probably put about the same mileage on this car.  I am very satisfied with this car, I have had zero problems with it.  Now to my concerns.  Kia did not send me a letter of recall about the brake light switch.  Sloppy communications.  Kia did send me a letter recently stating this cars engine could fail due to bearing problems. In the letter Kia stated they will extend the warranty on the engine. Therefore I researched this problem and a great number of people have had very bad experiences when their engine blew up on the highway.  Then Kia gave them the run around about their maintenance records and did a lot of denying of claims.  That really affects me since I change my own oil and filters.  I am sure Kia is not going to believe a word I say concerning what I have done.  Warranty worthless in my case.  I have concluded I will have to keep this car and drive it until something happens.  Of course there is a possibility I will not have a problem.  I gave...MY...car 5 stars based on my experience.  Kia would not get even one star based on their performance.                  I want to do an update, of course I don't know how to start a new section So I will just put the update here:  About a month after I posted this review I needed to change my oil.  The seal around my oil pan was leaking fairly bad.  I went back to the siteto reread some of the posts.  It became clear, in a number of cases,  that the seal leaking preceded the blowing of the engine.  I traded my Kia in for a HondaHRV.  Does not have all the bells and whistles the Kia had, but...I am not worried about my engine blowing.",5

He drives it... I pay for things. At 156,000 miles the car runs great. Starts quickly regardless of temperature, A/C still blows cold and all power features still work including windows. The only thing I've had to do is put brakes on it and one motor mount. When a motor mount breaks, you'll definitely know it!!!  Sitting outside year round in the Midwest including snow and salt on the roads, the car has zero rust on it. Paint has chipped off around the door handles, but the clear coat remains. Could be because the car is washed weekly, but the car is surprisingly comfortable, particularly for something so old. The car features side impact airbags and that is rare in all but high end luxury cars of that vintage.  I suspect a lot of people carping about their Optima's bought them used and are the kinds of people who don't believe in maintenance.

Uneven wear between wheels, (3 mm and 0 mm left rear vs  7mm and 3 mm on right rear pads) shows excessive wear on the outside pads. Wear indicator is on the inside pad so damage to rotor can happen before indicator makes noise. The dragging brake explains the poor mileage and sluggish power.

Transmission is very smooth and the powertrain combination gives excellent performance on hills.  Ride is comfortable but the driver seat needs an extra inch or two of seat cushion to give better thigh support for longer trips.

Historically a V6 sedan man but the 4 cyl engine is more than adequate especially with the timing chain vs belt.  The miles that  I put on that the chain saves a $400 preventative maintenance every 2 years (60,000 K).   Suspension and ride is good and headlights at night as well.  Taller ground clearance 6.3 inches will help in the winter.  I have only 1200 miles on it so the MPG is low 27 the first tank and 29 the second.  After break in I expect 34-35.

Just got 33 MPG on its first long interstate trip while running in the low to mid 70s.  Car is comfortable and quiet.  Not a sports car, but, it is very competent with about 5 PSI extra in the tires.  Transmission and engine seem to be well matched and smooth.  On the interstate, even in full auto mode it does not down shift at every hill.  In the manumatic mode you can make it hold 5th even longer to increase mileage.

1889, on 08/05/18 09:22 AM (PDT),Christine David ,2014 Kia Optima Sedan SXL Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Loved this car until...," I bought my car “certified used” still smelt brand new, only had 13k miles on it. Looked to be in mint condition. Loved it! I only had it for a little over a year. I took GOOD car of my baby since this was the first car I was able to buy 100% on my own at the age of 32. This past May I just dropped my two kids off at school, just jumped on the highway to go to work. This particular day it was mild out in New England. It wasn’t quite roll down your windows mild, but open the slider for your panoramic sun roof let the sun shine come in kinda mild day. So I did. Wasn’t going highway speed yet, considering I was still on the one lane highway I was approximately driving 50 mph following a good distance behind another car, had two cars behind me. I was looking down at my car radio because my iPod suddenly stopped (my car sometimes did that) radio dock was recalled but passed the timeframe (cause I just bought my car to have it replaced under factory warranty so I had to bite the bullet there, and make due) oh well, I digress. — So I was driving looking down at my radio (good thing too) because just as I passed a transport truck coming from the opposite direction from me I hear this LOUD explosion. I was like OMG that truck must’ve blown a tire or something. Then the realization that pieces of glass was falling down all over me, and inside my car hit. I immediately looked in my rear view mirror to see if it was okay for me to pull over, and I did. I was shaking, I glanced quickly up seen a huge hole in my sun roof above my head. I then recalled reading about sun roofs spontaneously exploding. I was like just my luck it happened to me two weeks later after reading that. I drive to the closest exit still having glass falling in on me. I had to get off the corner of this highway. I call my husband with the call button on the steering wheel afraid to move because I don’t know what size chunk of glass just slid down my back. I didn’t want it to puncture me. I say with a quivering voice “I’m on exit 18 at the park, and ride get her as fast as you can the sun roof just exploded on me I’m covered in glass”. He left our showroom locked the doors didn’t turn off the lights, and got to me in under 15 minutes which should’ve been a 25 minute drive. I got out of my car, and was completely covered in glass, glass splinters, and shards. My car was covered in the same. The glass looked like the explosion happened from the inside out the way the glass was bumped out. I called AAA they drove it over an hour away to the closest Kia. Long story short... I didn’t get my car back for a whole month. First Kia tried to blame me, said I did it. Or a rock hit it or someone tossed something at my car. They had people investigate the highway looking for bumps, or road construction (there wasn’t any) they FINALLY said we’ll fix it for free but we can’t say we’re responsible or liable for the damages. Because then they could be sued. I had to pay out of pocket $50/day for a rental (which they have yet to reimburse me for like they said they would) . They removed the glass put in the new one only to find out there was now issues with the track. Had to wait for word if they’d replace those. They did, oh by the way I also needed a new car battery which I had to pay for. I repeatedly asked them to keep me updated which they didn’t. I repeatedly had to call them. I asked them to kindly vaccume the inside of the car to rid it of the small glass. They told me they would. I go to pick up my car, and find the glass still inside. I freaked out on the guy. It now just turned August, and I’m still waiting to be reimbursed. We called a few times, and left messages only to go unanswered. I’m considering contacting a lawyer now. I’m petrified to drive in my car now especially around trucks. Also, inside my car there was scratches, grease stains on the inside and outside of my car, and it smells like feet now. Kia needs to take care of their customers, and they clearly don’t. I don’t recommend them whatsoever. Looking to trade in my car now.",2

The car so far has been a pleasure to own - spacious trunk, soft ride, comfy seats, quiet interior. However, there are some downsides. First of all, the mileage on the turbo is terrible. I drive mostly in the city, and I get 15mpg on average in normal mode. Tried putting it in Eco, but the car becomes completely unresponsive and dangerous. Second, the moonroof takes a lot of space: I'm 5'10 and I repeatedly hit my head on the roof when going over bumps. Finally, Pandora integration is terrible compared to Mazda and Accord. Overall, it's a decent car for the money, but I wish I've gotten Optima Hybrid or new Sonata Eco instead.",5

Was not looking to buy a mid size sedan but loved it as soon as I took the first test drive. Steering could be a little stiffer and provide a bit of feedback, and the front passenger seat is way to low without the power upgrade. Have a couple of friends who don't like not being able to see over the dashboard when riding with me. Mileage could be better, but for a mid size car with a trunk I could sleep in its not bad at all.

I went with an LX model but opted to get the convenience package for the back up camera. With any car though here will be issues and the 2014 Optima has a big steering issue. Everyone I talk with agrees that they don't have control of their car at high speeds and that the slightest correction to the steering grows the car too fast and far to the other side of the lane. I'm also not a huge fan of the grey and beige options as well as the gas mileage.,4.375

I try to hurry up and get to where I need to go so I want have to drive the car long.  The only plus is the safety/warrenty and the radio is good other then that I wish I never got this car. ,3.875

I have 8500 miles on it and everything still seems like new! I wish Kia and Hyundai would replace the 2.7 V6, its underpowered (190 hp) and bad on gas for the power (20 city and 26 highway)! They should replace it with a 3.2 V6, more power for same fuel economy! The I-4 is enough its not that sporty but its Kia what do u suspect? I get 32mpg on the highway and 25 in the city, great milege. Kia did a great job with the design! Very modern. It was between the 09 Fusion, 09 G6, or the Optima, Optima won! Its a good deal go out and I strongly suggest you put this on your list.",4.75

Researched for months to narrow my search; thought I'd opt for a Honda Fit or a Scion XB as I wanted utility, cargo room and decent mileage. But when I realized this was the only car under $20k with standard stability control, traction control and disc brakes on all wheels I was sold. The 10 year warranty and $2k rebate were icing on the cake. Amazing what comes standard on this 'base' model! Almost bought the smaller Elantra but figured the Optima's extra HP and larger engine with only a 1 to 2 mpg penalty was well worth the minor price difference. Excellent gearing + short throw 5 speed = FUN RIDE!!!",5

I hit a home run, when I purchased my Kia Optima. This vehicle is much better than the Accord or Camery. I have owned both other vehicles and there is no comparison. The warranty and safety is 3 times better. I only paid $13,9000 (new) and I jump on the deal.  This has got to be the best deal I have ever made on a vehicle.

The price, style and performance are great. First look at this car and you would say that's a car that is in the 30k range. My optima was in the low 20's and with the rebates and the fact that I was a current Kia owner that made the rebates even greater. I would say Kia is my car of chose hands down.

I just smile when I pull up beside a accord or Camry and think to myself I saved thousands and have an equal car. The optima feels smooth and plenty of power from the I-4 it only has a few less horse power than the v-6, save a few bucks and buy the I-4.

I eventually switched to regular and get 34 mpg.  The Rio's cost 2 grand less and get 37 mpg.  Bigger car, more options, excellent gas mileage.

I was looking to replace my wife's car and the Optima was the clear winner. We looked at Camry, Malibu, Elantra & Accord and the Optima was the winner based on features, styling and price. The $5000 mark down we got really helped. The Metallic Bronze is a head turner in the sun and we like the interior and exterior styling. We also have a Borrego and Kia has done their homework; clean conservative styling and nice standard features. Great basic features, great styling, very roomy cabin and a great value.

I stopped, took a test drive, and was completely AMAZED! Kia made the redesigned Optima look like a real competitor, and my car turns heads! I am shocked at the power from the small V6, better gas mileage than my Honda, better warranty, and it was surprisingly inexpensive for the features. I can't wait till the dealership installs my OEM navigation system! For being a Kia hater, I now wouldn't drive anything else. Kia's slogan definitely true!",5

Some factory warranty problems and did not like getting only one FOB key. Yet that's more of a dealer issue. I drove the car 18000 miles and overall it was satisfying experience. Number one feature is the good looks and the scarcity of this SXL model. Coming from a Mercedes my son and all my friends thought i was insane to trade for a Kia. Consumer reports review was very helpful. The Turbo 2.0 was very quick as well as good on gas. The interior was well appointed including red leather seats. Enjoyed a full sunroof, large trunk and an excellent sound system. The safety features were incredible which were found on only more expensive models. The blind spot sensor saved me from potential accidents. The best safety feature was the cross rear cross traffic alert. The back up camera chimed when a car was approaching from 100 feet each way!  Based on the fact that I paid $26,000 for one old car with 11,000 miles on it it was worth fixing the few minor items that were not covered by warning. Especially since i got it with virtually no money down! This rates as a great buy in a used car!",4

I bought this car after extensive research, because of it's beauty, driver mode control and shifting capability.  It's not often discussed, but the Optima has 3 modes which the driver controls with the push of a button.  Economy, normal and sport mode.  This is extremely important to me because the car suits the mood I'm in at the moment and responds in kind.  For example, if I need the power, sport mode gives an immediate throttle response with high RPM's; I can suck all the horsepower it can give.  If I'm mellow and want a smooth ride while saving on gas, I switch to ""eco"" mode.  There are a lot of positive comments I have about this car, but know this: it's a big and fairly heavy car, so don't expect it to handle like a BMW.",5

The seats are hard and long trips are very uncomfortable.  When it snows the ice stays on the windshield no matter how I adjust the defrosters. It has no compass as my other autos have had. The trunk is large but the trunk lid is small and larger item won't fit.

While driving in the Standard or Eco mode can be rather dull, I ONLY drive in SPORT mode. I like the way it shifts, both up and down, as I've always used the auto/manual mode for downshifting. It has proven to be responsive and reliable after 16 months and 2 road trips of 3, 000+ miles. I had no problem exceeding 100 mph over the mountains of Tennessee and the hills of Kentucky and Ohio. The 1.6T is very adequate and surprised me with no less than 34 mpg on both trips. The Tech Package (now its the Convenience Pkg) was an excellent choice. The cabin was very quiet at high speeds, thanks to the thicker windows. The seat positions were also very comfy on long drives, thanks in part to the 12-way power seat. The added lumbar function allowed me to manipulate it to mimic a ""shiatsu"" massage. If you enjoy a SPORTY RIDE without lots of frills, this car deserves a test drive. If SPORTY doesn't appeal to you, opt for the 2.4 paired with the 6-speed trans, a wonderful alternative, though not as exciting.",5
1964, on 09/25/17 13:18 PM (PDT),Lucy Oldham ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Unbelievably frustrated," I purchased a 2016 KIA Optima EX. Initially, I was very pleased with the car but the mechanical issues have changed my opinion. The car proved unreliable as the engine stalled multiple times and at times would not accelerate. The car's operation was dangerous having stalled while doing 70 mph on the interstate! I took the car in for service on 4  occasions, each time assured that ""the problem is taken care of"". The last time it stalled, I had it towed to the dealership and told them I thought the car was a lemon, I was scared to drive it and I wanted to trade it. So, I did for a 2017 Optima EX. It now has 22,000 miles on it and the same thing has started with the new vehicle!!!!!!!!!!!!! I called the same dealership today and spoke to the service department and was told once again ""we  have never heard anything like this"".

The list goes on. I'm amazed every single time I need power...to find the car already there. I say all this to let you know I have no affiliation with Kia nor does my family, but I'm so glad we bought it. Did I mention that the car likes to cruze like a rocket? Around town can be a challenge...this is a fairly large road car for up to five adults (or a family of five)...plain and simple. I use the capability of manual shifting in town with the ECO selection for drive. This proves to be an excellent way to manage the 30 to 55 mph areas perfectly. I have noticed that starting off from a cold start, the tranny will do a hard shift (no matter if you are in sport, ECO, or normal) from 1st to second. To accommodate this oddity and until the car warms up...I just use the manual shifter. In a few miles this hard jump goes away. This is most likely a sensor issue...but, since the 100,000 mile powertrain warranty is intact...I have little concern. New or used, this model is designed to go!",5

I absolutely love it... has so many features and I just love love love the way it drives and handles... amazing! The turbo lag can be a little inconsistent when you aren't used to the car, but now that I know how it responds and when, it's great. If you told me a few years back that I would be buying a Kia, you would be making a mistake. However, I loved the new design of the SXL and how sharp it looked so I went for a few test drives and little did I know, I didn't want any other car. Believe it or not, I have had so many friends who laughed at me at first, ask me if they can drive it, and have nothing bad to say when they get done.

1969, on 07/30/17 14:35 PM (PDT),Al D ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Rented one for a week," I rented one for a week. I've got long legs. The console has a sharp edge that rubs against my right shin. The ride and handling are fairly good, but the engine and 6AT are not a good match. Smooth acceleration not easy, especially in sport mode. In regular and eco modes, the tranny is reluctant to downshift, so you have to force it a little and that makes the car lurch a bit. The tendency to want to hang around 1300 RPM when you want it to downshift makes the engine a little buzzy and noisy in that range. The brakes are a bit touchy for me, but work well. I was glad to get back to my Camry SE after a week in it. The Camry 4-banger is quieter and torquier in the lower RPM. The Camry drivetrain is smoother and easier to work for mild asseleration increases. Also, the center console is better designed for long legs.",3
1970, on 06/05/17 07:02 AM (PDT),Amber Abshire ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Kia Heaven!," I had honestly never considered a Kia before. I had a Scion XB for 8 years that I loved but was hoping to find a more ""grown up"" car. I started asking people I knew who had purchased new Kias what they thought and 100% said they'd buy a Kia again when they looked for a new car. I thought I'd just get an LX because I could buy it outright, until I drove the EX. It was so comfortable and beautiful and had literally more interior features than I had on the Lexus LS I had years ago. The sunroof is amazing, all of the dash instruments are easy to use and in logical places and easy to get to. My last car it was impossible to have a window open or cracked on the freeway without it making this horrible wobbling wind sound, this doesn't do that. I adore the heated seats and Sterling wheel and the tushy cooler is AWESOME. I also love that it knows I'm close and opens the mirrors and unlocks when I touch the handle. I have only one complaint so far after having this 7 months, if it's been raining and I open the trunk, the way it's designed allows the water to run off into the trunk when I open it which I find odd. For the price and warranty I honestly can't imagine a better car, my sister bought something the same year and paid way more and it has less features!",5

Performance is good in Sport mode and mileage averaging 29+ in suburban, country driving. Opted for the lane departure, cross traffic,etc. safety feature and am glad I did. If the Kia is as reliable and trouble free as the Sonata was(only 2 trips to the dealer in 10 yrs., did all service myself) I will be extremely happy. So far a really great car for my needs. Wife loves it also and that's a plus!! Spent several months test driving the various cars in this class and lots of research and the Kia Ex was the best of the bunch by a wide margin.

1972, on 02/03/17 23:37 PM (PST),JWalt ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan SXL Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),OVER 700 MILES DURING FIRST WEEK OF OWNERSHIP," One week may seen too early for a review, but I've driven my Optima SXL over 700 miles the first week (that's average for me) and think I have a good sense of the car.  If you don't like long reviews, know I REALLY like this vehicle and find new reasons why I like (bordering on love) this vehicle!  I can't, and won't try going over all the systems and surprises I've found (too many).  So, I'm 6'3, and 235 lbs.  Previously I owned a VW Passat TDI SE w/sunroof and Nav (part of the VW buy back program).  I purchased that vehicle because it had ample legroom for me (including my left leg extended) and it had excellent mpg (avg 40 mpg with an approx elevation change of 3k ft through mountains).  On the downside, it didn't offer much for amenities.  I wanted a vehicle that would make my 75 minute each way commute comfortable, and fun.  Gas milage was important, but I was willing to lower my expectations there for the right mixture of features, comfort, cost, and reliability.  I looked at a ton of vehicles before going with the Avalon (Avalon Limited, Avalon Hybrid, Lincoln, Fusion, Camry, Accord - all higher trim models).  The Lincoln/Fusion (basically same vehicle), Camry and Accord didn't have the legroom I needed.  The Avalon had the legroom, but the tilt steering didn't have much range and it felt like it was in my lap (though I was willing to ignore that before I found the Optima).  The Camry had a ""bland"" feel inside, and the Accord just seemed too childlike for me.  The only Avalon that had the features I wanted was the Limited (most of the features).  Good price, but I really didn't want to go over 30-32k for my vehicle.  I looked at the Optima due to its reviews.  Honestly, I wasn't expecting I'd like the Optima.  I just wanted to check all my options before I purchased the Avalon.  My wife thought I was playing when we pulled into the Kia dealership; ""KIA?!?!  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?!?!""  Yea, I kind of felt the same way going in to the dealership.  Everything I knew about Kia did not inspire images of well made vehicles.  Well, I was wrong.  Reviews and research support the 2016 is an excellent vehicle.  I walked up to the white SXL vehicle, with chrome rims and opened the door to the white nappa leather and thought, ""WOW!""  Pictures don't do this vehicle justice.  The interior looks great, and everything feels great.  I saw a review stating the seats feel less comfortable on long trips.  Well, I spend almost 3 hours a day in those seats and they're very comfortable.  The audio system sounds great also.  And, it operates equally well.  I do wish there was a knob of sorts near the gear shift to navigate the system; The screen is a little reach with the seat pushed back.  A minor, but ""cool"" thing:  the LED interior lights look great at night against the white leather.  Bottom line - the vehicle looks GREAT and, it has everything I could think of as an option.  How does the SXL drive?  As good as it looks.  Smooth, quiet ride with excellent get up and go when I need it.  I'm averaging 29 mpg overall.  Not great coming from 40 mpg, but I think I can get that to 30-31 mpg.  I did look at the Optimus Hybrid, but it didn't have all the features of the SXL.  Also, it just didn't look as good as the SXL.  Steering in the SXL is also excellent.  I have noticed when taking curves through the mountains, the steering doesn't inspire control.  I felt..., disconnected from the road.  But, I also noticed switching to sport mode in those situations elevates the problem.  The only thing I'm having difficulty adjusting to with the Optima is the name plate:  Kia.  But, that's fast becoming a non-issue!  I purchased my SXL for $29,500 (USAA TrueCar) price the dealer honored.  I'm beyond happy with this purchase.",5

1974, on 01/09/17 15:08 PM (PST),MG ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan SX Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),"Lots of fuss, not so much muss"," I'm a demanding customer and I had Toyota's before, which I found to be excellently built and functioning cars, but their sedans are too fluffy for me now (too much body lean, cornering and grip not good) so I decided to try a different brand, but I need an all around sedan type vehicle without a 40 grand price tag. Still, my SX Turbo with tech package cost 32 thousand! My main gripe is with the steering. It's so numb and stiff, that I often find myself parking incorrectly so at slow speed you just have no feeling whatsoever. Then, despite expensive Michelin tires, you feel like the suspension is making the tires roll off the bottom of the tire. After an incident I can report that the automatic emergency breaking works very well with th sensors and tires to avoid  accidents by allowing you to steer very well as you skid, even on wet surfaces.  The turbo engine is very quick, especially in highway passing and  at above-legal speeds (watch out for tickets), but there is a problem in terms of steering and road feel as well as little visibility so you don't feel confident in quick maneuvers through traffic when it's crowded, so you have just stay in the left lane and use just brute speed to efficiently go from place to place in those conditions whereas a car with more road feel and visibility like the Honda Accord might allow maneuvering safely between cars . Also the turbo engine is somewhat inconsistent in terms of when the turbo kicks in (not sure if its lag or some other issue)  and can make it difficult to accelerate smoothly. Finally, you notice details that are poorly tested, like one touch windows that are very difficult not to activate, or a defogger that takes more than 15 minutes to do the job, or automatic locking keyless entry that you can't figure out how to unlock the other doors once you have unlocked the front one, like one click gas cap that has a weird feel, like cheap carpeting on the rear shelf when you have leather seats etc, like a dry leather on the steering wheel, like paint that chips with the tiniest stone, like a navigation system that can't find the local bus station, like voice recognition that doesn't recognize. Generally the materials of the interior and exterior seem brittle, easy to break/ scratch  and poor quality...Look, It's a beautiful looking car for sure (in this version) , and most everybody agrees it is,  but I'm not sure that I can deal with the lack of quality in design that makes a car REALLY work well or that I can deal with the numb steering... if you're a demanding, detail oriented customer who likes quality above all else (and I don't mean name brand, but years of flawless service), look elsewhere.",3
1975, on 01/07/17 11:54 AM (PST),Dean ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan SXL Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),if only....," I took this car for an extended [4 hour] test drive.  Disclosure: my wife and I are classical musicians.  I was very disappointed not to be able to buy this car because of a terrible sound system.  I liked the car very much.  Very comfortable seat, nice ride, good looking, engine a little loud but I could deal with it, lots of very nice technology, and a heated steering wheel [which I had to have].  I was a little worried about gas mileage - the reading on the dashboard was 19 - I asked the salesman about it and was told that the mileage was just for the last little trip, not overall.  Still I worried about that.  The Optima SXL is a very nice car.  I would have purchased it if I could put up with the terrible sound system.  The sound was more than a little raspy, harsh, edgy, distorted--both voices [normal talking] and instruments.  I think a lot of people wouldn't care, but it's important to me.  My wife didn't like the sound either but said she could live with it.  I couldn't.  It didn't have to be the best - just reasonably good.   Since I really wanted the car, I tried the sound system in two other Optimas - another SXL and the next lower trim level, and those cars sounded the same as the car I test drove.  Nice car, bad sound system.  Come on Kia, you have a nice product - it seems to me that it would be very easy to do better with the sound.",4

S ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Lyft Driver: Im on the road 24/7," So I traded in my baby a 14' Chevy Camaro for this 16' Optima EX ( New Horizon Blue color) 2.4 liter 4-cyl. I simply needed 4 doors to drive for Lyft Full time. So far I have had this car for about 3 weeks I purchased the car with 150 miles on it and now have around 2500 miles on it already :/ This was my first ""Brand new"" car. What I like about this car is the styling Im 28 years old and I dont feel like grandpa pulling up to an event or to someones house. I get daily compliments on the car from the ladies they love the sporty high-end look and the light colored leather interior feels like a benz/beamer on the inside. I spend alot of time in this car Gas mileage is ok I get right about what the car is rated to get. I was not getting as great gas mileage and power until I switched from 87 to 89 octane gas... I know every one says it doesn't make a difference well that may be true for you. I am a Car guy and I can definitely tell the difference, and trust me its not placebo. The 2.4 at first drive did seem a bit sluggish compared to the Accord and the Legacy the other 2 cars I was comparing. But throw it in sport mode but keep in in Drive dont use the sport shift/manual mode it really doesnt help actually makes the car slower from gears 1-3. The only time I felt a benefit was when I drove up Mount Lemmon in Arizona (steep hills/Winding roads) Thats when having control of my shifts really helped but other than that stick to Full Auto/ Drive. I picked the optima because of the obvious Warranty benefit. Also they have some really good service I called to set up my road side which I recommend you do when you buy the car to prepair incase of assistance you dont have to spend 30 mins giving your personal info as your stranded. My only hope or Con was that I wish Kia gave this optima some more hp and low end torque without having to drop 30+ grand to go with a SX-L. And also after driving lirterally all day the seats feel very uncomfortable. And im an average body type I am 5'11 Athletic and about 180 pounds.",5

We love our car which we have owned only one month, but on a recent trip through  mountains  both our ""Sirius"" and our ""radio frequency"" kept stopping as they could't pick up the satellite.   I love our CD's with the continuous music wherever the road leads,  so when I went to put in a CD and couldn't find a place for it I called the dealership and was informed they had discontinued the CD player.  Now all we get is choppy music.  I am very disappointed.  I wish the dealer would have mentioned it,  we probably would have not gotten a KIA.",4
1980, on 09/21/16 11:12 AM (PDT),Scott ,2016 Kia Optima Sedan SXL Turbo 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),"After 1 day, nearly perfect"," I purchased my Optima SXL last night.  I feel like I stole it.  With the $2500 rebate, I paid under 29k for the car.  Yes, you read that correctly, UNDER $29k.  Thanks to a GM who honored a price shown on his website that the salesman claimed was a mistake.. But after I contacted the GM telling him that the salesman told me the online price from another dealer is always a lie, then when their price was $10 less, I called them out on it.. and so they basically had to eat their own words, or practice a bait and switch on pricing as they accused another dealer of doing.  That turned out to be my gain!  The tech on this car is incredible.  I ding the car a little because for some reason there is no Homelink garage opener in this car.  I will have to decide if I want to keep a transmitter in the car, or opt to pay for dealer installed option review mirror with Homelink.  There is a little bit of turbo lag, but other than that, the car is very quick.  Steering is a little softer than I am used to, as I am coming from and Acura.  Acura's typically have very tight steering.  All of the feature on this car are awesome.. Huge sunroof, heated steering wheel, ventilated seats, and all of the accident mitigation built in is awesome.  This car feels very high end and very expensive.  I am surprised this is a KIA.  I didn't think I would EVER own one, but here I am.  Even the 10-spoke chrome wheels look almost identical to that on the Jaguar XJ.   The attention to detail is great.   Little bits of chrome in all of the right places..  illuminated outside door handles when you approach, and red painted calipers.   I am still shocked that I bought a KIA and even more so to say after 1 day, that I LOVE my KIA.  I'll do another review after I have had the car for a few weeks.",5

In three thousand the dealership pointed out that the front tires will require replacement; the softer rubber of the Michelins wear faster than normal and Kia will no longer use these tires.

However after doing several weeks of research into mid size sedans the Optima kept near the top. I went and test drove Accords, Mazda 6, Audi A4, Fusion, Sonata, and Acura TLX. I own a 2010 Acura TSX commuter car that I like but is getting old. I found that each of these brands has some comfort or convenience issue I couldn't live with. The Kia Optima had the best balance of price, performance, convenience and great technology. Fit and finish are spot on for this class, no problems at all. Every car I have ever purchased I seem to always have to compromise and just get used to. The Optima is enjoyable right from the start and I always look forward to driving it. Sometimes hate to stop! Very glad I expanded my horizons while shopping.July 2018- still rides nice and a joy to drive. Getting 28.7 mpg avg  50% highway, 50% city .

I would lose all lights, steering, brakes, and air bags for the vehicle.  Kia was no help in finding the problem with my vehicle and I totaled the car in July 2005.  The only good thing that saved my life was the seat belt installed in the car.  There was a burning smell that came from the car and the dealership had a hard time duplicating the problem.  They changed many items on my car but they were not sure they had fixed the problem and in some cases were scared to drive the vehicle themselves.

After 8 yrs, I had a phone book thick folder of invoices.  True, while the bumper to bumper warranty was in place, most things were covered.  Afterwards, this quickly became an expensive car so we got rid of it.Sorry, Kia simply is not up there with the Japanese yet.The V6 is quiet but relatively gutless and at 2.7L and 185 hp a waste of gas and money.

I had to replace an intake manifold sensor a couple months ago, but that wasn't too expensive.  This car has had problems with the transmission in its history.  The torque converter had to be replaced.  On a positive note, I have all the original suspension at 148,000k.  Wisconsin winters (read: salty/slushy crap) are rough on the undersides of cars, but it is doing really good.

Only car I've ever had that got poorer mileage on the freeway than around town-dealer can't explain this phenomena. Oh, great ad campaign, Kia, all image and no substance.

Biggest mistake we could've made.  Less than two months after purchasing it, we had to have the compressor for the AC replaced and that was just the first in a line of major issues we had over the 3 years we had this piece of junk. The crank shaft pulley broke, which in turn caused the timing belt to have to be replaced, too. Then, we started having to replace at least one low-beam headlight every month because they kept blowing. The final straw was that the passenger door started having some kind of issue where it wouldn't unlock and stay unlocked - you unlock, pull handle, then it re-locks itself.

It's been a very enjoyable car. Although it's a midsize family sedan, it's fun to drive with its mildly sporty character. The 4cyl. has plenty of pep and returns good mileage for a car this size. Fuel economy has ranged from 27-34mpg. That's with about 80% hwy driving. The 5-spd manual is not all that great in terms of feel, but makes the car more fun to drive. The suspension is firm, yet rides smoothly. On bumps and rough roads however, it feels too harsh. Steering feel is fairly tight and responsive, but could be better at lower speeds. Brakes feel great.

This car gave the most bang for the buck of everything I had driven. The engine is very responsive and the ride is very smooth. This seems to be the perfect vehicle for anyone who does not maintain the vehicle as needed. Whenever I have done simple maintenance, it reacts adversely. I constantly drive the same Highway to work and back and after cleaning the fuel injectors my gas mileage dropped from an average of 32 to 26 without any change in driving pattern.

All aspects of vehicle meet my expectations.  I had a Nissan Pathfinder for 7+ years, so the size change is significant.  Operating costs should go down with this.

Three months have passed and I like my Optima a lot. It has a smooth ride and handles well on any road surface and around corners. Very stable drive.

Now with leather I love the Optima.  It's quick, and even gives the option of manumatic shifting, which can be fun.  It's a nice quiet drive as well.

The fit and finish is first class. It doesn't feel like a 'cheap' car. It is the real deal.  I don't know how they pack that much value into such a (relatively) low sticker price.

The way I wanted the car equipped (the new 4 cylinder and not the V6), Hyundai did not make a Limited with just the 4.  In addition, I felt two things about the new Sonata, were below par.  The first being the side mirrors.  They are fixed, and cannot be folded back.  The second is the display for the automatic air-conditioning system is much too small.

I love the car. It's the perfect size easy in an out. Lots of trunk space. It drives like a luxury car. Every one that has seen my car really thinks it's a Jaguar. My Friend from choir rehearsal saw my drive up an when I got out the car the first thing she said to me was, Girl what's that you rolling in. She said is that a Mercedes or a Jag.  I start smiling I never said yes or no. I kept her in suspense. Until people see the back of my car that's what they think I'm Rolling in a Jag. or Mercedes. Then when they find out it's a Kia, they still don't believe it. I would Definately Recommend This Car. It's elagant stylish, you will get a lot of compliments. Keep the maintenance up to date. You got yourself a great car. Trust Me.",5

I bought it with 50K miles on it and now has 125K.  The car has every option available at the time, sunroof, all power, a great stereo, leather seats, etc.  It runs very well and acceleration is very good for a car this size and weight (almost 5,000 lbs).  You will feel secure when driving this vehicle.  Its seats are extremely comfortable, front and rear.  5 adults can travel in it, very comfortable.  I carry stuff all the time, I really appreciate its huge cargo trunk.  Fuel economy is poor, around 14 mpg in the city, but much better on the highway, around 22.   I have had to change batteries in my car every year, I still do not know why.  The outside chrome trim peeled off a few months ago and the air bag light is always on, apparently this is a problem in these cars.   Regular maintenance such as oil changes, filter changes, brakes, tires like any other car at regular intervals.  I did have to change its mass flow sensor and front cv axle joints and engine mounts, those were a bit expensive.",4

It has been a wonderful car. Regular maintenance has kept it running perfectly. Taking it to the shop 5/2/16 to replace an engine mount - cheaper than a new car! I wish KIA was still making this car! Been looking for used Amanti with low mileage to run for another 10 years. *Since my last review, I did purchase a used Amanti with only 35,000 on it. GREAT! Such luxury! Just drove down I-95 from PA to Palm Beach - floated on the interstate! I needed to take the used KIA in for PA yearly state inspection, Went to my KIA dealership and got a loaner - A 2016 Optima - It is ""junk"" compared to the Amanti, What was KIA thinking by getting rid of the Amanti - They replaced it with the Cadenza, but it is way over priced and feels like the cheaper Optima. So, I have two, 2004 KIA Amanti's - 1 is GOLD and 1 is SILVER in my garage! They are simply wonderful cars! My son has a 2013 KIA Forte - My daughter has a 2014 KIA Sportage - but everyone still loves my Amantis! Update: 11/30/16 - Just returned from Palm Beach FL - drove I-95 from PA - in my ""Silver"" '04 Amanti has 60,000 miles on it and drives like it is brand new. Still LOVE the drive, feel, luxury, & sound system. My ""Gold"" '04 Amanti is used for short trips to the grocery store and shopping - 225,000 miles and still drives great on country roads and the interstate! LOVE my Amantis'!Update: 10/31/17 - Still love my Amantis'! I need to the headlights cleaned up, but that is all! The miles are adding up on the SILVER Amanti, as we drive it on long trips. The GOLD Amanti is still running great! Regular oil changes keeps these cars going and going!",5

Can it wait til then - they said it could as long as I keep an eye on the oil level.I paid $5000.00 for the car and NADA shows its value a little over $6000.00 so with the repair it will meet value.",4.5

Car would periodically shut off while driving down the road, again, no dealer resolve.  After 30,000 miles the car had problems starting.  Very fragile, insecure handling.

Liked the body style, amenities and overall comfort. First problem was with brake rotors.  Second problem was with tires. Rapid wear and could not find anyone in my area to adjust because they could not get tires from the mfg.  Good gas mileage on hwy, have gotten over 30 mpg.  Traded Toyoto Camry that we didn't like.  Amanti is better than my Cadillac Fleetwood Bro.  Better mileage than Cadillac and about the same as Toyoto.  Wife really likes this one.  Will probably buy another.  ",4.875

Had to have the front grill replaced three times already for deformed molding and it needs to be replaced again. Front suspension rode like a skateboard until one service tech stuffed more rubber in there. Nothing major has broken, but it's those little things that add up.  Bumper to Bumper warrenty? NO, the salesman lied. Decent service, not a chance. Doubt I would ever purchase a Kia again because of their poor poor service.

Don't let other car dealers persuade you by bad mouthing it. If you are a smart shopper and can think for yourself then you will definitely see all the great attributes the Kia Amanti has. We have driven it 31,000 miles and no problems. Our last trip of 5300 miles we averaged 27.9 miles per gallon.

I love the body style of the car -- reminds me of a stylish European car. My biggest thought about ownership is the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty -- with this it will probably be the last car that I have to purchase in my lifetime.

We look forward to taking trips, it is that much pleasure driving it. I researched this car and compared it to many other luxury cars; also drove 7 cars and found we kept coming back to the KIA AMANTI. I love it. The auto magazines I monitor have rated the AMANTI as the quietest car made at idle; 40 Db and at 70 mph at 63 Db. No car beats it for quietness and those of you who own one can vouch for that.

The car was a lease vehicle and had been well maintained.  You can probably pick a used one up in the $16,000 range without the sunroof.

The leather was beautiful and there was plenty of room both in front and back. Accesss was easy. I couldn't believe the radio. It sounded better than any other auto radio I've ever heard.

However it does rival my previous '02 Lincoln Town Car.  I purchased this car because I was looking for a long term car to drive for many years. After researching Consumer Reports I found newer Kia/Hyundia models to be comparable, if not more reliable than domestic brands (still no threat to to Japan).

At the time, I thought no car could be better and gave it a 5 star review. Now, I have a Lexus LS 400 and that opinion has changed dramatically. The Kia Amanti is still a great car but you are wrong if you think you just got a very luxurious car that's as good as a Jag/Benz/Lexus/etc. The Amanti is a great VALUE luxury car that is very reliable, spacious, comfortable, fast/powerful, and smooth riding but compared to a bigger name luxury car like the ones that I just mentioned (particularly the LS 430 which it copied), it feels nowhere near as luxurious. The materials used on the interior are cheap and wear down easily, the handling and steering responsiveness is poor (the steering wheel literally feels numb, no exaggeration), and the side mirrors that never stay in place will drive you crazy. Repairs aren't cheap. Gas mileage and resale value aren't favorable.",3

The vehicle is equipped with switches that preset the seats and mirrors.  Unfortunately, the mirrors do not go back to what you preset.  That means that you have to constantly readjust the the mirrors.  I'm taking the vehicle to the dealer today, but it looks like other Kia Amanti owners have had problems with the mirrors and have just been given the run around by the dealers based on what I am reading on the internet.

The Infinity sound system can blow your ears off, and the wood trim is fantastic.  For a full sized sedan the gas mileage is great, and the 200 hp will really rock out o the gate.

It definitely has the European styling.  It is priced way below the aforementioned vehicles.  For the price and the warranty, you can't go wrong. I drove the Lincoln Town car, Cadillac DTS, and Mercury Crown Victoria before my purchase. Why spend the extra money! This car rates among these that I mentioned.

Unlike me, I walked up to a total stranger and asked him about the car.  He said he traded his Mercedes for this and he was more pleased with the Amanti.  My husband is six and a half feet tall and it is important that he has head-room and has enough legroom.  Of course, that generally cramps anyone in the seat behind him, but not in the Amanti.

The plus items for the Amanti would be: nice trunk, comfortable rear passenger sets, individual a/c settings, and the front passenger seat reclines.

After seeing an article online about the Amanti's redesign for 2007, test driving one was a relevation. I seriously shopped the Amanti vs. the Azera and a couple of other nice sedans, and the Amanti won. This car is an amazing value. I am continually being blown away by the quality and features. The quick power and smoothness of the ride are truly a delight. I'd say this car, for 2007, is the biggest hidden secret on the U.S. market, since Kia is not doing any advertising that I can see.

I took a long trip in this car and was never more pleased with a car.  Mine is midnight gray with every option except the cargo mat. The quality of materials and construction is far superior to what you would expect in a Kia and rivals cars at ANY price. The mileage has been slightly better than expected.

I wasn't looking for a sport sedan. I get almost as many stares in the Amanti as my red '70 chevelle. The torque and acceleration are greater than I could have expecteded. Only has 1500 miles so far but I love this car! The beautiful leather, fit and finish are awesome. Quietest, most comfortable car I've ever ridden in. An impressive car and so affordable.

So we took it for a spin and I loved it! We have owned Caddys,Vettes,Hondas, VWs, you name it. My last car was a Dodge Magnum Hemi.

I've been admiring the Amanti since it came out in 2004.The Amanti is every bit as luxurious as the Jaguar and the leather interior is actually nicer. The bouncy American luxury-car ride will take some getting used to after the finely tuned suspension on the Jag, but it's roomier, more comfortable and much more practical.

OK, I personally don't like the rear view mirrors tilting down when I put it in Reverse. But, my wife does, so to keep her happy, I can always move the mirrors up with the controls then hit the seat memory button when I go back to forward gears and they come back in place.

Steering is a little numb and throttle could be a little more linear.  Ride is comfortable but cheap tires are noisy and stiff.  Ride motions need to be better damped without being harsher.

The Kia Niro does that easily combining both electric only of about 27-30 miles before the hybrid has to kick in.  But there's more.  The Kia Niro has a crossover/small SUV look that is more appealing than a sedan/hatchback look. And more -The EX interior is stylish, roomy, with more than enough safety and electronic amenities. And more - great warranties including 5 year/60K  comprehensive and  10 year on the battery.  And - what made it all pencil out are the numerous rebates and/or credits from state of CA, the feds, PG&E and even the local Sonoma Clean Power - all in all reducing the car price by $10,000 and throwing in a free superfast home charging station and a free carpool sticker.",5

Ever since the Niro Hybrid arrived in 2017 I waited patiently for the 2018 Niro Plug In to arrive at local dealerships. The Niro Plug In is a perfect match for us. We live in a small rural city so the 26 mile electric range enables us to ride gas free locally 100 percent of the time. But when we take a longer drive like we did recently, we have the peace of mind knowing the Niro Plug In will switch to the gas engine and still get close to 50 mpg. Plugging in the car is really simple using a normal electric outlet in our garage most times taking on average between 6 to 7 hours which I do overnight. The Niro looks sharp like most SUVs these days and comes with all the comfort, safety and tech features that car owners expect with their new car purchase. The Niro PHEV also comes with Kia's industry leading 10 year/100,000 mile warranty including the plug in battery. The 2018 Niro Plug In is not as abundantly available as the Niro Hybrid on dealer lots so don't expect the discounts to be as deep, but many Plug In buyers like myself will benefit from the $4,543 tax credit when filing our federal income taxes for 2018. We have only driven a little more than 300 miles but so far the Niro has been flawless. We took it to Costco recently and filled three coolers and still had plenty of room for other purchases with the rear seats folded down. I'm really enjoying this new car and it's especially satisfying these days driving past the gas station in town.",5

Unfortunately, the ride- until the 2016 production- has always been stiff. We just put some new, better quality tires on it with hope that it would cushion the ride. Not so much. If you run over a quarter, you can almost tell what year it was minted. I would also recommend opting for a V6 if you ever want to pull into traffic before completing a prayer.

I was very excited with my purchase because I spent time reading online reviews of owners which overall were pretty much positive.  I bought the car in early 2015 and it was a 2013 model with 45,000 miles.  I drove the car for almost 3 years with no issues.  At about 70,000 miles the car starting to give me problems.  And by problems I mean major costly issues.  Within 8 months I had to have the AC Compressor replaced, engine oil pan replaced, rear back-up camera replaced, and then finally when the engine died I called it quits and traded in the car.  The reason for the engine failure was because the oil sensor failed and the car was sending oil into the engine.  The car did not drive any differently nor was there any alert on the dash board!  I just happened to take the car in for an oil change and the dealer said they couldn't return the car to me and explained what was wrong.  After about 3 days of fighting with the warranty company to cover the cost of replacing the engine I had my car towed to another dealership and traded it in.  I was disgusted that a warranty company would not cover what was clearly a glitch with the car.  They do not have to worry about me ever purchasing a Kia.",2

We've owned our 2013 Sorento for almost 2 years and 25,000 miles.  The 2013 Sorento LX 3.5 has greatly exceeded my expectations.  I own a 16' TrailLite camper (3,500 lbs loaded).  The Sorento EASILY pulls it at idle.  I was amazed how well the KIA pulled my camper with my 2 fishing kayaks on the roof-rack.  Granted Fuel economy drops while towing from 25mpg (@75mph) to about 11mpg (@70), but that was still better than expected.Acceleration is a little jumpy and takes some getting used to.  Breaks are great.  Handling is smooth and comfortable.Changing the oil was a learning experience; the filter is on the top of the engine, which was new to me; I searched for it for about 5 minutes before I gave in and Googled its location.  The filter is about 2x more expensive that typical filters.  It takes nearly 6 quarts of oil.Seating - Front is comfortable, but I wouldn't mind the seats being a little wider.  I'm 6'0, 220, 40"" waist.  The second row seating is fairly comfortable, and they recline!  The 3rd row is tight for me, but I could fit if I lost a bet.  Ideal size for 3rd row would be < 5'.In my opinion, none of the mid-size SUV competitors can compare to the Sorento when talking about towing capacity, economy, features and price.",5

She put 9,800 miles on the car so far with all the normalized services being up to date. This Saturday 10/27/2012, she drove from Miami to Naple, and this car died on I-75! Thank the Lord that neither she nor her friend got hurt! She had it towed to Fuccillo Kia dealership in Cape Coral, FL. This dealership did the initial evaluation that day, but could not diagnosed the reason why the car died! Thus, my 20 year old daughter had to leave the car in the Cape Coral Kia dealership, and no one at this dealership offered to help her getting a loaner/ rental car through Kia warranty coverage! My daughter had to ask her friend to drive from Miami (an hour and 45 minutes away) to pick her up and bring her back to Miami that evening!Of course, nothing was done on Sunday. On Monday, the Cape Coral Kia dealership had to ask that we should contact our Kia dealership in Clearwater to fax all the service records to them as all the Kia dealerships'service databases are separated with no connectivity or sharing capability among them. I called the National Kia Customer Service to ask for help as the Clerwater Kia dealership did not respond initially to our request. The toll-free National Kia Customer Service lady said that Kia National headquarter does not have any data on services at any of their dealerships, but she gave me a case # and her extension to call back or communication, which I thought initially as being very nice and helpful ( I even did a survey for her and gave her high marks!) I have to call the Clearwater Kia dealership's service manager to ask for help in faxing the service records to the Cape Coral Kia dealership to finally getting this done. After reviewing the well documented 3 services (on 08/11/11, 1/13/2012, and 06/11/2012), the Cape Coral Kia dealership agreed that we have had the car well-maintained by a Kia dealership during our short ownership, but th engine died fro unknown reason. The service manager there suggested that they will have to rebuilt the engine! We asked if this issue had been reported on other Kia Sorentos, and he replied that he does not or aware of any national recall nor issue with the Kia Sorento having premature engine failure. We asked that the engine should be replaced with a new engine from Kia factory in the Atlanta, Georgia plant in USA, rather from a rebuilt engine. The manager said that he will try to request for that. We requested that while the car being serviced under a Kia warranty-issue if my daughter could get a rental or loaner car for her to get to class at college. The dealership reported that they could do a rental car up to $30/day coverage only. However, since our daughter is 20 yo, she could not rent the car from any rental companies! The dealership insisted that they have no loaner car available for her to use! I called the Kia toll-free national customer service four times (twice on Monday 10/29/12 and twice on Tuesday 10/30/2012) using the previously given extension # to the service lady, Melinda. I was not able to get in touch with her either time, and upon calling back other customer service agents reviewed our case #, reporting that nothing was in our case report! So why created a case # and giving me an extension #!?At this time, we are waiting for Kia's decisions to replace the engine, and to consider helping our daughter a way to get back from Miami to Cape Coral!With this occurence of the failed engine on a new 2012 Kia Sorento with 9,800 miles after one year of ownership, I have to say that I am very disappointed in this car and with the above service issues from Kia National Customer Service Center!

Feel the transmission shift to make sure they are smooth. If you buy the car, don't drive it too hard. My transmission needed to be replaced after 5 years around 100,000 miles. After allowing the engine to warm up check for coolant leaks or faint amounts of steam coming out of the engine block. At 150,000 miles, mine has a leak that causes the cabin to smell like a sweet burning oil/coolant, but you may be able to get rid of the smell by recirculating the AC. As long as the coolant doesn't leak as a liquid onto the pavement it should be small enough to ignore. Feel the suspension, power steering and braking to insure that they feel normal for a car of this age. Spongy brakes are common if the brake fluid has not been flush. Lack of power steering may also be a result of poor maintenance. Make sure that  you have the fluids flushed out and replaced properly. If the engine light is on and the code is for a low range switch you should be able to get away without repairing it. that code has been on my car for 5 years no problems. Any major or minor repairs are done at the best price if you go to the dealership, even if the warrenty expired. Kia dealerships have the best repair prices. I got 14 mpg driving in the city on regular gas.",3

The mileage issue has nothing to do with engine size. The transmission is not geared properly which is why at 70 mph you tach out at 2800 rpm. Car needs a 5th gear.

Intake manifold issues caused car to resist acceleration, covered by warranty, however the result was burned out spark plugs which cost almost $300 to repair due to their location.

The rattling in the trunk, its the jack in the back, simply put a towl back there with it, the back seat trim is just to cover the hinges on the seat. They are not that important, and the airbag sensor in the passenger seat is working the way it should be, you just have to sit in the seat the correct way. Now to the car its self. It has been great 70k and no troubles at all. I do have to say though the transmission does shift hard sometimes but its not that big of a deal. Great power from the engine, it does suck up the gas though. Overal it is an excelent reliable car to have.",4.375
2441, on 03/07/11 08:36 AM (PST),garibaldibyrde ,2008 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 5A),It's not the car; it's the dealer/service," As much as I like my 08 Sorento LX, it's not the car, it's the dealer/service!The Sorento seems to be one with certain issues that plague most of the models. For example, so-so MPG,the passenger air bag sensor, brake rotors, hard shifting transmission (intermittent), rear differential failure and a front, testy transmission when in 4WD and recurring right side axle seal leak. These are problems which should be handled under warranty by any KIA dealer. Unfortunately, that is not the way the company does business. If you get lousy service at one dealer, you should be able to go to another dealer for service without problems. Not so with KIA. Let the buyer beware! Also if you miss any of the recommended services, they won't honor the warranty if any parts are adversely affected, even if the part just went bad on its own! KIA is extreme with their maintenance recommendations and timeliness of the services. Also be very careful when buying in the showroom. Every dealer is trained in HIGH PRESSURE sales/scare tactics. Don't allow them to pressure you into buying a car that you don't want. A ""similar"" vehicle is not the ""same"" vehicle that you want. Brush up on your haggling and bargaining skills and be prepared o walk out if you can't reach an agreement.",4.125

This was my first new car purchase and I am so disappointed.

I have driven it daily for over a year and have had NO problems of any kind. I spoke at length with a Kia mechanic and he told me the '08s and later were much better designed and were on par with Toyota quality--without the price tag. I have found that to be true.

I was never enthusiastic about owning an off-make like Kia; however, we inherited one w/90k miles and thought we'd give it a try. Bottom line is that this vehicle has the highest cost of ownership of any car I have owned. I spent more on it in the first six months than on my '99 Civic over the entire 15 years - which I sold when this lump of trash came along. Listing of issues: brakes, electronics, alignment, brakes again, engine gaskets, primary electric, climate control, interior finishes. Had to replace all brake calipers and resurface/grind rotors, which lasted about 5k miles before they warped again (despite following recommended wheel torques; I think the rotors are made from flimsy, untempered sheet metal...). The braking system causes vehicle to steer poorly, requiring more effort, when slowing to turn into a driveway, parking lot, or intersection.  Interior materials are cheap - the carpeting in cargo area split and zippers peeled away from rest of materials during routine cleaning/vacuuming. Both key fobs malfunctioned, running down the battery after cycling the door locks overnight. The radio is also a real treat. FM band picks up 5-10 stations in the area for about a mile before they fade out, while the AM band sounds like a Geiger counter in a fallout zone. Engine is designed such that oil remains against the gaskets in the upper end - which causes them to become brittle and shrink, which over time fills the interior with choking oily fumes. The plastic (non-repairable) inlet port on the radiator broke and required replacement. I have had to replace headlight bulbs twice (and no, I didn't touch the bulbs with bare hands). The engine coil packs began to blow - one after the other - over the course of a week, requiring replacement of the entire set, as well as associated components. The air conditioner compressor has begun to leak (the car is from Washington state so it wasn't used much) and has required specialized repair and sealing materials. This is just a partial list; however, I figure the cost in just materials over past year comes out to about $4 per mile - and that's not considering the abysmal fuel economy, which hovers between 15.5 and 17.5 - shocking b/c it's worse than an Escalade, Navigator, or Expedition.  SO - I cannot say that I am satisfied or impressed by the performance, reliability or overall value of my '03 Kia Sorento. I will NEVER own another Kia.",2

These cars love belts and timing belts THEY EAT THEM!!!!!!! this car gets the worst mpg. Its rattles a lot and it idles poorly. Also if you own a Sorento check your oil every 800 miles it eats it. when you put your foot to the floor it will stay in 4th gear at 5,000rpm stays at 88mph and when you go into semi-auto you can't up shift it is a 5 speed trans.",1
2479, on 12/18/14 21:17 PM (PST),raymoto ,2003 Kia Sorento SUV EX 4WD 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 4A),A workhorse not without a few issues," I bought my 2003 Kia Sorento EX 4x4 automatic brand new in 2003. I was the original owner and as of this posting (2017) had $130K. I've since sold the Sorento in favor of a Toyota 4Runner because the new Sorento is no longer a body-on-frame  truck platform.  The new Sorento is a unibody car platform. I wanted something more rugged and durable and the 4Runner is a true SUV. I took great care of the Sorento which is the main reason it lasted 130k miles. The engine, transmission, and suspension, steering have been solid as a rock. Even after 130k miles, all the rubber suspension bushings looked like new condition!  I've only had a few issues. The transfer case stopped shifting into 4x4 due to lack of use, but still operated in 4x2 mode. One engine sensor needed replacing, along with normal hoses, and the fuel temperature senor and thermostat which I replaced myself.  It also needed new shocks, which is normal for the age. (Get Bilstein shocks, they are the BEST shocks!).  Other than that it has been a workhorse, and reliable. The engine has considerable low end torque so it appears fast for 190 HP. It is spacious inside, with plenty of cargo room. With the proper wet traction tires the Sorento feels very safe and controlled in the rain. Without the 4x4 feature and proper snow tires it is terrible in snow and ice.  As a used vehicle the first generation Sorento is a great bargain. Just make sure the timing belt and  water pump have been replaced. The BIG Achilles heel for the Sorento is the Crank shaft pulley bolt. There is a recall due to it being weak. If it breaks or timing belt breaks, either can destroy the engine. There is a new, stronger crank shaft bolt replacement. If considering a Kia Sorento of this era, talk to Kia service to determine the cost to replace the timing belt, water pump, crank shaft pulley bolt, and drive belts if they have not already been replaced reciently. Talk to Kia about that crank shaft pulley bolt recall.  UPDATE: six months after I sold the Sorrento - After driving my 4Runner for a while I now realize how stiff and harsh the Sorrento suspension springs really were.  With the first generation Sorento you will feel every bump, every pothole, every imperfection in the road. However, the trade-off with a tight suspension is that you will gain precise, controlled steering. The Sorrento does not wander or weave and tracks straight on the road even in a torrential downpour. If you want safety and handling more than ride comfort then the first generation Sorento is for you. I must say though that the new Bilstein shocks that I installed enhanced the precise accurate steering but did not compromise ride quality. The very stout and stiff stock Sorento suspension springs are what causes the harsher ride.  In contrast my 4Runner lumbers down the road and somewhat bobs and weaves in high winds however the the trade-off here is ride quality is smooth and comfortable. So it's a trade-off with vehicles - Precise, tight handling with a harsher ride, or pillowy soft ride and mushy handling.  So, In conclusion, a well-cared-for, first-generation Kia Sorrento is a good vehicle choice.",3

There was a previous incident where the cruise control shut off on its own as well.  Kia's service center could not diagnose anything.  We have also experienced intermittent problems with the USB/Bluetooth features with the ApplePlay and our iPhones.  My husband has a 7s and I have a 5s (both acceptable for the current Appleplay compatibility according to Kia's website).  After ruling out the power cord as being the issue by trying different power cords and checking for Apple updates on our phones we took the car in and discovered that the basic warranty for 60k miles does not cover the radio (grr) The radio is only covered for 36k miles or 3 yr (wcf) and Kia also could not diagnose any problems for this and chalked it up to being a phone issue.  I have a mistrust for this car's computer as we discovered there were 2 computer recalls upon this visit (Lane Departure Warning System and Hydraulic Electronic Control). Lastly, if you buy this car used, kiss the 100k Powertrain warranty goodbye.  Subsequent owners only get up to 60k mi powertrain coverage. Disappointing as my car w/ GM transferred their original warranty to a new owner if the car still met the mileage/time applied to original owner.

It provides a very planted, quiet and smooth driving experience.   All the bells and whistles are appreciated including the warnings which are very helpful to aging drivers.   We researched this vehicle for over two months including Mazda CX-9 (handles great but less substantial and sub-par navi/entertainment), Honda CRV (smaller, intrusive lane keeping assist), Honda Pilot (top end 9 speed tranny has a bad rep and too high to enter/exit), Suburu Outback (entertainment system sub-par, noisier 4 cyl., 6 cyl harder to steer) and Highlander (runner-up, great vehicle but no Apple CarPlay and less luxury features).    The Sorento has great acceleration for an SUV (V6), handles reasonably well considering its size and gets good gas mileage (typically 24-28 highway, 19-22 around town).   We leave it in normal mode, seeing little/no difference with ECO mode in gas mileage.

Driving into Virginia we usually get around 38 miles to the gallon, WOW! The car handles quite well, looks great, has power to spare on tap and sips gas. This was a fantastic deal. Oh yeah the Ford comment. We had a Ford Expedition before the Toyota FJ. The engine started popping  spark plugs two months after we'd made the last payment. The Kia Sorento? Keeps running and running while we save gas money. When this lease is up we are getting another Kia Sorento. I'd like to say it again... are you listening Ford?",5

2558, on 07/31/17 12:39 PM (PDT),JAL ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Great SUV Except Mediocre Steering," Love the car except for one important issue - the new electric steering system. We had a 2016 Sorento SXL for only 5 mos. before that was totaled when a driver ran a stop sign. We replaced with 2017 Sorento SXL One of the key decisions on the 2016 KIA was the great steering system. Unfortunately, the steering in the 2017 vehicle is a bit disappointment. KIA changed the steering in the 2017 vehicle (upper level models) to an electric steering system. The new system lacks any ""road feel"". Furthermore, one is constantly making minor steering adjustments which is annoying at a minimum, but is dangerous if you look away for an quick look at something as the car immediately starts to wander. The dealer confirmed today that they are aware of the problem but there is no fix available to date. Hopefully there will be an updated software package in the future to correct the problem; however, until a fix is available. I have learned that using the ""Sports"" steering option provides a better steering feel and makes my evaluation acceptable.",4

It is simply an amazing car, rock solid in 22k miles.  I have owned Audi, Infiniti, multiple Porsches... And this car's refinement is as good or better, hard to believe.    We cross shopped the XC90, GL 450 and this has all the features we wanted at literally half the price!  We rented a loaded Volvo for a week and couldn't wait to give it back, so many minor annoyances.    Kia is tops with CR and JD Power, and the safety features are top shelf.   If you have a family, you simply have to test drive a Sorento.  Tons of safety features, powerful v6, super comfortable ride and whisper quiet cabin.  Much quieter than the XC90, 7db quieter than the Q7.  Put up the rear sunshades and your toddler will be out in no time !   I honestly don't know know they are making money at the prices these are selling for.     Lastly I will say this,  the Sorento and Cayenne sit side by side in our garage.  If one of us needs a car..... with or without kids, the Kia gets chosen 100pcnt of the time.  Porsches are incredible machines - that's the highest complement I can give the Kia. It is the closest thing to a perfect CUV you will find.",5

This was the second Highlander we've owned before trading. First of all the KIA has twice the warranty of the Highlander, This Kia is not a cheap car, in fact, I could have bought a comparable Highlander for about the same monies.

This vehicle is for my wife and it was difficult to find a 5 pass , turbo 4 that had all the "" needs "" on her list. The dealer made me an offer I couldn't turn down on this 7 pass , V-6 and we are extremely pleased. The most difficult thing about senior citizens like us when buying a car is learning all the new features especially the audio / navigation and electronics. We now have had the car for 7 mo and since the last review we took a 7500 mile driving tour in the western states. Our total mileage is 13,200. It has performed great. No problems and we are very happy with the vehicle. An pleasant surprise to me was the side rear view mirrors rotating down when you are in reverse. When backing up, many times it helps to see the ground to avoid curbs, grass  or other obstructions that might be low on the ground. The engine is so quiet, several times we have exited the car with the engine still running. Fortunately the car alarm alerted us the engine was running.",5
2567, on 03/21/17 12:31 PM (PDT),Jack Sorders ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV EX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Some likes and dislikes," Bought the 2017 EX with Tech and Touring packages two months ago.  Didn't get navigation, since Apple navigation Maps will show on display if Iphone plugged in.  (But Waze is not compatable).  I  like that I can use Bluetooth, so I can use Siri for calls, emails etc. without picking up the Iphone. Car verbal commands will play AM and FM stations, but will not recognize commands for XM stations -- instead it goes to FM station (strange). Good handling in twisting roads; I like power, acceleration and downshifting for Colorado mountains.  DON'T  like the electronic steering!  I'm used to hydraulic steering where once you get it ""on tract"" it stays there even if you touch the wheel either way.  With the KIA on highway at 60+ mph, you have to constantly make micro adjustments to the wheel to get it back to neutral.  No it's not alignment.  3 dealers have done alignments and it's perfect.  One dealer said that's just the way electronic steering  and other new cars are to save weight and for fuel economy.  KIA: Thanks for making those saving and the expense of easy driving.  (I wonder if Audi and BMW steer this way).  So drive it on straight  highway at 60+ and see if it bothers you before buying.",5

First of all you cannot have the recirculated air on at the same time as your fan. So you have to endure car exhaust fumes if you take any trip. Second which is even worse, the seats are uncomfortable for traveling and there is no remedy for that because you cannot use a cushion or seat cover. If you use a seat cover or a thin pad, no matter how much you weigh it turns off your airbags making your safety at risk. This was not a smart deal. I called Kia to find out how to turn the airbag on at all times. They said you will just have to live with it.",1

Took it for a road trip and it handled the rain, first winter snow  and slush very well. One thing I was not happy about was the passenger seat indicator did not come on when the passenger took there seat belt off. This is a safety issue in which should come equipped in all vehicles. The seat belts didn't have much resistance when the breaks was given a lot of force to stop. Very happy about the many air bags. In which I am having the dealer take a look at ASAP. I love the Sorrento very smooth ride and great on GAS. Do not care for the satellite to much, The signal is not good. The radio system is great with my Teenager as well as the USB hook ups.",5

(The CX-9 was our top choice in those categories.) When you added in the fantastic warranty, the strong CR reliability ratings, and the zero APR, the Sorento was a no-brainer for us.

2578, on 12/15/16 23:48 PM (PST),tombeaman ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV EX 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Things That Make you go Hmmmm," I've got about 1500 miles on my new Sorento so far, and there are SO many things that I love about it.  It seems to be a great value, a very comfortable car for the  money.  There are some items that make me scratch my head: The so-called third seat...REALLY?  That is crazy in every SUV I have been in.  Give it up, people.  If you want a third row, get a mini-van.  For the Sorento, getting that third row not only gives you a couple of seats that only an 8-year old could sit in, it also loses you some handy storage bins!  How stupid!  Another poorly designed feature is the power rear hatch.  The Sorento has a great feature that allows the hatch to raise just by approaching the car...that is cool.  What is NOT cool is that the hatch will open up while you are in the garage and then bang your hatch into your garage door.  If that happens (say, your fob button gets pressed by your other keys), then you go out to the garage and open your garage door, causing hundreds of dollars of damage!  This is not a problem with only the Sorento, but I never thought of it until I owned an SUV.  Beware!  A feature that I am having trouble with is the Automatic Forward Braking system.  It's supposed to monitor traffic ahead and warn you or apply the brakes if needed to lessen a collision.  A great safety feature...that turns off dozens of times each trip...about once every four miles!  Accompanied by a ""ding ding!"" I feel like it's going to be Christmas all year round!  It's going back to the shop tomorrow, so we'll see if they fix it or not.  My next whine is the leather seat warmers.  Why would the switch have to be engaged every time I start my car??  And why have a switch that requires multiple taps to cycle through the options, instead of a two-or-three position switch?  My other cars with this feature have an Off-Low-High toggle switch, and when you a running errands the heater comes on to the last setting.  But the Sorento has to be turned on each time, and then you have to push the button repeatedly to go from high to medium to low heat.  Now, after that list of complaints, I still LOVE how it drives.  A powerful engine (a little too touchy on the gas pedal), smooth tranny and ride, tight turning radius, great visibility.  I am happy, but I do wish those things on my list were not so puzzling.  Another oddity about KIA is that accessories cost twice as much if you wait to get them after the sale.  Seems to me that a posted price for an accessory should be the same whether the item is installed at the dealer or at the port.  And another thing???  Hire someone who actually knows English to write your owner's manuals!UPDATE:  The Forward Braking problem is already a service advisory from KIA.  So the good news is they are on top of it.  The bad news is the fact that it was not done properly to begin with, and now the part is on order.  I'll update this again as the repair process proceeds.",4
2579, on 12/15/16 07:37 AM (PST),Carlover ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Best SUV for the money," Leased this SUV for 3 years this past week. I choose the snow white pearl with merlot leather interior. I traded 2 other vehicles in for this one as my wife and I didn't need 2 since we are retired. I have leased over 20 vehicles in the past 20 years including BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Lexus. The Sorento is one of the best vehicles I have ever leased. I have the SX with Advanced Technology package which includes Lane Departure Warning, Advanced smart cruise control, Forward Collision Warning Autonomous  Emergency Warning and Electronic Parking Brake. I added remote start and Home link rear view mirror. The build quality is exceptional, doors close with a solid thud like the German cars, and interior quality is as good or better than Lexus RX350. Interior noise levels are exceptionally low with no tire hiss being heard in the rain which makes listening to the very good 10 speaker Infinity sound system even better. Heated and ventilated front seats are great along with the heated steering wheel. The 3rd row isn't that roomy but I will probably not use it that much but cargo room behind the second row is very good. If you will use the 3rd row often this may not be your best choice. Reliability isn't known yet since I only have 650 miles on the SUV. I hope this helps anyone looking to purchase an suv.",5

2582, on 11/13/16 20:25 PM (PST),Don ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV Limited 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Our 3rd Sorento-outstanding features for the price," Our first Sorento was an LX back in 2012 then we traded for a 2014 EX V6 and just last week traded that one for a 2017 Limited.  The wife loves the fact that the Sorento can be outfitted with 3rd row seats and I love the features for the price, notwithstanding great dealer support and warranty.  Our previous Sorento's have always been dependable.  I almost traded our 2014 for the 2016 but it was the 1st year of the re-tooling and dealers were getting MSRP pricing plus it didn't have auto braking with the front collision warning system.  Our dealer had a great price on a brand new 2017 limited and we traded.  I chose the limited for several reasons: to get some of the same features our 2014 EX had (such as ventilated front seats) we had to go to the limited trim.  But I also liked all the other features the limited offered so we chose this trim level.  You can't get any additional options on this trim level as they are all included, except for any extra dealer options (like a cargo net, mats, etc).  There are a number of great features on this car.  To begin with, the sound deadening glass and underbody makes for a really quite highway ride.  The interior redesign is very functional.  The power seat on drivers side has many new features on lumbar support and leg extension support at front of seat.  The LCD display and Navigation/Audio/Bluetooth/Climate displays are much more user friendly.  It seems there are on-screen prompts to almost all functions to help you.  The audio system is outstanding.  The menu choices have been broadened and are extensive: you can download Yelp, Pandora is included, SirusXM Traffic, Apple Car Play and Android Auto just to mention a few.  You still have the UVO system (download POI's you create on your own Smartphone or PC and Parking Minder).  We love the new Android Auto.  You hook up your phone via USB and you basically have Google maps and voice support at your command via the car's system. The Lane change warning is a nice feature.  You still have Blind Spot monitor which we loved on our 2014.  Adaptive Cruise control is really neat.  You set your cruise speed and if you come up on a slower vehicle your vehicle automatically adjusts its speed to the vehicle ahead until you move out of the lane and pass which time your car goes back to the speed you originally set.  The surround view cameras give you front views, backup camera with obstacle warning and cameras on underside of each outside mirror give a computer generated image of a birds eye view of your car.  This is nice when parking in a tight space you can see on the screen how you are fitting between two cars or other obstacles.  There is an electric parking brake on the Limited which automatically releases as you drive forward.  There is also a feature called Auto Hold which when activated allows you to take your foot off the brake when waiting in a line of cars at a light or a stop sign.  Once you come to a complete stop the ""auto hold"" holds your car just as if you have your foot on the brake, but you can relax your foot and as you step on the accelerator to move forward it automatically releases (part of the electric parking brake system).  The full ceiling panorama roof remains a great feature.  And of course with the 2017 model you have auto braking in advance of a frontal collision situation.  Haven't tested out that yet as no way to really simulate it in a situation without risking it not ""seeing"" the potential frontal crash.  You also have 1 USB connection port and 2 additional USB charging ports as well as 3 12v ports and one 110v port. Sunshades are on the 2nd row windows, the V6 is the only engine to go with in my opinion, and in the Limited you have heated/cooled front seats and heated 2nd row seats as well as a heated steering wheel.  Yes I know that is a lot of features which some are just 'luxury' items, but at $46,000 MSRP with most dealers discounting off that, you would be hard pressed to find another vehicle with V6 and 3rd row seats with all those features at such a good price.",5
2583, on 11/09/16 11:13 AM (PST),Dave C ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Our new Kia Sorento is great," My Wife and I just purchased this Kia Sorento V6 AWD with the SX trim level in a beautiful red.  This was a demonstrator with about 2800 miles on it so we got a great discount from the $45,000+ price.  We originally were talking with the dealer about a lower EX trim level model but we were able to negotiate for this higher trim level at about the same price as the lower EX trim because it was a demonstrator.  This is a fantastic car with the safety and technology packages on it.  One of the coolest features is the smart cruise control which maintains the distance from the car in front of you even down to a full stop.  The lane keeping alert is also very helpful.  The UVo voice activation feature is nice so you don't have to take your eyes off the road to tune the radio or make a call.  The ride is very comfortable and quiet even on rough roads and at high Interstate speeds.  The leather power seats have multi position adjustments which are quite comfortable and these happen to be heated and cooled.  The only nitpick is that there is no daytime running lights feature and the lights don't come on automatically with the wipers.  Kia engineers should fix this.  Otherwise this car is great.  It gets high ratings from Consumer Reports, Kelly Blue Book and J D Power.  The Kia warranty is an industry leader.  The value Kia puts in this vehicle is tremendous.  The features on this car can be had on vehicles twice the price.  This is the first NEW car we have had in our 40 year marriage and we are very satisfied with it.",5

It's sporty, sexy, luxurious yet still has the power to tow 5,000 lbs and cargo space to help a friend move or bring lumber home from the hardware store. The Sorento has the best turning diameter out of all the SUVs - do a donut (slowly, of course) and feel the difference it makes turning into a parking space! I'm a little short and if I had two wishes to make it better - it would be to reduce the height of getting in and out of the vehicle and changing the driver's seat headrest, minor details for such an amazing SUV.",5

2588, on 10/01/16 11:33 AM (PDT),Happy Kia Customer ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV EX 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),My 3rd Sorento!!  And I love it...most of the time," My 2014 EX was a big jump up from my 2011 EX.  My 2017 is an even bigger jump!!  Great looking in and out!  Drive is smooth and (mostly) quiet.  Mostly everything has been improved over my 2014 (which I loved) except a couple of things.  First, my 2014 was 100% free of squeaks, rattles, vibrations...noise.  My 2017 has a couple of rattles on bumpy roads that can get a bit annoying.  I get rattles with the sunroof but on very bumpy roads the rattles become vibrations and then it's very disappointing...like various sections of the roof get loud vibrations...kind of kills the ride.  I also get a little bit of rattle coming from around where the center console meets the dash board.  I took everything out of the car like coins, phone/GPS wires, other stuff to make sure it was not any of my loose stuff.  Although not consistent...I did get rattles from that section on bumpy roads.  So that ""noise"" is also disappointing and kind of ruins the ride...when it occurs.  Everything else is fantastic with this car.  I thought the 2014 was a little small (aesthetically) for my 6'4"" tall frame...a little girly is how I put it.  But, this 2017 which is only a few inches longer feels like it fits me much better and I feel great (cool) driving such a nice car that also seems manly for me to drive...while still being very stylish.  This car looks great from all angles inside and out...very proud to drive it and be seen driving it.  Except for the rattles...all other fit-and-finish seems high quality!  Materials are all good.  Everything is like you'd find on a more expensive model/brand....dear I say mid-entry level Mercedes.  The only thing knocking this car down a peg or two is the rattles and vibrations...which is a big deal to me...especially since my 2014 had none.  I also noticed that my cargo area doesn't seem to be as wide as my 2014.  I would get my mountain bike and my dog crate side-by-side easily into my 2014.  My 2017 those two items are squeezed right up next to each other...seems a few inches narrower than my 2014.  On the other hand, it seems the cargo is a little deeper so that helps.  Also, even though the 2017 V6 drives great (better than '14)...I do think that since it is heavier than the '14...Kia should seriously think about upping the V6 power by about 25hp and maybe get a 7 or 8 speed automatic like the competitors are doing.  I do think my back up camera parking assist guides are not calibrated like my '14 was.  I could drive my '14 backwards all over town just by looking at my dash video...the guides were very accurate.  I knew if my guide lines were touching anything on my camera then I knew my car wasn't going to hit anything.  It was excellent for parking backwards in tight spots and getting out of tight spots...I relied on it a lot...TRUSTED it!  My '17 guideline seem off so I really have to rely on my mirrors to see the parking lines and be extra careful.  If I just followed my camera I'd likely side-swipe cars parked next to me.  The camera lines don't match up with the real parking lines...so that isn't cool.  Might have to ask my dealer about that.  So, overall, I'd give my 2017 a 4.5 stars and not a 5 because of the occasional rattles/vibrations (Kia should have ironed out for the 2017) and the backup camera guides aren't calibrated well...not as easy to park or get out of tight spaces as my '14.   Otherwise...I LOVE my 2017 EX V6 Sorento!!",5

By far the Sorento has the best quality, interior, and technology.  The navigation and blue tooth are very user friendly.  In addition, the vehicle is so so quiet, it is hard to believe as there are extra insulation and acoustic glass.  Kia engineers hit a home run on the build quality.  The more I  drive this vehicle the more I really enjoy it and can appreciate such great quality.  Even the electric steering has great road feel, since Kia placed the motor on the steering rack.  This is the first Kia I have owned and I never thought I would buy a Kia, but I am sold now.  Kia hired an engineer from Audi and he has really upped the quality.  I would put this crossover up against Lexus any day of the week.  The front seats are very comfortable and supportive so you do not get driver fatigue.  You will not be disappointed and you must include this vehicle on your short list if you are in the market.We have owned this crossover for a year now and still love it.  No issues and every time we drive it, we more and more appreciate the great build quality.",5

We were also very impressed with the ride and the safety features (autonomous braking, lane monitoring, blind spot monitoring and a great back up camera).

Being designed in Korea, most of the folks there are small and those seat bolsters hold them in place nicely I'm sure.  Due to cancer meds, I have gained some weight and no longer have a little butt and as such the seat bolsters are very hard and jab me in the hips making it uncomfortable.  If you don't have a big rear end, then this is a great car.  KIA should make the bolsters softer so that they don't jab a person in the hips.  I mentioned the discomfort to the dealer and they indicated that they were sorry.UPDATE:  while not perfect, the seat feels much better. Just don't have a big butt!",5

Only minor issue is that a side view mirror popped out when I was folding it in.  I was able to easily replace it.  It doesn't pop out if I'm careful when I fold it in and make sure not to touch the mirror itself.  Still driving great.  No problems and surprisingly good gas mileage on the highway when I keep the tires optimally inflated.,5

2600, on 07/07/16 10:31 AM (PDT),Netscorer ,2017 Kia Sorento SUV Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Step aside lux X-overs - there is new King in town," Kia has outdone themselves with new Sorento. It's a perfect size crossover - huge trunk in 5 seater configuration and always available fairly comfortable 3rd row to haul up to 7 adults. Very blunt front and rear minimize exterior dimensions to assist in parking, while providing the same interior dimensions as much larger Highlander. Comfort on the top trim SXL is rivaling premium crossovers from Japanese and American carmakers. Compare Sorento with Lexus RX, Lincoln MKX or Acura MDX and you will find that Sorento matches them feature by feature, seat comfort, road noise isolation, technology and ride. All while costing $10K less MSRP. Considering that KIA & dealers are also providing very aggressive discounts from MSRP, you can easily save $15K by forgoing the prestige brand logo. Sorento's Adaptive Cruise Control is also considerably better then competition - keeping distance reliably and supporting full stop & go traffic where most of the competition cuts out below 15mph. Ride quality is excellent - assertive, yet soft enough to forget road imperfections. Acceleration for V6 Direct injection engine matched with 6-speed automatic is excellent too. Starting up hill or overtaking cars on the highway is piece of cake. Fuel consumption could be better, but at least the listed specs are very conservative. My V6 AWD trim is rated 17/23/19 combined and so far in the first 9,000 miles of mixed driving with plenty of traffic and AC on I am averaging 21mpg. 2017 model adds Adaptive headlamps that swivel in the curves to provide better illumination and Autonomous Emergency Breaking that keeps an eye on the traffic ahead and will apply brakes automatically if it feels that collision is imminent. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto also come standard and greatly enhance available infotainment system. Otherwise 2017 is indistinguishable from 2016 redesign model. Huge panoramic sunroof goes beyond second row of seats and provides great sky views for passengers in all rows. My only pet peeve with it is that it is controlled by single lever. So if you want to just open blind, but leave the sunroof closed, you can't. Once you push the button to open the blind, the roof starts to open automatically and you need to go back and forth to achieve what you want. Another perplexing omission in US is absence of DRLs. There is an LED brow light on Sorento that acts as DRL in all regions outside US, but in US it is can not be turned on without full headlight. So you either drive with your lights off, or you need to turn on main headlights. It's a mystery why KIA decided to disable this feature in US.",5

2603, on 02/13/16 14:43 PM (PST),Scott ,2005 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4WD 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 5A),11+ years and it WAS a great SUV," I bought my Sorento LX 4x4 new in January 2006 (2005 model year) and it has been a very dependable vehicle and I have enjoyed owning it.  It has only been back to the dealer one time for minor repairs, brakes and new belts in 10 years.  Very reliable and I love the truck design platform with real four wheel drive.  It will easily crawl up any mountain jeep trail in 4x4 (low setting).  It has good towing capacity.  I may have been lucky that I did not end up with one of the Sorentos that mechanical or electrical issues, based on the problems in other reviews.  When it is in standard 2wd the rear wheel drive can loose traction easily on icy roads, but it plows through everything with secure traction in 4 wheel drive (high setting).  The only other repairs that I have done are the exhaust flex pipes were replaced when holes developed, replaced the tires and regular oil changes.  Gas mileage varies considerably based on driving.  I typically get 9-14 mpg driving in my hilly city, but on the highway it gets 18-22 mpg depending on speed.  I just did 700+ miles of mostly freeway driving at 70 mph in the winter 32 degrees on day and 0 degrees a few days later and still got 21-22 mpg both times. On slower 55 mph highways I have gotten 24 mpg when fully loaded down with a weeks worth of camping gear and an 18 foot canoe on the roof.  I'm happy I bought it and still enjoy driving it, the seats are very comfortable, the interior is nicely designed, I still take it on road trips and down remote logging roads.  I don't put a lot of miles on it because I live in a smaller city and don't do my daily commute to work in it.  I happily get to walk to work all year for my commute!  In town it is primarily used for hauling supplies to work.  Glad I bought my Sorento LX :)  - Read updateUpdate:  In my prior review I forgot about the engine starter motor that failed on Christmas Day in a different town.  That repair on a 6 year old car was not covered by the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty!Since then:  At 11 years and 2 months, with just 60k miles, a engine timing belt sprocket broke distroying my engine.  The timing belt replacement & associtated maintenance had been performed the prior year.  The replacement rebuilt used engine cost just as much as the suv was worth.  My local KIA dealer took 3 1/2 months to replace the engine, including 2 subsequent repairs due to the a poor installation.  On one of those the dealer had to tow the car in because the replacement engine quit working.",2
2604, on 02/11/16 01:26 AM (PST),Ashton ,2005 Kia Sorento SUV LX Rwd 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 5M),Still Runs like a champ after 10 years!!," Me and my family have owned this car firsthand since 2005 and it has been such a fun, exciting reliable car since the day we bought it! Ok so firstly Id like to say obviously if you bought the car second hand you cant really blame the car for poor performance issues or problems. Each car has its own history and of course with good care will last a long time. That being said I can start my review... ok where to begin... alright well performance wise the car has alot more power than expected. The 3.5 V6 has about 195 HP which is really great and the engine combined with the transmission has always been very responsive and seems to never dissapoint. As far as comfort I personally am content with the vehicle. I mean its not comparable to a plush couch but its not uncomfortable either. The quality of the vehicle is decent, Kia is known for using cheaper parts but its nothing too degrading. When you enter the car its what you can expect from an average car. Now hands down this is the toughest car Iv ever owned. Iv only been in 2 accidents, one of them I was rear ended at a red light and it was an extremly hard hit. Other than damage to the bumper and tail gate towards the back of the car thats all that really happened, and I was personally ok other than a small ammount of whiplash due to my position at the time of Impact. The car has never left me stranded anywhere and I havnt had to replace anything too major other than thing that with wear and tear need fixing. Probably the biggist repair has been changing the timing belt just because you literally have to take off every accessory on the engine and its very time consuming and a bit of a pain. Our sorento now has a little over 160,000 miles and still runs like a champ, a can floor it anytime, make hard stops frequently, and steer abruptly anytime I feel like it without having to worry about damage or wear.  And I can confirm I have driven the heck out of that car, I meanIv put extreme wear in it and she still runs great. So aside if all the great things the sorento has to offer, some down falls are... the paint on the hood, roof and other small areas has faded completley. Iv noticed my sorento isnt the only one that has a faded hood though and sort of in the same shape. I actually think it might be due to the heat of the engine over time... then again its a decade old so you can expect that. Another downfall is bad gas mileage. Its rated I believe at 16 MPG or so but when you drive it hard like I do go ahead and bump that number down to 14 mpg. And lastly, I wish the cars hood didnt slope down so much, it makes it look more like a van than a SUV. Although the 2009 Sorentos hood did improve concerning that... So yea anyways the cars not a clunker, Kia did a very good job with their 05 Sorento and obviously it does has flaws just like every other car but take it from me It still holds the champ title in my eyes, and I still pride the car to this day. So many valuble memories have been made with it, and I comend Kia on it. I just wish the 2016 Kia looked different and I also wish they hadnt strayed from the true SUV body style. The 2016 personally looks like a mini van and it doesnt have the same off road capability or ruggedness as my 05 does.",4

The only thing holding up the car was a shock! I truly believe this car was made poorly with cheap metal. Kia will not help me or stand behind the cars they build.

Love that it has full size tires and not the barbie doll ones like on the Sportage.  Okay the wife is out of the room now, let me tell you what I really think! This car is beast! I live in Colorado where it can snow pretty good and when you put this thing in 4x4 and mash the pedal it can take you places. I'm talking 4 ft tall drifts sometimes 20 ft across and this KIA got me across them. I have proof the car can take a beating.",4.25

Within the first year, the brakes and rooters were replaced.  The dealership replaced them 4 times, at our expense, then we took it to another mechanic and since then they have been fine.  The motor has been replaced twice and is now at the dealership again after it just died in the middle of the road, and my husband and I had to push it off the road. We've replaced every light in the car numerous times, at least 3-4 times a year.  It's been in for oil leaks at least 3 times.  The paint started chipping within the first year.  I'll never ever buy another Kia.  ",3.75

I drive many miles to work so I first bought a Kia because of the low price, now I buy because of the quality.  So far I've had no mechanical failures, but my shocks and struts are getting weaker.  Of the two Sorentos I've owned, the first one did have the issue with head lights going before their time.  This one has been OK so far though in regards to that problem.  My first Sorento was bought used as well and was a 2004 EX v6 model.  It was also very reliable but got totaled in an accident so I had to buy my 05 to replace it.

It still stands out in a sea of sameness.   Fuel economy is not great but I consistently average 20 mpg per fill up.

We are concerned if we trade/sell we are passing an unsafe car to another unsuspecting consumer but we may have no other choice due to KIA's indifference.",2.625

You can't compare this to a Trailblazer, it's twice as nice at half the price.  The $20,000 I saved buys a lot of gas. Mine's a fully loaded EX with almost every aftermarket option Kia offers. Plenty of torque, power to spare.  This car wants to run.  Baby the pedal on take-offs, let the transmission do the work.

My most recent SUV was a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and I loved it but it was time to get a newer model and the price was a little out of my range so I decided to stop and check out the 2015 Sorento and I was amazed on how well it handled and the power that the 4 cyl produced and actually it performed better than my  Jeep. The comfort is great and I could not find anything that would stop me from buying it in which I did do. So with 32000 Miles on it I have the balance of the factory 5/60 B2B  and 10/100 on the power train was the selling point. I have had it now since Sept. 2015 and the only thing is the road noise but this may be due to the All Season Mastercraft tires I have on and depends on what kind of surface the road is.  Great gas mileage. This is 1 Great Vehicle. Update on the noise.

I'm thinking the 4 cylinder engine is just too small for the weight of the truck.  It just drags on acceleration.  I have to punch it to go up hills.  I get 16mpg in the city/hwy is about 24mpg so the claims that the manufacturer makes are false (probably only best case scenario).  If you get one, buy the V6.

I put 36500 miles on it and it run perfectly for me gave me good gas mileage and no problems, it was AWD by the way and when it came time to trade I received good resale value. I take very good care of my vehicles, and by the way I dealt with two different dealers I bought my 2011 from one dealer and I leased my 2015 from a different dealer and will say that they both are top of the line dealers couldn't be happier, they are both excellent when it comes to service and getting things done. When I leased my 2015 which is a SXL AWD V6 I noticed that on rougher roads which we have a lot of them around here in NE Iowa especially in the spring time after the frost comes out, that it had a thumping noise like it was coming from the right front, like a strut or something that wasn't right, I could feel it through the floor even like it was metal on metal. I stopped at the dealer and told them about it so they had one of their experts ride with me on good roads and he even admitted that he could tell that it was doing it. So it was decided that when I brought it in for my 5000 mile maintenance that they would check it over and try and fix the problem which they did, and they also found a leak of coolant that they fixed. I was very happy and couldn't say enough good about the excellent service that I got there first class for sure. I liked my first Sorento the 2011 very much no complaints, I love this 2015 SXL what a nice vehicle for the money, and when you consider the warranty price and features for your dollar it is very hard to beat KIA. Only thing that I would like is just a little more room in back for my golf clubs it is a little tight, but of course KIA is one step ahead of me along comes the 2016 Sorento with the extra room, looks like I will need to update again soon.",5

My sister bought a 1972 Toyota Corolla as her first car (used) and EVERYONE doubted Japanese cars. She sold it with 211,000 miles, at a time when 100,000 was considered outstanding. I think the same is now true for Korean cars... they need to prove themselves. But take the badge off and overall the Sorento trails no one. Drove the 2018 Audi Q5 and there's nothing not to like but for $15,000 more than the Kia all it had was the really cool display and a faster 0-60. Drove the Lexus RX350. Again, really nice but $12,000 more than the Kia and no Apple CarPlay and only the base engine was same HP. Drove Acura RDX. Again really nice and only 2k more but way smaller in size. Drove the Honda Pilot but after driving the Acura, it was quickly dismissed. Toyota Highlander a bit larger than Kia but an extra $9,000 for same equipment, and again the Toyota/Lexus clunky infotainment system with no Google or Apple. Then we drove the 2019 Kia Sorento. For $40,000 we received AWD and all the safety and entertainment features currently available. The interior was equal or better than everyone except the Audi. Capacity better than anyone except Toyota and Honda but enough for us. With the 3.3L V6 and the 8 speed trans on the 2019, performance is at least equal to everyone except Audi. Safety, it's the only IIHS Top Safety Pick Plus in the group.  Reliability is yet to be seen for 2019 but the warranty (60/60,000 and 120/100) is by far the best and, based on past reliability, it's better than all but Lexus and Toyota. So when you put together: value #1, performance #2/3, interior quality #2, infotainment #1 and safety #1: the Kia wins. You just have to get over the fact that it says Kia on the badge.",5

I have owned this for three weeks and I am truly impressed with the level of finish and the outstanding quality of the vehicle. It's incredibly smooth and so quiet for an SUV.  The 6 cylinder engine is a must for a mid-size AWD SUV such as this. The acceleration is great. And let's not forget the ten year powertrain warranty.

It had been a completely reliable ride for 70K miles but with so many safety improvements in recent years we felt it was time to look around again. We considered just about every SUV/Crossover with an MSRP of $50K or less.  Frankly we couldn't find a better set of features, a more comfortable and quiet ride, and a ""just right"" size in any other vehicle. The excellent price combined with a generous trade-in at the local KIA dealer meant we came home with a 2018 SXL AWD model.",5
2696, on 04/07/18 04:51 AM (PDT),Eric ,2018 Kia Sorento SUV SX Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Luxury car without luxury badge," The Sorento is an outstanding SUV, especially for the price. I'm completely satisfied with my choice. Pros: The best infotainment system we saw. Everything is easy to use and it has Apple Carplay/Android Auto; Luxury interior; quiet ride; great adaptive cruise control; great safety technology; small footprint is easy to maneuver in urban parking lots. Cons: steering and handling is not sporty; third row access could be better; fuel economy is poor, especially relative to the wagon I had before; it's a handsome car but not exciting to look at; Kia doesn't have the cache of a luxury brand and many people still see it as a cheap car. In addition to the Sorento we test drove an Audi Q7, Volvo XC90, and Mazda CX-9. We originally thought we would get a luxury brand but decided the premium we would pay for the Audi could be used to fund some pretty nice vacations and the Sorento is close enough in quality that it wasn't worth an extra 20k. The Volvo is a beautiful car and not as expensive as the Audi, but the Kia drives better, has a better infotainment system and controls, and doesn't have all the reliability red flags. The Mazda is also sexier than the Kia but it also has some reliability issues, weaker technology, and no apple Carplay. Now that I have Apple Carplay I will never own a car without it again. My wife also hated the heads up display in the Mazda. Fuel economy: we live in a hilly urban area where we get 9 mpg city. With our 4 cylinder Acura wagon we were getting about 14 mpg city. On the highway, if I set cruise control to 70 mph I get 26-28 mpg.",5

Overall I like them both, but I hear a lot of air leaking in from the front passenger door or back passenger door, not sure which door.  I made sure that I slammed the doors shut, but there is still a whistle of air coming from the doors. The door seals are tight, because there's no water leakage coming into the vehicle.  I had a 5 passenger 2016 Sorento and bought a plastic cargo tray for the back. I was told that the cargo tray would fit the 7 passenger 2018 Sorento, THIS IS TOTALLY NOT THE CASE.  I have to now cut and try to fit the cargo tray into the back of the vehicle.  What a pain!!!!",4
2698, on 03/25/18 16:02 PM (PDT),Mike McNamara ,2018 Kia Sorento SUV EX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Surprise!! It's a KIA!," I usually buy a 2 year old car and drive it 8-10 years.  So, I started a year ago looking for a replacement for a 2006 Lexus RX330.  I wanted all the new safety devices. I loved the Lexus, but didn't like the newer ""big mouth bass"" look.  So, the Highlander, Forrester and Sorento were the final 3 on my list.  However, after driving the Sorento and being amazed at its Lexus-like comfort and quiet, but with better handling, I was sold.  After an extensive Internet search, the 2016 Sorento I was considering was only $7000-8000 less than the deal we negotiated on a new 2018. So, I pulled the trigger on a new one!  I've driven it under various road and weather conditions and am still amazed at what a terrific car it is.  It has a little more space than the RX330, which is good for the volunteer work I do and it has the emergency 3rd row for the grand kids, although they stay stowed flat most of the time.  The Apple Car-Play is a plus.  So, if you're looking for that right-sized SUV and want great handling, quiet and comfort, you should drive a Sorento.  It is also a lot less money than an RX350 or Highlander.",5
2699, on 03/05/18 22:53 PM (PST),Happy driver ,2018 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),My first SUV. VERY pleased!," This 2018 Kia Sorento LX V-6 is perfect for me. I didn't want a large SUV, and found this vehicle provided 'just right' passenger and storage room. Plenty of cubbyholes for various gear, enough USB and power receptacles, rear-seat passenger HVAC controls, ease of entry and exit front and rear, lots of passenger room, comfortable seats, plenty of power from the V-6 engine. I found the 4 cyl just too anemic, and I don't care for turbos. Interior finish and quality of materials are excellent. I didn't need a lot of high-tech options which are available, settling instead for a backup camera, but forgoing most of the other technology. My GPS links perfectly well and displays on the vehicle's screen so no need for navigation. U.S. News ranks the 2018 Sorento #2 in their list of the top 19 mid-sized SUVs, and I agree wholeheartedly. I shopped the GMC Acadia, Toyota Highlander, GMC Terrain, Ford Edge, and Hyundai Santa Fe,  and in the end, felt the Sorento was the best value for the money spent. Build and materials quality are top-notch. So far, I am VERY pleased with my choice.  Can't imagine needing or desiring any more than this vehicle offers.",5

As to the back being comfy, not really. Seats do not adjust properly, and passengers have complained about lack of comfort. Admittedly, these individuals are older, and previous to this vehicle, we had a Honda Odyssey Elite. Why did I buy it then? A blunder, in my case. Performance is good, and the adaptive cruise control works like clockwork. Storage spaces throughout the cabin is quite limited. Ours has under 3000 miles, and for those more on the average/petite size this SUV should be more pleasing. I must tilt my head a little when boarding the vehicle. Stereo is average, and CD player heats up rapidly, hate to play it too much during hot weather. 3.5 Stars. PS Upon further driving, the vehicle grows on you. Comfort level remains iffy, unless you are a small person. For those sitting in the back is not a comfortable situation. No reclining of seats, and basically one position. Myself I have to tilt my head to enter (my chiropractic is quite thrilled about it), just because I am over 6 feet. So far the vehicle appear sturdier than most, and relatively quiet. 4 Stars.",4

2702, on 01/10/18 15:40 PM (PST),Howard Gabennesch ,2018 Kia Sorento SUV SX Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Edmunds readers like it.  So do I.," In January 2018, I compared the average consumer ratings on Edmunds for midsize SUVs with at least 20 ratings in the 2017 model year. Acadia trailed the pack at 3.7.  Grand Cherokee, Explorer, Highlander, Murano, and Pilot fell in a narrow 4.1- 4.3 range. Edge came in at 4.4.  Sorento, Santa Fe, and CX-9 topped the list at 4.6. (By the way, there is often little relationship between consumer ratings and expert reviews of the same vehicle. For example, both Acadia and Sorento received 3.5 stars from the Edmunds expert.) While the Sorento is unchanged in 2018, some of the others are now in new editions and their 2018 ratings may turn out to be different. But it's safe to say that the current Sorento has been well received by the owners who submitted reviews to Edmunds. And this satisfaction mirrors my own. High-quality interior, quiet ride, excellent safety technology, superior warranty, peppy V6 on regular gas, Android Auto, thoughtful touches throughout (e.g., AC outlet).  Shoppers should be aware that several competitors are roomier, but so far I can't find much else I'd change. Oh, I did replace the front and rear Kia badges with the stylish “K” logo displayed on Kias sold in Asia. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this vehicle.P.S. (7/14/18)  Apparently Edmunds has decided to stop showing consumer ratings of each vehicle in numeric form (4.1, 4.6, etc.)  If we want to know the average number of stars per vehicle, we'll have to calculate it by hand.  Not likely.  Why would they want to make it more difficult to compare vehicles?",5

After trying CRV, CX-5, Tiguan, Pilot, Highlander we settled down on Kia Sorento. The size is just right with lots of room for front and mid row passengers. The third row is good to have. The V6 engine is perfect for the weight of the vehicle to accelerate. The car handling is very nice with active safety features. The warranty is just great, gives peace of mind for 5 years bumper to bumper and 10yrs/100K on transmission.

I was happy at first on what seemed a very good deal. Leather seats plenty of comfort, small frugal engine, but the first thing to go out the window was the promised MPG, very low, way below the expected. The engine is too small for such a heavy vehicle and I am very conservative in my driving. I don't care at all for sports cars and to me a car is just a tool, like a screwdriver. So even for somebody with cero passion for horse power, torque and acceleration, this car seems way underpowered or something. IT feels heavy. We had several problems with the lights going on on the dashboard. Reliability was always a question mark. I was floored when my 4 year old girl got the handle of the read door in her small hand trying to open it? cheap plastic broke. bad design and bad quality together is a recipe for disaster.

Kia may fix mine who knows but I doubt it reading the rest of the people with the same exact thing go wrong. BEWARE update Kia did fix mine. Got new motor new trans an new drive train. All was bad. Good thing it blew up lol. An the exhaust manifold has a crack in it by 02 sensor. An now after they fixed it now the ball joints are somehow bad they say. An the front end make a noise like the struts are bad. So I replaced all of it struts balljoints, tie rod ends, hubs, an finally the stabilizer bars on the front an it took care of the sounds. So people it's not the rubber boot on the strut. I changed it all an nothing worked until that.

I've heard since that the 4cy version has significantly less power and virtually no difference in MPG.  I drive daily at 50/50 city and highway and it delivers between 23 and 24mpg over all.  Highway only roadtrips get about 28mpg.  I consider this good for the size and weight of the vehicle.  I've had it almost a year, and it does well on the snowy/icy Minnesota roads.  The heated mirrors and parking assist 'tipping' of the mirrors is great.  I like the push-button start--I never have to get out my keys--the button on the door handle locks and unlocks the car.  The heated and cooled seats are so nice for that instant need for heat or cooling.  It would be nice to have at least one more USB port.  Some haters say Kia has a 'cheap' feel, but I don't think so.  Seats are comfortable and it's SO versatile--you can 6 passengers besides yourself (7 if they're small and you cheat a little), OR you can fold down the seats and have as much room for hauling as a pickup with a topper.2017 update:  I'm still as happy with it as the day I bought it.

I purchased the four cylinder base model.It has Bluetooth,auto transmission,AC,and lots of style.I get asked a lot about my Sorento.""How do you like it?"" ""How much was your car?""

We've put 10,000 miles in three months, taking long trips, moving and hauling lots of cargo. It's proven to be comfortable while averaging about 25-26 mpg on the highway and about 20 mpg in the city.

The windshield seemed very small and the A pillars very wide reducing visibility and causing a claustrophobic effect. Also, the back up camera image being in the rear view mirror was extremely distracting and made it more difficult to have full visibility to safely back up. Additionally, the steering was so tight it almost felt as if there was no power steering.

It has been a great car for the past three years. This year it was at just over 90k. I have always done everything I am supposed to. Plus I am a slow accelerator, typically I cruise at 2000 RPM in the city and 2500 on the highway not passing 3000 during acceleration. Then last month I heard a god awful metal sheering sound and the car skidded to a halt. Had it towed to the mechanic and was told the cylinder tubes had corroded and the cylinder heads were shifting and scraping the sides and that the engine could no longer be started. Cost for a used engine with the same amount of miles is right around $4500. If I want a re-manufactured one it is even more. Warranty is not an option because it cancels at 5/60 on used purchases. What is worse to me is a I still owe $14k. I did some research and it looks like this is a common problem in 2011 and 2012 Sorentos. I had planned on buying a Kia again in the future but I think I will stick to brands I have had good experiences with.

We had minor/insignificant issues during the 60k bumper-to-bumper warranty period (which DOES transfer to the second owner)... insignificant things like a backup camera that needed replaced and some minor vibrations on the interior that just needed tightening up. Let me tell you though, almost the MINUTE that warranty was up parts started falling off this thing like a cartoon. We just had to take it in for a $450 oil pressure sensor that caused us to lose the entire contents of our engine oil in less than an hour. That's a MAJOR engine component and WOULD have been covered under the 100,000 mile powertrain warranty... EXCEPT it doesn't transfer to the second owners.

My air bag light came on suddenly. Vehicle was not involved in any sort of accident. Took it in and bottom line I had to have an entire new driver side air bag and assembly replaced. When I question how the heck an air bag needs to be replaced with out being in an accident or tampered with Dealer says, ""It just happens, the air bag is defective."" Well I wasn't going to drive around in a vehicle who's driver side air bag was not functioning. So I coughed up $1300 to get it fixed. Figured I'd go after Kia after the fact. They have told me no, and no again. One of the reps tried telling me this isn't a safety issue. Seriously? Anyways, I will get my money out of them. In the mean time a little internet research reveals  several, several stories of people who did not have an air bag light on and where in roll over or other serious collisions and NO air bags deployed. Scary. Wonder if the rest of my air bags will work in a collision...?*Update* On top of the air bag issue, I also started having transmission issues at about 84k miles.

This vehicle has electronic assist steering and has zero play in the steering wheel. A vehicle with has no play in the steering wheel is difficult to drive as very little movement in the steering wheel will cause the vehicle to move in that direction. I do remember when I took driver Ed. the teacher spent a session explaining why the steering wheel needs some play in it. As we drive we move the steering wheel a bit at a time to keep the vehicle on the path we want it to go. If there is no play just the smallest movement will cause the vehicle to move back and forth and make it very uncomfortable to drive. I would think on an icy road this would be very dangerous. Also the back up camera is so dark it is all but useless. In the daytime the reflection on the screen makes it very difficult to see and at night it does not show up well. I think the back up camera is more dangerous than not having one as the driver has to lean over towards it to try and see it better to no avail. I went to a Kia dealership and they looked at both problems and they explained to me that is the way they are built and there was no fix for the problem. The service manager agreed that these were problems but he apologized as there is no fix!

I traded it in for an 07 which was trouble from the beginning.  It was delivered with a broken sunroof, slit in the leather seat and the passenger seat didn't acknowledge there was a passenger in it. We brought it back to the dealer(s) (Boch, Norwood MA) at least 5 or 6 times in the first couple of months. The dealer we bought it from dropped Kia within a couple of months after buying the car. We then switched to (another dealer, they dropped Kia a few months later.  Next there was a problem with clutch slip in the rear end. This took Kia almost a year to come up with a fix. We had to drive 40 miles to a third and only dealership as the others dropped the line. In 2015 it developed a problem with a bearing in the engine (30K) and was repaired under warranty. In 2016 oil was pouring out from the area the dealership (Quirk) had done the bearing repair. They cleaned it and told me there was nothing wrong. I picked it up and brought it to a local repair shop and they told me it was still spewing oil and it appeared they (Quirk Kia, Braintree MA)  stuffed gasket cement where the leak was coming from. Brought it back and they worked on it for several days.  My daughter took it up to U Maine Orono last month and the car died a couple weeks later. Drove it to the Bangor Dealer who said the car was not worth fixing (42K miles). The electronic throttle control had gone, which I get the car is 10 years old. While on the lift he informed us that the engine is pouring oil out (same fix from Quirk) and the rear end mounts were completely rotted through. Looking on line this has been a huge issue for Kia worldwide and has been recalled in Europe. Not here yet.  This car was a third car for us from day one and my wife used it to travel to work in the next time. It was rarely driven on the highway and as you can see only had 42 K on it which about 12k of was put on by my daughter in the last year.  I've been waiting for 11 days from Kia. Never contacted any of the dealerships involved. Looks like were going to court.",1

I have contacted the dealership where it was purchased and they told me sorry I was out of warranty period. This issue should be covered. It is clear that the paint is faulty and is just peeling off. The spot is right above the windshield on the passengers side. The paint is chipping down to the primer. It seems that the paint and primer are not bonded properly. I feel that they should be liable because there are tons of complaints on this issue online. I have spoken with customer service through the 800#. My case was handed to District Mgr. Steven Kang. He offered to fix the roof if I paid half the cost which their estimate was over $300 out of pocket for me. I feel this is shows they know the paint is bad or they would have just told me sorry. I have asked to speak to Mr. Kang on numerous phone calls and he refuses to talk with me. I feel that if he is a customer service manger it should  be my right o speak with him concerning his decision. However he will not take my call. I have since been escalated to another group. I clearly told them do to work schedule I could not take a call till after 530pm and they contacted prior to this. I have returned the call and still haven't received a call back in about a week now. I am still seeking a solution to this issue. I feel that a vehicle that is just over 3yrs old should not have the paint falling off it. That is unacceptable.... I have spoken to several reps and have documentation of our conversations so when this goes to a higher attempt to get what I am do I will have names and employee extensions to quote. I hope this issue is resolved. I would never recommend a Kia vehicle to anyone due to this issue.,1

Within 6 months, my navigation/LCD display system which comes on once you turn on the car would get stuck at the introduction screen. This means that you can't use navigation, control the radio, CD player...nothing since you're stuck at the start screen. I would need to turn the truck off for an hour for it to come back on. They replaced the system at least 4 times. The last time I had it reset (as opposed to getting a new one) which was in August 2016. A week later, my battery died. I parked my car so that I could commute using public transportation. When I left work that evening to go and pick up my 1 year old, the car wouldn't start. A tow person, jumped the car assuming it was my fault for leaving a light on and suggest no taking it to the dealer. The next day after picking my son up from daycare, it did not start again. This time, I had them tow to the dealer! The dealer said they had to jump it just to get it in the garage. They put a new battery in my less than 3 year SUV that I drive daily on a highway. I almost sold it after that and decided against it. 2 weeks later, while leaving the grocery store around 8PM, the truck didn't start again...A red battery light came on and the warning ""battery discharge warning"". After a few tries, it started up and I got home almost without stopping! I called the dealer in the morning who is guessing that it's the alternator. It's being towed away as I type this...Update - They tested the truck and told me that they couldn't duplicate the issue. I asked them to buy it back from me and was told that they wouldn't give me much unless I wanted to buy another Kia (not). I sold it and haven't looked back.",3

First three service jobs were completed at the dealership. On 9/9, I noticed smoke coming out tail pipe upon acceleration. Husband checked oil, said it was fine but said it needed changing. I knew I was about 2K over recommended oil change. Took to Jiffy Lube to have oil changed on Monday 9/12, when pulling into Jiffy Lube, smoke is billowing out the back of the car. They checked oil said there was no oil, never had a light to come on to indicate there was an issue. They put oil in it and I went straight to dealership.After a 3 hour wait at dealership and the service manager being rude because I did not have an appointment, I was told my engine is gone it is burning oil due to sludge. I proceeded to tell them there shouldn't be any sludge I had oil changed every 5K miles or so. I did realize I was about 2K miles past my service. I was told the warranty would not cover engine because I was over the recommended mileage and to even be considered under warranty I would need to produce receipts for all service done on the car. My husband changed the oil the past three times and I did not have any receipts. I was then told warranty is null and void. I mentioned I received a letter a week earlier from Kia stating a known issue with the engines and the warranty had been extended. He said provide receipts where your husband changed the oil.I contacted the owner of the dealership, he owns 5. Supposedly, he was out of town for a week and I was told the GM would call me. I never received a phone call from anyone. Needless, to say I traded within a few days.

The other day I incurred a major engine problem in which I found out that now it's notable enough that KIA  just sent out a mass mailing stating that if you hear the engine knocking there could be problems with the Block, Crankshaft, Bearings, Connecting Rods and or Pistons. They describe it as ( This letter does not announce a service Campaign that requires mandatory repair on all vehicles. ) Another way of saying there will be no re-call. So if you have or get this problem with your KIA Sorento good luck. I am now in the process of finding out what they are going to do.

There are only two areas I consider this vehicle lacking.  Number one is driver legroom.  I am well over 6 foot tall and getting older.  I cannot move my legs to relieve the arthritis pain in my knees.  The other thing is that it is a 4 cylinder engine.  It does a very adequate job but I reckon it is that muscle car thing from my youth.  I do not feel that it accelerates as quickly or easily as I would prefer.

2931, on 06/13/16 09:47 AM (PDT),JVT ,2014 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Nice SUV," Only real gripe I have about the Sorento as equipped (LX FWD) are the low grip eco tires they put on it.  Being in the snowbelt, I should have gotten AWD, but the Eco tires are horrible in even light snow.   I'd expect an all season tire to at least get you moving when there's an inch and a half of snow on the ground.   Not so much.   I put some winter tires on and all is well again however.  The Sorento is roomy and has great cargo space and some hidden under floor cubbies in the cargo area as well.  Very handy when camping / moving and etc.  I'm averaging around 25mpg which I'm happy with given the Sorento's size.  The ride is smooth and comfortable, interior materials have solid fit and finish and are soft touch for the most part.  IP and center stack are very legible and usable.  Heated seats work well.Overall I'd say this is a solid soft roader SUV that has lots of cargo room and would recommend it.Update: 40K miles.  MPGs have dropped a bit.  Still seems to be holding up well and there aren't any new squeaks or creaks to report.  Interior materials are also still in like new shape.  Backup parking sensors have been on the fritz sporadically over the past 2 years.  Sometimes they just beep once when you put it in reverse indicating it won't warn you if you get too close to an object.   At other times, the beep will stay on the entire time you are backing up which is super annoying.  Had a rear control or sway arm replaced under warranty.  Can't think of any other issues or failures.Just replaced the front brakes at 41k miles.  Rears still have some life left as expected.Update: 55K miles.

I average 20-21 MPG in town.  Cons:-The 4cyl is gutless-Third row is not an aftermarket option - I got this car with hopes of adding because AWD and 3rd row are hard to find. -headlights could afford to be brighter.

I like the handling, the lack of road/wind noise, and all the extras that came with the LX model. Mine also came with the 3rd row seat package. The 3rd row is pretty small, but I love how the whole middle row can slide forward and back to give the 3rd row a little more room if needed. With that option, it makes having bigger people in the back a little more realistic. The 4 cylinder engine is surprisingly strong(though I haven't driven the V6) and it is enough power for most peoples needs. If price isn't a concern, obviously the V6 would be the way to go. As of now, I plan to keep buying Sorentos in the future. ",4.375

The auto dim feature of the instrument cluster makes it difficult and at times impossible to see speedometer needle.Kia says it is ""working as designed""""Kia cannot help you""It is bright with no problems at night/in garage and on cloud/stormy days.Since design features are not covered by warranty Kia America refuses to address the matter. 7 others have filed same complaint with National Safety Board.I must get rid of the car before i have an accident while trying to locate my speed.Also window shade rattles""no adjustment can be made"".Will be my last Kia.Update:  Unfortunately I still have the car but have saved enough to get an end of season 2016 or early 2017 of something other than KIA.   KIA claims there are no sensors for the speedometer needle.  However, wrapping the entire cluster panel leaving only a tiny hole to observe shows there to be a sensor somewhere but I am unable to find it.    It is not a reflection issue.   The car is unsafe to drive as I cannot see the speedometer needle on bright or sunny days.  In my opinion KIA is very unresponsive and not customer friendly.Update2   Unfortunately still have car ... issues have not changed.... finally have saved up enough for a 2017  and currently am car shopping...looks like I may go with Toyota.Update 3...Finally got rid of car...got a Toyota Highlander that I have no problem with reading the speedometer.   It is unfortunate that Kia chose not to address the issue and very very customer unfriendly.   Would not even acknowledge that there was a sensor controlling the needle.

Our 2014 Kia Sorento SX-L AWD is our second Sorento. Most of what we said about it in our earlier review still holds true.  We now (March 2018) have about 55k miles on it and the Sorento has performed nearly flawlessly.  For several months we have been having an issue with the starting button.  Sometimes you have to wiggle the shift lever to get the button to engage the starter.  The dealer has now had the Sorento three times in an attempt to fix this problem.  They have given  us a rental car this time and Kia corporate is involved.  Other than that, it is great as I said in our initial review, the Sorento is very feature rich and comfortable to drive.  Little features like the heated and cooled  front bucket seats have proven to be even more beneficial that we believed they would be.  I can give the Sorento an unqualified ""thumbs up"".  Also, the original equipment Kumho tires (at over 50k miles) still have not needed to be  replaced.We bought a 2011 EX V6 FWD in April 2010 and put about 60K (happy) miles on it.It had all of the available ""bells and whistles"" at the time but the new 2014 SX-L is a huge advancement in nearly every category. It is so feature-rich, comfortable, powerful and well finished that I think it beats the competition from Honda, Acura, BMW etc. for thousands of dollars less. Admittedly, this is the top of the line so the Nappa leather and panoramic sun roof won't be found on every model  Aside from the many features on the SX-L, I would strongly recommend the AWD version.  It really makes a positive difference in how the vehicle drives.  Update March 2017:  The Sorento continues to perform very well.  The factory tires are several thousand miles from replacement.  All of the many features continue to perform flawlessly.  I can recommend the Sorento without reservation.",5

This vehicle has the appeal for all age groups Stylish, roomy, handling, technology and smooth riding. I could go on I think you get the jest of it. Take one for a test drive for yourself. YOU will be IMPRESSED. Don't forget about the 20 year 200000 mile warranty.

Felt that the car offered many more options and features than some of the competitors pricing.   Overall, I would say I have not been satisfied with the Kia.  Have found some of the technology a nuisance.  For example, the caution warning goes on when the temp hits 39 degrees Fahrenheit.   Living in Vermont, this is quite normal and don't really need a warning on this.   Find the braking and handling not nearly as nice as the Buick Encore we replaced.   Overall, I think",3

It took 4 months for kia to get their crap together and take my car back for repair. Since I don’t have a Kia dealership where I live, they kept telling me to take it to a local dealer for diagnostics, but the local dealer couldn’t diagnose it without a Kia scan tool. And Kia doesn’t release their diagnostics programs until the warranties run out (forcing consumers to just go to kia). Ended up that the timing belt failed and it now needs a new engine. Their customer service is awful. I’m so disappointed in the quality of service and can not wait to be done with Kia",2

We purchased the vehicle from the Kia dealer with 2,400 miles on it...about 2 months later we started noticing problems. First, the shifting between 1st to 2nd is terrible. So bad that it jerks your head and throws any pets off balance that you may have in the car. It's embarrassing. Secondly, there is a very loud rattle coming from near the turbo. Thirdly, the vehicle will fail to start at random times. We've taken and left the vehicle at 2 Kia dealerships multiple times now, filed complaints, and not one single thing has been fixed or addressed. The dealers are writing us off, Kia customer service employs some of the rudest people we've ever had the pleasure of speaking with and they do not stand behind their vehicles or service at all. It's easier to tell you that everything is normal. So here we have a new Sorento with 24,000 miles that doesn't know how to shift between gears, randomly won't start, and can be heard rattling all the way up the street - but we're told that is all normal. Been fighting with the dealers for 2 years now over this vehicle, so much inconvenience and it's just ridiculous. We've narrowed the noise down ourselves to the Turbo. It's in the stages of turbo failure and in no way shape or form is a normal noise. It's only a matter of time before this vehicle sets dead in our driveway. We will never, ever, buy another Kia vehicle again because even if we did get a lemon, the lack of customer service has been astonishing. We DO NOT recommend anyone purchase a Kia vehicle.",1

When your going straight down the road and you move the wheel a very small amount there is resistance then you feel a click type release.

2991, on 01/17/17 03:00 AM (PST),John ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Sorento - Economical Luxury," Goal was to find a reliable, well appointed, 3 row, mid-sized SUV AWD to replace a 2000 Honda Odyssey (200K miles).  After considerable research I narrowed the search to a 2016 Kia Sorento 3.3V SX/SXL and the 2015/16 Toyota Highlander XLE. Test drove both a new 2016 Kia Sorento EX and a used 2015 Toyota Highlander XLE within minutes of each other. Was surprised the 2016 Kia Sorento had better ride as well as safety features not available on Toyota Highlander till 2017. With mid-sized 3 row SUV prices over $40K sought an under 20k mile used Sorento SX or SXL. Again Kia had the edge since the 2nd owner receives the balance of the 5 year, 60K bumper-to-bumper new car warranty vs the Highlander 3 year, 36K mile warranty. Was fortunate to find an under 20K 2016 Kia Sorento SXL AWD for $33.5K.  I am pleased to report that after 22 months and 23,000 miles of driving our Kia Soretno SXL the overall mpg is to 23.5. On only long trip from Boston to Washington D.C. the 2016 Sorento averaged an incredible 32 mpg in both directions.  As for the features love the incredibly quiet and smooth ride, 3rd row, large clean back-up camera, wife's favorite is the heaated steering wheel for cold winter morning short work drive. Other nice features include side mirror lane departure sensors, cross check sensors, heated and cooled seats (front & back), no hands tailgate lift, small turning ratio. Everyday wife drives and more and more pleased with this vehicle purchase. So far standard maintenance, there has been a few free manufacturer recalls. Only repair issue has been the panoramic sunroof tracking. Have had it grease when I first got SUV and then in -8F the roof wouldn't only close after manual intervention. Trip to dealer and found there is a manufacturer recall for this issue. I am absolutely delighted with this 2016 Kia Sorento SUV and I would definitely buy again if in the market.",5

2993, on 11/18/16 14:35 PM (PST),b.urban@outlook.com ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Nearly Perfect!! Great SUV witha few minor flaws., The value the Sorento offers is amazing. You really get a lot for the money when buying. However the biggest problem with KIA is the resale. We bought ours one year old with 20 thousand miles on it. It already took the big deprecation hit. A new highlander or pilot will be much better if you buy new and plan on selling in a few years. They also cost more out of the box. We have no intention on selling so resale isn't a big concern to us.   First I'll start with the engine. It is plenty powerful. We live in the south so we got the front wheel drive model. It really is overpowered for the front wheels. If it kicks down a few gears it will torque steer. Fuel mileage has been as expected. We average 23mpg between a mix of city and highway.  One of my biggest gripes are the brakes. When I am doing a lot of city driving the brakes do start to fade in stop and go situations. I can noticeably feel the pedal travel get further. Kia should have gave it a little bigger brakes from the factory.  The other gripe I have it the seat material. Ours has cloth seats and the material just isn't great. I do not believe it will hold up great over the next 5 or so years. Time will tell.                 Other than those gripes which are minor to me the Sorento is a great SUV. I tow a trailer which weighs about 2500 pounds and it takes it just fine. It is comfortable and easy to drive for extended periods.  The third row is usable. The highlander and pilot had more third row room but the Sorento's third row is fine and usable for children or small adults. I'm 5'8'' and I can sit back there fine. Anything over 5'10'' or so is going to run out of head room.  With the third row up there is very little room for storage.      Overall I am very happy and my wife and I love it. Very glad we chose the Sorento.,5

2998, on 09/15/16 07:13 AM (PDT),Laura ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV EX 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Kept my family safe in a serious collision!," Coming off of a Lexus RX, I was concerned that it wouldn't feel as luxurious. Although it's stiffer and less ""designed"", I fell in love with the Sorento immediately upon driving it off the lot. It's tough but not trucky, comfortable but not couch-like, and big but not cumbersome. It has great pick up and drives like a car, and I happen to think it looks pretty darn cute on the road. Having said this, the reason I'm writing this review is that I was in my first car accident in my 38 years just this week. I was T-boned, and before I knew what had happened I realized the car was flipping. SUV's by nature may be more likely to roll, and that may be a deterant to some, but in this instance I think it was a blessing. I believe the roll helped lessen the force of the hit, which struck my child's door. As I understand it, T-Bones can be very catastrophic, especially to the person in the receiving seat. Between the airbags, restraints, and general contour of the car, when the car came to rest we were completely unscathed. Completely. The moment I can, I will go get another Sorento and will feel safer than ever. And thank you to the designers of this car for helping me walk away with my son!",5

The Sorento has gotten more things just right than any vehicle I have ever owned. The push button start works perfectly, headlights give you the right options, controls layout is excellent, the ride/handling balance is very good and the engine and transmission perform flawlessly in sync. The engineering to get the amount of space and passenger capacity in a vehicle only 187 in. in length is a real accomplishment. Most other competition is 7 to 10 in. greater in vehicle length. With this space efficiency, comes weight savings and the strong V6, so it has good performance for a vehicle in this class. We got 24.7 mpg on highway trip.

I had had my mind set on a GMC Terrain, but there is no comparison, not even close.  Our Kia is so quiet yet so powerful.  There are no more bumps in the road, and it handles almost as well as my Honda Accord did.  It came with third row seating, heated leather seats, the back-up camera, lane warning, and power liftgate, all of which i strongly recommend, oh, and all those electronic thingies.  With the flat folding rear seats the cargo space is huge, and they are easy to operate.  It has a power passenger seat and even the second row reclines (separately left and right).  Our ride from NJ to Maine was actually enjoyable, plus we got 25 mpg at 80 mph!  We put $5000 down and are leasing at only $300/month for 36 months.  With 5000 lb towing capacity it will be a breeze towing our boat up to Maine in July.  We are thrilled with our decision.  Gotta deal with Tom Brennan at Sansone Jrs. in Neptune, NJ.",5
3004, on 06/07/16 16:06 PM (PDT),Chainplate ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV Limited 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Over The Top for A Cheap Import," I should probably wait to write a review as I've only had the car for a couple of weeks and haven't driven it that much (I think it still has less than 500 miles on it).  Regardless, I'm delighted with the car as it handles and performs far better than I expected it would.  There are places where the fit isn't what a top-tier car should be but, then, it's not a top-tier car.  However, from someone who has owned 8 Mercedes-Benz, this car performs right up there.  Some of the things I especially like:1.  The Hyundai Lambda engine is an excellent match for the car.  It's very responsive and the relatively high butt gears gets you off the line with a nice snap.  No, this isn't a muscle car V8 but for a small SUV, it's damned decent.  I don't complain about the fuel economy though my children might disown me for not buying a hybrid.2.  Exceptional braking with virtually no loss of control - even in hard braking maneuvers.  Granted, I'm not too aggressive with the brakes right now as I'm letting them 'break' in gently but the car still stops in a very short amount of distance.3.  The navigation/entertainment center is very easy to use - it all makes sense.  I've owned cars where I was continually searching through the manual to figure out, ""How do I make it do . . . "" whereas on the Kia, it's easy to find the features I'm looking for.  Even the more esoteric features that aren't used much, they're easy to find.  The sound system is excellent.4.  I absolutely love the self-leveling, HID headlights.  Since I'm an old man, my night vision isn't what I'd like it to be.  With these headlights, I can see everything in front of me clearly.  Good news for you who drive near me at night!5.  Consumer Reports rates the car as having an excellent frequency of repair record.  I'm hoping they're right.6.  I like the looks of the car.  Subjective, I know, but it's better than driving a car that I think is ugly.7.  My brother-in-law, who likes to point out everything what's wrong with everything I do, said that KIA stands for 'Killed in Action'.  Actually, Ki is Chinese for energy (sometimes transliterated as 'Qi').  They added the 'a' to stand for 'Asia', despite the fact that the car is built in the USA.  Now that I own one, I see them all over the place.There are three things that I don't like about the car:1.  No Day Time Running Lights.  I could turn the headlights on during the day but that leads me to Dislike Number 2.2.  There's no warning chime, buzzer, etc if you leave your headlights on, shut off the engine and open the door the door.  I think that's been a feature on virtually every car made in the last 40 years!  Granted, the electrical system will shut down everything if the voltage gets too low - nice feature - but that's hard on batteries if you like to have the car lit up during the day and aren't warned that you're leaving your headlights on.3.  Our trim line uses a hard, black plastic for parts of the steering wheel, the window control trim and the center console.  How much could have it cost to do those pieces out of a nice wood?Okay, two years later and I still love the car.  Granted, we only have about 14,000 miles on it but we have yet to have a failure of any kind.  We have the oil and filter changed every 4,000 miles and the dealership only charges $40 and they do a complete inspection at the same time.  Tires show virtually no wear but the right rear tire has a very slow leak - it loses about 5 psi every two weeks which is not a big deal but kind of a pain in the ass.  Other than that, though, I remain as enthusiastic about the car as I was when we first bought it.",5

I have 2000 miles on it since it was leased and I love it. the interior materials are not cheap but very soft and rich looking. the controls while incorporating touch technology still have a lot of buttons and dials which I personally love. great sounding satellite radio and the noise level from outside is minimal. I have the 240 horse turbo and was concerned with the low milage epa estimates for the car thinking I would be lucky to get 22-23 miles per gallon. I changed the selection for the engine to echo mode when I drove it home and it has been there ever since. I have the awd and I have consistently averaged 25 + miles since new. I have not had any lack of power in this mode and will continue to leave it there. back seats very roomy and had three adults back there going out to eat the other night with no issues. back storage area very large also. another nice feature which I haven't had to use yet is the locking hub mode for deep snow etc. great car at a wonderful price.,5

Not a small 4 cylinder econo box and not as big as a the full size 7 passenger SUVs, just right for usually 5 passengers with option to flip up to get 7 seats. Ride is quiet and comfortable. Visibility is good. Technology works well with clear displays and easily understood controls. The only minus is the steering. It is way too loose. We have to always select the sport option or the Kia wanders on the road. Overall a great buy.",5

3011, on 05/08/16 07:52 AM (PDT),Jason ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Kia Built a Winner - Great Value!," Updated after 22 months - Again the Sorento isn't terrible, it's just been alright.  We've tired of a few issues, passenger door rattle, transmission smells like it's burning up on hills at low speeds and the low beam headlights are terrible.  Resale value is disappointing we recently started looking around and have been told by 3 dealers it's trade in value is in the 18.5K range.  Pretty for less than 2 years old, less than 20K miles and an original sticker of 36 ish.. in any case once we get through the holidays we're probably going to change it out with a Pilot.Updated after 10 months -  Bottom line - The Sorento is still a quality ride.  My biggest knock is the UVO electronics has had to be reset several times after locking up and the KIA service department we've dealt with SUCKS!  At 5K we took this vehicle in for a front passenger door rattle and were lectured by the service manager about how if they find a penny or something similar in the door we'd be charged $105 per hour for repairs.  In fact if they found nothing we'd be charged for their troubleshooting time.  After dealing with GREAT hassle free Honda service it blew my mind how the KIA service manager treated us!  Just can't beat Honda service, pretty sure we'll go back to a Pilot or maybe scale down to a CRV in 2018. ORIGINAL REVIEW - This Kia is a really nice mid-size SUV!  I'm a Honda guy, my daily commuter is still an Accord.  My wife is the primary driver of the Sorento and it replaced our 08 Pilot.  We really research major purchases like this to death and tried out most of the SUV's in this class, minus the luxury brands.  It took us 2 months to make a decision and it came down the Sorento and the Pilot.  I honestly don't think we'd have went wrong either way but after 3 months of ownership we're still happy with the Sorento.  We love our LX but our only regret is going cheap with the LX.  In hine sight the larger touchscreen, some of the active safety features and the fog lights would've been well worth the extra cost.  We'll probably drive this Sorento for 2 or 3 years and upgrade, probably only looking at the Pilot and Sorento at that time.  Things I like about the Sorento:  Power, the V6 is a beast.  Comfort, very comfortable passenger compartment.  Front and middle row are every bit as good as the Pilot, third row comfort goes to the Pilot but we don't use the third row much.  Fuel economy is pretty good we're right around 24 mpg overall.  Quiet, comfortable ride.  The warrenty is huge, it was the deciding factor in our decision.  The only knocks:  Small infotainment screen, this is my fault for going cheap.  Lack of storage when using the third row.  Overall we're very happy with this Sorento!",3

This vehicle is quiet and smooth as a babie's behind. We have the 3rd row (for emergencies) but the seats are folded down. The back is huge. Maybe not as big as the Pilot, but neither is the car itself. All I can tell you is to go take one for a drive. They range in price from $25k - $45k. Mine is the LX V6 AWD with convenience package and 3rd row seat. MSRP was $33k. They have several incentives like active military, veteran, student and combinations. Your mileage may differ.",5

The car is rated higher than the rest in safety & reliability and has a far better warranty as well.  The comfort and passenger room in the front seat is far better than the other brands.  My wife did all of the homework, drove and rode in all of the other brands and Kia got the sale.  If you don't believe it, go drive one and see.  Now we have 6,000 miles on the Kia 11/3/16 and all is well, my wife still loves it.  Have had it a year now and there are things I don't like.  I don't like the console opening from the front instead of from the drivers side.  If you try and get anything out of it while driving, it's difficult.  I really don't like all of the electronics they put in cars these days.  I am really tired of having to break out the manual to find out how to change the clock or do most anything.",5

The EX is so quiet and comfortable I can drive 800 miles and still go dancing!  To date I have had zero problems with this car.

The styling is great, the car just sounds solid when closing the doors, and the thought Kia put into the design shows throughout. We went with the top model and the extras that brings makes long trips really enjoyable.  I have driven Sorentos as rental cars over the past 7-8 years but vowed I'd never own one due the the fairly harsh ride. But the 2016 is a true game changer!!

Looks great and drives great. This new remodel turns heads. Everyone on my block and at my kid's school has been asking about it. Sharp looking interior, well thought out with lots of cargo space plus additional storage bins underneath. Rear back-up camera, bluetooth, UVO services (voice command), heated seats, AWD, parking sensor, USB ports everywhere, power adjustable driver's seat and many other bells and whistles. Compared to Explorers, Highlanders and Pilots, you get so much more bang for your buck plus a far better bumper-to-bumper and powertrain warranty.

3023, on 03/25/16 13:56 PM (PDT),Dick ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV L 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),My sassy AWD SX Limited 2016 Kia Sorento," I have never purchase a new vehicle so quickly.  I have been driving a 2010 SRX Cadillac Premium Collection for five years.  Who would have ever thought I would buy a KIA SUV?!  I went to the dealership to drive the Volvo (which I literally hated) but I had done some internet research on the 2016 Sorento so when the salesman said you really need to drive the Sorento, I said ok.  That's all it took, I fell in love with this automobile.  The quality of the interior with it's Napa Leather and the ease of the instrument panel and the large viewing screen and the beauty of the drive won me over at once.  Now all I had to do was decide just what I wanted and the trim package, the color Titanium was a given.  Well I wanted it all ....a SX Limited.  The dealership had to locate one in Missouri.  It was exactly what I wanted color trim etc., and lo and behold when it arrived it had several other perks, like a tow package, gorgeous side steps, remote start, cross bars and several niceties.  People said you are going from a Cadillac to a Kia and my reply is hell yes.....it truly is a much better car, much more comfortable, the seats are the most comfortable I have ever had and the black and white interior is stunning.....people can't get over the look and quality.  The visibility out the front windshield is vast with very minimal blind spots.  There are so many bells and whistles on this car I couldn't begin to comment on all.  Let's just say, it's right up there with the Lincoln MKX (much cheaper), BMW, and other luxery vehicles.  I read this was Kia's goal to put forth an SUV that would possibly attract these luxury car drivers to the new Sorento and yes that's exactly what is happening.  I have been driving mine for two weeks and I'm still so much in love with it's gorgeous body stye and all it's safety and wonderful amenities along with the quite, high quality interior.  The ease of the voice activated navigation and the very simple bluetooth hands free telephone along with the Xeon lighting, the full panoramic sun roof, the roomy storage, the thrill of having an actual spare tire (Cadillac had a pump), the very peppy takeoff and getaway, the quietness of the ride on highway and the nifty red and blue lights on the interior at night make this very quick purchase of the 2016 Sorento one of the happiest and best decisions I've ever made.",5
3024, on 03/24/16 19:20 PM (PDT),Sorentina ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),"Lots of good, some things to work on"," Had my LX V6 over a year now.  Great ride. Nice finishings. Gas mileage almost always EXCEEDS the 18/26 posted.  On highway, I usually get about 30 mpg- wirh a V6 engine!  Car insurance is starting to go down but it can be pricier than other SUV in its class. Something to keep in mind.Driver seat is nicely shaped but slightly firm.  The wing-up edges can pose a challenge for those with mobility issues requiring help getting into the 2 front seats.  Plenty of leg room in the front and back.    I enjoy driving it a lot but I have a list of a few things KIA could do to really spruce things up:1.  Please add adjustable brakes.  Brakes are a little mushy if you're a light-footed breaker.   2.  Please, please PLEASE add the option to silence that annoying alarm that rings when it's 40F outside.  It's annoying and startling at times!!3.  It's hard to wash the top of the back window with that fin in the way- esp with the squeegee.  Can that fin be reshaped or removed?4.  It's annoying that you can't change the radio station when the backup camera is on.  Really?!  Also, with the wheel radio control, you can only change the radio position one station at a time.  Would be nice to be able to hit the button 4 times and actually go up or down 4 presets.5.  Please, please, PLEASE, KIA add the Global Open-Windows feature to the remote.  It would be a god send for people like me with heat intolerance.  PLEASE!!!6.  Daytime running lights on L, LX models, please!7.  Would appreciate a rubber cargo mat for 7-passenger cargo area when seats are folded down rather than the less-than-helpful carpeted cargo mat available.8.  Automatic up and down driver window feature is nice but it takes a lot of finessing to adjust the auto-down if you need interrupt it.9.  UVO system is OK on LX- nothing spectacular.  KIA- please make the 7""/8"" navigation system standard.The Sorento is a good value and a nice drive, despite my little nit picks.  But I think it's the little things that separate good cars from the great ones.  Sorento is not a disappointment but a good car that has the potential to be a really great one with a little attention to details that make the driving experience even more of a pleasure.",4
3025, on 03/24/16 07:59 AM (PDT),Miel Sarr ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),3 Miles on Odometer," I started looking for cross over SUVs with the AWD, and a third row. I used to drive a 1996 Honda Accord LX (Manual transmission) I really wanted a Hyundai Vera Cruz but they stopped making the vehicle in 2012. Then I thought about the Mazda 5 (manual transmission) but it looked like mini-van car.  I ended up focusing on the Santa Fe and Mazda CX9. I got a consumer report magazine and added the Outlander and Sorento to my research radar. In concert with a good friend I test drove all vehicles 3 months before I purchased. My friend road in the back while I test drove and used a check sheet to document wind noise and backseat comfort ability etc. By the end of the day I narrowed it down to the Mazda and the KIA.  I purchased a 2016 LX Sorento with 3 miles on the odometer.  The ride is smooth, I feel like I am riding in luxury without paying the price.  The vehicle is not too big and able to do all the things I need it to do.  Cargo room is great; however not when the third row is in use.  I only have two issues the Bluetooth tends to spike in volume when a call comes in and that can be startling EVERY time and I never feel completely confident when parallel parking.  I feel as if visibility is limited.  I am overly satisfied with my purchase and the price.  I may consider upgrading to EX in a few years.******Update*****Its been nearly two years and I am still very pleased with my vehicle.  I have a little over 10k on the odometer and it is in tip top shape.   I have no complaints and highly recommend this vehicle to those who are looking for more bang for their buck.  I am exponentially pleased.********Update**********Its been nearly three years and I really can't complain.  I did have an issue but it was resolved please see below:I had my vehicle serviced in December 2017.  I had to return to Yonkers Kia dealership in January of 2018 because of a check engine light and dash error message appeared.  I was told that because the error did not appear when they checked the vehicle nothing was wrong.  I was instructed to take a photo of the error message and return if the light came back on again.  HUH? February 2018  it happens all over again, except this time I take a picture and return to the dealership.  I make an appointment on the Wednesday before the Saturday.  I even write in what issue I have with the vehicle using their appointment tool.  I arrive for Saturday 8:15 a.m. appointment  and I am told that Saturdays are reserved for service appointments and there are no technicians available to check my engine.  So between Wednesday and Friday no one called to tell me that I would have to bring my car in on a weekday.   I decide at that point to not return to Yonkers Kia who did not make it known that Saturday service appointments are reserved for routine maintenance i.e. oil changes.  I end up taking my vehicle to the dealer it was purchased from and lo & behold there was a December recall on the engine cap and guess what Yonkers Kia put as if the work was done but it had not been completed.  The original dealership had to eat the costs.",4

I drove nearly every similarly sized SUV in existence and nothing compares in terms of value.  I definitely recommend the V-6 version, its much more fun to drive and, I believe, much safer.  As an added bonus, I was treated like a human being at the dealership and it was a pleasurable experience compared to some to which I have been exposed.  If there is a downside ...it will probably take quite a while to master all of the technology in this car.Now two years into my driving experience with my KIA and I an still a fan.  The best thing is that everything works as advertised...the only thing I have had to do is keep up with the scheduled maintenance.",5

The car looks and rides like a $50,000 SUV, but at a fraction of the price.  I am typically drawn to European cars, but feel this car offers all the luxuries I am accustomed to with the backing of a 100,000 mile warranty. One additional selling point for me was the large amount of usable cargo space.  Many of the newer SUV's have a significant sloping to the back window, which is not practical for 3rd row occupants or dogs.  The Kia Sorento gives my 3 furry friends significant head room in the back. There is also an air conditioning vent in the 3rd row so my pups can stay cool.  My kids love the car too.  They have always been spoiled with their rides and this car is no different. We are very happy with the fit and finish of the car.",5
3028, on 03/20/16 08:37 AM (PDT),Jon ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Some Good and Some Not as Good," We’ve had the Sorento 14 months, and our impressions are some good and some not as good.  We have not had to take the car back to the dealer for a single problem--which is probably the single most important good thing about the vehicle.  It is a well built vehicle.First the good things:1. Love the body design and overall exterior and interior look of the vehicle.2. The ride is very smooth and quiet, with ample power for passing and hopping onto the freeway.3. Gas mileage is above what they rated it to be.  We’re getting over 25 mpg on highway and 21-22 in the city.    and that's in the 7 passenger, 6 cylinder, 3.3 liter SX 4. It has a very short turning-radius for that long a vehicle.5. There’s ample leg-room in all 3 rows of seats, but the headroom (with a sunroof) is a little too low in the 3rd row of seats.6.  I like the manual shifting capability.  It makes driving on winding mountain roads a lot easier on the brake pads.7.  The blind-spot warning and reverse warning systems work well to assist in driving.  The visibility when backing up is not as good as we'd like, so the backup camera and warning system help in that regard.8.  I like that the leg room along the ""hump"" (console area) next to your right leg is much better than in many of the other vehicles we test-drove--like the Nissan Murano and Infiniti  QX30.       Some of the not so good features are:1.  Entering and exiting the 3rd row seats is a slightly difficult.2.  The front seats are a little too firm, and the power lumbar is slightly noticeable even when fully contracted.3. The steering wheel position could be allowed to go lower and farther out.4.  I liked the CVT transmission on our traded in Murano, so I do miss that smooth, quiet shifting.",5
3029, on 03/19/16 07:18 AM (PDT),David ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV L 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Tight fun," I have test driven 4 different Kia Sorentos and I recommend skipping any of the 4 cylinder models.  I went over to the Nissan dealer after trying those models and almost didn't return.  The 6 cylinder is pure driving joy.They have a $32,000 model with the 6 cylinder, leather, satellite radio.. And no sun roof..  For me this model  would have been perfect except the radio really sounds lousy and it's virtually impossible to upgrade.  This is a $10,000 savings over other  similarly equipped three row SUVs on the market. Since I really care about my music I would've had to upgrade to the $38,000 model  which adds a panoramic sunroof gorgeous rims and larger tires plus an infinity sound system.The drive is very nimble and sporty while-being smooth enough for those of us who like a little tactile communication with the road.Other three row SUVs on the market feel much more cumbersome, heavy And over bloated by comparison:  while the 2016 Kia Sorrento feels lean, agile, youthful and fun to drive.It feels like a precision machine:  very well put together.",5
3030, on 03/17/16 20:37 PM (PDT),Dave ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV SX 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),Very Impressed New Buyer," Recently purchased a 2016 Kia Sorento SX after thorough review on this site and several others. Opted for the SX trim since we really wanted the UVO navigation package and other features that came standard at that trim package. Very impressed with the acceleration of the V-6 3.3L engine, smooth handling, and solid suspension.  I think that there is incredible value in this vehicle and that it compares favorably with luxury SUVs that command prices 10-20K higher. Of the very few criticisms that I've read regarding the 2016 Kia Sorento, one was the limited available interior space with the 3rd row. I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a mid-sized SUV that is not intended to constantly haul 7 people around but rather provides you the option of extra seating when you're in a jam.  Went for a test-drive at Cowboy Kia of Conroe and was very impressed. I was able to negotiate a great deal and am a highly satisfied customer and new Kia owner.",5
3031, on 03/17/16 18:38 PM (PDT),Rachel ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),A car that gives you peace of mind!," If I told you about the past three cars I had before my Sorento, you wouldn't believe my bad luck. I still walk out of the store and thank god ""Black Betty"" is there to greet me. We bought this car less than two weeks before moving across country. We went with two rows. Just my husband and myself, and a bunch of fur babies. We looked at every car out there. New/used. We stayed away from anything 45k and above. We had about 10k-12k to put down. Our options were open. Initially my husband test drove the Sorento. While I was impressed/size with the appearance I was favoring the sleek and sexy body/look of the Nissan Altima. Obviously the two cars aren't a like at all. We did need space. I went over the Pros and cons. I'll share them with you now. Pro: Space, the large trunk offers much more space than most SUV's without removing seats. The body is sexy, it looks nice. People are always caught off guard by the brand.The interior is really detailed. I love the two tone. Black and tan with tan seats and black carpets. Even the 4cl has some kick when you want it to move.It rides so smooth. Not as great as my Lincoln, but come on it was a Lincoln!Interface has many options to choose fromMode for gas: eco, sport, regularEase of getting in and out. My grandmother loved how you could just slip in and out. Many options for power, you can all have your devices plugged in at once. The seats are comfortable, you don't feel stiff and unable to move freely. The backup camera, something I never thought I would use, is very useful.Leg room for passengers is always a pro. The movement of the second row allows people in the backseat to relax and not feel stuck.Gas is pretty good. We drove over 4000 miles from South Carolina to Washington State, making stops in both Arkansas, and Illinois. That's not an easy drive in any car. With 6 animals. I wouldn't have chosen any other vehicle to have done it in. we got 27.8 miles per gallon. I'll take it. ---ConsThe wind with knock you over, no really if it's windy let off the gas. I feel like for a brand new car the headlights lack in visualizations. The speed on the windshield wipers is not up to par, in fact I consider them almost dangerously slow. The sound system could be better. I will have to have it replaced with a better system at some point. It's lacking in every way.(The Sounds system for years it seems on Kia models has come with issues, you have to reset it with a pin (pointed object, being inserted into a tiny hole) Or there will be no sound, from ipod's cd's ect..Front grill isn't east to clean. Took many car washes to get the bugs off of the grill. I spent almost $30.00 just trying to removed them. There is still residue. If you have pets HUGE annoyance ""You can't leave your keys in the car and lock the door, thus leaving the air on."" If your keys are in the car your doors will not lock. Auto lock doors. Great for when you run in a store and forgot to lock your doors, not great for when you run back into the house to grab your purse. Mostly the cons are dumb things that are more annoyances that come with learning more about your car. The first three are my only real gripes.Over all. I think we went with the best choice. The price was worth it. Not over priced, not over sized. I like the kia community. We have had a really great experience with out service provider. Our car is nice enough to feel luxurious, but not well known enough to be targeted. As silly as that sounds. When you're from Chicago you learn the little things are important. It's great that it can fit into small spaces, tow a camper, lug 25 2x4's. Or just move a family across the continental United States. It handles nicely, it rides better and smoother than most SUV's I've ever been in. Mostly I feel safe when I take her out everyday. Nothing feels better then knowing not only am I in a car with great crash test ratings, but if she breaks down Kia has my back. Take a chance, invest in a Kia.",5

That SUV is now one of the most sought after used SUVs in the market.  I love my Borrego and wish Kia would have continued the large SUV format.  At least this version of the Sorento is larger and has a substantial road presence.   I was torn between the new Pilot and this version but the warranty and past Kia performance convinced me to continue my Kia loyalty.  I hope the Teleride is released soon.....it looks like the awesome full SUV that Kia needs.,5

The Vehicle Suspension is very bad. Took to Dealer they said everything is fine as per specs. I noticed that the Vehicle is deteriorating very fastly. In Just 4 months - It shakes as if roller coaster and no suspension is there and too much vibration. Gear shifting is not smooth. Ride comfort is not there , Cornering is not good. and engine has become noisy. Also noticed Wind noise is not acceptable - it is getting worse now at 50 miles Wind noise is too much.I am already hating my vehicle within 4 months.----------------------------I own my 2016 sorento Lx for just one month now. Though I was very happy initially now I feel there are areas of improvement like air and road noise at higher speeds like 70 mph. And vehicle suspension is smooth but left-right bumpiness is too much that is annoying and continues for a long duration - I always owned sedan and this is first SUV so not sure if this is normal. Ride is smooth.3 Mirrors and rear view camera All have different zoom ratio which is very confusing and needs real improvement.Overall I am happy.I always owned Brand value cars like Honda. Trusting Kia as they have shown serious improvement. Hope they don't fail me on my first Kia. The warranty of 10 years 100k is what made me trust Kia.",3

Ive had the car for 9 months-no regrets," Go test drive and look at the SXL-I have the 2 row one, I didn't need 3 rows. I got the 2016 almost as soon as it came out after poring over many crossover reviews, test drives etc. I wanted as much in terms of features and comfort as I could get for a decent price.This was by far the best deal for the money I could find. VERY comfortable, great features- LOVE the heated steering wheel.Extremely sharp styling both inside and out.Mine is black on black and even in deep south, was very comfortable last summer in very hot weather. Only thing I didn't get was the very top technology package with the front camera-I do have the rear camera, lane change warning,cross traffic rear warning, navigation, blue tooth, satellite radio, huge sunroof etc. Many usb ports- first 2 oil changes/services very affordable.After suffering through Mercedes Benz after warranty services I will never get one of those German so called luxury vehicles again. A BMW or MB crossover suv with these features would've run about 30-40 thousand more and it truly looks just as good side by side and is wonderful to drive.",5
3037, on 02/14/16 09:51 AM (PST),Gene ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Hyundai Owner makes the Switch," I have had a 2010 Hyundai Veracruz replaced with a 2013 Santa Fe Sport Turbo.  Price drove me to Kia for the value.  I loved the Turbo in the Santa Fe and was worried about a non turbo 4 cyl Kia Sorento.   However price of a lease was the major factor.  I was ready to accept less as the Santa Fe Turbo had some very nice features.   To my surprise the 2016 Sorento has impressed me more than I could imagine.   First is it solid, totally.  Closing the doors it has the feeling of a tank. The ride is the best of all the Hyundai's by far.   The loose suspension of the Veracruz is gone and the somewhat hobby horse feeling of the Santa Fe Sport is gone.  I assume the longer wheel base is the reason.  It rides solid and smooth, the steering is tight and responsive.  Yes the 2.4 litre engine is not the Hyundai Turbo but it has what it needs to do the job.   The car is the LX model with the convenience package.  A great car at a very reasonable price  and we get more cargo space and leg room then the Hyundai.  I could not be more happy.   5000 miles later all is well. No Problems at all. Went to the dealer for a Oil Change and Tire Rotation and they performed 2 computer programming upgrades and a tail gate latch fix what was a problem on some but not mine.  I have finally have a complaint.  The AM radio section of the Radio is terrible.  I mean really horrible.Well we reached 15,000 miles with the Sorento.  With nothing really to report.  All systems working as new.  No rattles or squeaks solid and quiet as new.  Went for an Oil Change and a Tire rotation and the dealer replaced the tail gate latch as part of a recall.  it was working fine before so I was surprised about that.  Dealer also said it needed a wheel alignment again the tires were wearing evenly and it was tracking straight at 80 but I let them do it anyway.  And the AM radio still sucks.  Otherwise it is a great auto.",5

3041, on 02/05/16 07:59 AM (PST),M S ,2016 Kia Sorento SUV Limited 4dr SUV (3.3L 6cyl 6A),!!! MUST BUY !!!," I just bought a loaded 2016 KIA Sorento SXL with the Technology Package and the 3.3 peppy V6 . Having owned a Lexus RX before,  luxury SUV and KIA was simply not on my radar until I inadvertently came across an online article about this Sorento that piqued my interest. So after 18 hours of online research and watching YouTube video reviews, I was amazed to read the many glowing written reviews and hear the positive video reviews of this newly designed seven seat Sorento. A trip to the KIA dealer ensued and I am so glad to have went. This 2016 KIA Sorento SXL blew me away when I saw it up close and drove it. Rick Jacobs at Fucillo KIA knew this SUV  inside and out, he answered every question I threw at him.  With the Sorento's luxurious curb appeal, the way it handled, its numerous safety features, its voice activated navigation, long warranty and beautiful two tone ivory and black Nappa leather interior, I was hooked.After 6 months of driving my Kia Sorento, I am completely satisfied! It is everything I had hoped and expected this SUV to be. There have been no issues at all!!! Incredibly quiet cabin and comfortable Nappa leather makes driving this Sorento a pleasure.  Would definitely encourage others to buy this vehicle!!!My KIA Sorento is now a year old and still the BEST SUV I have ever purchased. Have had no problems whatsoever!This SUV continues to be the best vehicle I have ever bought. No problems at all and there is plenty of power when a pass is needed.Bought this KIA Sorento brand new in 2016 and would do it again!!!!! I am a perfectionist and this SUV has been flawless. Would recommend it to anyone considering the purchase of this vehicle. Oh wait....I did have one flat tire which the dealer promptly replaced at no cost. Seriously though, this KIA is everything I expected it to be and more.",5

The bolt broke while I was on the highway doing 65 MPH.  When I went to steer on to the on ramp, I had NO power steering and almost went off the road.  I had the car towed to the dealer and they told me the crank shaft bolt broke and I needed a new engine to the tune of $5000.00  I purchased the car used 6 months before for $8900.00 and there was less than 91,000 miles on it.

Dome light diode (whoever heard of such a thing), door lock actuator (never had one fail even in the GM garbage of the 70's and 80's), heater blend door actuator, and crankshaft angle sensor ($900 repair to replace shitty magnetic pick up, but buried in engine).  The sunroof plastic guide rail broke at 5 years with little use, so roof will slide but won't tilt.  Temperature gauge has never worked reliably, even after 3 trips to dealer when new.  I finally gave up as it wasn't important.  Factory replacement windshield wiper blades last only 18 mos!  Most of the problems are just annoying, but the crankshaft sensor problem is way too frequent...should have been a recall.Also, seat belt retraction springs are going bad.  The build quality on the new models looks worse, so it will be a Honda, Nissan, or Toyota next time.   I also have an 18 year old Infiniti with 70,000 miles, and have had less than one- fourth the problems!Update 8-22-16:  Valve lifter (tappet) now ticks if the car sits more than a day or two without being driven.  Not burning any appreciable amount of oil.  Gas mileage down to 15 mpg using the E10 fuel now sold here (was 16 mpg with 0-5% ethanol).  Have had to replace another failed electrical part, the A/C & heat temperature door actuator.  Got the Kia brand part on the internet for about $70, replaced myself so no labor cost.  Still driving the vehicle because it is much more comfortable to sit in (excellent leg room) than most others, and property tax is very low.  Overall impression of an average quality SUV remains the same.Update 2-23-17:  Replaced brakes and turned rotors at 58,000 miles.  No more vibration when stopping.  Have not experienced the crankshaft bolt/pulley failure but received notice of class action settlement regarding this frequent problem.  Tailgate lift struts no longer work.  Vehicle remains what I would term ""average"" quality, on par with most of the American products.  I keep driving it because the seating position and comfort remain excellent and the overall cost of ownership, even with some problems, remains low.Update 8-24-18:  No new issues in last year.  As I get older and have to deal with many increasingly obscure and complicated electronic gizmos (and no standardization of anything!), I appreciate the relative simplicity of this vehicle.  Comfort remains good and performance remains sluggish, but it has been reliable except for the aforementioned crankshaft sensor that most definitely should have been covered under a recall and/or fixed at no cost.  It is heavy (full frame), more durable, and safer than most of the similar new vehicles, resulting in a generous appetite for fuel!  Still, it's a keeper.",3

As I looked at getting a replacement vehicle, I had to ask why.  There is not a squeak or rattle.  It handles the way it did on day one, and I can still tow my 4-wheeler to northern Maine (250 miles one way) without a problem.  If you can deal with ""not great"" fuel economy, buy one.

I'm on transmission number 3 and the radio needed to be replaced after 9 months. The most aggravating thing is the alarm system which has a mind of it's own.

I addressed that with my local dealer and the problem was corrected and the skirting was repainted. I'd love better gas mileage (who wouldn't?) but think the powerful V6 is a fair trade.

No one tells you that you are under the severe schedule until you need the warranty.  Transmission failed at 38K.  Kia won't cover because we didn't have the transmission fluid changed at 30K per the severe schedule.  Normal schedule says look at fluid and replace if needed all the way to 105K.  No customer support!  No dealership support!  A private transmission repair shop states that the fluid is fine & that the failure is due to part failure.  Kia doesn't rebuild transmissions, they replace the whole thing and keep many in stock just for this reason.  I think Kia is trying to avoid a recall.  Wish superman would come to our rescue.

Overall I enjoyed the Spectra5, and it did pretty well with a rear collision at 50 mph. Pushed me into another car, so both the front and back ends got it, but neither crumpled that far. Safety-wise it did pretty good. The driver seat during the collision slid to the back and put me into a reclining position. Strange, but not a serious fault in my opinion. So, good on safety, brakes stopped me, but the Civic behind me... not so much.",4

A salesman talked me into test driving a Spectra 5. I was totally surprised at how quiet and smooth this vehicle was. Road noise was absolutely minimal! The great looking interior is very comfortable. All instruments and accessories are easy to use while driving. I drove this car cross country twice and it was very comfortable the whole way. The car is very stylish. I've had numerous people inquiring about it with great interest. My wife liked the car so much that I gave it to her and bought another one, identical to it!

I have the SX model which has the sport tuned suspension and it handles and feels like a sports car! I don't understand edmunds review about the motor. They say it gets noisy at high rpm, not mine!

Not many cars make me stop and give them a second look, but this one did.  Some quick reference checks and I bought it 3 days later.  Although I miss the room in my Caravan I have to say this is one of the most fun cars to drive.  Gas mileage has been just under 30 MPG in mostly city type driving but I know that will get better as it breaks in.  Although no car is perfect I haven't found any major items to complain about.  There has been some talk of Kia not honoring their warranty but you just need to maintain very through records if not serviced at a KIA dealer,",5

The features that this car offers are absolutely phenomenal.  I initially checked out other compact cars such as the Dodge Caliber, Toyota Matrix, Pontiac Vibe, and Nissan Sentra.  I have to admit that each of those cars left me desiring and seeking much more.  Then I decided to check out the Kia Spectra 5 and that was the best decision I could have made.  The car was everything I was looking for in a compact car.  The look was sporty.  The exterior quality was extremely obvious.  The interior was loaded with features that even some bigger cars and SUVs didn't have. Then came the drive.  I was sold and the car was mine.  Thank you Kia.",5

Mixed driving (city and 75 mph interstate) with AC on about 25% of the time. Mileage 30-32 mpg. May get better as it breaks in. Reasonable power for an econo car. Engine noisey when pushing beyond 3500 rpm, but under normal driving a very quiet, pleasant ride. Good fit and finish. No wind noise in the interior unless wind is really blowing outside (30+ mph). Suspension a little soft. Sounds like it is bottoming out when I hit a pothole. I intend to keep this car a long time. If it is reliable, this car is an excellent buy.",4.375

There are some slight noises through the cabin, but overall fit and finish is very good. The manual transmission is the way to go to get the most from the engine, though the clutch takes a little getting used to and rpms tend to hang a little per shift. Long strokes between gears, but a $90 aftermarket short shifter should allievate this problem. Great gas mileage thus far ,worst MPG so far 28.79 mpg on the first tank (best 33.06 mpg last tank 1806 miles).

It's not fancy, it's too old to have all the bells and whistles, but it has a great radio and CD player, climate control keeps me always comfortable, it's reliable and dependable, gets pretty good gas mileage, and gets me where I need to go every time. It holds two carseats in back, and a little person can fit between them, allowing me to transport four grandkiddos at a time. What more, really, does one need in a car? I love my little Spectra.",5

Never had an issue with this car and suddenly the transmission failed.  I have never owned a Kia, until now.  While I am disappointed in the lack of ""extras"", it is a simple car and what I could afford at the moment.  It has a surprising bit of get up and go.  I feel like I could pass anyone on the road.  Everything on the inside (radio, trip meter, lights, etc.) is very easy to find and operate.  I tend to think of it as a ""sleeper"" car because the acceleration is so awesome but it's just a simple four-door sedan. This would be a wonderful starter vehicle for someone.  I plan to keep the car for a year and build my credit, but if I continue to be happy with it, I will be a Kia owner after this! Side note, I bought this car from a Kia dealership and it was very clean and I was told the mechanic tore it apart and fixed what was wrong (which wasn't much).",4

I am pretty sure those 2 miles were put on by me in my test drive too. She now has 101K miles on her over 10 years and I can safely say this is the best car I've ever owned. Despite what the reviews seem to say here, my LX does have ac which has never once needed to be repaired, only recharged once. As for maintenance I have only had to do regular service, and, as long as you treat the car well, you'll most likely never have to do any advanced repairs for a long time to come.  This car is amazingly reliable and affordable. It also has more climate control settings than your average car that costs twice as much, with 9 fan speeds and many more temperature settings than any other car I've driven. I love it and have come to rely on it.",5
3234, on 03/04/17 21:18 PM (PST),Mr. Fox ,2008 Kia Spectra Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Love my Lil blue fox!," It's been the best car I've had in a long time. Never had even so much as a check engine light the whole time I've owned since it had 6 miles on it. On a straight freeway trip once I actually obtained 44mpg with cruise set. I was absolutely amazed! Even around town my fuel mileage in my Lil Fox is stupendous! She only eats a Lil bit and goes a long way on that. I can't speak highly enough of this vehicle! ( Maybe I just got a hold of a good one?) Regular service as needed, that's all. Never, ever left me stranded. Showing just a Lil bit of normal wear and tear, but still looking good. And most importantly, mechanically the best! I'm retired, this might very well be the last vehicle I may own. I'm sure it will be around for a long time with lots of love. *Update!* My lil fox just turned over 100,000 miles! Still doing wonderfully great. Even in the blasting heat of this summer she ran cool, no overheating problems! I can only say that it is a bit saddening that the Spectra model is no longer produced today.(The last year they made this model was 2009). If they still did, if I ever decided to trade up, it would be to the newer Spectra. Kia makes wonderful cars but the rub is that none of the newer makes/models can obtain the fuel mileage I can achieve with my Spectra to this day. As long as my lil fox will answer the call of my key, I will keep her. She always takes me where I need to go, without hesitation, summer, winter, anytime. Kudos to Kia for the Spectra!",5
3235, on 06/24/16 13:32 PM (PDT),C.B. Dunlevy ,2008 Kia Spectra Sedan EX 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 4A),BEWARE!!! Engine dies - Steering wheel locks!," ■ 2016 April 23	I brought my car in for the regular “The Works” package maintenance to Kia of Dayton.  Thereafter, my car ran a little rough.  I did not think much of it until my car began “pausing/hesitating” as I drove it. ■ 2016 May 25	I was driving to an interview and thought the car was going to die on the highway.  My car has never behaved like this; and, again, this was after the most recent routine maintenance on April 23, 2016.  In addition, sometimes when I put on the brakes, the car stops and then lunges forward.  This does not happen all the time; it happens intermittently.■ 2016 June 10	I had my two twin granddaughters in the car.  We met my husband for lunch and then went to Kettering Hospital to visit a relative.  While driving in city traffic (going approximately 35 MPH), I gradually applied the brakes to stop at a stop light.  When the light turned green, I realized that the engine had died.  This concerned me as this has never happened.■ 2016 June 13	I brought my car in to the dealership and described what was occurring.  A diagnostics was performed and the car was driven.  The Tech advised that nothing showed on the diagnostics and that when the car was driven, no issues occurred. ■ 2016 June 18	I drove from my house to the local grocery and back to my home.  As I went to make a right-hand turn from, I gradually braked, made the turn and then realized the engine had died because my steering wheel locked!  I had the air conditioner on, the radio on and was singing to it, so I did not hear the engine die.  Further, because I could not steer, I went into the other lane and thankfully, no one was in the lane or I would have hit them.  In addition, if someone would have been behind me, they would have hit me as they would not have expected me to turn and suddenly stop—especially since I did not have my foot on the brake after I turned. ■ 2016 June 20	I took my car back in to Kia of Dayton and reported the June 18, 2016 incident.  I told the tech that I was very concerned about these incidents and relayed that I considered these to be very dangerous and life-threatening.  I also called the Fixed Operations Director, and relayed that my car has been running rough since I got it back on 4/23/2016, feels like it is pausing/hesitating when I drive it; died while I was driving it without warning on 6/10/2016. (I had put on the brake for a stop light and did not know it had died until I tried to accelerate.)  I advised that the diagnostics done on 6/13/2016 did not produce anything and that I thought maybe all of this was just  an odd happening, so I continued to drive the car.  On 6/18/2016, when I was right turning, the car died and the steering wheel locked and that I considered these incidents to be extremely dangerous and life threatening.I called the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and provided information regarding this issue.  I wrote the Fixed Operations Director a letter documenting the incidents and my concerns and noted that I had copied the NHTSA.2016 June 22	the tech called and said that they ran another electronic diagnostic and have driven the car over 50 miles and nothing shows up on the diagnostic and they cannot reproduce the incidents.  I reiterated that I do not feel safe driving the car.  I asked if any of the incidents were recorded in the car’s memory.  No.  I asked if the sensors in the car were able to record things like this.  No.  So, the sensors are not sensitive enough to record such incidents.  I asked him what might cause the car to pause/hesitate while I am driving and he said that it might be the spark plugs.  I asked if he checked these and he said no as that would mean that they need to tear apart the car to check these.  I also asked about the fuel filter and the same thing applies.  He said that tearing apart the car and looking at it will cost me.2016 June 23	I called and left a message with the Fixed Opertions Director around 12:30 pm advising that I would like to speak to him regarding my car.  Since I did not hear back from him, I called Kia of Dayton and asked for the corporate office # and was given 1.270.783.8080.  I called and spoke with a woman named Tricia.  I explained to her what was going on with my vehicle and she suggested that I call and speak with the General Manager of Kia of Dayton. I called Kia of Dayton and spoke with the General Manager and conveyed my concerns about how serious these incidents are.  He offered to do a trade in with me. Unbelievable.  I advised that I am the only owner of this vehicle, that she has run fine until 4/23/2016. I am currently waiting for Kia Corporate to look into all of this as an internet search documents that the issue of Kia's suddenly dying while being driven goes back to at least the 2001 models.  Query as to how many ""accidents"" have occurred that were attributed to a driver when it was a product failure!  BEWARE!!! And, I love my car.... :-(",4

My tires wore out at 27000 miles to the wear bars even though I kept pressure monitored closely and rotated according to recommendations, but you know how the new car new tires are worse mileage than the ones you replace them with!

I never had a problem with it until the day an SUV coming at me in the opposite lane was hit by a car that ran a stop sign, lost control, came into my lane and wiped me out.  My Spectra was totaled.  Although I was happy with my Spectra, I went to CarMax to see what else was out there.  I drove a half a dozen cars or so, and nothing was better than what I had.  I purchased another Spectra and have been very happy with it.  I must have gotten a good one because I routinely get just over 40 miles to the gal.

It has a ton of trunk space. Inside is roomy enough for four people.  It has a lot of extras you would not expect such as  place to plug in ipod, sturdy cup holders including ones in back seat, CD player, etc.  What I found amazing was that this car had all these extras but cruise control is not standard.

Very quiet engine at highway speed of 70 or at idle (wondered if in was running while waiting at a stop sign). The finish and fit is excellent.

The driver's seat curves up sharply jabbing into your rear end.  I'm not a skinny guy, but by no means large either.  But the real disappointment is in the 23 mpg avg I'm getting.  Mostly highway, this is very disappointing in a car this size.  Now one nice thing is that the controls are easy to reach.  Second, this car really has some kick.

I drove every make and model out there and could find nothing else that I was more comfortable in or satisfied with than the Spectra, so I promptly purchased another one and have not had, even for a second, any regrets.

Quality of the major Korean brands has improved markedly over the last 15 to 20 years and they are almost on par with the major Japanese brands. The ride is surprisingly smooth and quiet. Engine power is adequate but no ""ball of fire"". Handling is ok but this is no sports car.  This is a great first car for a teen or a second car for getting around town. With rebates the selling price of this car was $14,200 + TTL vs. a list price of $16,700.  That is a strong price vs. what late model used cars are selling for without the strong factory warranty.

Most of the miles so far are on the highway (with the A/C on) and I have consistently obtained 34+ MPG, with the maximum so far being 37.8 MPG. The vehicle handles very well on the highway, but can be a bit awkward at low speeds. Does not handle turns very well, even at low speeds. Feels like the car is going to rollover if you take those curved exit ramps at more than 30 to 35 mph. But overall, considering the price, I am a very satisfied owner.",5

The 2.0 liter engine can get up and go although the engine gets kinda load over 4000 rpm. I get greats gas mileage, sometimes close to 38 mpg on the highway at reasonable speeds (80 mph or less).

The 2.0 with a manual is peppy, the engine is all but unnoticeable until 4k rpm (About 80+ in 5th), and with all the convenience features I got, makes me feel like I got a great deal. Gas mileage has been 22ish (city) thus far, but I only have about 150mi on her right now, and by all accounts mpg gets much better as it breaks in.

In the past 3 years I've put on over 75000 miles and have had to do very little maintenance. But I don't feel safe in it at all - the littlest gust of wind tosses it around - not fun on highways during blustery blizzards! I actually had a panic attack while driving it through the W.V. mountains (Talk about a very long trip!) I get about 31 mpg most of the time and with the miles I put on, that's a definite bonus.",3.875

Yeah, it took four return trips to the dealership (175 miles away, ouch!) but eventually the throttle body was replaced under warranty.  Honestly, if you follow routine service and don't treat it like a red-neck stepchild, you should get many years of good use out of it, just like any other car. ",4.375

I have been greatly surprised and pleased with it.  The equipment on it for the money was a very good value and the factory stereo has surprisingly good sound.  It has a good amount of storage for things like sunglasses and cd's.  This baby will turn on a dime, and after 53,00 miles handles well, and drives and rides well compared to higher priced cars.  2 trips from Kansas City, MO to Fort Knox, KY and a trip to Akron Ohio and all I've had to do is change oil and tires.  No mechanical issues at all which surprised me.  A great little car for the money. ",4.375

The car is fun to drive and has actually held up pretty well for a car of its price range. However, this baby was in the shop 8 times for a throttle problem. The first 7 times they said the problem was the throttle positioning sensor and it was replaced, reset etc.  We were fairly irate because they would reset the sensor and it would be fine for about 3 weeks then it would have no power at all and I was getting 14 mpg - yep I said 14!  Finally, they changed the whole throttle body and components.  We also lost a bolt out of the flywheel, and they had to remove a chunk of foam from the back door so we could roll down the window.Tomorrow I am buying a Ford! Seriously!",2.875

I have had the transmission replaced twice. The rotors have been chewed up by the brake pads and they weren't even 60% used up and the dealership didn't want to cover that one. They say more than 50% and it's not covered. After haggling with them, they FINALLY agreed to replace the rotors, which I'm not sure they did, because 10 months later, I am needing new ones again. They put that they wouldn't cover rotors any longer in the computer last time there was a problem, so now I'm hung out to dry. The pads are AGAIN about 60% used. The driver seat replaced due to springs popping out of it, the seat belts replaced for not working properly, and much more.",2.5

I only have 1200 miles and I'm going to have to replace the ground effects.  I've contacted KIA and the regional manager won't replace the part which is going to cost 365.  I think they should reconsider this because the car hasn't been driven abusively or in any manner of the performance range of this type of vehicle.

But more important was it's tight corner handling and spunky acceleration. You have to know that handling depends a lot on the quality of tires.

And it gets 35mpg without the AC running...about 30mpg with it on through all ranges of driving. During the winter I take out the AC relay, in the under-hood rely box, to prevent the AC from coming on when I turn on the windshield defogger/defroster. I wish there was a switch to turn it off from the inside. The warranty was useless, due to the dealership, There was a broken middle air register when I bought it and it's STILL broken.

Not the best gas mileage, but definitely for the price.  I'd have to say this is the best sedan under $15k that you can find.

Never really paid much attention to the Spectra.  Was looking at Toyota and VW and Honda.  I fell in love with this car. My husband has an Accord, loves my car better.  Both cars are garage kept and when my car is parked in the garage beside his, it doesn't even look like a compact car.  I would recommend this car to anyone not just first time buyers.  Because I'm not a first time buyer and I will get another Kia when it is time for another one.  Now my husband wants a Kia.  And you get all of that bang for your buck.

You will NOT be able to trade this vehicle in at ANY point in its life.  Ask ANY other dealership than a Kia dealer.  I was guaranteed that I could trade this car in after a year, went back to the dealership and they wouldnt do it, depreciated almost $10,000 in 1 year! More than half the cost of the car! If I could do it over again I would buy a Toyota or a Honda; better gas mileage (don't expect over 25 highway on this car) and better reliability.

Since I don't drive in the city that much I don't know what that's like. Its got a decent stereo and enough room in the back. Trunk is spacious and a great value over all.

Front seats are tiring for a long drive as there is no thigh support. Plus if you are tall or have long feet this is not your car. Interior is pleasant and quiet. Engine is mostly smooth once you are up speed. Tire noise is noticeable. The seats are comfy -- thigh support. Keyless entry is a great option and the remote trunk is great.

I have to laugh when I see commercials for all the 'most bought' and 'most reliable' cars, still 'on the road after 10 years' etc and I think of all the recalls all of the big automakers constantly have.

Regular oil changes every 3k miles, tires and gas are all the money I've put into it, and it runs beautifully in every condition - snow, ice, 110* heat, torrential rain (that's St. Louis weather for you).

A bolt apparently vibrated loose and after six days in the shop with nothing done I am told that it is not under warranty because this problem is ""Human error."" I have never had an alignment on the car yet that is what is being blamed for the problem so Kia has decided that they will not cover the repair. The tech stated that this part ""Never comes loose on its own"" so ""I must have done something wrong."" I am furious with Kia and will never purchase another car from them if they do not make this right. I have 2 warranties on this car and this is the response I get from them.Shameful service",3.125

I have had no major issues with the car just I have done standard maintenance and only thing that I have replaced are headlights, tires and windshield wipers. Easy to control in tight spots. It still has the standard radio system which works well including the aux input and cd player. Really like having sunroof makes the car feel more open. Only complaint would be the clear coat which has started peeling.",4

It was priced to move since the brand new 2010 Forte was hitting the market. If I could have afforded to spend more I would have likely gone with the Honda Fit. Imagine my surprise 8 years later that my Spectra is still going strong with no major issues. It has proven to be an enjoyable car that is darned reliable.,5

Contrary to other reviews I get excellent mileage on my KIA.I commute 55 miles one way to work, I have gotten anywhere from 30-38 mpg depending on my driving habits (if you know what I am saying ;)).My in town mpg is even better, I regularly get 40+ mpg and have had as high as 52mpg in town.

There were no major issues and it was an overall awesome car.Unfortunately, I got into an accident a couple of months ago where someone hit my front right wheel/door side head on. I was going about 40-50 and he had just pulled out, so I'd say about 15 or so. The damage didn't look too terrible except that the wheel and door were bent inward, the center dashboard popped out, and the passenger airbag broke the windshield (no glass was actually shattered).It turned out that the frame ended up being twisted inside along with the other problems I mentioned which totaled it out.

I love that I've got an auxillary jack and I love the hidden charger in the middle console. It helps keep wires out of the way, and you can set your MP3 player or iPod/iPhone inside to keep it from sliding all over the car.

No problem merging into fast freway traffic or running 2-3 hours at turnpike speeds. Haven't tried it in snow but it is okay in torrential rains.

Good stuff: Peppy performance, great gas mileage; cool, intuitive dashboard controls; comfy seats (easy on my sciatica); solid warranty; roomy trunk; stylish, at least to my eyes.

My expectations were pleasantly met in getting behind the wheel of this great little economy car.  For my Cash-for-Clunkers allowance for a 1999 Isuzu Trooper and my Hyundai trade-in, I drove away in my KIA Spectra EX for $10,000, including tax, title and registration.

Plenty of pep and super-quiet for the mondo freeway driving I do. Amazing fuel economy. Forget the EPA rating, I get 34mpg in mixed driving with the AC on most of the time! Picked it up for less than $11,000, with AC, CD and auto included. Lots of room, both front and back seats. Yes, the exterior and interior are simple, plain vanilla. I like that; pragmatism rules. And I'll agree that this is less solidly made than a Toyota. But for $5,000 less, well worth it! The lack of ABS, though, is shameful.

The peace of mind of having such a great warranty is priceless, and the added value of such a good MPG vehicle (getting 29 to 34) was an important factor. The controls are in easy reach, and the vehicle drives very comfortably. The interior is spacious and overall very pleasant to drive.

Mechanically engineered well, great gas mileage (I averaged 34mpg the first weekend, 300 miles of mixed use), looks pretty decent parked next to a Nissan or Toyota. The ""carpet"" is more like some sort of fuzzy cardboard, we'll see how the rest of the interior holds up over the next 3-4 years. Overall, for the price I don't think you can beat this car in terms of warranty, safety, features, and performance.

I was able to get the ""Copperhead"" color, so the car looks sharp & it has fog lights and a rear spoiler.  Before you laugh at the spoiler, I was cruising the I-10 at 105 mph & this engine was up to the task. At 85 mph & below the cabin noise was minimal.  I took some local back roads and the suspension was solid and the car felt glued to the road even as I took the curves at a goodly amount of speed.  The brakes bring the car to a quick stop with no spongy fade.  I look forward to taking my new Spectra on a long road trip to visit family in TN.

The gas mileage has been around 28 MPG in the city, but I do expect that to increase as the car continues to break in. One of the major selling points for me was the incredible warranty and the roadside assistance.  The interior is a bit spartan but very well thought out.

That's ok though you can get used to it after a while, and the stereo can be turned up loud enough to overcome the noise.

The Spectra is much more zippy in acceleration, yet has the same size engine as the Focus. And fuel economy is 20 percent better. I like how spacious the engine compartment is, in terms of accessibility to hoses, belts, battery, etcetera. These items are easy to see and inspect. And replacement, when necessary, should not be difficult. What I miss about the Focus is the softer seats. The Kia seats are are quite rigid. What I have a concern about is the cable actuated gas cap door. Cables and plastic latches fail in cold climates. I may have to improvise a better system to insure I can refuel in the winter.",4.125

Mechanically wise, this car has run well- especially for a car with over 130K miles now.  Only major mechanical problems would be that the AC compressor has been replaced twice now.  The major problems I've had are all small and very annoying things, like the dash warping and the dash vents breaking; the doors will lock and unlock without any prompting; most plastic pieces in the car have broken off (i.e., the mirror covers, the armrest, etc.); the paint faded in under 3 years (BAD fading on the bumpers); the doors won't shut on a cold morning; etc. Overall, the car is a good value for the money, but I don't think I'd own another one.",4.375

We have not had to put hardly any money into it (besides normal maintenance). We have almost 104,000 miles on it and have taken it on a number of long trips over the eastern half of the US. Our only complaint is that the front bumper is completely faded and the dashboard is warping. So I think the quality could have been a little higher. For $11,000 (brand new) I can't really say that I am disappointed. I think we have a great car and look forward to driving it for many more years. GO KIA!!!",4.75

Great gas mileage, little trouble, except when I had to change my front wheel bearings [covered under warranty even @45K). I  am little concerned with the brakes; they tend to be needing readjusting every so often to fix the weak braking power. As second owner I have the 5 year/60k warranty which I have used 3 time's when I locked myself out :-). Mine is a LS 5 speed with everything except the ABS. I LOOOOVE the car.

The 5 has a sporty suspension with extra low-profile tires, alloy wheels, front and rear sway bars.  Tight turning radius, no problem taking tight corners.  Point it where you want it, and it goes.  The nicest handling small car I've owned, and I have had Toyotas, Hondas, Audis, Capris, Neons. Kia has improved the appearance of the interior for 2007, and fixed the too-low front air dam as well, so the two biggest problems of 2006 are now history.

Average fuel economy is about 34mpg. I think it's a much better alternative to a used car you know nothing about. I did all my research on Edmunds and got even a lower price then I expected. $15,000.00 -  that includes sun roof and abs. I got it in red and that includes tax and tags. If you're looking for a car that rides like your 1970 Olds 98 forget it but I would have no problem taking the car on a long trip.  The seats are comfortable. I am impressed so far.

The performance is what you'd expect from a 2L 4 cylinder engine but as far as the drivetrain, everything runs smooth as silk. The power band of the engine is quite linear and the transmission shifts are smooth and precise. It's taken about 4k miles for the millage to come up and so far with about 5k miles it's averaging 31 mpg, not too bad. The ride is superb and the noise level rivals much bigger luxury cars as well.

A minor concern.  Car looks sharp, good clean lines/curves.  Brakes feel solid.  The interior looks very nice.  Climate controls are easy to use. Keeping in mind that this is not a sports car; the engine has no power issues, unless you have more than one passenger, and are going up a steep hill.  Overall, this car is a terrific value.

I looked at a few others, the Corolla, the Civic, even the new Yaris. The Kia, of course, had the best overall package. The outstanding warranty, good looks, lots of room, and it's really fun to drive. For those of you considering this car, DO NOT buy the automatic.

We have had a poping noise coming from the front of the car and had it at the dealership several times for this issue but the prolem is still there and they have yet to fix it. If I lived in town and only drove in town this would be a good car, but on any other road where the speed limit is 45 or greater it is not worth the money. The new feeling of this car faded very fast. I should have spent the extra $2000 and bought a quality car. ",1.875

There is a difference between the ""drive"" of an EX and a SX, spring for the SX if you can. With the Standard Transmission there is plenty enough horsepower to have some fun.

I had no problems getting up to speed with it, and I had no service issues with it.  When I was rear ended in February, it was totaled by a Toyota Tundra, going 70 mph, and even the passenger compartment was protected.  I didn't have any rear passengers, but after the way the car looked, if it had been another brand, I'm sure someone would have been hurt worse or even killed.

The fuel valve gave way, and it was in the shop for a week.  Kia does not provide loaner cars. After 20,000 miles, the transmission began shifting hard. I took the car in, and the service manager advised the car would need a new transmission, however the head service manager would have to review the findings.

It's not the sportiest or fastest car I've ever owned, but I added a set of Autolite platinum plugs and a APC intake. so instead of that measly 138 standard horses I got about 145.

Never thought much about it until my teenager hit a culvert (under a driveway) to avoid another car partially in her lane unexpectedly.  The front end smashed in and both of her legs had compound fractures and she was hospitalized for 11 days. Maybe it was the way the car hit, or not enough decrease in speed before impact, but I believe more front end would have offered more protection.

Second the acceleration was a significant upgrade-you can run the air without decreasing performance, a problem with most 4 cylinder cars. Thirdly was the size; it's larger than my 2003 and the overall design is exceptional. The tires (Goodyear) are a significant upgrade on the quality tire that Kia used to use as OEM tires.

I looked at Honda, Toyota, Nissan, and Scion and they are all okay but don't compare to Kia. I chose the Polar Ice Blue and get stopped all the time and no one believes my car is a Kia.

My last car was a Corolla, which I drove to its dying day.  However, during my research while buying a new car the warranty on a KIA was 100,000 miles/10 years.  Once I went to the dealership and test drove one I couldn't believe how it felt.  It is great. It drives like the Corolla, and looks kinda like it.  For the price I couldn't go wrong. The standard equipment on this car is great. I keep my cars until they die and I know this one will be with me for many years.",5

It's got everything I could want in a car (all the included options with the SX), the steering is tight and the feel is very sporty. Makes me feel years younger. Mileage is still at 28 mpg - hoping that goes up with time - but I don't baby it either, since my drive to work is all freeway at 70 mph. My only comment (and I know I read this when I was first researching the vehicle) is that it almost feels like it could have had a 6th gear - I'm not even close to maxing out the rpm's though - just how it feels to me.  But I really love driving it - problem is, so does my husband. We might have to get one for him!",4.875

Got to love the KIA 10 year warranty. I've put about 1200 miles on it so far and it rides like a dream. Lots of interior room, and very comfortable seating.  It has poor acceleration, so its performance isn't the best. Like someone else said, it revs REALLY high in first gear. I've seen stuff on eBay that is supposed to fix this.

Very well built, doors feel sturdy, everything feels well built and tight. There is no rattling at all even when going over hard bumps and potholes.  The car feels very powerful, though not so much in 1st gear. I drive with a lot of friends in the car to classes and it still feel very strong with 4 grown men in the car.

The older EX had a few minor issues (fuel door, speedometer) that were fixed very quickly and we havent had any problems since.

3834, on 08/30/18 08:33 AM (PDT),Rob Weaver ,2018 Kia Stinger Sedan GT2 4dr Sedan AWD (3.3L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Impressive first sports sedan for Kia," Ever since this car was revealed, my interest was piqued.  I previously had a WRX, and wanted a car that had a better interior, features, and more space, without sacrificing much performance and the fun to drive factor.  The Stringer GT2 looks like it fit the bill.  Pros -  The best feature of this car is what you get for your money.  The MSRP is $10-15k less than comparable Audi's and BMWs and currently the dealers seem to be giving pretty decent discounts (I got $8500 off the MSRP). The engine makes this 4000 lbs car a true rocket.  It is fast off the line, but the most surprising power is when you are moving at 30-40 MPH and you put your foot down.  You quickly will be rocketing toward ""arrest me"" speeds.  The gearbox is responsive and shifts quickly.  The suite of driving features leaves little want for more, especially at this price point.   The interior is nicely put together with actual button controls, which is a large plus for me.  The seats are very adjustable, comfortable, and low (once again, that is a plus for me).  I mostly use Android Auto, and that integration is done well.  The sound system is very good for a stock system.  For the exterior, I find the car to be one of the most handsome on the road.  It is long, low, and wide, with an aggressive appearance without being, for a lack of a better term, ""Type R""ish.  The lines flow to a wonderful hatch shape.  The 5 year standard/10 year powertrain warranty reassures me a lot since this is a new design.  Cons - Gas mileage is pretty disappointing, but somewhat expected for the weight and power of the engine.  I average about 18 MPG mostly commuting to work in the inner suburbs while trying not to drive too much like a goon.  No manual transmission is available for those of us who enjoy rowing our own gears.  The adjustable suspension can get a little floaty around corners, even in sport mode.  I wish they built in a sport+ mode that firmed up the sport mode a little more. The leather seats are prone to getting depressions if you rest something heavy on them (like seat belt imprints if you fold down the rear seats).  The exterior has a few silly non-functional fake vents.  I worry a bit about the resale value of the car, but I plan on keeping it for awhile to take advantage of the warranty.  Conclusion - Kia built themselves a really good value GT car that has most of the features and driving experience of the more expensive luxury brands at a much lower price point.  You could get roughly the same features or a more powerful engine at the same price of the Stinger from an Audi 5 series Sportback or a BMW 4 series Granturismo, but you would spend a lot more if you wanted both.  If you are not a badge snob, this car should be on your short list if you wanted a powerful GT car with a lot of space and good features.",5

It does everything well!," Right, first-things-first: I’m sure that a lot of ""brand snobs"" (sorry, but you know who you are) will turn their nose up at a Kia. No, it’s not a BMW or Mercedes, with all the ‘status’ that comes with the great German luxury brands that the Stinger is competing against. Honestly, that put me off just a bit at first. But if you can get past that – if you are truly buying a car and not a brand, I don’t why anyone would NOT want this car. I started researching cars over the winter. Wanted to move up to at-least an entry-level luxury brand e.g., Audi A5 Sportback, Infiniti Q50, etc. I started reading the great reviews for the Stinger. Took the V6 GT for a test drive and I was blown away. The power/acceleration (wow!), handling, braking, and overall performance are fantastic. The interior build quality is excellent. And hatchback/utility, and 4-passenger room of the car is a real plus.  Kia snagged stalwarts from Audi and BMW to design and engineer this car, and it shows. They made a point to say they built this as a GT, and that’s what I wanted: a car to cover long distances quickly, in comfort and in luxury. My wife and I are “empty-nesters”. We take plenty of weekend getaway trips, and I use it as a daily commuter. Or, if I just want a lot of fun, put it in Sport mode, find some twisties and some open straights… it’s a blast! The car is perfect for us. And, by the way, it gets a lot of admiring looks from other drivers. Folks' first reaction might be ""that's a lot of money for a Kia"".  Actually, I see it as a steal. Comparably equipped and powered, the comparable luxury models (think Audi S5 Sportback) would be at-least another $20k. Add the 10yr/100k warranty, and it was a no-brainer for me. I rated Reliability 4 stars, because I haven't had it long enough to really tell. So far, no problems, squeaks, or rattles. Solid. Now, there are a few things that I'm not a huge fan off: the rear view visibility is somewhat limited with the sloping lines and huge c-pillars - hence the 4-stars on Safety; there's a lot of tech... the engine auto stop/start is default-on -  I wish it was default-off; the shift-by-wire in the GT2 / having to press the ""P""/park button also takes awhile to get used to; and the auto-lift-hatch seems to be guessing as-to when you want it to open.",5

They ""lost"" the 2nd key fob.  A replacement is ""being sent from  Korea"" but this was just unacceptable. Also, the check out process was a hours long wait.  Emails to my salesperson (which were answered asap before I bought the car) seemed to take lower priority after I drove out of the lot.   It is too bad that Kia made a car comparable to luxury vehicles (even the Porsche Panamera), but cannot deliver the dealer experience.  I own an Optima (which has been an excellent car), but dread the idea of going to the dealer for maintenance, because they are just too rough around the edges.   That said, the Stinger itself lives up to the hype and more.  It is has amazing acceleration, handling, breaking and comfort.  I get lots of admirers, with thumbs up signs from random passers by..... A couple of minor things.....Kia might consider a redesign of the Video screen which sticks up a bit awkwardly in the upper middle console.  It still need to work on changing the display to emphasize the clock and radio station functions and not the GPS, but these are minor quibbles.  I am also VERY happy with the Driver Assist package (which was loaded on the model I bought off the lot) and would have been something I might have skipped to save $.  The blind spot detection and lane departure warnings can be customized to provide just enough sensitivity to assure protection, without annoying constant beeping for minor normal safe driving lane departures/changes.  Also, I have been driving on Econ mode while sitting in traffic, and I'm fairly certain that it has enhanced my gas mileage.",5

This is not a status defining car, this is just a sports sedan. And, Stinger does this job impeccably. When you shop for 50K car, you sure would have researched or test driven, audi, BMW, Merc or lexus. But you have to decide can you pass the above luxury brand dealers, and go to Kia dealer to buy this car. I did, and glad I did it. It has gorgeous looks.. Believe me, every day (yes, every day), people, either on traffic signals or in gas station or in parking lot, have asked me about this car and complemented a lot. It has Maserati look. Drive is amazing. For me, after test driving, S5, BMW 440Xi and C43 AMG, there was something in this car, I fell in love with. It is for sure, at least (if not more) 15K less than similarly equipped above brands. They have great materials in and out overall, even though there is some lack of achieving the level of above premium brands. I cannot write how much I like about this car, as it may take a lot of space. I can write little about what I don't like in it (very few, if any). I don't like the KIA label (I have always owned BMWs), fuel economy (but for this level of performance, it is acceptable) and major one being, the interior noise which can be refined a bit (I think this is common to all sports sedans like S5, AMGC43 and BMW 440Xi with M sport).",5

They did a nice job copying the exterior of an Audi A5 Sportback with the interior of a Mercedes.  The materials and fit are still subpar. For example, the push button is hidden behind the steering wheel.  The temperature gauge feels like cheaper silver plastic, too.  For some reason KIA won’t let you buy the GT with a sunroof, and the roof materials are dark making it a bit too claustrophobic for me.  A lighter roof color would be better.  Also, most of the GT1 and GT2 colors come only in red leather.   To me, the gray Nappa is best but only comes in blue and few dealers carry it.  Lots of red, black, and whites.

The exterior lines are awesome with few flaws. (One noticeable is the wind dams that cool the breaks accumulate sand and small rocks due to winter snow maintenace. The interior is comfortable as the front seats provided 18 adjustments. The side bolsters hug your sides. The heated seats and steering wheel work well. The cabon layout is good and controls are placed logically , with the exception of the 8"" touch screen (slightly out of arms reach) and the volume control is placed low and without looking I find myself operating the passenger vent. The interior materials seem of good quality with some hard plastics. (Which should be expected at this price point. I personally feel that KIA is going in the right direction, but probably should have created an up line badging due to badge bius of shoppers.

The interior is well designed and has nice materials but I am used to seeing a little wood in a sedan.  I sat in the back seat, and, at 6 ft, it is very cramped and my hairs touched the roof.  The dealer only offered me $800 off of list of $52,000.   As much as I liked this car, I could not justify spending more than my Lexus for a KIA.

You quickly will be rocketing toward ""arrest me"" speeds.  The gearbox is responsive and shifts quickly.  The suite of driving features leaves little want for more, especially at this price point.   The interior is nicely put together with actual button controls, which is a large plus for me.  The seats are very adjustable, comfortable, and low (once again, that is a plus for me).  I mostly use Android Auto, and that integration is done well.  The sound system is very good for a stock system.  For the exterior, I find the car to be one of the most handsome on the road.  It is long, low, and wide, with an aggressive appearance without being, for a lack of a better term, ""Type R""ish.  The lines flow to a wonderful hatch shape.  The 5 year standard/10 year powertrain warranty reassures me a lot since this is a new design.  Cons - Gas mileage is pretty disappointing, but somewhat expected for the weight and power of the engine.  I average about 18 MPG mostly commuting to work in the inner suburbs while trying not to drive too much like a goon.  No manual transmission is available for those of us who enjoy rowing our own gears.  The adjustable suspension can get a little floaty around corners, even in sport mode.  I wish they built in a sport+ mode that firmed up the sport mode a little more. The leather seats are prone to getting depressions if you rest something heavy on them (like seat belt imprints if you fold down the rear seats).  The exterior has a few silly non-functional fake vents.  I worry a bit about the resale value of the car, but I plan on keeping it for awhile to take advantage of the warranty.  Conclusion - Kia built themselves a really good value GT car that has most of the features and driving experience of the more expensive luxury brands at a much lower price point.  You could get roughly the same features or a more powerful engine at the same price of the Stinger from an Audi 5 series Sportback or a BMW 4 series Granturismo, but you would spend a lot more if you wanted both.  If you are not a badge snob, this car should be on your short list if you wanted a powerful GT car with a lot of space and good features.",5

It does everything well!," Right, first-things-first: I’m sure that a lot of ""brand snobs"" (sorry, but you know who you are) will turn their nose up at a Kia. No, it’s not a BMW or Mercedes, with all the ‘status’ that comes with the great German luxury brands that the Stinger is competing against. Honestly, that put me off just a bit at first. But if you can get past that – if you are truly buying a car and not a brand, I don’t why anyone would NOT want this car. I started researching cars over the winter. Wanted to move up to at-least an entry-level luxury brand e.g., Audi A5 Sportback, Infiniti Q50, etc. I started reading the great reviews for the Stinger. Took the V6 GT for a test drive and I was blown away. The power/acceleration (wow!), handling, braking, and overall performance are fantastic. The interior build quality is excellent. And hatchback/utility, and 4-passenger room of the car is a real plus.  Kia snagged stalwarts from Audi and BMW to design and engineer this car, and it shows. They made a point to say they built this as a GT, and that’s what I wanted: a car to cover long distances quickly, in comfort and in luxury. My wife and I are “empty-nesters”. We take plenty of weekend getaway trips, and I use it as a daily commuter. Or, if I just want a lot of fun, put it in Sport mode, find some twisties and some open straights… it’s a blast! The car is perfect for us. And, by the way, it gets a lot of admiring looks from other drivers. Folks' first reaction might be ""that's a lot of money for a Kia"".  Actually, I see it as a steal. Comparably equipped and powered, the comparable luxury models (think Audi S5 Sportback) would be at-least another $20k. Add the 10yr/100k warranty, and it was a no-brainer for me. I rated Reliability 4 stars, because I haven't had it long enough to really tell. So far, no problems, squeaks, or rattles. Solid. Now, there are a few things that I'm not a huge fan off: the rear view visibility is somewhat limited with the sloping lines and huge c-pillars - hence the 4-stars on Safety; there's a lot of tech... the engine auto stop/start is default-on -  I wish it was default-off; the shift-by-wire in the GT2 / having to press the ""P""/park button also takes awhile to get used to; and the auto-lift-hatch seems to be guessing as-to when you want it to open.",5

They ""lost"" the 2nd key fob.  A replacement is ""being sent from  Korea"" but this was just unacceptable. Also, the check out process was a hours long wait.  Emails to my salesperson (which were answered asap before I bought the car) seemed to take lower priority after I drove out of the lot.   It is too bad that Kia made a car comparable to luxury vehicles (even the Porsche Panamera), but cannot deliver the dealer experience.  I own an Optima (which has been an excellent car), but dread the idea of going to the dealer for maintenance, because they are just too rough around the edges.   That said, the Stinger itself lives up to the hype and more.  It is has amazing acceleration, handling, breaking and comfort.  I get lots of admirers, with thumbs up signs from random passers by..... A couple of minor things.....Kia might consider a redesign of the Video screen which sticks up a bit awkwardly in the upper middle console.  It still need to work on changing the display to emphasize the clock and radio station functions and not the GPS, but these are minor quibbles.  I am also VERY happy with the Driver Assist package (which was loaded on the model I bought off the lot) and would have been something I might have skipped to save $.  The blind spot detection and lane departure warnings can be customized to provide just enough sensitivity to assure protection, without annoying constant beeping for minor normal safe driving lane departures/changes.  Also, I have been driving on Econ mode while sitting in traffic, and I'm fairly certain that it has enhanced my gas mileage.",5

KIA Quattroporte.," Before anybody buys this car, they should know that, this is not a sports car, this is a sports sedan. This is not a luxury  / premium car, this is a sports sedan. This is not a status defining car, this is just a sports sedan. And, Stinger does this job impeccably. When you shop for 50K car, you sure would have researched or test driven, audi, BMW, Merc or lexus. But you have to decide can you pass the above luxury brand dealers, and go to Kia dealer to buy this car. I did, and glad I did it. It has gorgeous looks.. Believe me, every day (yes, every day), people, either on traffic signals or in gas station or in parking lot, have asked me about this car and complemented a lot. It has Maserati look. Drive is amazing. For me, after test driving, S5, BMW 440Xi and C43 AMG, there was something in this car, I fell in love with. It is for sure, at least (if not more) 15K less than similarly equipped above brands. They have great materials in and out overall, even though there is some lack of achieving the level of above premium brands. I cannot write how much I like about this car, as it may take a lot of space. I can write little about what I don't like in it (very few, if any). I don't like the KIA label (I have always owned BMWs), fuel economy (but for this level of performance, it is acceptable) and major one being, the interior noise which can be refined a bit (I think this is common to all sports sedans like S5, AMGC43 and BMW 440Xi with M sport).",5

They did a nice job copying the exterior of an Audi A5 Sportback with the interior of a Mercedes.  The materials and fit are still subpar. For example, the push button is hidden behind the steering wheel.  The temperature gauge feels like cheaper silver plastic, too.  For some reason KIA won’t let you buy the GT with a sunroof, and the roof materials are dark making it a bit too claustrophobic for me.  A lighter roof color would be better.  Also, most of the GT1 and GT2 colors come only in red leather.   To me, the gray Nappa is best but only comes in blue and few dealers carry it.  Lots of red, black, and whites.  The dealers experience was such a turn off I began looking at the Audi instead.

( I will say that the GT2 has 19"" tires that roughen the ride, but find acceptable in lieu of performance) The car handles well and  provides amazing accelleration even if cruising speed has been acheived, steering is responsive and the car hold the roads well. The exterior lines are awesome with few flaws. (One noticeable is the wind dams that cool the breaks accumulate sand and small rocks due to winter snow maintenace. The interior is comfortable as the front seats provided 18 adjustments. The side bolsters hug your sides. The heated seats and steering wheel work well. The cabon layout is good and controls are placed logically , with the exception of the 8"" touch screen (slightly out of arms reach) and the volume control is placed low and without looking I find myself operating the passenger vent. The interior materials seem of good quality with some hard plastics. (Which should be expected at this price point. I personally feel that KIA is going in the right direction, but probably should have created an up line badging due to badge bius of shoppers.

This car far exceeds the Audi.  The only item I preferred that the  Audi has is a full digital instrument cluster.  But that is really not a deal breaker for me.

The interior is well designed and has nice materials but I am used to seeing a little wood in a sedan.  I sat in the back seat, and, at 6 ft, it is very cramped and my hairs touched the roof.  The dealer only offered me $800 off of list of $52,000.   As much as I liked this car, I could not justify spending more than my Lexus for a KIA.

The only thing is, I only paid $3000 for it. Other reviewers seem to of been expecting a Honda or even a Toyota. This car is neither. Its a Kia and it is cheaply made (big surprise!), but if you are willing to put up with some minor annoyances, this car will get you from point A to Point B at least til 100,000 miles. I've probably only spent about $1000 in unusual maintainance. I consider it a great investment.",4
3946, on 07/25/07 10:33 AM (PDT),Dana ,2000 Kia Sephia Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,Great car for the money," I got this car new.  Seven years later, the only problems I've had are replacing the battery after 3 years ($53) and replacing one of the connecting wires (twice, first for $60 after 4 years, then for $110 at another shop after 6 years) because the plastic degraded, caused a short, and told me to 'check engine'.  The plastic started degrading before I left the dealer, so the middle console lock, both air/heat grates on the upper dash, and the window sealer have broken.  But replacement parts for this car are cheap!  A windshield was $212.  Handles best at high speeds and has a lot of pep!",4.625

My transmission went 3 weeks after I bought it. Good thing it was under warranty. So far I have had it for 2 and a half years and the alternator, blower, battery, brakes, wiper motor have all gone at least once some twice. I have to get new tires every 9 months front only due to it can't keep an alignment. Brakes sqeak no matter if they are new or old. Door looks freeze in the winter. Also doesn't handle right in the snow. Right now my car is off the road either due to a blown motor or possibly the catalytic converter. It has been nothing but trouble. ",2.625

The seats are nicely padded. The comfort of driving it long distances without feeling stiff has been wonderful. Accelerating onto a highway is great. The trunk really holds a lot. Passengers have felt comfortable. It is great on gas. It has been very reliable. I just love driving it. My husband and grown daughter enjoy driving it when I will let them. ;>),5

I've had to replace the complete front brake assembly and had to replace the rear brakes.  All of this replacement is a cause of the previous owner neglect.  Anyway I like this car a lot, it's very comfortable, gets good gas mileage, and is very reliable.  The only mechanical problem I've had is the fuel pump needs to be replaced very soon, and the exhaust is rattling a little.  One thing that is extremely annoying is a sharp loud metallic rattle coming from the automatic shifter inside the car.  I can't figure out what it is, I just know it's very annoying.",4.125

This little speed demon has the right handling, acceleration and packs a mean punch. I do have one complaint about the car though, I can't stop driving it!

Luckily the dealer replaced it at no cost to me even though I bought it with no warranty. It ran great till two months later the transmission blew without warning; no prior transmission slipping or anything. With the bill running $2200.00 I was out of luck as far as the dealer was concerned. I only paid $1500.00; good deal at the time. I wouldn't pay $3700.00 for it.,3.625

I drove it to New York and back several times, and numerous trips to Texas. The only thing I had to replace on this vehicle until this year was the power steering pump, and normal upkeep items like filters and belts etc. It still hardly uses any oil or other fluids for that matter, had to replace the the rack and pinion this year, but I feel that was due to the rocky roads its driven on on a daily basis.

Every time I am near time for an oil change, I run through oil a lot. The brakes seem to squeak all the time especially when it rains. I even put new brakes on and it still squeaks, sometimes very loudly. When I first got the car it needed a new blower motor. I had the dealer put in one and there was a problem with it making a lot of noise. They replaced it two more times. Now it's been a year and I have to replace the blower motor again.",3.125

Metal exterior very susceptible to dings and scratches that wouldn't normally happen on cars like Hondas.  Major brake repairs nearly every year, costing me about $300+ a pop.  TERRIBLE handling in snow.  Interior parts (heat pipe) got loose.  Transmission problems with only 60K miles on it (luckily it was still under warranty).  Really good on gas, but that doesn't make up for the thousands of dollars you'll have to make in repairs and maintenance (and I'm not talking about your average oil change).

Vehicle is comfortable, and is very acceptable on long trips.  Trunk space is acceptable.  The only negative comment is there is no place to set a coffee cup, or soda, without the gear shift or emergency brake being in the way.  CD player exceptional, rear defroster really works well.  Price of vehicle acceptable for what you get.  Tires that came original on the vehicle OK, could be a better tire, original ones seem to dry rot after a couple of years.

Had to have the fuse box in the engine compartment replaced because it melted.  Annual brake work, emergency brake cable snapped, sun visor spring snapped, inside driver door handle snapped, battery died, new tires every 18 months, it's LOUD, struts were in dire need of replacement at the time I dumped it.

Only real problems were an initial coolant leak on thermostat housing (both of them) because of a poor gasket.  And one had a bad plug wire.  Very happy with the overall reliability and quality for the money spent - $8K and $10K (w/air, side moldings, spoiler) and these were out-the-door prices. I am actually considering buying another, hope it's not a mistake and I was just lucky the first time.

The car is very light which makes it hard to handle in the snow or ice little to no traction even with winter tires.  The fuel economy is great though.  This car runs the best in the summer.  The car heats up and cools down very quickly never had a problem with the a/c or the heat. ,3.375

The gas mileage stinks for the car size. This car will nickel-and-dime you to death!  The latch on the driver's door has been repaired at least 6 times.  The doors freeze and won't shut (if you can even open them) if the temperature dips below 30. The engine is so loud, it sounds like a full-size pick up on the road. The body is cheap. It chips and dents very easily.  When you're driving, the doors are like tin foil - you can actually hear the wind outside whistling through the door seal.  I will NEVER buy another KIA again.

It was really cheap, and so I'm fairly satisfied with it since it proved to be pretty dependable. The brakes are very squeaky when cold, i.e. just after starting the car, but they behave normally after a mile or so. Minor annoyances so far were a faulty battery cable connection, and a defective spark plug wire that cost about $100 to fix. Wouldn't hesitate to buy one again.",4

I went to 2 dealers only to be told it drives fine. Well I and everyone who’s driven this car totally disagree. The ECM reflash - the recall- consisted of updating the software originally supplied by the car maker and changing its Air/Fuel Ratio algorithms. The rule of thumb is 12-14/1 optimum. The new software seems to keep the Turbo's wastegate open too much during wide open throttle causing the Turbo Not ""Spool Up"" all the way, losing boost, and obviously power loss. So, why did KIA update the software instead of replacing the faulty FCV valve - because it's cheaper than re-engineering the FCV. Or, even more expensive but better yet, why not replace it with a tried and true fuel pressure regulator- Cost for KIA?  Instead the easy route was to detune the car so it doesn't reach full boost, saving the FCV. So the car is now ""killed in action."" But this did lead me to learn about certain safety issues that have me very concerned. The turbo is located near the firewall, on the backside of the engine. If the pressurized part and axial lode of the turbo Fails, and is spinning at an average of 150,000 rpm's, this can act like a grenade under the hood, throwing shrapnel everywhere, possibly causing both driver and passenger injury or death, as the force of the pieces of hot steel and aluminum from the axial lode, plus the inertia of rotating blades at 150 rpms, would penetrate through the firewall.",1

Im the original owner of my sportage that just turned 191,000 miles. It has had usual repairs and maintenance. The only costly repair was the 4x4 hub upgrade. Found out you can install manual hubs cost $120. Other than that it still has the original engine and trans. I get almost 23 mpg with A/C on and averaging 70 mph. Sometimes they build lemons. Other times the repair facilities don't know what they are doing,throwing parts at it. Sorry to hear about the bad sporatges. But I plan on keeping mine until it breaks in half.",3.625

The mileage makes no difference when the car itself is such a lemon. Kia engineered the Sportage to have absolutely no pep, no style, cannot make it through 4 inches of snow even with studded snow tires, and gets bad gas mileage. There is no redeeming quality that compensates its weaknesses. I would trade horsepower for gas mileage or for getting through snow. I've owned little cars that handled and went through snow with no problem. It's ridiculous this 4WDR SUV wont go up a small hill on a dirt road with studded snows. I absolutely HATE this car so much that I will never buy another Kia.",1.125

The original owner ran her hard. First some wires rusted and fell apart, a wire on my brakes got twisted, my rear axle rusted over and broke, (that was scary), one of my back doors wont open from the outside, I recently had a problem that is I go through gas way too fast and when I go to fill up it makes a really weird hissing sound! I had this part removed from the gas tank to prevent it from rusting so its not that. But when I get the money to get it fixed it will be perfectly fine. I love it!",4.25

I drive it about 3500 miles per month and so far these are the only repairs: brakes, tires, 02 sensor (at 150k miles), batteries (gone through several of these), power window switch.   Cloth seats feel cheap, but otherwise the interior is well planned and accessories are convenient.  Exterior, for me, is pretty rough--it sort of looks like a beefy go-cart.

The few problems I've had have been things designed to wear out, like the battery, brakes, etc. I've kept it maintained and have not had any major surprises. I chose it for the car-like interior, with the height of a small truck, and not for towing or anything heavy duty, knowing that the engine is small and pretty easily taxed.

If your Sportage lacks a limited slip rear differential you might lose grip in rain or snow, depending on the type of tires you have.

It handles well and the pick up is great. The rear seat capacity has plenty of room for my granddaughter's car seat and my 80 pound golden doodle. The trunk space is ample as well.

4293, on 12/16/17 08:13 AM (PST),BTATR ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV EX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Great Vehicle But Terrible Instrumentation," I constantly get wow type comments from others who love the way the car looks and how comfortable it is on the inside. There's plenty of room and I'm extremely comfortable when driving. There's one very important characteristic of any vehicle I buy and that's the view of the road, especially the vehicles on  my left and right. The Sportage gets an ""A"" in this all important category because I have almost a 360 degree view of the road.  If there is a vehicle in a lane I'm about to enter, there's a loud beeping sound to warn me. And when backing up, the camera is terrific. It's very easy to see where I'm going and if I'm about to run into anything. I don't have a large family, but for me, there's more than enough storage space. In terms of reliability, this is my 3rd KIA and I've never had a single mechanical problem. A company can't do any better than that. Fuel economy is OK but not great. I do almost all stop and go driving and get only 18-19 mpg. I just went on a long trip, which was all highway and I got 28-29 mpg using Economy mode. Although I love my Sportage, I must warn you, there's one aspect of the Sportage I detest, and that's the technology on the instrument panel. My previous car was a 2015 five door KIA Forte where the instrument panel was incredibly well designed. It was as good as it gets, everything was intuitive, I never had to read the owner's manual. I could check my fuel economy and a wide array of other information was readily available. Unfortunately, the team which designed the Sportage instrument panel has no clue in terms of being user friendly. It's absolutely the worst design I ever saw. Does it provide all the information a driver needs? Yes it does, but finding that info is where the Sportage design is a complete failure. Even after reading the owner's manual, I have trouble and I'm a computer guy. The team which designed the instrument panel should be fired and they should hire the technology team who designed the 2015 KIA Forte 5 door. There's one other technological aspect I don't understand nor like. How could KIA produce a car in the year 2017 which does NOT have LED tailights? That's incomprehensible to me. As for the radio controls, it's also poorly designed, but the audio is very good. Radio ergonomics was much better in the Forte. Android Auto works well.But aside from these two minor complaints, I love my 2017 KIA Sportage. Here's the best part,  when I wake up, I can't wait to drive it.",5

A few months ago they did a ""recall update"" on the Air Conditioning.  Said it was necessary.  I now have NO AC and the dealer continues to argue with me about repairing it.  Claims AC is fine even though just a small amount of warm air comes out.  Transmission still a mess.  Car continually stalls.  Apparently they KNEW I bought garbage and don't care.  NEVER BUY A KIA.  I bought this vehicle used with 17,000 miles on it.  Got it home and within the first month the satellite radio keeps going out and the transmission can't find the right gear causing the rpm's to fly up.  It eventually catches and then it's fine.  I brought it back to the dealer and explained my issues to the service manager.  I also told him I read of these complaints online.  His first answer, ""don't believe everything you read online"".  Then he said, ""I'm going to educate you about satellite radio"".  He proceeded to tell me that, ""it's like being on the internet when a lot of other people are and that's why you aren't getting a signal"".  Wow.   I've had satellite in my cars and home for way over 10 years and know that's not the problem.  He said they will, ""check it out"".  After waiting over an hour he comes back and says the usual, ""We were not able to duplicate any of your issues and everything is fine"".  Had it back 2 more times and same stupid answer except for the satellite.  I brought that in while it was coded and they ordered a new antenna for it.  I doubt that will work, but it's the cheapest solution for them.  The transmission continues to miss gears.  I will drive it until the transmission blows up or I can get rid of it.  We purchased 3 Kia's from this dealer in 2 years.  We are done.  No more Kia.",1

When I picked it up in January, the problem still wasn't fixed, and the car wound up in the shop for that two more times and the whole system had to be replaced.  Ok, it finally got fixed.  Next problem: when I would try to start the car, the engine would ""roll-over"" before finally starting.  I caught the problem on tape and took it to the dealer.  The service person was shocked and I forwarded the video to him and he gave it to the mechanic.  This car has been in the shop for this problem at least 4-5 times, and every time they say ""we are not able to reproduce your claims"" - EVEN THO I HAVE IT ON TAPE - MULTIPLE TIMES. So, I finally told them I wanted to file Lemon Law.  Their tune changed to ""oh, another customer complained about this problem yesterday, we think we know what the problem is"".  So they changed the transmission switch plate. And shocker! Didn't fix the problem and caught the problem on video three more times.  During the warmer/hotter summer months, this hasn't been a problem, but I'm dreading winter...  So a couple weeks, no problems.  We take the Sportage to Florida - about 2,000 mile total drive.  During the drive down, we noticed the transmission slipping while at highway speed.  In Florida, the transmission slipped a couple more times at lower speeds.  And finally, on the way home, the transmission slipped 7 times - all at highway speed.  So, once again I called the dealership and once again my car is in the shop - it's been two weeks and I still don't have my car back.  I called for an update and I'm told ""we are not able to reproduce your claims, but will keep it a few more days"".  Something else we noticed in Florida was the AC going in and out.  During acceleration, the AC would blow hot - I had noticed this before now, but now somebody else was noticing it.  And when it's 95*, it's annoying and unacceptable. So anyway, I hope my problems help somebody else not have the same problems.  (By the way, the dealership has always been nice and has given me a rental, so that helps a little). Oh, and the gas mileage sucks.  And it's slow...definitely recommend turbo.",4

4299, on 08/16/17 10:53 AM (PDT),Extremely Frustrated!!! ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Extremely Frustrated!!!," I traded in my Kia Soul for a 2017 Kia Sportage in October of 2016, loved the look the drive etc.  Dealing with Kia Service however has been another issue, Camelback Kia!! In April of 2017 my lights and ac went out I only had parking lots arriving at the airport at 3am had an hour and 15 min drive to get home. Drove home with parking lots on 110 in Arizona not safe but my only choice at that point.  Took it into the dealership they couldn't find anything and it has not happened since.  Now for the past 4 weeks my AC has been out working here in there but in 124 degrees that is unacceptable! I called Kia for a Saturday day apt they got me in never telling me that they didn't have anyone to work on the vehicle on a Saturday as it was a skeleton crew.  Sat there 6.5 hours had to pay $250 for a recharge and a cabin filter but they did not know if that was the problem got in the car and it was not fixed I was told I had to bring it up on a weekday. Today I have dropped off the car was told I would be reimbursed for my fee on Saturday and was told now I have to wait until they figure out what is going on. Did not pay for rental I live 1 hour plus away from the dealership and can't not take the day off work to deal with my defected car.  I have called corporate no response. I told them today I do not want the car till it's fixed. It's sad that Kia service is just awful. I know they direct there employees to be that way but when your waiting for service they try an up sell you! I know something electrical is going on with my car and they are just letting me run up miles so they do not have to deal with it!  I will fight till the end! I will never recommend KIA to anyone and I will never purchase a vehicle from them again this is my 3rd car from them.  Good Luck to you all! 2-23-2018 No change in  status they never fixed it summer is coming and it will be in the triple digits!!! I'll be up there fighting with them some more!! So done with KIA",2

The most important about that suv is the performance of the engine 2.4litre 4 cylinder is sorta impressive the SUV pulls pretty hard when the a.c. is off but when the a.c. is on the motor sorta lags power a little but at the sametime still can weave through traffic with ease, there's time i thought i was on neutral and feels like I was downshifting while driving especially on low speed and what I read that kia didn't yet find a solution on why the transmission is doing that besides the it could be the computer(ecu) selecting the wrong gearing. The handling is ok even though I had the awd version and it didn't really feel like I had awd because there's times i be going from lane to lane on the freeway sorta high speed and the suv swerve pretty easy like I didn't have traction.Gas mileage is pretty good(could be better)I drove from Vegas to orange county cali and back with a full tank and in the end i had quarter tank left with a.c. on the whole time.  Overall kia is kinda stepping there game up with exterior,interior and how well the engine performance, kia needs to find the transmission gearing  issue problem asap  or else someone will get into a bad car accident.",4

Immediately after purchase, we realized the front head rest were extremely uncomfortable, pushing our heads into a position where we look down if we keep our eyes in a normal position. A few months later, we began having a lot of pain in our left hip joint. Thought it was just old age until a much younger person took a trip with us and began to mention having pain in left hip joint.                                                                                                         There was not a lot of hot weather after our purchase, so we can't say the cooling problems were there initially. As warm Spring days arrived, we realized the air conditioning was cycling from cooling to no cooling every few minutes and on ""recirculate"" wasn't cooling at all.                            Later, we realized a problem with the front and rear wiper switches--the wipers don't always turn off when the switch is placed in the ""off"" position.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              After leaving the vehicle with the dealership for the 3rd time we are again without the use of the vehicle. The !st time the evaporator box was replaced and the system recharged; the 2nd time they said a system fault was ""causing the AC control head to not allow full system operation"" so they performed control head reset; The 3rd time, no corrective measure has been performed on the AC since a tool needed has to be ordered, and they don't have an answer for the wiper switch problem because the wiper switches didn't malfunction when checked at the dealership.",3

We now have owned our Sportage for 7 months and 12,000 miles, and I'm not taking back a single thing I posted in my first review - this is a great vehicle.  We have not had a single issue.  The ride is smooth and quiet - so quiet that both my wife and I need to watch our speed carefully because the vehicle often is going faster than it seems because we hear so little engine noise.  Love the 6-speed transmission - so smooth that you can hardly feel the shifts.  Fuel economy has been better than advertised.  On the highway we are always over 30; in our mixed driving on city streets and expressways we are usually close to 30 or just a tick below.  Multiple riders have commented on the comfort, especially in the front seat where the head-rests are unusually soft.  All of the technological bells and whistles (of which we have few because we bought the base model) have worked flawlessly.  One of the best vehicle decisions we've ever made.",5
4310, on 04/07/17 14:12 PM (PDT),AGC ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),"Let the record show, 2017 Sportage awesome:"," I had an '05 Cavalier (since 2004), wonderful little car... didn't put anything into it except gas (when empty); oil and filter (every 5,000 miles); replaced the battery in 2011 (up and died on me, it sat for most of the year as I was travelling the world); put new tires on it a couple years back (the originals were dry rotting on me) and blew through some windshield wipers over the years... when the speedometer quit working (@42,000 miles) I drove it another 27,000 using my GPS for speed and cruise control (never got a ticket).  AFTER ABOUT 13 YEARS of driving low to the ground (by the seat of my pants) I decided a change was in order... I have been retired since 1998 and had nothing but free time to sit in and check out all the competition (like Goldilocks) most were: too big or too small or underpowered or gas guzzlers or had too many whistles and flashing lights or too nuanced... THE SPORTAGE fit me and my plans just right.  I like driving the back roads and at 45 mph and get around 38 mpg in echo mode (on level ground... if its hilly not so much); observing about 24 mpg in and around town (but that's with echo off, riding normal mode)... I am headed to the blue ridge mountains and fully expect to be using sport mode and couldn't care less what the mileage will be for that because it will be fun (no white knuckle driving but there will be no Miss Daisy along for the ride).  Plenty of room for me and my stuff (and then some).  The Sportage looks great be it parked or on the move... oh you can tell it might be top heavy (knowing how gravity works) but if you drive it like you own it (responsibly) there should be no surprises.  I am really impressed with the different modes (echo, normal and sport), there is a remarkable difference in horsepower on demand between echo and sport... they make normal seem obsolete... but everything has its place, I suppose.",5

This 2017 has a major defect that is apparently a recall in the waiting.  The transmission is worse than bad.  Mine has locked into a gear and would not change.  It constantly downshifts when it has no business shifting...thus, planting you into the steering wheel.  It has a proclivity to slip into neutral while driving causing the RPM's to redline for no reason.  The dealer has no idea what to do about it because Kia hasn't come up with a fix.  I am aware of three other cars just like mine with the same issues.....all brand new.  I've had strangers come up to me in parking lots and ask if my tranny is screwed up too.  Kia has to be aware they are selling cars with a defect.  Edited 10/2017...Kia finally discovered a problem with the ground in the electrical system.  Apparently the grounding ""screws"" were painted over in the initial factory painting and they had to be cleaned and rewired.  Since then the gear lock seems to be either fixed or better.  I have still had a couple of warning light and shifting issues when driving in the mountains.  When I pull out of the driveway every morning I get 50 yards up the road and hear a ""clunk"" as if something isn't bolted tight enough.  Nobody can find the source of that sound.  Additionally the material used for the dashboard that is intended to feel like leather turns out to be a dust magnet and scuffs when you try to clean it.  The tow plug on the front bumper falls out all the time so I had to silicone it in place.  I've noticed this on several Sportages I've seen around town.   In general.....this car has too many small defects to garner a better rating and I feel they are all in the form of poor design and engineering.   Perfect example....you cannot drive this car with the driver side window down......the buffeting sound will literally hurt your ears.",3

The radio reception without Sirius radio is poor. When temps are in the teens the engine has a hard time turning over. It always starts but it seems to struggle. We haven't had below zero temps yet so don't know how that will go.  Dealership can't replicate the problem. The major problem with this vehicle is that the steering wheel has locked up 3 times in the last 2 months when I turned it off. The key won't turn, the steering wheel won't move, and the gear shift is locked. The steering wheel needs to be perfectly straight when the car is turned off or I may be stranded. Love Kia vehicle assistance but this is a MAJOR pain .  The dealership is zero help with this problem. The tow truck driver has gotten the steering wheel turned but offered no suggestions.

Compared it to its step brother the Hyundai Tucson that doesn't have the looks, or fine interior, or the 2.0 turbo engine.  I believe Hyundai might have told Kia after having the newer better car,  ""oh no you don't , you are not posting good gas mileage results"". Just a thought .... But we are getting 30mpg highway easily at a constant 65 mp/h  We have even seen 33 Mpg !  On average after putting on 8000 miles I would day the Average MPG is about 25 with city driving and pretty bad freeway traffic here in L.A.   The car is very nicely styled and quiet,  powerful even at low rpms.  The stereo/navigation is excellent !  We tried the AWD in the snow up in Big Bear Ca after a winter storm and were very impressed.   The car has a comfortable ride but handles extremely well and feels tight on the steering.

Please don't come to the party expecting good gas mileage, I've owned Korean cars for over a decade now and they're all notorious for poor gas mileage. Accepting that from the start I can find little more to complain about. The turbo is fast and the pedal is responsive. It offers 3 driving modes and if you want to get pushed back in your seat, select sport mode. Handling is responsive and ride quality is good and quiet. I've not yet had the opportunity to see how the AWD handles itself in the snow but living in the NE, it won't be long.

4322, on 11/20/16 14:58 PM (PST),Chris ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Updated Review: 2017 Kia Sportage LX," Edmunds sent me an email to update my review after owning my car for over a year, so here it is:I purchased the 2017 Kia Sportage LX model in August 2017. I don't drive a lot, so I only have 3,100 miles in 15 months. The car still smells brand new! As a result of mostly city driving and taking short trips, I average about 18 mpg. Longer city trips average about 21mpg and I don't have any stats on regular highway trips since I don't commute to work.I really enjoy the Kia Sportage. It's a lot of fun to drive and switching drive modes allows me to zip through lanes when I'm on the road. I've been interested in adding some extras to the car like side steps, foglights and wraps but Kia doesn't offer much in the way of aftermarket products. I did add some WeatherTech mats to protect my floorboards which is a big help at trapping dirt and water.After 15 months of ownership and low mileage I can't really rate it for reliability, but I have not had any major problems. However, during the first three months I did experience some intermittent starting issues. The engine would try to start up then stop after it sat overnight in my garage. So far, that problem has not appeared again. I also experienced a minor problem where the gear shift would stay locked in park after starting the engine. After a few times of this happening, I learned that if I took my foot off the brake and left the car alone for 5-10 seconds it would then unlock. This may be a safety feature of some kind that I have not learned about. Overall, I am still really happy with my Kia Sportage. I really like the styling and people ask me about it all the time. I tell them that it's my Kia Porsche.Previous Review:I agree with a lot of the other reviewers on the overall happiness with the 2017 Kia Sportage. However, I get no where near the gas mileage that others have reported, even on the base model front wheel drive. Am I missing something? Driving in Eco mode, I am lucky to get 21mpg overall in city driving. I expected a little better in Eco Mode. If I dare to change to standard or sport mode, it takes half a tank to get back up to 20mpg in Eco Mode. I don't drive much, so its not a huge deal, just wondering what I might be doing wrong. Despite the gas mileage, I really love my 2017 Kia Sportage. I bought the front wheel drive LX back in August and it has just the right amount of torque and acceleration that I need for urban driving. Even in Eco mode, I noticed that it performed better than the Nissan Rogue, RAV4 and Honda CRV. However, what really stood out to me was the amount of features I got with the base model LX compared to Toyota, Nissan, Mazda and Honda. I also appreciated the long warranty, reliability ratings and the IIHS top safety report. I really like the overall design of the car (especially the tiger nose grill) and the spacious back seats sealed the deal for me.I used to drive a 2000 Volkswagen Beetle, so pretty much any new car was amazing to me. The first car I test drove was the Mazda CX3 and it was a lot of fun to drive but too compact. I then tried the Nissan Rogue which had a lot of nice features for the price but not much acceleration and it rolled too much. The Honda CRV was a total letdown and a completely boring car. The Toyota RAV4 felt like a very solid and well built car. The quality was very apparent but so was the high price. After testing the 2017 Kia Sportage, seeing all the features and finally the reasonable price, I was sold.Now, I'm not a fan of the gas mileage but I drive so little that it never mattered to me. At the end of the day, the Sportage is a lot of fun to drive and provides a comfortable ride with enough acceleration that I can get around the city without any problems.",4

Not enough of a left to right adjustment available I would guess.   Cant speak on maintenance costs as yet and that's a good thing but the mileage seems to be lower than expected.  According to the car's internal stats and the amount of times I go to the gas station per month,  I am getting less mileage than my 2007 Toyota Camry and that's NOT a good thing!

Very difficult to get my songs into system (like the jukebox on old Sportage). Dealer couldn’t figure it out either.,4

So far haven't missed the Mustang at all. The Sportage rides extremely comfortable and has been getting 26 to 27 mpg in town. The A/C will run you out. The visibility is terrific with little to no blind spots. The 4 cylinder has ample enough power around town and on highway for a SUV. Negatives? Stereo sound is wimpy and do miss the hid headlights the Mustang had. Overall we are satisfied with the look, ride, and performance of the 2017 Sportage.Have owned the Sportage for a year now and my wife has put over 10,000 miles on it. Still doing good although ever so often the transmission feels like it gets hung out of gear for a few seconds. Does this very randomly maybe once or twice a month. Dealer hasn't found anything wrong with it so keeping an eye on it.",5

Im getting roughly 28 mpg driving in Eco mode with relatively fast acceleration. It feels luxurious.It's been 6 mos and I still really love the car. The only thing that I don't like is that there isn't a automatic window washing for the back window.

Test drove the 2016 and 2017...knew right away...2017 Sportage EX was going to be my pick. Went with the premium package...didn't feel the technology package was worth the extra 2 grand. Only disappointing feature on the 2017 Sportage EX is the lack of cargo compartment space...no pockets in the back for items...everything slides around....no passenger side cargo space-saver under the seat and no coin change holder/personal/dodads draw or compartment to hide small items...just a big deep hole in the console that you probably will never find something in....once you place it in there....,5

The past three mornings the car turns over a few times before starting.  This morning after it started, it acted like it wanted to cut off.

Really like the way it looks. I've owned the car less than 2 weeks so I'm still learning it, but so far it's great!

The first was a 300 mile round trip, 90% rural highway, speed range between 50 and 65 mph. Result: 28 mpg. The 2nd trip was shorter, approximately 100 miles, 90% highway 60-75 mph. Result: 26 mpg.

4331, on 08/28/16 19:16 PM (PDT),Dan K. ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV EX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Excellent inside and out!," The first time I climbed in this car it reminded me of my early 2000's Audi A6 because of the layout of the dash, the shape and comfort of the seats, and the premium feel of the leather seats and steering wheel. However, when I fired it up and drove it around the block, it felt much more planted than said Audi. I have nothing but great things to say about this car! Peter Schreyer did an incredible job designing the interior of the car to make it feel like a much more expensive European SUV, and the exterior resembles the latest offerings in the category from Porsche and Audi, from the glossy black plastic fascia and foglight surroundings, to the excellent LED surrounded projectors and sexy body contours. The climate control is fantastic, and the screen is great. The front and rear seats are great, and the rears even recline for extra comfort. There are a million airbags, and nothing rattles at all. Acceleration is what is to be expected from a heavy 4-cylinder SUV, but the 6 speed auto keeps it in the rev range that maximizes torque and passing power when needed. My wife is 7 months pregnant, and I feel very comfortable knowing she's in this car when she has to go out. Fuel economy is what was to be expected, though it is probably the cars worst aspect. I average about 22MPG combined, but the car only has 2,100 miles on it, so it'll work in a bit and probably increase, but it is what was advertised so I can't complain.",5
4332, on 08/20/16 19:30 PM (PDT),Andrew ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),"Vehicle = OK, KIA Service = BUST"," EDIT: Kia wants my unbiased review?  Well, lets just say Kia's customer service won't support you at all.  I had an issue with a faulty gas tank latch.  It is a new design where you push in on the fuel door and it locks into place, and to open it you also push in, and a spring pops the door out - don't know of a better way to describe it.  I don't get why other designs needed to be replaced with this, or the fact that since it doesn't lock anymore anyway, why does it need a latch in the first place...but on to the story.Incidentally I also had a problem with the A/C completely freezing up and the vehicle needing to be reprogrammed, which of course ALSO happened while I was on the road but back to the point at hand.6AM.  Cold, dark fall morning.  Getting fuel to go to an appointment out of town - medical specialist appointment.  I pull in and try to open the fuel door.  Won't budge.  Repeated attempts - won't budge.  Pushing on it much harder - nothing.  It is not frozen because I have a temp.-controlled garage.  I am now stranded at this station because no one can get the door open to fuel the vehicle and I do not have enough fuel to reach my destination.  If I cancel this appointment I am still billed several hundred $ and the medical condition is not trivial.  I have to get there.  The cheap design and cheap little plastic spring mechanism in the fuel door latch has broken and jammed the door shut.  After a few more minutes, I remember that it is plastic and decide I can get the door open and replace the little plastic part later.  I eventually get the jammed/defective plastic part to snap, which allows me to open the fuel door but in doing so, I put a small scratch in the paint around the fuel door.  No big deal, I am sure Kia will help me with this.  Total cost estimate for the scratch = $125.  My appointment would have been much more expensive to cancel.Later that morning I call Kia, because of course they are not open at 6AM.  Why did I not call Kia Roadside?  2 reasons.  1) The service station mechanic who helped me with the latch tells me they are going to have to pry it open anyway and  2) I would have had to wait for them to show up, which means I would have missed the appointment regardless.  Everyone there agrees with just getting it open and it makes sense to deal with it later.   I call Kia.  Kia tells me that since I didn't let them handle it, they wouldn't assist me at all with the claim and basically refused to talk to me.  They accused me of deliberately damaging my new car.  I ask them if their part could have had anything to do with it and they of course refused to even send someone to look.  I have taken it to both a body shop and the local Kia dealer.  Both places, I was told ""Why is Kia not taking care of this for you?""  I could only shrug.Here's the thing - I don't even want the fuel latch replaced.  I want it left ""broken"" because now the door actually works as it should.  I don't want another cheap plastic part put in there just so it can jam shut on me again.  So all we are talking about is the scratch.  I asked more than one Kia rep. what the procedure is for opening a stuck fuel door, knowing full well there isn't one and everyone knows they were going to have to pry the fuel door open.  They would have had no other choice and they know it.  The dealer pretty much confirmed that too.  The rep. on the phone didn't want to answer.  Of course they know their part failed but won't pony up $125 to help out a customer with their brand new vehicle.  How cheap can you be, Kia?My experience with this vehicle has been overall fairly good until this point but now I will never buy another Kia.  So guess what, Kia?  I am paying $125 for this repair.  You are losing my future business.  We were thinking of replacing my wife's Escape with another Kia but now that won't be happening, either.  A friend of mine who is replacing her vehicle asked me how I like my Kia and that she might get one.  Not anymore.  I wonder how many people I can convince to change their minds.I hope the $125 was worth the several thousand $ this will cost your company.",5

I called and had one put on hold.  I booked a flight, they picked me up at the airport in my new Sportage.  Wow Kia has amazing style, features and good power for a 4 cylinder.

Until now, I haven't had any issues with it, still works nicely. It also has a backup camera but I just wish that the manufacturer included a 360-degree camera to better assist with parking.

All I can tell you is that these three companies better change fast or else this sportage will bury them.  Last fall we purchased a used 2014 sportage lx for my daughter, i love the handling and the ease of maintenance.    The new 2017 is a knockout power punch for this company,  yes we have the means to afford a 40k car but why ?   My daughters power window broke on her 2014 with 48K on it and they fixed it for free, just can't beat the warranty .    A few of our friends laughed at us, ( lexus, audi ) until they sat in it then took it for a drive,  laugh no more.  This is a cool vehicle.   UPDATE: 20,000 miles.

I looked at several models and based on research and my test drive, decided on the Sportage.  I have NOT one regret yet!  It is a 4 cylinder model so it doesn't have as much punch as my Murano but thats okay.. i'm not in a hurry.. My gas mileage (although low compared to other crossovers) is still better than my Murano.  I love the design of the outside of the Sportage and the inside is just as nice.  My only small complaint is regarding the USB.  It doesn't seem to charge phones as rapidly as I would like and I don't think it is the actual cord.  It worked better in the Murano, but this isn't a huge issue for me as long as i can get some charge.",4

You cant beat the warranty and I think the build quality is good. There is only 2 dealers near where we live so we went to the closest one first to take the 2017 out for a test drive. When we first seen the car we loved the way it looked and the inside was even better (we looked at a Hyundai before we went to the kia dealer and they are almost the same) the problem I had was when I turned the key and heard the noise the engine made. It was HORRIBLE, I have a strong mechanical background and the tapping noise the car makes inside and out is unacceptable to me. What it is is the high pressure injection system (fuel pump and injectors) . Now if you know nothing about machinery you may not notice the noise this makes and if so buy the car it is a good car I am just giving my opinion about the fuel system. Now the dealer will try to tell you that this noise will stop after the car has warmed up but this is just not true, They may also say that this is new technology but this is also false. All I am asking is you research direct inject systems and educate yourself on the positives (and there are a bunch) and on the negatives. Sorry to be such a downer on this I love the car but they could have relocated the fuel pump and insulated the firewall better to quiet the tapping noise..",2
4344, on 06/06/16 13:11 PM (PDT),NASA Lil ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV EX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),No longer an Acura owner!," Love this SUV. Test drove one a few months ago and liked it. Drove other SUV's in the mean time- RDX, CX5, RAV4 Hybrid etc. and none of them really appealed to me. Test drove the EX with premium and tech packages- so all the goodies, and I loved it. White with grey interior looks awesome and the infotainment system is very nice. Fuel economy is lousy so lets hope the fuel prices don't go sky high for a while.UPDATE: We have owned the car for about 6 months and so far so good. We put a lot of miles on the Kia going back and forth to our sons college and we only had one real issue. Over the summer the air conditioning failed during a 90 degree day. We were not happy to say the least. When we brought the Sportage to the dealer they told us that they had a new firmware version that will fix the problem. I thought that they were full of it. BUT, low and behold the air conditioning worked perfectly from then on. The best part of the car so far is the Android Auto and Apple Car Play. I would never purchase a car without this technology ever. It works so well that it changes the driving experience. We are looking forward to the snow so we can try out the locking differentials- a feature that sets this compact SUV apart from others in the class.",5

Plenty of power when needed and gas mileage which was my main concern has not been much of an issue.  One 600 mile drive on mostly cruise I got 27 MPG.  Very luxurious interior with good placement of controls.   Love the ventilated seats, heated steering.  Everything I need with one exception, adaptive cruise control.  Other than that all the safety features are included.  We own a Kia Optima as well which we have loved but had roof noise which took 2 trips to the service dept. to repair.  Sportage is much quieter and the moon roof is very large, very nice.  Easy to get in and out of, plenty of back storage with seats forward or about the same size as my last Subaru Outback.",5
4346, on 05/17/16 11:31 AM (PDT),Ken ,2017 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),My new SX turbo rocks!," This has everything I was looking for (SUV, size, power, styling, tech, etc.). I like German makes, but for for this level of equipment you'll be spending north of $45,000. I like that this trim includes everything, no nickel and diming for options. Mine is Pacific Blue with the beige interior. I think the cool grey interior would be nice as well. Kia reliability is up there with the best in the latest surveys. Looking forward to a long ownership.Update: zero defects in the first year. Ride is a little stiff but last night I rode in a RAV4 and it was worse. Steering is nicely weighed and responsive. Transmission is excellent, always seems to be in the right gear. Love the low rpm torque pull in second and third gear. Al the tech stuff works great. Mileage could be better and the gas tank is small (15 gallons). Overall totally satisfied with my purchase.Defective spark plug (probably) caused burned valve and ""internal engine damage"". Replaced by KIA at no charge to me. Took 5 weeks to get new engine from Korea. Had underpowered Ford Fusion loaner the whole time. Glad to have my ride back. Still love the car. Disappointing gas mileage but I don't drive enough to worry about it. Never able to squeeze more than 14 gallons into tank when practically empty. I think the capacity is overstated.",5

This represents the first radical change since that model came out. It meets my entire checklist of must have items except for adaptive radar cruise, which is only available in larger models.

I have owned a 2003 Kia Spectra, 2013 Kia Optima, 2016 Kia Optima, 2016 Kia Sorento, and not this beautiful 2017 Kia Sportage.  I got the Sportage to replace the Sorento.  I owned the Sorento for only 2 months before things started to break.  It only had 1000 miles on it before the sun roof broke, and the trim pieces around the door started falling off.  I never could get the UVO system to work properly.  When I went to the dealership the Sportage was what I wanted, but they didn't have it in the trim level that I wanted and when they did get one in I wasn't impressed.  When I took my Sorento in for repairs that's when I saw the 2017 Sportage and decided that this was a huge upgrade from the 2016.  So I went all in.  So far I'm really impressed with this car.  The look is sexy and sporty, and fun.  The interior feels expensive (in most places), the tech package and all of the upgrades are awesome.  This car has it all.  It drives and handles great, and I love that the turbo engine give me all of the power I need to pass easily, and move in and through traffic without worrying about having the get up to make it into tight spaces.  I can see myself driving this car for 10+ years.    Pros: Excellent technology package, TONS of features like autonomous breaking, front collision warning, ventilated and heated seats, beautiful styling and I LOVE the dark brown leather seats.  Lots of power and speed when it's needed, comfortable ride, and the car feels spacious.  Placement of all of the controls is perfect, everything is easy to find and easy to use.  Android Auto is AWESOME!!! Cons: Some of the finishes feel a little cheap.  I would have been willing to pay a little more for visors that don't feel like they are made of cheap plastic, The lack of the memory seat function, and the lack of the easy entry seat also gives the car a little bit of a cheap feeling.  These things are very noticeable because the rest of the finishes are better quality.  It would be nice if this car had the same luxury feel that the Sorento has.  UVO system is still troublesome.  I can only get the eServices portion to sync to my phone sporadically, and it's a bummer that you need to have the phone plugged in to use it.  Same with Android Auto there seem to be a few glitches like after taking a call the Google Play Music won't restart.  I believe some of these things will be fixed throughout the year as updates are released.  Still it would be nice to be able to use these functions via Bluetooth instead of needing to plug the phone in.  More road noise than the Sorento, and the Optima.  Bottom line this is a GREAT car, and I look forward to many years of enjoyment from it.",5

Honda is supposed to be the reliability king - I had problems and dealers unwilling to figure out the causes. As a loyal Honda customer (I've had 5), I was nervous about moving to Kia. So far, so good. I'm really happy that I made the move. Kia engineers seem to be really trying to put out a quality vehicle, and so far with the Sportage, they have. Comfortable seats, engaging driving dymamic. Honestly, it feels a little like a grown-up version of my 2010 VW GTI.

I test drove a RAV-4 4 cylinder with 53,000 miles on it before the Sportage. I liked both but I had a hard time letting go of the zippiness of the RAV-4. My dealer said Toyota had a much more advanced 4 cylinder motor than Kia. Well I wish Kia would figure out how to do it. BUT, the 4 cylinder is still peppy enough for me. I drive on the highway everyday back and forth to work and I don't have any trouble with passing if I want to. I absolutely LOVE the smooth ride, and lack of rattles. My mother's Explorer feels like a jalopy after riding in my Sportage. I don't like to ride in anyone else's cars now. Kia did a great job.   ",4.875

Was wife's dream vehicle but common sense won out. I had driven Tucson and liked it but we both went to drive the Kia. Gearing made it feel sportier and interior is beautiful. Wife liked well enough to buy on the spot. Sportage is fun to drive, luxurious, practical, roomy. The value is unbelievable as Kia has so many nice features and they are done up in a great package. 6 CD changer is awesome and black leather interior with heated seats is a great place to spend time. Mix of freeway and in town getting us about 22 mpg. Cannot believe others would purchase mundane CR-V or RAV4 and spend much more to end up with much less. Go Kia!",4.75

I have already had occasion to use it and the response was prompt.  The responder did minor damage to open the door, but after some hassles, they reimbursed me for my expenses for repairs.

I am really glad I choose the Sportage. I love the dual exhausts, the safety features at no additional cost which includes the ABS, ESP, side curtain front and rear airbags and the 100,000 mile warranty.

It looks good, has decent power from the V6, has an awesome interior with many standard features, plus the best warranty you will find anywhere. Granted, I haven't owned it for a long time so reliability is a question mark. One thing that I hate is taking a car in for repairs although honestly my other cars were reliable.

I also live in the city and for practical reasons a hatchback was a MUST for me - not a side opening trunk.  I almost bought the Hyundai Tucson (identical to the Sportage), but just prefered some of the slight styling & gadgets in the Sportage better (ie. different trunk covers).

We had really wanted a Kia Sorento as we'd already owned a 2011 Sorento and really liked it.  What it ended up coming down to folks was price.  We did not want a high car payment yet wanted an SUV for the cargo space and something good on gas.  We purchased this Sportage with 23,000 miles on the odometer in excellent condition and got it for an exceptional price.  We've taken it on a trip to northern New England and make frequent trips to North Carolina about 2.5 hours away.  It's been super reliable, averages high twenties for gas mileage (have gotten up to 35mpg on trips), has more than enough power when needed, stops well and handles just fine.  I'm getting ready to turn 60 and have many aches and pains, yet the 2.5 hour trips to North Carolina don't cause me undue discomfort.  Yes, the seats are a bit hard, but if on longer trips you stop and stretch every couple hours or so they are fine.  I didn't expect luxury seating in an economy SUV.  The ride is quiet and the controls are easy to reach and use.  As some people note the ride is a bit stiff, but unless you have to drive on rough or poorly maintained roads all the time it's no big deal.  I might feel differently if I lived in New England, but here in Virginia where I live, and on our trips to North Carolina, most roads are smooth and in good condition.  The dealership has been great to work with and as of 33.000 miles have had no issues.  Overall my wife and I are very satisfied with this SUV and plan to keep it for several years.",5

My favorite thing about our rental Sportage is how a lower trim could totally pass for a mid-trim level. Things that make that true are: LED-turn signal mirrors, alloy wheels with silver/gray accents, UVO with parking minder, Bluetooth, Curfew set, and many more. Driving the Sportage is great due to the 2.4L GDI 4-cylinder that produces 182 horsepower, this SUV accelerates like it has a 3.5L V6, so WOW. On the fist day with the Sportage we had to travel to Seattle, which is 1 hour away from Olympia, WA. The ride was so comfortable that it felt like we only drove for 15 minutes. In IKEA Seattle we had to get a desk as my cousin's christmas gift, a large, flat box easily slid through the tailgate. My aunt has a Toyota RAV4 XLE that I compared to the Sportage, and the Sportage has some great advantages. Only one thing I don't like that the Sportage has, is the Poor small overlap rating by the IIHS. If you are interested in a compact utility, definitely recommend to consider the Sportage or even a Toyota RAV4.",5

4460, on 11/24/15 21:08 PM (PST),Jeffrey ,2015 Kia Sportage SUV EX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),peppy little bug!," I rented a Sportage for a week and had mixed feelings about it overall. I typically drive a Chevy Suburban.   I was surprised at how much gas I had to put in that little Kia. I didn't calculate the fuel mileage but feel like I was gassing up just as much as my big Chevy.  The engine has some get up and go but sounds like a weedwhacker under hard throttle.  First impressions pulling out of the parking lot was how quiet the car was. The interior quality seemed very good. It took me a while to figure out how to use the windshield wipers.  The temperature gauge was in Celsius and I could not figure out how to change that.  The suspension was firm but that's the way I like them.  The suspension seemed to handle well but the car felt top heavy and narrow.  Heading down the interstate the car felt a little twitchy as the steering was very quick and the narrow car seemed to want to change lanes at the slightest movement.  The triangular shaped side mirrors were infuriating I felt like half of my field of vision was chopped off and I had to duck my head around to see everything I needed to.  I tried to lower the seat to get comfortable but then realized the windows were too small and the bottom of the window was almost beside my ear.  I had to raise the seat back up so I could see.  Trying to use my phone as I GPS I could not find a place I could set it down where it would not fall on the floor or slide to the back of the passenger seat where it is too dangerous to look at.  This might be a nice car for a young single person or a first SUV but for a 45 years old father of 5,  I really didn't like it.  If the same mechanicals were in a sedan or coupe I think I would really enjoy it as long as I could find a place for my phone.",4
4461, on 11/05/15 11:18 AM (PST),Robert Brashears ,2015 Kia Sportage SUV EX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Great little SUV/CUV," I have owned my Sportage for a month now, and I am nothing less than thrilled with it from bumper to bumper.  When KIA named the vehicle, the ""Sport"" aspect of ""Sportage"" is very appropriate, as the vehicle looks, handles and drives like a small sports sedan.  Mine is the EX model, AWD.  The EX package includes Panoramic sliding sunroof, leather seating surfaces (front/rear), leather wrapped steering wheel, heated and cooled ventilated front seats, power drivers seat with lumbar, dimming rear view mirror with Homelink, front/rear floor mats, cargo mat, fog lamps, power/folding heated side view mirrors w/turn indicators, Uvo touchscreen entertainment system with backup monitoring, bluetooth, Infinity speakers with 8"" sub woofer, navigation, Sirius, keyless entry and push button start/stop, dual climate control, 18"" wheels and tires, and a cooled glove box...all for a sticker of $31,650.00.  That is an incredible value compared to other manufacturers vehicles in this segment. I found that a Ford, Mazda, Toyota or Honda with the same features, were anywhere from $4,000 to $6,000 more comparably equipped.  They also don't come close to matching the 10 year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty, or 6 year 60,000 bumper to bumper warranty that KIA offers.My KIA has a 2.4L, inline 4 cyl. engine that produces 183 HP.  It also has a 6 speed auto transmission w/manual mode.  The engine is quite peppy, and getting up to 65-70 is no problem.  The engine never sounds taxed, or over revved.  Shifting is quiet, smooth and precise...no hedging or jerking. Fuel economy is okay...with a combined 22 mpg city/highway.  But, the vehicle is full time AWD, so I am okay with that.  I will be curious to see if that improves when I take it on the road this summer. The steering is precise, the suspension is taught, not stiff..so small bumps do not beat you to death. Road noise is minimal. and for having a smaller wheelbase, the ride is quite comfortable.  It also tracks and corners very crisply, which I really appreciate for city and suburban driving, and getting on and off the expressways.The interior is very nicely appointed.  Fit and finish is excellent.  Quality materials...not a bunch of hard plastics, and all controls are easily accessible from the driving position.  The tilt/telescoping steering wheel has all of the audio, cruise control, and hands free bluetooth controls on it, so no fumbling around with knobs while driving.  The rear seating area has plenty of room for 2 adults...but 3 would be quite cramped.  Nice headroom in the front and back, although the sloping roof line does require me to tilt my head to the side a bit when entering the vehicle.  the sunroof provides a one touch open/close, as do the driver and passenger windows.  The seats are quite comfortable, and the power controls and lumbar in the drivers seat make it quite easy to adjust to fit your personal comfort level and driving position. The exterior is sharp!...very sporty.  Fit and finish is excellent. Just enough chrome accents to add to the appearance...however, I am not a big fan of the plastic fuel cover. It isn't cheaply made, but I have a feeling if you bumped into it just right, it is going to break...possibly snap off of it's hinges. I would prefer it if the cover were made of steel. Color options are limited...Silver, Black Cherry, White or Blue.  Mine is white...and I love how clean it looks...personal preference. The 18"" aluminium wheels are very nice, as are the Hancook tires.  The provide an additional inch of ground clearance over the base model, and I like that...especially when the snow comes.So...in summary...this is a great little vehicle that 1. Looks amazing, 2. Has a ton of features, 3. Drives and rides exceptionally well, and 4. Has a warranty the other cannot touch, 5. All for a price that is very consumer friendly.  All in all...5 stars!",5

My 6 cylinder gets better mileage. I also do not like the way it looks in the back, like a bubble. I know they have flatten the back hatch door with the new models , but the bubble made the truck look like a big bug in the back. I didn't notice until I purchased my Kia because it was in the showroom and the back hatch was open. Once I got it home, it was like oh my goodness!!! I haven't had any issues with the Sportage during the time I've been leasing it, however I constantly ask myself, why on earth did I put 4k down on this car, just to lease it when I had plenty of other choices?

It has leather seats, heated front seats, a 2.4L 4 cylinder engine (standard on both LX and EX models). Pricewise is very reasonable compared to the Mazda CX5.",5
4465, on 08/16/18 20:39 PM (PDT),Leo ,2018 Kia Sportage SUV LX 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Don't overlook this one...," If you're looking for a compact SUV then you'd  be making a huge mistake to overlook the Kia Sportage.  I had just moved and had a little bit more of a commute so I wanted something more comfortable than my Ranger, with better gas mileage.  When I started looking, what drew me in was the warranty and, as I looked more, the good reviews got me to test drive one.  I think the exterior can be somewhat polarizing but I like the look and I like the choice in colors besides black, blue, silver, white, and red.  Mine is copper and I think it looks great, and different from other cars on the road.  What really sold me on this SUV was the interior.  The quality, feel, fit and finish of the interior is outstanding.  It feels like a much more expensive vehicle than any sub $25k SUV has the right to be.  All the controls are laid out logically and you don't need an instruction manual to figure everything out.  You have multiple ways to control things, like the infotainment system.  On the base model LX I have a 5 inch touchscreen AM/FM/CD/SAT player with aux input, USB, bluetooth, and rearview camera.  I can control the system using the knobs and buttons, the touchscreen, or the steering wheel controls.  No cumbersome menus to go through, super simple to use and I think it sounds good.  As a plus I plug my iPod into the USB port and can also control it from the steering column.  The driver information system is controlled from the steering wheel and allows for a lot of adjustment to suit individual tastes.  The heating/AC system is also very easy to use and works well.  The LX only comes with single zone climate controls but I don't find that an issue for me.  The steering is nicely weighted and the handling is very good.  The six speed transmission is good and don't find it hunting for gears.   The main complaint that I see in professional reviews of the Sportage is the engine and gas mileage.  I think 181hp is more than adequate and I certainly don't have any trouble keeping up with California highway traffic in mine.  As for mileage, I commute about 13 miles one way to work on a back country, twisty 2 lane road with about a 1,000 ft elevation change and I average 25-26mpg.  I keep my Sportage in Eco mode and I didn't notice any difference in performance and I'm very happy that I can go over 2 weeks without having to fill it up.  Also, my Sportage is all wheel drive and I haven't noticed any mileage penalty for that either but I feel that it contributes to the great grip in corners that it has.  Another nice feature of the all wheel drive in the ability to lock the center differential which could come in handy this winter.  The LX also comes with standard with 17 inch alloy wheels which look great.  I would rate brake feel and overall braking as excellent.  The doors, both front and rear, have large openings that make entry and egress very nice, even for very tall people.  The drivers seat is very comfortable and has manual controls and nice shaping that even fits my large frame well.  Manual tilt and telescope steering column also allow the Sportage to adjust to a wide range of bodies.  The rear liftgate on the base LX isn't powered but I don't find that an issue.  The other major complaint I read about the Sportage was a lack of storage space, which was usually pegged at between 4-6 cubic ft less than it's competitors.  This hasn't been an issue for me and I think the storage space is more than ample for my needs and has plenty of tie downs to assist in organizing the space.  The base LX also has tinted rear windows and a soft cargo area cover to keep unnecessary eyes from prying.  Frankly, combining all these features on a base model LX with no options for less than $25k with Kia's outstanding warranty made this a no brainer for me.",5
4466, on 07/03/18 14:04 PM (PDT),JoeH ,2018 Kia Sportage SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Does all the wrong things right.," The 2018 Kia Sportage looks fine on paper. You can read various reviews that eschew the various good parts of the car. However, in classic reviewer fashion, they undersell the negative aspects of a car to make it look better. This is probably because they all get to test the top-of-the-line trims while us plebs are stuck with something less. When I bought my 2018 Kia Sportage LX FWD, I was expecting a ""softer, compliant, quiet ride"". What I got wasn't anywhere close to that. The car does have some good things about it. The infotainment system supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay (at least, my model does). The dual zone AC is a little much, but works nice. The interior is nice, the seats are okay (not bad but not great), and the storage area is enough for a couple with three dogs and no kids. The gas mileage is fine (I average about 25-26mph according to my instrument panel. Most roads I drive down are 45mph-ish). When it comes to drive-ability, the acceleration is decent enough for its size and the steering is also above average compared to most cars I test drove. However, where this car falls short is probably the most important part: the ride quality. In an effort to cut corners, I'm sure, Kia put the lest work into their suspension. This thing hits every bump and you feel every little thing in the cabin. That includes every tiny road imperfection, every little rock, every pothole, all of it. The dealership swears up and down that the springs will ""break in over time"", but even then, they said to expect maybe a 10-15% improvement. This is an SUV, not a race car, and the idea that the suspension is tuned and built in such a way that causes noticeable jostling and a fairly uncomfortable ride at even moderately low speeds baffles me. That's the joy of these cheaper Asian cars, I guess. They cut corners where you can't see them to deliver better experiences elsewhere. Lemme tell ya, I'd trade in the soft-touch plastic and the Audi-style interior design for the ability not to feel every tiny bump in the road. If you live somewhere where the roads are properly maintained and are basically flawless, this car will be fine. However, if you live in literally any city, this car will make you painfully aware of how little tax dollars your city spends on fixing roads in your area. I honestly feel bad for people in my back seat when they're there. Dealership says there's nothing I can do and that it's working ""perfectly normal"". If you're okay with a rougher ride, then this is otherwise a really nice car. However, if you're buying a crossover SUV because you want something comfortable that handles road flaws well, this is not the car for you. I recommend looking elsewhere if you want comfort.",3
4467, on 05/24/18 13:06 PM (PDT),Pat ,2018 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Well-made SUV," Suspension for the 2.0 Turbo AWD can be too stiff for some people. The trade off for the stiff suspension is good handling. I have no problem with the suspension. It feels kind of like the Mercedes I am driving, only not as supple. The vehicle seems to be well made. The interior design will probably suit most people, especially those who are used to European designs. The rear turn signals should be placed in a higher position and possibly made larger so that other drivers can see them. There is no heated seat for the second row seats. Heated second row seats are only available as an option for the EX model, and is not offered on the top of the line model!? Why is KIA doing this? KIA should make it a standard item in the LX model. It is available on the Hynudai Santa Fe Sport. This is one of the deal breakers for me. I ended up buying a different SUV.",5

We had looked at a number of 2018 sedans and SUV's, and this one fit or needs completely.  And, we got the 100K warrenty included.    The first thing that stood out was the instrument cluster and the comfort of the interior.  I was not all that happy with the miles per gallon, as I was only getting 23.6 as an average.  That is until we found the ECO mode.  It didn't seem to change the handling of the SUV, and the average went right up to 26.7 as an average.  We haven't even put on 1,500 miles yet and we both have acknowledged that it's the best car so far.  We're only 76 years young, so we've had a few cars in our time.  Try one, you'll really like it.

So on long trips the Sportage does not induce an excessive amount of driver fatigue.  The Sportage is a fun and agile vehicle to drive.  About the only weakness I noted was the heater was slower to put out warm air during cold weather as compared to most modern vehicles.,5
4472, on 03/02/18 04:45 AM (PST),The Ted ,2018 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Sportin' a Premium Sportage," Purchased a pacific blue/beige interior AWD SX, a bit over a month ago, after shopping for a replacement for my wife's 180,000 mile 2007 Mitsu Endeavor SE AWD.  We checked out/test drove the Mazda CX5 GT, Subaru Outback Limited 2.5, Ford Escape, and Nissan Rouge before making a decision to buy the KIA. We didn't test drive the Honda CR-V or a Chevy Equinox/GMC Terrain because she wasn't fond of their appearence (the CRV exterior looks low rent with all the plastic looking chrome stuck all over it). There were multiple things that sold us on the KIA over the others. The first of which was the premium, well designed interior that has more than enough room for us empty nesters. The interior quality and materials any better than any new Buick. There's enough room for a 6 foot + passenger to sit behind 6'1' me with no front seat position compromises. The second thing is how the KIA performs and feels. I feels solid like it is made out of one hunk of metal. No flexing or squeaking over bumps. It rides like a good german car. There's no float, it feels planted and its seriously quiet. KIA has come a very long way over the last 5 or 6 years. Acceleration to 60mph is sub-seven seconds and engine has very good low to mid-range torque. The last thing of note that sold us on the Sportage is its unique looks. It has a good stance and the satin finished and gloss black highlights compliments its shape nicely.I also own a 2012 KIA Forte5 SX which is my work commuter. It's been very reliable over the 75,00 miles I've driven it. Just normal maintenance and tires. But the difference between it and the Sportage fit and finish and build quality wise is nuts. There are couple things its missing that would of put the second cherry on the sundae. It lacks memory seat and mirrors and radar cruise.",5
4473, on 01/29/18 20:31 PM (PST),Colleen-801 ,2018 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Luxury in a Spunky mid range SUV.," I've shopped for an SUV since 2016 (in prep for my move to snow country). I was set on the Subaru Forrester originally so why did I buy the KIA?  In a nutshell... Comfort, warranty & pricing.  I drove the Sportage LX AWD 1st, then the Forrester.  Compared to the Sportage, the Forrester felt like a sturdy work horse (acceleration was better but road noise, comfort & sound system were so-so).  Acceleration was important but Subaru would not budge on the 38K sticker price so I went back to KIA and drove the Sportage SX Turbo GDI AWD.  The zippy Turbo,  Luxurious interior, sound system and low road noise made it a slam dunk.  I felt so pampered.  I drive a lot on rural roads so acceleration (for passing) is a MUST and the SX gets 5 stars.  For an SUV,  it has a tight turning radius, low road noise, Car Play Hands Free and a wonderful sound system.   The only things that do not surpass the Forrester are the mileage and visibility. (the Subaru made me feel a little exposed and vulnerable with all that glass tho). This SUV really feels like a luxury car. It  has 3 drive modes (ECO, sport and normal).   I've only used sport mode for the snow so far so cannot rate the 4 wheel drive lock feature. Speaking of the 4 wheel lock, it should be on the dash, not on the console.  I've set my purse on it and accidentally turned it on twice.  I'd like the front windows of the KIA to be higher at the curve because I hit my head a couple times when I got in (my legs are short and I like to sit high so I have the seat lifted to its max and almost all the way forward). My brother, however, is a large 6'2"" and had no problem when he adjusted the seat down and back.  His wife commented that the back seat is a lot more comfortable than her brother's Honda CRV.  When I can keep my foot out of it, I can get descent mileage but most of my road trips have mountains and rural roads so not the optimum conditions for maximizing the MPG (28 is the best, 23 worst). The car MPG gauge is pretty close to the calculated mileage if you zero it between fill-ups. The stirring wheel controls are very driver friendly and intuitive. (trip instrumentation, cruise controls,  hands free etc) but I am not crazy about the Navigation system. The graphics and screen size are awesome and the route guidance accurate but controls are not at all intuitive. The Nav system also only lets you save 10 favorites. The backup camera shows the vehicle angle in red plus where you will go (in yellow) if you do not adjust.   I learn a little more each trip but may have to resort to reading the Nav system & Multi Media manuals to get the full benefit.  I've only had this car a month so I really can't rate reliability but I have put 2500 on the odometer in road trips and this car is great to drive.  I highly recommend the Sportage SX Turbo GDI AWD.Update 7 months later: I've driven this car for almost 7000 miles & I still love it.  I upgraded the safety to 5 stars because visibility was just a matter of adjusting from a small car and using the mirrors.  I would give the airconditioning 6 stars if they had a catagory for airconditioning. Cooling a large space like the Sportage interior quickly is a big deal.  The air conditioning kicks hinny in this high desert summer.  I have an older everyday care but always drive the Sportage on the hot days.    The car still feels like luxury, and still has a new car smell.   I downgraded the interior to 4 stars because there are some things that really bug me.  1) I metioned in the inital review, is the  4-wheel Lock being on the console. No matter how careful I am I still set something on it occasionally and accidently turn it on.  2) There is no button to open the hatch from the inside.  There should be a button so when I pick my grandson up from one of his sporting events  I can hit the button so he can dump his gear in the back without having to get out and open it.  There's a button that locks the hatch so it can't be opened but not one for opening it.  They definitely need to add that in 2019.  3)  My gas cap lock does not work.  It is supposed to lock if the doors are locked but doesn't.  4) I had need to unlock the door manually once and my key did not work. At least I thought it didn't.  Even the tow truck driver did not know that the little slot on the underside of the door handle is not for the key but a button that pops off a cap over the actual lock.  That adds absolutely nothing to the attractiveness of the car and is confusing even to the service department in most shops.  It serves on purpose.  The lumbar/seat adjustment and comfort are outstanding.   I am still happy I bought the KIA over the Subaru and highly recommend this SUV.  I love it more than when I bought it.   Best mileage is 28, worst 23 mpg.  I still feel the trade off for the speed and luxury of this vehicle is worth the lower mpg.",5

4476, on 01/15/18 02:18 AM (PST),kinglerch ,2018 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),"A surprising 5 star car, with some caveats"," PROS: Truly a good looking and unique looking SUV in a field of station wagon looking models. Great features including a very well laid out and intuitive control system. For example, turning on the rear wipers initiates a status change on the dash info area letting you know the wiper change. Parking assist beeping uses the stereo system so you know where the obstruction is without even looking. Every feature (almost) is customizable, if you don't want the auto liftgate, for example. A very fun car to drive, which is a hard to put on paper feature. Also an easy to follow feature and model set, compared to say the RAV4 which has (if you can believe) 10 different models that cannot even all fit on a screen to tell which is which. The visibility is astounding and the sunroof is almost like a convertible. And on the Turbo model the power is unreal, almost feels too fast for an SUV, but again fun to drive. CONS: The biggest con is the MPG, which is truly crap. However, even the much heralded Subaru Forester is just 5MPG higher than the Kia which translates to about $200/year. Not nothing but not worth paying thousands more for the Subaru. The reality is that car companies should not be crowing about 5MPG here and there, most SUVs get crap MPG. In 2018 MPG should all be in the 30s or 40s and not crowing about tiny differences in MPG. OTHER: I am a bit confused about the features that are available worldwide that are not standard throughout. Such as heated front windshield, heated rear seats, wireless charger, auto parking assist (SPAS system), etc depend not on what you spend but where you live....seems odd. Storage is an odd thing to complain about in this SUV because it is one of the smallest SUVs in it's class. It of course won't store more than a car that is a foot longer, but it's also going to be easier to maneuver. Kia also included a unique ""Auto Hold"" feature that keeps the brake applied when at stop lights to avoid foot fatigue or accidental rear endings...but oddly you have to turn it on manually every time you start the car. So there are quirks but they are minor in a sea of great. NOTE: I have only owned the SUV for a few weeks so I can't comment on the reliability but I will if something noteworthy occurs.",4

I chose the Sportage because it was the only vehicle with all the tech I wanted within my budget. The three must have features I was looking for were; Harman/Kardon sound, AWD, and ventilated seats. The Sportage has all of these plus some nice active safety features. I drove it and was quite impressed with the power and comfort of the vehicle.  The interior fit and finish looked and felt better than some of the competitive brands (Honda and Toyota) I test drove. The ride is sporty and responsive. I was driving the car last night (January 4th, 2018) and the check engine light came on.  This really disappointed me and I have lost some thrill for the car as it’s brand new and this shouldn’t be the case. We will see how the future pan out with the car. Major points lost for this and I did check the gas cap to see if I forgot to put it on proplerly. Gas cap was seated properly and I’m anxious to see what the dealership says.",3

We started out looking at the same old/same old Rav 4 and CRV. They were both boring. Maybe it's because the styling is getting dated on both of these utes. We checked out the Sportage after seeing a couple on the road. The dealer had just got in the SX in a really nice color (Mineral Gray). One test drive and we were sold. Performance, style and price sold us on this car. That was in April. Now it's October and the only thing we have had to do is change the oil.

The car's steering is touchy, but was easy to get comfortable with. The Sportage replaced my 99 Jeep Cherokee and feels roomier than the jeep, though I'm pretty sure it's smaller. The Sportage looks good, drives smooth and had more basic features than other cars I had checked out. I went for the EX model because I am vain and really wanted the big shiny rims, and also fog lights. The model with the navigation screen and panoramic roof looks amazing, but is too much to pay for a Kia. I went the last day of the month and was able to get the car at dealer cost. I'd suggest everyone do the same for whatever car you are looking to buy. ",4.875

I look past that older one to my brand new one sitting in the parking lot, and I can't believe they wear the same label.  I drove an '06 for three years and only got rid of it because my lease was up. I bought a high mileage accord because I didn't want a payment, but after a year and a half, I decided it was time for something new. I checked out the Soul but decided it was too small.

When buying, the brands I considered were RAV4, CR-V, Santa Fe. The good thing about getting a Kia is the ability to negotiate a suitable price. Honda and Toyota's are a little too stubborn to do so. But really, the vehicle has an awesome build quality and drivability. I was surprised by the quality of the vehicle, especially comparing it to the previous Sportage.

KIA got it right with this one what can I say?",5
4665, on 06/29/10 18:49 PM (PDT),Ladybug ,2007 Kia Sportage SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Nice little SUV," I bought my '07 Sportage used with 27K miles on it for only $11K from a Ford dealership. While test-driving it, the salesman, who had never been in the car before, exclaimed how much better it rode and how much quieter it is than an Escape. Having had a KIA before, I was more than happy to purchase another one. After 3 months I've been very happy with this car. It's simple and practical, which is what I wanted. I have the 4 cylinder, and it definitely isn't real zippy when entering freeways, but if you don't mind a little engine whine, you can push it without it getting near the redline. Since most of my driving is done on surface roads, the acceleration is more than adequate for my needs. ",4.75

Within 2 months, 2 fuses blew and I had to have the brake light replaced. In April 2010, with only 36,000 miles on the car, I needed a new transmission. (Under warranty, but not the point)!

Has been very reliable aside from nagging ""ESC OFF"" issue.  The ""ESC OFF"" illuminates on the dash due to a faulty ""brake switch"" as defined by a Kia recall for several of its models.  I have had to have this replaced three times now (under warranty).  Aside from that, brakes wore out after only 35000 miles and had to be replaced ($459).  Cheap OEM Bridgestones tires needed to be replaced after 27,000 miles.  Put Michelin Hydroedge tires on and it rides much better.  Service at 60,000 miles will be costly as well.

I finally decided on a Kia Sportage and I think I made one of the best choices in a car that I have ever made. It has a 5 star rating, and it was not bad on my budget while I feel that I got a decent small SUV with a good warranty for my money. It has averaged about 22-23 mpg overall, but that is not bad compared to other SUV's on the market at the moment.

We looked at the CR-V, but it was not available with a V6. Also, was about 10K more when compared to our fully loaded KIA. Also, the KIA has a better warranty. This car is excellent for the price. The 4X4 w/ESC and TRAC is GREAT in the snow and ice. Leather heated seats & remote start are nice and a must for cold weather users. Not impressed with the gas mileage.

It is very nimble in curvy mountain driving, and excellent in climbing grades with the alternate manual shift feature.  It gets excellent mileage for a 6 cylinder car (20 around town; 25 on the highway at 70 mph), and cruises well on long distance drives.  While there is some road noise on some road surfaces, it is not a major problem.  I recently had to move quite a few large boxes and was able to accommodate them in the vehicle with all but the driver's seat laid flat.  A nice feature.",5

In addition, after 24,000 miles I had to replace the Bridgestone tires.  Furthermore, the transmission shifts roughly sometimes when you need it going up hills, or trying to pass.  The cooling fan sometimes sound like there is a knocking in the engine.   I travel on avg. 1000-1200 miles per week with the kia and it handles very well and the ride is smooth for a SUV.

A happenstance visit to a Kia dealer changed all that.  One week later I returned to purchase my Silver EX Luxury Edition Sportage.  Why? Styling, bang for my $$, fuel economy and standard features found only as options on similar vehicles.  I'm not disappointed.  The interior is plush and the exterior is eye-catching.

There is one problem when the highway you hear the road too much but everything else is great. I recommend it for a family of 4 or 5.  The trunk space is really good and the seats fold flat to make the trunk bigger.  It is a great car, looks kind of sporty andhas a nice touch to it.  It could use more power but that's ok.",4.625

It's quiet when the doors are closed to road noise. It's the first luxury car/truck I've ever owned. I keep finding small key extras.

This baby is the Korean Energizer Bunny! I bought it new in July 2010, at over 139,000 miles, the only two times I needed help for it were a dead battery and a $2.99 O ring in the radiator that failed on my way to work one morning. Maintenance is not cheap, but worth it for a car that faithfully gets you where you're going. The only negatives are the awkward headrests (took a while to get it into a position that allows my head to remain upright) and the ride is a bit like a pickup truck--a non-luxury one. Gas mileage is great; averaging 28 MPG, all non-highway driving. My daily commute is 54 miles total, half 55 mph and half stop-and-go 45 MPH or less. I do play the lights when possible to avoid wasting time and gas that way. Have replaced tires twice. Took it on a 3k mile trip last summer; it loved the open road.

4709, on 12/12/16 06:34 AM (PST),Rob ,2014 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Even Better Second Time Around!," I bought a new Kia Sportage in 2009 without knowing much about the line or manufacturer, however they had great rebate incentives and a solid warranty. At 96,000 miles, after only routine maintenance and new tires, I traded it in for this upgraded version. After two years of driving my 2014 Sportage SX, I still enjoy it every time behind the wheel. The quality and safety are reliable and the same as I expected, fuel economy could probably be a little better, however I bought this one because of the turbo and it does impact the performance. For those saying it has stiff suspension, you are correct, because it's the sportier design with the turbo the suspension is stiffer for the sport performance and handling. The fuel economy is better when I use the eco mode button, however that's not why I bought the SX. It's a small SUV which works well for hauling kids and groceries with average fuel efficiency, in my opinion, and does the job of something expected in this range of vehicles. I've not had any trouble getting around in the Minnesota winters with it driving on ice and snow, although it doesn't like the extremely cold weather and the fuel use does increase driving below freezing. Why I still enjoy driving it though is not the reliability and safety it provides; it's because of the turbo and the giddyup with which this car moves. It's just fun to drive. Perhaps it's just me because this is the first car I've had with a turbo that can get up and go while cutting in and out of traffic or around curves without feeling like it's getting too tippy. It looks sharp, the interior features are great for the vehicle, ventilated seats are nice in the hot summer with the leather, but not a deal breaker. If you purchase this thinking it's comparable to luxury SUV's out there because it's the top Sportage model, then you'll be disappointed.

Seats are uncomfortable, they have no way to adjust lumbar support in lower back, the steering wheel doesn't come down enough so if you want to put your arms on the armrest you have to rotate which arm is driving. I got the same gas mileage in the Mustang that I get in this POS, It has no power to go, even turning the damn ECO off its like waiting for the hamster in the wheel to catch up...... I fill up at least twice a week, even if I take it easy and drive like a grandpa it just sucks. Unfortunately I am stuck in this damn thing for at least two years or unless someone runs a stoplight or stop sign and takes the whole front end off, which I hope for every time I get behind the wheel, I would get out and hug them afterwards and thank them. I think the only thing I like about it is the color and the height. That's about it....",1

Transmission problems with only 20K miles," My opinion about this car has changed since my previous review. Over 20 000 miles, this car began to present a problem with the transmission, which is very disengaging, in such a new car. The problem was that sometimes I stopped the car in a stop sign or a light, and when I tried to move  it again, I accelerated, but the car barely moved, after about 30-40 seconds, I could feel  like a blow or jolt and then the transmission responded and the car start to move normally again. After reporting the problem 3 times on Kia dealers, they finally replaced the transmission. I do not know if it was bad luck or low quality Kia, but I definitely choose to replace this car with another make and model; and at this point I recommend a lot of caution to all buyers who are considering buying a Kia.",1
4713, on 03/07/16 11:48 AM (PST),Leslie Ray ,2014 Kia Sportage SUV LX 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Best Kia I've Had So Far!," I've seen some other reviews here that are not particularly generous. I've owned three Kias prior to my current (just acquired) 2014 Kia Sportage. The first two were 2006 and 2007 Kia Spectras (purchased new), both had very comfortable seats, drove well, the 2006 was totaled when I was hit head on (thankfully, the airbags deployed and I wasn't injured in the least). I had the 2007 for 4 years before I decided to purchase a larger vehicle to use for transporting event equipment for my small business. I purchased a 2011 Kia Sportage (new) and while it served most of my needs, I found the front bucket seats to be VERY uncomfortable compared to the Spectra seats. I sold my 2011 Kia Sportage recently and purchased a used 2014 Kia Sportage with only 12K miles on it. The previous owner traded it in citing complaints with the engine. Kia replaced the engine with new, and I picked up the car soon after. So far, I absolutely LOVE the 2014 Kia Sportage! The body went through something of a change since 2011...the front grill is much snazzier (beehive pattern, as opposed to the old straight lines on the 2011). The wheels are much better quality and have an improved look to them. The seats are a LOT more comfortable than the seats in the 2011 Sportage, although still not quite as comfortable as the seats in the Spectra, which was more of an economy car (go figure). The 2014 drives much more smoothly than the 2011; it's quieter, and feels more solid (including the way the doors close--less of a ""clang"", more of a heavy ""clunk"". The transition between gears on the 2014 is smoother than the 2011. Bluetooth is MUCH improved in the 2014...the voice is soothing, not irritatingly loud and annoying like the Bluetooth voice in the 2011. I've also noticed that it is much more accurate in terms of interpreting my commands. I like the upgraded buttons on the stereo console--they look sharp, not cheap. The 2014 I purchased has the same parking sensors that the 2011 did, but it also has the backup camera that comes on when you put the car in reverse. This is a feature I had wanted in the 2011, but they wanted another $2500 for it, so I opted not to get it at the time. The 2011 also came with mud flaps, but at the price of $300, I told them to take them off...I wasn't going to pay for them. The 2014 has the flaps, and I like the look as well as the functionality. Overall, I'm very pleased with the 2014 Kia Sportage so far. However, if you previously had a higher quality SUV/Crossover, you will notice the difference and you may not be impressed. For me, the value one gets with the standard features on a Kia, as well as the safety rating and the warranty, make Kia an excellent buy, and I am a loyal Kia owner. (And, no one paid me to say that. Lol.)Update: I've had my 2014 Kia Sportage a while now and I'm still very pleased with it. The braking is much smoother than it was on the 2011 Sportage, and it still drives so much better than the 2011. I did have an issue with a sound that seemed to be emanting from the muffler since I last posted, it turned out that there was a break in a solder joint. Took it in to the dealership for service, and they took care of it right away, no problem. I'm happy to say that the service department at the Kia dealership has been excellent so far (I started going to a dealership a little further from me). Overall, I'm still quite pleased with my 2014 Sportage.",4
4714, on 11/15/15 20:34 PM (PST),KJ ,2014 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Hate/like relationship with this vehicle!," I purchased a new 2014 KIA Sportage SX. I have owned the vehicle just shy of two years; now at 3,600 miles. I have avoided driving it due to the damage done to the dash by the KIA dealerships (makes me furious when I get in the vehicle). The overall vehicle appearance is nice; not the most comfortable vehicle and somewhat of a sloppy ride. It has decent power; would say fair. The UVO (navigation/stereo) is a major sore spot. The unit gives error messages in Korean (not helpful in U.S.), no one at KIA can provide any interpretation information. The unit locks up repeatedly; has been replaced 4 times (10 trips to dealerships). The only way I have been able to keep the music playing is to remove the SD card and hit the reset button repeatedly after it locks up. It became a source of entertainment having friends laugh about the Korean messages; the incorrect navigation (evidently normal per KIA). KIA needs some serious work on their customer service! It would be a decent vehicle if KIA could get rid of the useless technology that does not function correctly and provide a decent service center.",3

With less than 14,000 miles on it we have had it towed back to the dealer twice because it left us flat without starting. So far not very reliable. I also do not like getting in or out of the car. I hit my head a lot. Only being 5'.7"" tall, this not something I'm a custome to.  In addition the car is loud and forget about opening windows or sun roof. The strangest whistles, howls, and hums we ever heard. So far easily, without question, the worst new car we ever owned. Compared to the comfort and reliability of the 96 VW Jetta, 04 Saturn Vue, and 03 Dodge Van which we bought all new, and that all went 100,000 miles each without need for a tow truck. I would buy each one of those vehicles again but I have no interest in even getting back into our 2014 Kia Sportage ever again, let alone ever buying it again. Sorry Kia, looks aren't everything.  You gotta do better than this.",3

I have long been dreaming for an SUV, but didn't expect to find one in the $15K price range I was aiming for. Stumbled upon the Kia dealership, and was impressed with the RAV4 & Forester matching features of the Kia in such an affordable package. I've had it for 3 weeks now and am overall impressed. Horsepower is a bit lacking, but fuel economy is decent (23 mpg on my first tank, 90% city). Handling is secure, if not sports-car-like. Interior is ergonomic, durable, & comfortable without the silly frills found in other cars of this segment. Easily the most bang for the buck in the small SUV category.",4.5

My car came with cruise control and a sunroof and a v6 engine with 60,000 mile warranty and 3 months of satellite radio.

This is my second KIA, I find the quality is excellent. The sportage also has plenty of storage and room to handle my 3 kids and their gear. I owned a 07 Honda, i find the finish superior on the Kia.

The KIA appeared to offer better features for the lowest price. I was not disappointed, it has great features and is very well built. While not a powerhouse the engine offers sufficient power for highway driving. The seating layout and flexibility is well done providing real flatbed storage. The transmission is smooth. I wish that KIA offered a larger tyre option, but it is not a major flaw. The finish and engineering are of high quality. The entertainment system, bluetooth and component inputs make offer more luxury features than are found on many prestige cars.

4768, on 04/08/16 09:09 AM (PDT),Sharon ,2016 Kia Sportage SUV SX 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Read and Research Before you Purchase," This was our first Kia and all is not what is said about this little car.  We have the SX with a turbo engine.  The gas mileage is terrible.  Our Hummer H3 did better than this Kia.  The front and rear seats are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in.  Very hard and uncomfortable.  The navigational buttons are all over the place.  Some on the left, some on the right but no rhyme or rhythm on any of them.  The turbo will automatically kick in at a high speed and the car takes out from under you.  The turbo engine is very very fast and takes off out from under you.  The biggest problem is that i am 5'3"" and I hit my head on the door entry every time I get in the car.  The door/head clearance is deplorable.  The sunroof position because i have to have the seat forward is behind me so it does me no good to have the sunroof open because it is behind me so to see out I have to look up and behind me. When they [pn they positioned the sunroof they set it back way too far.   We tried to call the dealer after the first week to tell them this car would not work but after six weeks and 51 calls the dealer would never call me back.  I even tried to call the owner of the dealership to tell him this car was not working out for us but he also refused to call.  The very worst thing about this car is the back sunroof is cosmetic only.  It will not open but there is a sunshade that you have to open with your hand which means you literally have to pull the car off the road and climb into the back seat and open the sunshade to see out the back sunroof and the same with closing it.  This I find to be cheap and ""cheesy"" for such an expensive car of this class.  From the outside this car is a beauty and very sporty and and eye catcher but that is where this car stops.  I find it to be unsatisfactory in all fields except it is a joy to drive.  You have to try to ignore the blind spots, which are there, the extremely small back storage with zero to no light.  The only thing good about this car is driving it.  Other than that just go out and buy a Hyundai Santa Fe because for the price that is a better car but not as sporty and as flashy as the Kia SX.  Other than that if you want to drive fast this is the car to have because this is a car that goes fast in a few short seconds.  We made a mistake in purchasing this car and the trade in value of this car is zero to nothing. For the best Kia in this class the products used are how it was made was cheap and cheesy. Then make sure you deal with a dealer who will let you return the car for another if you decide to buy.  Our Kia dealer would not even return one out of 51 calls over a period of six weeks.  We are now paying for a car we hate and a dealer who refuses to make good on what they promised which was if you do not like it we will get you into something that suits you.  A better choice would have been a Kia Sorento.",4

I wanted a smaller SUV for my family, it's me, my wife, and two toddlers.  Comfort of interior is pretty decent and we love the steering wheel (really comfortable). Ride quality is firm but I like it, I don't understand how anybody would want a ""loose"" suspension/ride.  We got a pretty big snow storm recently and it did great and the AWD didn't even kick on.  It's a very easy vehicle to drive, the only two complaints I have are the gas mileage is not as good as I'd like it to be, it averages out to around 22mpg.  The second is that it can be hard to see any other vehicles when changing lanes.  Overall I'm pretty happy with it and I think it was a pretty good buy, I would recommend it to anybody.",4

My grand daughter loved it because with the stadium back seat she could see out easily. One thing I wish I had checked before buying is how back seats fold up to enlarge cargo space. Since they fold up against the front seats at least 8 possible inches are lost. I bought it to be my ridge runner when living in Big Sur, which it was 'excellent' for size-wise and 4x4, and its safety features, structurally better than other baby SUVs of the period, as it is a small truck frame and drives like a small truck; has cross beams in the doors and an extra air bag for driver's knees. I never had to do anything except regular maintenance, as the only major thing that ever went wrong was shortly after I bought it and warrantee totally covered it. It has been rear ended 3 times, progressively worse each time, and fully repaired the first 2 times. This last time hit and run while it was parked, at a speed high enough to throw it about 20 feet forward, frame was bent in back, but was still totally drivable and seemed structurally sound except for the smashed rear lift door and spare tire. I let it go so its heart could be transplanted into another, but I miss it terribly. I was the only owner and was quite happy with it, regardless of the cosmetic interior complaints.

Then this winter I had problems with putting fuel in my tank; kept flowing back out at me. Accelerator sensor replaced 3 times.

Gas mileage improves with every tank.  Great, smooth ride. I drove 3 different Hondas and no one ever pulled up next to me at a light to ask me about my Honda, but they have about both of my Kia's.  People are curious.  I love my Sportage, I loved my Sorento and I would recommend them to anyone. Oh, and I took it up to Breckenridge and over Loveland Pass a month ago and it performed flawlessly.",4.75

I WAS averaging about 18.6 mpg at first. But after the first month and a half, and driving it like I had 1 gallon left in the tank, I was pleasantly surprised to see my mileage increase to 24.3 average mpg. I have noticed that despite HIGH gas prices, it doesn`t seem to slow anyone down...why? I think if most of you just stopped romping on the gas, you would find the mileage posted for the vehicle is quite accurate, and you should be doing your part to save fuel anyway. Stop trying to race everyone, and you`ll pay a lot less. I absolutely LOVE this vehicle; you should too!",5

I do think that the steering and brakes could use some improvement, however. I had two problems right off the lot, the turn signal shaft and a belt needed to be replaced.

4924, on 02/08/16 17:22 PM (PST),MW ,2013 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Ideal for a tight budget," Last winter I had to part ways with my beautiful 2004 orange Pontiac GTP.  I loved that car ~ but I could not keep up with repairs after the electrical started to fail (bought used, had more problems than I was aware of at the time).So after car shopping for months (because I was reluctant to let go of a beautiful car) I settled upon a Kia Soul+.  I knew a couple of people that had one and never complained about it.  So let me tell you the perks of owning one.Seating is comfortable, for both drivers and passengers.  Visibility is great - unlike my Pontiac I've yet to encounter a blind spot while driving.  Steering is sensitive, acceleration is nice - though I'm not impressed with the noise (sounds like a fart car compared to my Pontiac).  Out of all the vehicles I test drove, I felt comfortable behind the wheel and actually felt the car was from this galaxy when I checked out the entertainment bit.  You have a usb port, a jack, two lighter sockets, and the controls on the steering (volume, blue tooth call, etc) are easy to learn.  Millage is good - if you have proper tires, and filled properly, and use your cruise control and don't drive like you're in the Daytona 500 you may get more millage than you expect.  I'm getting about 30 in the city, and 32 on the highway.Now for the cons... It's not a fan of bumps.  You'll feel them unfortunately.  I once went over a bump so hard I nearly popped out of my seat! If you're in the US, you're missing out on the rear parcel shelf - it's a hard top that doubles as a privacy shield to hide your things in your trunk.  Google it and buy one - don't waste your time with the flimsy canvas stores and dealerships try to sell you.  The wheel; it's nice, but if you're used to a larger wheel size it can take some getting use to.  I once hit what I thought was my horn in the parking lot to alert a distracted driver and instead hit my blue tooth call button.  Speaking of blue tooth, it syncs better with an iPhone.  I have an android and even though I'm able to sync for calling, it doesn't sync/provide volume for when I try using my phone for maps or music.  Lastly.... THE TIRES! THE TIRES ARE TERRIBLE.  They're fine at a 16"" for snowy weather, but the brand they have on their is TERRIBLE.  If it comes with Nexen - ditch the wheels straight away.  I tried driving on them in my Pontiac and they were not suited for winter, despite saying all season tires.  Hankooks are a little better but I still wouldn't recommend it - buy yourself some proper tires.  If your dealership tries to sell you something other wise, take it to a trusted mechanic for better tires or google what the best tires for a Kia Soul would be.  Lastly.... if you're thinking about getting a Soul Base - don't do it, at least if you live in a snowy climate like I do.  The wheel size is smaller as is the engine.  Spend the extra cash and get yourself a Kia+!",4
4925, on 10/25/15 18:56 PM (PDT),Soulman44 ,2013 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Definitely a Soulman," The Kia Soul is the best of the econoboxes, and it's not really that close. I took a very hard look at the Scion XB, as I'm a fan of most things Toyota (particularly the original MR2), but it was an odd combination of too quirky yet too heavy and grown up. The Honda Element is all of the same traits amplified, but with worse still gas mileage. The Nissan Cube is quirky too, but very light and efficient with great gas mileage. However, it's not large enough for passengers, at least not in comparison to the Soul. The Cube also has poor visibility out and an uncomfortable seating position, IMO. Then comes the Kia Soul, which simply does everything right while looking great and driving sweetly. One can opt for the 2.0 liter with a manual for a healthy dose of sport, but I prefer the better mpg of the 1.6. It still accelerates strongly due to its low weight, but keep it out of the revs and you can return 31 mpg in Suburbia-type traffic with lots of stop and go. This is my first manual with 6+ forward gears, and the Soul really makes the most of them. I haven't done any 60 mph highway drives, but I would fully expect this to get 40 mpg in true highway driving. What else? The stereo with Aux in, USB for charging (or a billion songs on a thumb drive), bluetooth for phone audio or calls, great ergonomics, a huge glovebox, great visibility all around, and a very comfortable drive. I also do my own maintenance and repairs, and was blown away the first time I popped the hood. Room! Room galore for hands and wrenches. The only criticism I can imagine is that there is some road noise, but no more than my wife's very comfortable Odyssey. Some of that is likely tire noise, but you can tell that they left off some noise dampening  to keep the weight and price down. It's not bad by any means, but it's the only thing I can think of that is less than ideal with the Soul, even with the base. Ebay has sheets of sound deadening material for sale, and I'm doing that next. This car is highly recommended. I'll be shocked if I don't have at least one Soul in our driveway 10 years from now.",5

So comfortable to get inside and out.  I owned a 1960 Austin Healey 3000.  I always compare this autos steering to that car.  It handles beautifully.  My friends are always very surprised at the comfort.  The large engine is really zippy.  I just have no complaints against this auto.,5

Nice interior.  Lots of room (I'm 6'4"").  Good entertainment system in my base model.  BUT, with just 12000 miles on the odometer, I've got a rattle in the front suspension AND the steering column.  The big negative for the Soul is the suspension.  Everyone describes it as firm.  I'd say brutally, and unnecessarily stiff.  If you are fortunate enough to drive nothing but new pavement, you will love this vehicle.  Real world roads bring out the worst in the Soul's road manners.  I drive 22 miles to work, and I've been introduced to every pavement fault along the route.  You soon learn to avoid the big ones, or suffer the bone jarring consequences.  But, even the small irregularities are magnified to uncomfortable proportions.  Lots of road noise...suspension rumbles...now I know why the hamsters have the music cranked up.  If you are considering a Soul, give it a good real world test drive, or rent one for a weekend.",2

It's my first one, and so far I love it. If it proves to be reliable over time, I will probably drive a Kia Soul forever. It is the perfect car for my needs: I'm single & only occasionally have passengers, so I don't need a huge car, but I'm also active and sometimes need to pack my car up with camping gear & strap my 16' kayak on top. The back seats are roomy for when I do have passengers (the car has plenty of head clearance for tall people). I live in the south so I don't need AWD. I love how easy the Soul is to maneuver (it turns on a dime) and to drive; it handles very well, to the point that I often feel comfortable enough to steer one-handed. It seems compact from the outside, but inside it feels very roomy. The backup camera is great, and I was pleasantly surprised at how wide the view is. The hatch is convenient, and with the seats down there's plenty of room for gear or a bicycle. I'm not an extravagant person, so I enjoy that this car has character and is cute, but is also utilitarian, without a ginormous touchscreen and over-the-top bells & whistles all over the dash. Another surprise: the driver seat is SUPER comfortable. I have lower back pain on longer car trips, but the seats are comfy and have great lumbar support. There are a few things I would improve: the MPG is lower than I'd like (~26 overall) and sometimes I feel as though I have to gun it a bit to get the car to accelerate appropriately. However, I knew both of these things were criticisms going in (mine is not turbo-charged) and I can live with both, easily.

I have drive HUNDREDS of cars, many weekly to and from the airport destinations. There is no car I more highly recommend to clients than the Kia Soul for overall VALUE for your dollar, comfortable seats, massive storage cabin, and versatile capability.  Millions of owners agree, which is why Kia Soul has earned the public support to make Soul the #1 selling Kia vehicle. The 2018 Kia Soul ranked #1 in Compact Cars.   It has earned respect and accolades every year and ever since it first hit the market.  Consumer Reports states it is ne of the few to be known as the most reliable vehicle on the road today. It is affordable, fun to drive, and popular with all age groups.  Insurance safety score is based on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash test ratings and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration safety ratings safety ratings have declared the Soul one of the safest vehicles on four wheels.   The one single thing about the Soul that I like is that it brings pleasure to so many.  I have often chatted with owners to find them delighted with their vehicle and willing to share their recommended joy.",5

Remember that this is an entry level economy car. Keeping that criteria in mind and you will not find a better value considering the 10 year warranty. No other manufacturer is standing by that long to keep your car running tops. The one issue I have found is that the fuel mileage is not as good as it should be for a 1.6L 4cyl. Mine is the 6 speed automatic and I average 27-30 mpg with a mix of driving. If you drive really easy and with great care, you can get the average up to 30-33 mpg. That is a lot less than is shown on the sticker. I can still say that it is very nice car for running around town and will hold quite a bit of storage when the seats are folded down. No regrets on this little car so far. I have put about 22K miles on it.",5

Love and use the under floor storage in the back.  Don't feel cramped in the seats which are very comfortable.  Our trip via car to Las Vegas from Minnesota was very nice.

In that time I have made the following observations. It is important to keep in mind that this is a base vehicle. I see it filling a niche was owned by the VW Bug, with technology and comfort. My 1.6 130 hp with an automatic transmission is plenty of motor for this car. The mileage is amazing and I love all the technology that tells me about my consumption and range.  I find that I drive a bit slower in this vehicle for some reason. Getting in and out are important to me and this is done with ease. I wish the front seat had a few more adjustments but it is fairly comfortable. The Soul is easy to drive and the ergonomics are good. The technology is easy to understand and use for an older driver like me, love the Bluetooth.. This vehicle is easy to park and navigate well in tighter areas. The one real knock on the Soul is that its smaller windows create very dangerous blind spots. If you don't have a warning system and I don't, the passenger side has a huge driver's blind spot. The drivers side is also bad but not as bad. Overall I am delighted with my KIA Soul.",4

I had been searching and test drove quite a few vehicles and walked away from each disappointed about something.  That was not the case with this one.  The ride is smooth and the EXCLAIM is very quick.  I used to drive a smaller hatchback and got tired of having essentially fall into my car.  With the soul, the seats are at waist height and I quite literally just walk into my seat.  Just yesterday, I took a friend out in it who owns a truck and he mentioned this very thing.  He was saying he has to climb up into his truck and loves that you can just walk into the seat.  I said the same thing regarding my golf (as you just read).  I also got the Tech Package and I am very pleased with the sound system.  It is superb.  Definitely not a miss there.  The audio controls actually make sense and is very easy to navigate.  I test drove some cars that were just way too complicated (looking at you Honda).  We don't want complicated while we're driving.  I want to push 2 buttons max to get where I want and do what I want.  The fuel economy is actually lower than advertised, and that's kind of a bummer.  I drive mostly (that's 90%) interstate and am lucky if I break 28 overall.  The A/C unit is not what I'd call amazing.  There are definitely better A/C units out there.  Other than that... very comfortable.  Drives great.  Turns on a dime (better than my Hatchback did, but the hatchback handled like a dream... cuz it's a hatchback).  I am not at all disappointed and would highly recommend it.  Also, Kia's warranty kind of tells a story of a company who's not afraid to offer a high warranty because they have faith in their product.  Seriously, their warranty is twice as good as anyone else's.  Highly recommended.",5

Enter the 2017 Kia Soul ! and its 1.6L turbo engine. The engine isn't the problem with this car. The problem is that it is only available on the Exclaim model and the Exclaim has added and subtracted a few things. They've added a red strip that goes around the bottom of the exterior and gave the interior Leather/cloth seats with orange stitching. They didn't make the Soul a race car by any means, they just added an engine that gave it enough power not to feel like you had to floor it everywhere you went. So why would they make it like a kids toy and add stupid little things like that? On to the list of things that are gone.  The front cooled seats are no longer an option and the heated front seats are still there but  now only have 2 heat settings instead of 3. Those items are still available on the Soul +. So instead of getting the Soul ! that used to be the top trim level you're getting a Soul ! that isn't even fully loaded.

My Soul has about 21,000 miles on it and it's still like brand new. Still looks great, sounds great, runs great, and everything still works on it like it just rolled off the showroom floor. I have a base model with alloy wheels, so I have the model with the 1.6L engine, which serves me well. It gets me where I want to go comfortably and with pretty great style. The interior is well made, great materials, and the electronics are intelligent and work very well.  Driving the soul is a fun experience. It rides very smoothly and feels incredibly sturdy and handles high highway speeds with ease. Getting in and out of this car is easy. I'm 6'0 tall and not too skinny and I fit in and out with ease.

Program in a destination, and if anyone bumps the touch screen when its displaying the mapped route, the Nav system will  reroute you to where ever you bumped the screen.  I have had it reroute me into lakes, mountains with no access roads etc. Its ridiculous. It should splash a screen asking you to verify that you want to reroute your trip. Nope it just does it.  Absolutely the most poorly programmed computerized system I have ever had the mis-fortune of buying. KIA!!!   FIX IT AND LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE. The car its self is a great little car.

4996, on 05/16/16 23:23 PM (PDT),Ian Dogole ,2015 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Inferno Red Plus Mostly Delights," In the late summer of 2015, my 2000 Honda CR-V, which had performed flawlessly for 15 years, began to have some issues and I  commenced searching for its successor. I was set on purchasing a 2015 Honda Fit, but in August the model and color (red) I wanted wasn't available in Northern California, so I considered my Plan B - a Kia Soul. I had started to notice these quirky-looking, boxy vehicles after the redesign and I was quite attracted to the refreshed look. The reviews across numerous sites were mostly very favorable and I decided to visit Kia of Marin for a test drive. I immediately noticed how solid the vehicle felt and similar to the CR-V, I really liked the sensation of sitting high vs. the Fit, which has a lower profile. Overall, I was very impressed and when I inquired about the availability of an Inferno Red Plus, the dealer was able to get one in 2 days. What really cinched the deal was Kia's $2,000 discount and the availability of a 1.9% financing deal for 66 months with no money down. Bottom line - I drove out in a new Soul Plus for less than 19K, including tax and license. Seems like a great value.Driving experiences - After 5,000 miles here is what I have learned: First, I had a few negative early impressions, which have moderated or reversed over time: 1. Blind spot on the passenger side - Due to the rather thick pillars where the tail lights reside, I had to get used to a significant blind spot, which requires me to position the side mirror in such a way that I can see a car in that blind spot and I do a visual check every time I make a lane change to the right. On the driver's side, I have no problem. I don't like the blind spot, but I deal with it. 2. No CD Player - As an older driver accustomed to having CD's in the car, this was going to be a deal-breaker for me but I decided to open my mind to using a flash drive and plugging into the USB port. Good move! I don't miss the CDs and the clutter at all and I can put so much music on a flash drive. It's really a no-brainer. 3. No spare tire - That's just silly and this ""kit"" they provide is a joke. Pay the $250 or so for the spare tire assembly unless you love repairing them on the side of the road. 4. Back seat doesn't lay flat when folded down and falls about 6"" short of the front seat. As a percussionist with lots of drums and other gear, I thought this would really suck for me, but it was a false alarm. I get all of my instruments into the vehicle with no problem and I use the ""gap"" between the seats to store skinny items like cymbals, mic stands etc. Driving - The Soul drives smoothly and confidently and I don't experience the ""vague"" steering that many reviewers have noted. It handles curves just fine and gets up hills (many in Marin County where I live) without undue effort and doesn't roll back when stopped on a hill, which is a revelation. Breaking is good enough and power is more than adequate with the 2-liter engine. Gas Mileage - This is a weak point of the Soul as my combined mileage is less than 22 in Eco mode, not the bogus 26 MPG claimed on the sticker. However, since I monitor the MPG on every trip, if I stay on the freeway, the car will return roughly 31 MPG. It's on the side streets and hills where it falls back to about 18 MPG.Stereo System - Since I didn't get the upgraded audio package, I settled for replacing the front component speakers and the rear coaxial speakers with new Hertz speakers and the sonic experience improved dramatically. Comfort - I would give this 5 stars if it weren't for the annoying positioning and hard materials of the head rests. The head rest feels really uncomfortable when I lean into it. The seats are very comfortable and I feel like I have plenty of room as a driver and I know passengers feel quite comfortable as well. Other - All the doors and the rear gate open effortlessly, making it a breeze for me to get all my gear in and out of the vehicle. Beware of the key fobs. I didn't like the idea of carrying 2 bulky key fobs in case I misplaced one and the dealer had no suggestions for how to get a simple spare key made. After countless calls to Kia and to locksmiths who wanted to charge up to $200 to make one for me, I found a local locksmith who used a Lexus blank to make me a spare that I can put in my wallet which opens the doors and starts the engine ... for $35. I highly recommend this option if you are like me and never want to be locked out.Overall, this is a very fun car to drive and a great value to boot, especially if you can wait for a year-end deal. It's quirky, but I can't think of a better option in this price range.",4

The larger tires make chaining up a nightmare (live in the mountains) not enough wheel well room. The only thing it does better than my old one is get up my steep driveway. It cost$4,000 more than my old one. It gets 8mpg less, less cargo. Basically I paid for whole mess of gadgetry that for me I will never use. I am disappointed. Not giving up though.

The Audio amplifier failed and was replaced.  The drives door seal split open from getting in and out Was replaced and 6 months later has split again. I really like the  car except for the headrest which is much too close to my head when driving.  I cannot adjust it enough to make it comfortable.  That one item may keep me from buying another if Kia doesn't correct it.  According the forums, I am not the only one with this complaint.  I have replaced the original tires with Bridgestone Driveguard run flat tires.  They are great.Kia service has bean very good!Another year, now at 13,00 miles with no problems other than having to buy a new battery.Now three years old with a little over 16,000 miles.  No problems with anything.  It is a good car for seniors, plenty of room, easy to get in or out of and my rollator fits in the back with very little effort.  I would be tempted to replace it with another Soul, new turbo engine, safety items, even folding mirrors.  I have mastered the headrest proble by reclining the back a little..",5

Very comfortable, easy to get in and out of for us older folks.  Zippy attitude in the city and on  the highway.  Just did a day in San Francisco and what fun.  No trouble up or down the steep hills.  The vehicle did not roll back when stopped on a hill at a light.  First time ever either stick or auto.  Hate the fact that the car is marketed for youngsters.  This car has so much going for it.  Great headroom.  Both front and rear seats are comfortable and roomy.   I came from a Mazada MPV and only regret is less room in trunk area. Mileage is soooo much better and the direct front wheel handling is fantastic.  Have tried to do all kinds of driving since purchasing this vehicle and in all areas mountains, to freeway, city  to country it is really a gem.  Glad I found this lovable drive-able car to be a very good choice for my last car purchase.  Truly believe it will do the job until I stop driving.  It doesn't hurt to have a really good warranty longer than the rest of the market.",5

5002, on 11/24/15 20:51 PM (PST),Tim Parker ,2015 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Great fun at a reasonable price," I shopped for a Soul a year ago and ended up buying a Honda Civic instead.  No knock on the Civic, but it just wasn't the right car for me, and I found myself still looking.  I came back around to the Soul.  Kia had special financing, and the dealer was offering a better deal than I could find a year ago, so I took the plunge and bought the 2016 Soul+ with the Audio/Nav package. Wow! I'm so glad I bought it!I love the extra driving height and extra headroom. There's more room in the back seat. There's more cargo room. It's fun to drive. Acceleration is good with the 2.0 liter engine.  Handling is good. Pro reviewers talk about ""numb"" steering but I don't notice it. It drives and handles fine.  That said, it's not a sports car so don't buy this if that's what you want.  It has lots of creature comforts like a great audio system that thumps you in the chest if you want it to, but can be tamed if desired.  The nav system works well. I didn't think I wanted it, but now that I have it I use it often.  I like the climate control system.  I have it set and never need to touch it.  It keeps the cabin comfortable no matter what the outside temp is.  It has a large touch screen that is easy to use and pretty intuitive.  You can check Kia's site for a full breakdown of features. For me the important thing is the features it has all work together to create a fun and comfortable driving experience.  I've only had it a month so I can't comment on long term durability, but so far there's not a squeak, not a rattle, everything works flawlessly, and the materials and workmanship are first rate, especially for a vehicle in this price range.  A+ for the Soul!",5

5004, on 11/14/15 09:26 AM (PST),Jim B ,2015 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Perfect small car for tall drivers! Awesome! A++," I was in dire need of a good car. Tried finding a good used car with less then 100k miles on it but everyone wanted damn near $7,500 for one. So, I decided to buy a brand new small car for ~$15,000. I purchased a 2015 Kia Soul with a 1.6L engine and a manual transmission. I'm 6'3"", 220 pounds and I have lots of head room and leg room in it. This is the first car I have ever drove that I could not drive with the seat fully back, there's that much leg room! Even in the back seat I have plenty of head room and leg room, that's a rare find even on more expensive cars! The 1.6L engine is on the smaller side but with the manual transmission I can nail the peak horsepower curves for some impressive acceleration. No problems quickly reaching highway speeds. The engine make a cool deep throttle sound at 3500 to 5500 rpm in hard acceleration. Interior is awesome, I've owned it for nearly 8 months and drove for over 20k miles and I'm still finding neat features about it. The cargo area is smaller then most but it can handle one overloaded grocery cart full of groceries easily. I installed a small trailer hitch on it and use a cargo hitch basket for long trips with the kids. The internal storage area and the cargo basket will carry luggage for four people with plenty of room to spare. The only negative I've seen is the back two corners do have a larger then normal blind spot, but I consider this a very minor problem.UPDATE- After 1 year and 3 months and 33k miles of driving my new Kia Soul I still love it! Added a trailer hitch which I use for a trailer hitch tray. Perfect for hauling push mower, weed wacker and gas can. Even use a small trailer with my Kia Soul to help clean up the yard from tree trimmer and such and to help friends move their belongings. Absolutely no problems with it. Found the idea MPG at 40-50 mph, I can reach 38mpg at those speeds. High speed expressway driving greatly reduces MPG to 33MPG due to wind resistance and a high reving 6th gear. Still wished Kia would have made a 7th gear but I believe most people would not understand that you could only use 7th gear under certain idea conditions.UPDATE- After 1 year 9 months and 45,000, no problems at all with my 2015 Kia Soul. I'm still loving it! :-)*****GAS MILLAGE IS A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT IS LISTED*******  29-33mpg driving it like I stole it LOL. 35-38mpg if taking it easy at 45-55mph on highway.UPDATE- After 2 years and 3 months and 55,000 miles: Took out a 10 point buck with it. Knocked the [non-permissible content removed] antlers right off him. I was surprised to find almost no damage to the car, nothing worth filing an insurance claim on.  Hit a huge pot hole which bent the rim. Beat the rim back into shape and all is good again. Surprising there was no damage to the front suspension. Gas mileage still a lot better than listed. Tires are worn pretty bad, will need to replace then at 60,000 miles.UPDATE- 3 years and 3 months and 80,000 miles: still running great. Original tires lasted 65,000 miles. Replaced tires. Replaced all three wipers. Driver side door key lock failed. Bad tumblers? I don't have a remote key less entry so driver lock was used constantly. Still 100% happy with my Kia Soul. Hoping for 300,000 miles out of it.",5
5005, on 11/05/15 16:03 PM (PST),Sandra Clayton ,2015 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),The most rewarding therapy I've ever had!," I was in my car 3 hours a day, some times more.  In bumper to bumper traffic, I was losing my mind in my boring Corolla.  I was getting big time depressed, and I have an elderly father who has a hard time getting out of a car.  I researched and decided if they could get me out of my lease, I would take the loss.  Best decision ever!  The only thing I didn't get that I wanted was a sunroof, but realized that the extra expense wasn't worth it for how little I would use it.Cars higher off ground so I can see better and get in and out better.  I love the back up camera, won't get a car now without one.They showed me how you could pull the bottom of the trunk out to maximize space, not that I need that much.  I really hated having a huge trunk, I like having the window at the back of the car so I feel like I have better sight thru the back.The other thing I must have is to be able to listen to my books when I'm stuck in traffic.  And it has TWO chargers so I can charge my IPod and phone at the same time.  If it came with a refrigerator and microwave, I may never leave.Acceleration isn't the greatest, but it gets the job done.  I always have a problem with seat comfort no matter what car I drive.  I think it's my long torso.  The Soul has an adjustable seat that inflates.  It took a while but I found the right adjustment.  I've always put a seat cushion behind my back before, not now.",5

5007, on 10/13/15 08:28 AM (PDT),Sam Spade ,2015 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6A),Base model - Lot of bang for the buck," I went from a very well worn and well loved 2005 Rav4 to the Kia Soul Base with automatic.  Its almost identical in interior volume and overall size even though it looks a lot different.  Very comfortable on the interior with more passenger room front and back than the old Rav4, but you lose a fair amount of storage in the back in comparison.  It sits slightly lower, but only an inch or two.  Build quality was excellent along with fit and finish.  No issues so far after a month.  Love the upgraded electronics which even in the base model are much more than I was used to in my old car.  Bluetooth works great, radio sounds great and works great.  Interior controls are very similar to what I was used to and are easy to use though the radio is a bit ""busy"" with lots of buttons and it where you access all your system settings.  Love the dials on the climate control since they kept it simple unlike too many cars nowadays with a plethora of buttons that you can't work by feel alone just to turn on the A/C or defrost.  Love the steering wheel mounted controls for radio, cruise, and bluetooth/voice command.  Very comfortable seats and ride.  For what you pay, it seems like a great value for your dollar even if resale may suffer.  I plan on putting on a lot of miles and getting my money's worth before I have to worry about resale/trade-in.  If it lacks in any area it is power and mileage.  Its acceptable, but not an acceleration demon by any measure.  My old Rav4 had a lot of miles on it and was burning more fuel per mile, but would still had decent torque and acceleration (low end and high end)  with its 2.0L and 4 speed auto.  The 1.6L with 6 speed Kia does fine around town and cruising on level freeway, but strains when merging into traffic or in hilly country.  Turning off Eco mode helps a little, but I think hurts your mileage more than it helps your acceleration.  Mileage is not what you'd expect for such a light car and a 1.6L engine.  Its about what my old Rav4 was getting when it was new, but that was 11 y/o technology on a larger motor and somewhat heavier car.  Logic would say the Kia SHOULD be getting  around 35 on the highway at least, but struggles to make 30 under the best conditions which to be fair is close to what the sticker predicted.  Around town, it stays around 23 or so.  Not great especially for a car its size, but as I said for the price you pay I'll sacrifice a little mileage.  So far very happy with the car even if people do make fun of a guy in his 50's for driving a ""cute"" car.  It does what I need it to do (puttering around town and 400 mile business trips a 2-3 times a month) and comfortably and for a heck of a price.  No other cars by any manufacturer were anywhere near it that had the safety rating, reliability, or warranty of the Soul.  Plus, buying a 2015 model in the fall when the 2016's were on the lot made for lots of incentives and the dealer was eager to make room on the lot.  People can laugh if they want.  I'm happy and that's what counts for me.",5

So off I went to the dealership for another one. I picked up a 15 Soul Base 6 speed manual, Silver with 2 tone Silver/Black interior. Very nice combo. I was so thrilled with my 14 and equally with my 15. I noticed they did away with heated mirrors  on the 15 base manual compared to the 14. I also noticed the tires were nosier on the 15, they were Kumhos. On my 14 and 15 I purchased factory foglight kits on the internet for 189.00  from Kan Motors and had them installed at a local bodyshop for 150.00 . I then checked all the local Kia dealers for pull-off wheels, I found a nice set of new Soul + 17 inch wheels and tires. The car became quiet like the 14 .These tires are the Nexens.

It's a reliable average commuter vehicle with weak gas mileage and underwhelming performance.  Improved interior appearances and better fabric help, but scrape those away and actual performance issues become apparent relatively soon. Automatic transmission is quirky to the point that it displays the slow responsiveness of early CVT transmissions. Normal acceleration begets transmission hesitation and lost power when shifting from 2nd to 3rd to 4th. With vehicle ratings of 164HP and 151 lb.ft. torque, acceleration is surprisingly strained (especially at highway speeds), indicating horsepower and torque numbers are inflated. Cruising on slightly undulating highways yields frequent transmission shifts.  Steering and braking are effective, but vague. At highway speeds, wind noise has become more excessive over time although it was originally reported as being ""normal""; it's not.  After five years of ownership, the car displays less and less soul.  Noticeable cabin wind noise has drastically increased whenever driving above 40 MPH.  Minor dashboard rattles have surfaced.  Stereo sound quality has been disappointing.  Suspension grinding noises have slowly become more pronounced, similarly reported as normal.  The car is generally an average, reliable daily driver, but appears to suffer from poor engineering, with some lesser quality control and lesser quality components.  While appearances are good and options look very good on paper, actual performance is weak; when it comes to actual driving and function of those components long-term (e.g., weak climate control, and average steering, suspension, handling, and transmission), components display obvious weaknesses and are of generally lesser quality relative to their pricing.  If you're looking for a vehicle that is reliable and seats you higher while returning underwhelming power and efficiency, the soul has something to consider.",2

The only real complaint I have is that you have blind spots towards the rear of the car. You have to be really careful when changing lanes.

5041, on 12/28/16 18:15 PM (PST),CJ Naples ,2012 Kia Soul Wagon ! 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),"AFTER 63,000 MILES"," I've owned this + Model Soul for almost 5 years now and decided to write a review before I trade it in with 63,000 miles on it. I originally purchased it with the intention of driving it for 5 years then giving it to my daughter who would be getting her license at that point.  I figured the mileage was great and I could suck it up driving a hamster car for a while. First, before I list my complaints, I will say the car is pretty zippy and sits up higher than a sedan. I'm also 6'2"" and have no issues fitting in it at all. It handles well and the warranty is very good. They even replaced a broken key. That said, I bought it in March 2012 and realized off the bat that the MPG sucked. In the beginning I averaged about 23 MPG around town and 28 highway. After 5 years it's down to 21 city and maybe 27 highway. The interior is very hard to clean and if you use armor-all on the dash (at least while there is still a finish) it will leave streaks that last a long time (months). Other complaints are that it's noisy on the highway and the entertainment system sometimes takes a few minutes to turn on. Biggest complaint is that Kia was compensating us for the poor gas mileage (actually because they fudged the MPG numbers to consumers like me) but now there is a new class action settlement and as a result the whole process is intentionally a pain. (I've actually been on hold with the Kia MPG settlement people the whole time I've been writing this...) I've decided to trade the car in as I don't want my daughter driving it. I just don't think it would be safe in a collision. Kia and Hyundai are very tempting... overall, I don't think it's worth it.",3
5042, on 07/25/16 10:07 AM (PDT),Justin ,2012 Kia Soul Wagon ! 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),I'm falling in love with this little Kia," I've always hated the ""boxy"" wagons(Scion, Cube, Element, etc), but the only one I've liked was the Soul. Couldn't really give a reason they just looked cute. So naturally when we needed a 2nd car, I bought a 2012 Exclaim model. I'm gonna start with the few things I don't care for. I bought this car with 58,000 or so miles and have since put on another 22,000 or so. It's kinda harsh NVH when accelerating with any urgency. Not sure if this is just an unavoidable 4cyl econobox(pun intended) trait, but just saying it's more noticeable than other vehicles I've had. Second gripe, the inside door panel sills are so thin you can't rest your forearm on them when the windows are up. No big deal, just a quirk I'm not a fan of. Third, the damn sunroof doesn't tilt up like almost every other car. Fourth, the car has a backup camera but the screen is really small and the lines don't move with the steering wheel and can be prone to moisture getting in the camera and the screen going black. All those small things aside, I still love this car. It's a dream to park, I average 29.6/33.4 mpg city/hwy. It has a great Infinity sound system w Bluetooth, Sat radio, and subwoofer. It's punchy from a stop(but only about average once you're out of 1st gear). It's damn cute and just all around excellent for a small family. It's like the perfect combination of cargo space, fuel economy, passenger space, and just an excellent city car. I highly recommend it if you get a good price(they don't have super resale value).",4

The engine BLEW on my 4 year old car that I took wonderful care of - Connecting Rods failed.  I had my car in my local shop for over 2 months and they couldn't identify the error.  A month later, I receive a note direct from Kia that they're extending the warranty of my car to 120,000 miles DUE TO THE EXACT REASON MY ENGINE BLEW (connecting rod failure).  I had since sold the car to a junk yard for $500 (because no one wanted it) and I lost over $8,000 compared to the KBB value of my car.  Now Kia wants nothing to do with it because I didn't choose to repair my engine for $8K (what the car was worth at the time...)  BOTTOM LINE - Kia does NOT care about their customers - they do not care about brand loyalty or repeat customers.  They'd rather sell you a piece of junk car, wait for it to fail and then wish you luck with your next purchase.  BUYERS BEWARE - DO NOT BUY A KIA.",1

For the first time in our marriage, my wife asked for a specific car, the Soul!  I said, a what?  We usually buy a new car ever year or two; I give her the new one and I use the older one in my sales job.  My wife loves this car.  She is 5'2"" and it fits her perfectly.  It sets higher so she can see fine and this makes getting in and out much easier for her.  We have had no problems with the car.  It has excellent pick up and stops well.  It will seat five but one of them had better be a child in the back seat!  Our only complaint is that the ride is harsher than need be.  I understand the new ones are a bit softer.  I don't like not having a spare tire so I got one at the junk yard.    I change my own oil and it is easy to do on the Soul.  We bought this car with 3000 miles on it, the previous owner felt is was too small for his family but it is perfect for us.  All our kids are grown.  Gas mileage is a little less than I had  hoped for.  At 65 mph and on the flat Interstates in IL, I cannot get over 30 and a milk a car for gas mileage.  I could get 36 on our 2010 Malibu on the same roads.I didn't like that it did not have ""driving lights"" so I bought OEM fog lights on eBay and installed them so that they are on whenever the ignition is on.  I do like the fact that after an amount of time, the car will automatically turn off any lights left on after you turn the car off; headlights, dome light, etc.My wife and I would highly recommend the Kia Soul.  We have the ""Plus"" model.  We have only had one recall and that was optional.(UPDATE)  This car is amazing, still  no problems and my wife loves it.  We almost traded it for a 2016 Soul but this one is just too nice to give up.  Go buy one.(UPDATE)  1/16/2018  This car continues to impress us.  No problems what so ever.

I am a car guy, owning a chevelle convertible, camaros and a nova, this is not a car I would go looking for.  But I like it.  It is easy to work on.  I changed the brakes before noon last Saturday. The oil and filter are right up front.  It drives tight with a nice build of torque through the low to mid range.  Mine is the + model which has every useful piece of tech in it but no screen, which in my opinion is far worse than a physical nob.  The false speaker in the middle is a terrible design since it is a focal point of the dash, I will figure out something creative to do with that. Good car.",5

It also has plenty of room to load of the baby and the husband!I have been able to get up to 41mpg on the highway (going 55mph, not really highway, high speed back roads) and anywhere from 32mpg-35mpg city.The only thing I do not like about the car is the clutch stick when you're on a hill, I tend to gun it because I forget it kicks in.

The Factory Sat radio/CD/USB/bluetooth works nicely and the sound is great for stock.The interior feels much more roomy than you would think.The 2.0L engine is very peppy and the 6 speed auto shifts smoothly. My Soul hasn't been broken in entirely yet but I'm getting 22 in stop and go traffic to work and 31 on the freeway. I like the MPG display on the dash.

I tried to find a normal key just to open the door but goofy Kia changed the size of the key blank (for 2012).I cant find a locksmith with the right size anyway.The car also turns off the radio and then yells at me to coordinate my cell phone with its Bluetooth system.My phone is too old to for bluetooth so I get yelled at twice a week forever?The car probably learned to yell from Kia Customer Service people; they yell too.The car has no spare tire but it does have an emergency inflator.I live at the end of civilization in Idaho and there is often no cell phone service when I go fishing/hunting.I cant be sure that I can get roadside assistance if the car has a flat outside the cell phone service area. And I have to carry a cell phone?I would think that adding a spare tire is cheaper than paying the crabby customer service people. Overall, the car is very good at what it does; efficiently moving people at low cost.It is just so annoying in operation that I will not buy a Kia again.Ill buy another new full-sized pickup and pay the extra fuel costs with the money I save from the trucks lower purchase cost and lower insurance costKuna Dave",3.375

One week later, when driving on a highway at 57mph my hood flew up. My safety latch failed to do anything. My warranty is only a couple miles over. Thankfully my windshield did not crack by I am left with huge and costly dents in roof and hood. Thankfully when this occurred my dad happened to be driving. Being the new driver that I am, I probably would have swerved from the loud and shocking impact and killed myself and others. The damage cost $4,910 and Kia will not help. I had read numerous accounts of this same situation happening to others on other sites and I myself have reported a recall request for the safety latch. Kia needs to do something!! Also, another defect (not as important or major) is that the cigarette lighter and USB port doesn't work. My guess is that it has something to do with the fuse box. Be warned and check your safety latch for rust or any other malfunctions and lubricate properly.",4

I purchased in 1/2011 and sold it on 2/2016 so I owned it for 5 years. It was probably one of the most fun cars Ive ever driven. Despite having a 4-Speed automatic while everyone else was putting in 6-Speed in the newer models. In the coarse of 5 years Its had LED fog lights, full sound system, lowering springs, 3 sets of tires, plastidip on the factory 16'' and other LED interior lighting. I've used it to drive on the canyons and beat on my buddies with sports cars proving that a box on wheels and keep up with a fr-s or bmw. But like all cars I've driven the poor thing very hard. Tons of scratches and door dings by the time I sold it but I made sure it had the proper service taken care of at the Kia dealer. Switched to 5W-30 synthetic blend at 80K and replaced the timing belt and other belts during that time. Replaced the front rotors and pads ONCE for the front axle and the rears were still on the stock rotors since there was quite of life left in them.I guess that sad thing is that all 103,8xx miles. It has never left the state of California. 100% orange county driven. I eventually sold it carmax for $5k at that mileage and I bought a new car.Overall I recommend this car for anyone learning how to drive or just a basic city car. Its not the fastest but it will get the job done.",5

BUT; off the bat, I am 6 4 300 lbs a VERY big guy, and the comfort was A++++ in getting in and out; the car was simple and VERY reliable, AMAZING in snow (in fact, first year I had it, drove through 8+ inches of snow with less than decent tires on it with NO issues at all) I took it off roading to several locations with NO issues; AMAZING on gas I avg'd about 38 mpg; etc... I can't say enough good things about the car... The ONLY thing I was no fond of; was the 5 spd at speeds over 60, the engine just sounded so strained; would have been much better as a 6 spd... BUT anyway that is the only thing I had issues with... Due to health reasons; I upgraded 2 weeks ago to a BN 16.... I AM IN LOVE with it... SO much bang for the buck that I couldn't imagine owning ANY other car... ANYWAY; our family is now up to 3 Kia's and will be 5 in about 2 weeks...

The Soul is incredibly roomy inside and with the rear seats folded down it has cargo room comparable to any wagon... I've always been hesitant with Kia but they seem to have hit the mark with this one. For $16,000, this car seems to be put together well and has features like ABS, traction control, Bluetooth, and 4-wheel disc brakes that are missing in other cars. I would prefer the manual transmission model; the automatic is an outdated 4-speed and it feels like it was definitely tuned for economy rather than sporty driving but what can one expect for under $16k?",4.75

I like the roomy, SUV-like seating, while still getting good MPG and a low price tag. The interior is nice, though some plastics are easily scratched (but not as bad as 2010 Soul). The engine and transmission are older technology making driving performance just OK (i think this is how they kept the price so low). However, steering feel and braking are nice. I get exactly the EPA rating of 26-28mpg in mixed driving. I got a little over 31mpg on a purely highway trip. The feel of the manual shifter is not too good, but this can be easily upgraded aftermarket. My biggest complaint is 5th gear is not tall enough making RPM noticeably high above 70 mph. ",4.375

It is a good value overall. Mechanically, it is a basic 4 cylinder economy car. The body design, roomy SUV-like seating position, and a generous feature list are what make the car attractive. Two consistent complaints with the 2010 model - rough ride/poor suspension and door panels that scratch up easily - have been addressed with the 2011 model. One shortcoming that remains is the final gear isn't tall enough so that you have high RPM at highway speeds (3,000 rpm @ 70 mph). MPG is good. I consistently get 26-28 mpg in mixed driving and got over 31 mpg on a purely highway trip.    ",4

Was able to dicker for $189/mo and only $600 drive off, a savings of almost $680 over the term of the lease.  Interest rate is 1.454% with a 59% residual. Love the car and all of the included features.  It is really fun to drive and gets very good gas mileage too!

I am not sure what noisy highway driving means, but I drove about 400 miles on the highway and had no issue with noise, or anything, in fact it was a great trip! I highly recommend the Soul.  And for those that have commented to me to buy American, well, if there were cars that were more in my budget, I think I would still buy a Soul!",4.5

It has more than adequate power, handles very well, but is a bit 'busy' in the ride. It is extremely comfortable, especially for larger people. I had a 6'3"", 300+ pounder in the car and the car basically said ""So?"". Gas mileage with air on nearly constantly has been about 27 overall. The Soul has the BEST steering wheel mounted cruise control controls anywhere. Same with the radio controls. This is my first experience with Bluetooth and I love it! The only real negative is the interior plastic which shows scratches if you look at it sideways. I would definitely buy it again.",5

The interior is attractive, roomy, and extremely well screwed together, but the materials are hard and cheap plastic.  Handles well, but straight line acceleration is just acceptable.

The looks are great and the handling is very good. Comfort was never an issue on the long haul from Bozeman to Yellowstone.

While initially skeptical of the Kia brand from a quality standpoint, the test-drive completely won us over. Sure, it doesn't ride like a luxury car and some of the materials may not be top-of-the-line, and it's certainly no sports car, but we nevertheless found it to be fun and peppy and reasonably comfortable to drive.

I could do without the sport suspension, as the ride is much bumpier than I'm used to, but the pros outweigh the cons for sure.

I'm a short person so getting in and out of it is still a bit hard but I know I'll get used to that also.

I can even make the seat go higher as well as closer to the steering wheel.  It has cruise control which I love and a trip monitor for the trips I plan to take now that I have a car I can trust.

5228, on 09/20/17 16:49 PM (PDT),Margarets Dad ,2014 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Exceeding expectations!," I bought my 2014 Soul with 32,000 miles on it and have driven it almost 1,000 miles, and it really is a remarkable car. If you're looking for a small car, you can't do any better than this. I live in Brooklyn, and finding parking is a major issue for me, so the shorter the car the better. The Soul is only 163"" long, just 4"" longer than the 2009 Hyundai Accent I traded in, and 3"" longer than the Honda Fit. But the amount of room inside is incredible. The back seat is limousine-like, so there's no problem carrying four 6-foot adults in comfort. There's even a generous amount of room behind the rear seat--enough for at least four good-sized duffel bags--as well as a large, deep tray under the rear cargo area for carrying all kinds of other stuff. Instrumentation and controls on the base model are intuitive and straightforward. And it's fun to drive! Others have complained about a lack of power in the base model, but I haven't found that at all. There's more than enough power for doing whatever you need the car to do in everyday driving. And I've been getting fantastic mileage: about 36 mpg in mixed driving on the highway, in the city, and along country roads. (That's calculated by hand, not going by the on-board mpg calculator, which is usually about 2-3 mpg high.) Honestly, I don't understand why the mpg ratings for this car are so low and how it is that so many other reviewers are getting mpg's in the mid-20s. I don't drive like Mario Andretti, but I sure don't drive like a granny either, and mpg has exceeded my expectations by a longshot.",5
5229, on 06/10/17 13:33 PM (PDT),CMR ,2014 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6A),Good value for the money," I,was coming out of a toyota rav4 lease in March and due to a back problem I still needed a car that was easy to get into and out of. My friend suggested a KIA SOUL he was right. I visited my local dealer and drove a 2014 soul. Much to my surprise the seat was more comfortable then may RAV 4. Also the soul has a better fell. On the down side it needs better pick up for merging with traffic. Great second car for the money. So far no complaints.",4
5230, on 05/08/17 15:45 PM (PDT),Derek ,2014 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Loving IT!," What a great little car.  I got the base model with the 6 speed manual transmission.  The shifting is easy and the clutch engages nicely. I love the ""hill holder"" feature - car doesn't roll on a hill while you get going from a dead stop.  There have been a couple of minor recalls on my car which the dealer has taken care of.  Other than those, NOTHING has gone wrong with this car in 43,000 miles.  The good is the gas mileage, I average about 35 miles per gallon.  About half of my driving is under nearly ideal conditions for mileage, but the other half is stop and go.  The bad is I have the 1.6 liter engine, just enough to keep up with traffic, but not much power to spare.  The other weak point is when backing up, the rear visibility is not that good.  The cabin is quiet at all speeds, the seats and ride are firm, but comfortable and the cornering and braking are great. Overall I would buy this car again.  The low price, the long warranty (which I have not needed at all) and the quality make this car a winner.",5

I was tired of a large, bulky vehicle and decided it was time to ""downsize"" into something simple, clean and easy to maneuver.  I drove it until the 2014 models came out and found many changes had been added since 2010.  The navigation system is the best I have ever seen in a car.  The radio audio quality is super and the handling is fine.  Plenty of room in the rear for whatever you are hauling and, I will never own another car without the backup camera.  It has saved me a few times from ""bumping"" into things that do not need to be bumped.  I will buy a 2018 when they come out.

Well the Kia Soul took the place of the Element. IT doesn't have the amount of room that the Element had, but it's better looking, better mileage, Quieter, handles better, turning radius is unreal, parking a breeze. The steering wheel is about the same size as our Lexus CT200H, fits like a glove. The doors open very wide and the visibility out the front window is great. Most vehicles have a small front window, not the Soul. Love the fact that I don't have to take the headrests off to have the rear seats fold. It's really nicehaving a 4 door hatchback (wagon). I bought the bare bones Soul with the 6 speed manual shift. It shifts very, very smooth. Clutch feels Great and the mileageis really great.",5

Had a whole 31 miles on it! (guess from other test drives) Got it for $14,222 with a few extras like mudflaps, SOUL floor mats, and maybe a few other dealer add-ons. No real mods besides my Amp and 2 12's I pulled from my 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Still running great! She has been to Tennessee (Only once) My Jeep went to Tennessee 100 times haha, South Carolina, and Virginia / VA Beach so far. About 4 Virginia trips to VA Beach so far (In a few weeks it will be going back  I have took numerous photos of my soul, along with one I took in the fall of 2015, has been shared and spread across several dealer websites AND was posted by KIA Motors America on their Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other social media accounts last month! Here is the link to their Twitter Post, https://twitter.com/Kia/status/697901801337720832 Also I'll post a link below with some of my favs I've taken.My Soul now has 56,000 miles, I had a check engine light at 21,000 were a sensor on the transmission threw a code, but fixed it self, but dealership replaced it anyway, along with the few recalls that's came out. I do currently have 2 issues and 2 concerns. 1st main issue is the sun glasses holder, at random times it has a rattle like something broke off in it and is rattling around, but noticeable only really on roads that are not as smooth but is very annoying at times. Sometimes it makes noise sometimes it does not. 2nd is what sounds like coming from the back when going slowly over speed bumps or really bumpy roads like its the suspension but not sure. My 2 concerns is when turning off my car I hear a bubbling gurgling noise, I just recently recalled hearing it again since having to use AC. 2nd concern is my AC sometimes has a mildew smell but usually goes away after 30 seconds. Almost forgot somewhere around 30k my Poor rear passenger side window got shattered ohhh the glass everywhere, I think it was my dads fault as we suspect a rock may have flung up from the lawn mower, he felt bad and bought me a replacement from a wreaked Soul in Texas. (he owns a body shop) Picture in my gallery below. My Soul soon will need new tires, still running on the stock tires. My Soul made me proud last month, we had a Ice storm really bad here in NC, So many wreaks even right in front of me I seen people loose control of there vehicle but being safe my Soul got me through everything safely. - Video from my Dash Cam https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jmv_6cChc_s Local media used this video. Overall I love my Soul and hope she makes it to 200k+ She might in the near future get registered in the State of Virginia in a few weeks will be spending some extended time there.Here are all the pictures Posted Here (The ones I like anyway) And a recent one from today! - http://hunterspad.com/?page_id=99",4

It was in perfect condition with 13,600 miles. Negotiated hard for 2 weeks. Finally got my price 16,998. It has been a dream to drive no negatives here at all. It's like driving a Korean Bentley lol. Only thing I warn you. If your buying a USED soul or any Kia. Make sure it's from a kia dealer and certified.  Otherwise you lose the 10 yr 100,000 mile power train warranty. I bought mine from a mazda dealer. Hope to see you on the road! Update!!! Nearly 5 months of ownership. Still loving my soul !. No issues to report. Have 19119 miles now. Only minor issue is every time you start car up. Navigation always asks for permission needing 2 taps on screen to get you to use navigation or radio. Nothing serious,  just little irritating lol.

Its very easy to get in and out of and you sit pretty high which is great for visibility as well as for entry and exit. The seats are supportive and comfortable, if not plush and overly cushioned. Its like a small SUV in a way. Its quiet and rides well and also handles well. Not like a highway cruiser or luxury car or sports car, but at that low price, you couldn't expect it too. No, its just an inexpensive little car that's big on room, build quality, reliability, value and safety. It could use just a little more cargo space and get a little better MPG. If the car has a flaw its a little noisy when accelerating from a start and also a little slow to get to speed when merging under hard acceleration. But when you get to highway speeds its actually pretty quiet and moves with ease. I drive up a hill every day and never have a problem with power. The base has everything I wanted feature wise, nothing too techy, just simple and easy to use. A remote rear latch release would be welcome, though. I've had it over a year now and no problems and its holding up fine.",5

Second was a 2013 Optima Hybrid, A great Car, but my wife is physically handicapped and the passenger seat was so low that it was very hard to enter and get out. So with mixed emotions I traded for a 2014 Soul + which is extremely easy to enter and exit. Shortly after taking delivery we had to make a quick trip across country. This was from Yuma, AZ to New Jersey. (round trip total was 6215 miles.) The weather was torrential rain a good portion of the trip, The Soul proved it self to be outstanding, Through Texas we ran about 85 mph when possible and my fuel average was averaging 28-30 mph. The Soul was quiet and did well in heavy winds. I now have accumulated 8500 miles and have not had one problem. Also the local Dealer here in Yuma is outstanding. KUDO'S to KIA",5

I'm impressed with the number of features for the price (power locks, cruise, power windows, selectable steering control, Sirius, Bluetooth, etc.) on a base model.

So far zero problems. THe Soul+  has the 2.0 liter engine, which I recommend. I test drove the standard Soul (1.6 liter) and it lacked power, and was constantly shifting itself. Also the Soul+ has more bells and whistles. We average in the high 20s mpg which is fine (over 30 on hiway). The front seats are surprisingly comfortable and supportive and we like the driving position. I'm tall (6.2) and so leg room is important, and this car has plenty of it. I've found that too many smaller SUVs compromise on leg room, with the shifter console much too big and intrusive. Not so with the Soul. My right leg rests comfortably....a major plus for me. The only negative about this vehicle is that there is not a lot of storage room behind the rear seats. You get good height, but not enough depth; although you can push down the rear seat backs if necessary. Sure, the looks of this vehicle are a bit quirky (hey, there's a ton of them on the road!), but if you can get past that, this is a great small SUV.",4

Less than 1 year into ownership I had to trade it in for something else.  This car is SLOW...yeah, I know you can't expect much from a 1.6L engine but I have owned and driven many manual transmission cars/trucks in my 30+ years of driving and this one by far has been the worst.  The acceleration is very poor.  It seems the transmission is not paired well to this engine.  It's as if it is geared for gas mileage only.  It got hairy a few times when trying to merge onto the highway.  In all the cars that I have owned in my lifetime, this is the only car that I have to ""Floor It"" all the time to speed up.  There is a switch you can disable on the clutch pedal but then you get warning lights on the dash.  If you don't believe me, check out the Soul forums and it's all there on how to bypass/replace this switch.  The suspension also creaked and moaned like an old lady getting out of bed in the mornings, not a good sign for the long run.   It's a fine little commuter car with plenty of storage and decent MPG, just don't expect to get there quickly.",3

The cargo area is smaller than you would think. I've had some snow related issues but think they are related to the lack of power rather than something with the car itself.

My friends continue to be impressedl; two have since purchased Kia Souls of their own from the local dealership.)  Loving this car !!  My last car was totaled in August 2016 in a rear end collision while I sat at a stoplight.  I always thought my 2003 PT Cruiser Turbo would be with me forever.  When I found out I could afford a 2016 Kia Soul+, all my car blues went away.  The Soul isn't quite as powerful, but it is a fun, quick little car that seems to impress all my friends.  I have a Hamster theme going on with a few decals and even a hamster personal license plate.  I'm getting about 30 mpg around town while in optional ""economy"" mode.  Another option that I have tried is three levels of steering---normal, sport and comfort.  Since I am 70 years old, the ""comfort"" setting feels easiest for me.  The seating is comfortable and spacious.   The warranty that came with the car is very impressive.  The dealership has been fantastic----they even held a Kia Soul Rally last month where 12 Kia Souls all gathered and traveled from Prescott to Sedona, AZ, for lunch and music.  Winding through the local mountains all in a row (11 different colors in the group), we seemed to get lots of attention as we passed some viewpoints and in the mining town of Jerome, AZ.  I'm looking forward to many happy years with this cute, bright red, stylish car.",5

On taking a test drive I knew it was what I was looking for, It is extremely  easy to get in and out, with the small engine the transmission seems to shift a lot. it is maintaining a 29 mpg which is great in my book. I sets beside a 5 leder awd automatic that gets 14.5 mpg. My previous car was a 232 V6 with a 6 speed stick. while it was fun to drive and averaged about 23 mpg using high test gas , which is 50 cents a gallon more than regular, a roaster which was my dream car and I drove it 9 years, a record for me.

5289, on 10/10/16 20:17 PM (PDT),Dave Condon ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),2016 KIA Soulful Plus," I purchased a 2016 KIA Plus Soulful because basically that was all the dealer had left of the 2016 models. The Soulful is an optional package on the KIA Soul Plus. I think it adds bigger wheels and also adds a drop down molding piece. Here are what I consider the strong points of the vehicle: The Soulful is very easy to get in and out of. The visibility is excellent with really no blind spots. The variable steering means sharp turns at slow speed and much more forgiving steering at high speeds. The headlights are powerful and the fog lights are tremendous in fog. The overall interior quality is impressive. Fuel economy is acceptable running about 25 mpg in town and 35 mpg on the highway. There are two things I don't really like about the KIA Soulful: (1) the 18 inch wheels and (2) a missing CD player. The 18 inch wheels look cool but ride hard and replacement tires are around $225.00 each. The entertainment package does not have a CD player and only accepts a MP3 format using thumb drives. Everyone I know that has a KIA Soul loves them and to tell the truth, the longer I have my Soulful the more it's growing on me.UPDATED: 2800 miles-except for the larger than stock wheels and low profile tires, it is a great vehicle. I worry about getting too close to curbs and damaging those expensive wheels. Otherwise, it is really a great urban vehicle....great visibility, easy to get in and out of, passengers like riding in it, sharp turning radius , and reasonable mileage in the high 20's.I'd still give it 5 stars! UPDATE: The fancy wheels on this Soulful Soul cost with tax about $660 each. Because the tire width and the wheel wide are almost the same, I purchased oversized Michelin tires (widthwise) ($774.00) to gain about 1.75 inches of wheel protection. Surprisingly, the larger width tires produced a better ride and much better road handling. A year later this KIA Soulful is still a 5 Star vehicle.",5

My friends are floored at how upscale my Soul looks and feels inside. VERY comfortable even for long highway drives. The ride, even with the 18"" wheels is fantastic. The car feels well planted and composed. And it's QUIET inside! Selectable modes for steering also a pleasant surprise. In fact, I'm blown away at how good the steering feels compared to earlier Kia/Hyundai models. Excellent 6-speed automatic with fun to use manual mode. Luggage space is a bit tight. But there is more room under the removable cargo floor. Take out the storage bin and you gain a lot more space for suitcases and travel bags.

Yesterday, my wife took it for an oil change and they talked her into 'fuel injector service' and 'radiator service' to the tune of $300. Today the 'check engine' light came on and all the sudden Haleen Kia doesn't want to hear about it. I called Kia Moters and they told me all the dealers can do whatever they wanted I should try another dealer which is 59 miles away.  So my only real choice is to pay a real mechanic to fix it.

There is a lot of things I like and miss about this car. But what I will tell you about is the three things that drove me up the wall with this cute thing. 1.Transmission. It could not figure out what gear it was supposed to be in- constantly upshifting and downshifting even while in Cruise it was clueless, and most of the time the wrong gear. For instance every day on my way to work I had to drive up a moderately steep hill. I could not do 35 to 40 mph up the hill. When I gave it a little bit more gas to not bog down, it would downshift and if I let off the gas to keep it at the speed I wanted, it would up shift and start bogging down again. Gerrrr! This transmission is definitely bipolar. 2- The gas pedal...it's basically an on-off switch! There's no way to start this car at a light without sending your passengers head crashing into the headrest. 3- the seats have no economic Lumber support and the top of the seats shoulders and head rest are too far foward, making you feel crunched up. This is just my three things I feel could have been better with this car. The one thing I liked the most was the interior, it was roomy, it was quiet, and the sound system is awesome.",3

My daughter the lost control of the car from the impact and hit a concrete building  almost head on, at approximately 35 miles per hour. I was a passenger in the vehicle with my daughter and I cannot stress enough how impressively this little wagon held up! The front end damage was severe, but the safety features of this vehicle performed exactly as they are meant to and ensured that we both walked away with only minor bumps and bruises from airbag deployment and seatbelts.

Seats are very comfortable.  Good interior space (for the appearance of size).   I like the rear mirror and window visibility (front & side, also) best of all.

At 1st service told the service tech.  couldn't see it because they had the car about 1 1/2 hours.  There is along story involved since than, and the clock now loses about 3 minutes a week, getting worse.  Kia will not repair this problem because its ""not a safety issue and is very expensive"" I have now bought my 1st and last Kia product.  I just hope I have know more electronic issues with this vehicle even though I bought extended warranty from dealer in case these problems happened.  I was told the reason I needed to buy the extended warranty was because electronic issues are very expensive to deal with??????  After 21,000 miles car now has the tire light on constantly, about once a week the driver mirror falls to its lowest position and needs to be adjusted and now the clock loses about 10 minutes a week. Soul needs to safety recall so I have to go back to the dealer, I really don't expect much, but hopefully they can get the recall right as the NHSTA says this is the 3rd time they have had this recall and the 1st two times the fix didn't work wont buy another Kia again.  Looked at car for recall they said all is ok, tried to sell me services that you can check on my window and see was done 100 miles ago.

5310, on 04/02/16 14:32 PM (PDT),Gary ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Great vehicle for the price," The 2016 Kia Soul performs better than expected . Interior space is better than expected for a vehicle of this size. Despite the reviews in regards to performance, the 2.0 power plant does a very good job for the normal everyday driver. I have managed to get 29 miles per gallon in town with light foot driving practices. The steering is very responsive and the four wheel disc brakes are much better than average. The ride comfort is a bit stiff on rough roads but acceptable. I would recommend the base+ if you don't need every bell and whistle available. The cost for additional packages is a bit costly in my view. The plus has the back up camera feature and touch screen on the dash. It also has fog lights and automatic headlight feature. I will comment on two areas for change in my view. The fact that the Soul does not have a spare tire is very important to me. The spare tire kit will cost you an additional $200.00. It is possible you could be setting for some time if you depend on roadside assistance. The spare tire will get you on the road in less time by far. The additional area I would comment on is the rear wheel well. The material that is used in the rear wheel well area is almost carpet like. It holds the mud and salt in our area and is hard to clean even with high pressure spray. I am concerned about this materials ability to hold up under mud, snow and gravel situations. It should be a heavy duty plastic like the front wheel well area. Overall it is a great vehicle for the money invested. The 2016 Kia Soul should be considered for the budget minded consumer or anyone that would like to have fun in a new vehicle.",5
5311, on 03/30/16 13:33 PM (PDT),bryan kauffman ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),4 or 5 depending on expectations," Was looking for something that could hold a family of three, one still rocking a car seat, and be enjoyable when I rode alone to and from work (plus I love the aesthetics).  Got a topped out version of the plus model after considering the Exclaim.  The features I wanted while shaving off about $1500/$2000 off the price, though I think if I wanted the additional features the Exclaim is certainly worth looking at.  Driving Impression: Engine - meh.  Just okay with the 2.0 liter.  But, I am fine with that.  If they come out with the much discussed turbo model, I think that will sell briskly and make it the alternative to the VW GTI.  Doesnt struggle to keep up in traffic or pass.  Just doesnt blow your hair back.  Braking seems solid.  Wind noise is less than I expected considering the shape.  Ride feels composed on the highway.  Visibility is spectacular.  Body roll around corners is average.  Interior - Got the leather with ventilated/heated seats, a huge touch screen display with navigation (no service to buy to use it either.....bonus!)   Back seat easily fits my kid's carseat with plenty of room for an adult passenger in front of it.  Would probably be tight if he was still in an infant seat, but I think it would still be a fit.  Lots of soft touch materials.  Odometer display is a bit lackluster.  Back seats are comfy for an adult of average height.  Nice bonus that the outboard seats are also heated.  USB port and 2 120v adapters up front too.  Storage - Plenty of cup holders, a nice little cubby space for change and a glasses holder.  Armrest storage feels a little insubstantial and doesnt come with any useful trays or anything.  Wish you could adjust it a bit so it could be an arm rest.   Glove box is cavernous.  The rear storage cover is great and can be adjusted or removed if needed.  Storage behind the rear seats is adequate and honestly larger than anticipated considering the size of the vehicle (enough for a cart full of groceries) Storage under the floor cover is a wonderful surprise and actually holds quite a bit.  rOverall: I would probably give it a 4.25 star review if possible.  I think, dollar for dollar, it checks all the boxes and then some with room for only minor improvements.  I am thrilled with it and actually am looking a lot more forward to my commute.  My one annoyance is the constant pairing of the cell phone (just about every time you start the car it wants to update contact lists and asks if you want to keep your phone as primary.  Also, gas mileage is a bit subpar.",5

My wife has always driven larger SUVs and I've driven a 4-door Pickup truck for the past 10-years. I fully expected the Soul to have sluggish pickup and I expected to be bounced around like in any lightweight economy vehicle. Let me tell you,  this car is comfortable, it has plenty of pep (2.0L) and is fun to drive. I'm particularly pleased with the quality of the materials and workmanship in the car.  Plus this Soul! has more electronics than I have ever had in my previous luxury vehicles. I was so impressed that I purchased the extended bumper-to-bumper warranty which I have never done before. I had driven my pickup for 10-years and if my impressions prove correct, I'll be driving this just as long.",5

5315, on 03/09/16 17:06 PM (PST),Johnny ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon ! 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),"""ITS A SLEEPER"""," I looked and test drove tons of vehicles and the fact that I finally settled on my 2016 Kia Soul Exclaim w/ premium package amazes me. I wouldn't think originally that it would be the one. First the fact their isn't many on the road enabled me to get a good price unlike a Honda. Secondly it has a classic 6 speed automatic and NO CVT, I have the upgraded 2.0 which in this class is hard to get something thats not underpowered like the Subaru cross trek. The 2.0 has more then adequate power, my first drive on the highway I was sandwiched between a semi and a lane that was merging so I punched it and was very satisfied with the passing power. The vehicle is very easy to maneuver and drive, the back up camera is very helpful. I have the 8"" touchscreen infotainment and it's very responsive the navigation is on a SD card but is excellent with lane guidance. The leather seats are nice and comfortable I will say the passenger seat sits kinda low but I don't care I'm not the passenger. I also have the upgraded infinity stereo and it sounds good but could be better maybe I need to play around with settings. One of my favorite features is the panoramic sunroof with power sunshade it really brightens up the inside of vehicle. In closing I'm very happy with my Kia Soul and really believe for the money it's a sleeper vehicle.",5
5316, on 02/29/16 07:04 AM (PST),Bucki ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6A),"Versatility, practicality and value"," I purchased a 2016 KIA Soul Base automatic.  I paid $14.5k before taxes and registration.  At this price point the Soul represents an excellent value and I would recommend it.Strong points: Versatility, practicality and excellent warranty.  The wagon/hatchback layout is much more versatile than a traditional sedan, at a significantly lower price than a comparably-sized SUV/crossover.  KIA’s 5y/60k miles bumper-to-bumper and 10y/100k miles powertrain warranty offers excellent protection for budget-minded buyers.Weak points: Lackluster performance and comfort.  Performance from the stock 1.6L engine is adequate but the Soul is definitely not a fast vehicle.  Very smooth transmission with relatively low gearing helps to maintain car dynamics, but at the expense of fuel economy and engine noise.  Comfort is good for short drives, but long road trips are tiresome.  And don’t mistake the Soul for a “real” SUV/crossover – if you want higher ground clearance, AWD or even minimal towing capability, look elsewhere.Performance:  The Base 1.6L engine delivers adequate power for city driving and reasonable highway performance, but the Soul isn’t fast.  The transmission gearing keeps the engine relatively revved-up (compared to other modern cars), helping to improve driving dynamics, but at the expense of fuel economy and increased cabin noise.  Even with 4 adults the Soul does not feel underpowered at normal highway speeds and typical interstate inclines, but acceleration is only adequate, at best.  Fuel economy isn’t what one would expect from a vehicle of this size.  The 6-speed automatic transmission is very smooth and usually picks the right gears for the driving conditions, helping to make the most of the little engine.  But it also keeps the rpm’s relatively high (close to 3,000 at interstate speeds), resulting in more engine noise.Comfort:  The Soul offers a lot of space for the money and there is enough room for 4 fully grown adults to ride in relative comfort.  Sitting position is very good with generous leg, head and elbow room, both in the front and the rear.  However, the seats are not all that comfortable for long rides.  Front seats offer good lateral support, but lumbar support is nonexistent, and there are a few “hard spots” in the seatbacks making prolonged rides somewhat tiring.  Rear seats are very flat bench-like, and the seatback angle does not help to adopt a relaxed position for a long ride.  Access is excellent thanks to the low floor, tall roof and large doors.  The ride is stiff but adequate for the size and class of vehicle, and not overwhelmingly harsh.  Cabin sound level is good during city driving and adequate at highway speeds.  Both engine and road noise are kept down to reasonable levels. Quality and fit-and-finish:  Interior materials are good for vehicle class and price.  All panels fit nicely and everything seems solid and well made.  There are no squeaks or rattles when driving over uneven road surfaces, and in general the vehicle feels very solid.Cargo space and versatility:  The wagon/hatchback layout offers a lot of versatility.  The cargo space is adequate and the trunk layout is very clever.  There is a cargo organizer tray under the trunk floor, allowing to keep valuable out-of-sight and organized, at the expense of some cargo space above.  This tray can be removed, and the trunk floor can be lowered increasing the cargo space by about 30% to accommodate large suitcases.  And of course the back seats can be folded, providing plenty of space for large objects.Equipment:  As all KIAs, the Soul comes well equipped even in the most basic trim, with a good audio system that includes satellite radio, Bluetooth and voice commands.  Pairing-up a phone is quick and easy, and voice commands work generally well.  The basic A/C-heater performance is adequate and it is not as noisy as in other economy vehicles.  Privacy glass is a nice detail that helps to keep your stuff out-of-sight and the interior cool.  Soul comes without a spare tire, but you can buy a tire-jack kit for under $200.Safety: Passive safety is very good with a 5-star rating from NHTSA and Top Safety Pick by the IIHS. The Base model lacks some of the modern active safety features such as lane departure, blind spot monitoring or front collision warning/avoidance, but for the price it is a very safe choice.  Visibility is very good all-around.  Controls are simple, intuitive and very ergonomic.  Handling and steering are adequate considering that the Soul is pretty high.  Braking is adequate with good pedal feel.  Headlights are average with good low-beams.  High beams have good reach but provide little illumination to the road surface.  Final verdict:  For less than $15k the Soul is a strong value and an excellent choice for anybody who wants a versatile, practical vehicle on a budget.  KIA’s excellent warranty provides extra protection that otherwise is only available through a pricey extended warranty.",5
5317, on 01/29/16 08:24 AM (PST),Phil Smith ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),First KIA purchase," over all this is a great car it may seam small on the outside but inside it feels roomy.  The telescoping wheel is a great feature with my long legs I can sit comfortably with the wheel close to me so my arms are not stretched out straight. My friends have commented on the amount of leg room they have in the back seat as well.  the acceleration is a tad slow but with a 1.6 liter engine that should be expected.  I opted for the manual transmission by choice, I love shifting on long car rides to help keep me awake.  With that being said the shift knob is less than uncomfortable  imagine a cue ball mounted on top because that's basically what they give you.  The palm of my hand will start to hurt wile I'm stuck in traffic.  I have purchased an aftermarket shift knob to replace it.The EPA rated gas mileage at 31 highway, but with good shifting and keeping with the 65mph speed limit I'm getting 34.5 mpg commuting 100 miles round trip to work and back each day.  I do very little city driving, the highway is about 2 miles from my house and my work is about 7 miles from the exit so most of the miles I put on the car are true highway miles.",4

5321, on 01/08/16 11:08 AM (PST),Paul Wilson ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),A most excellent and fun little car," I am 6' 5"" tall and over 300 pounds. I have trouble finding cars I can be comfortable in. My spouse of course is a little gal at 5' 2"" so we needed to find something we could agree on.  This is not my first Kia or even my first Soul.  We originally bought a 2000 Rio which our daughter drove into the ground.  We also bought a  2011 Soul 1600cc with 5 speed manual.  That was a very fun car but it had two big issues.  Cruise control was not available even in aftermarket for that year and it was too loud on the freeway.  The engine noise restricted it to being an around town car.  No way were you going to drive 1,000 miles to visit your in-laws.  So we traded the 2011 in for the 2016 base with 1600 engine and 6 speed automatic.  You’re sitting there thinking “but it’s no bigger.”  Well, it isn’t and then it is.  The interior is a little roomier, but more importantly the gear ratio is very different and this has a lot more get up and go because of the gearing. It has cruise control and has great sound deadening which the original did not have.  This car has many other features the 2011 Soul did not.  It has selectable steering, sort of a drive by wire system. It has an ECO engine mode which provides optimal acceleration for economy driving. The stereo is easy to use and includes satellite as well as USB and Aux jack.  I plug my smartphone in and play music by way of Pandora.  Unlimited channels and cheaper too, plus I can reject songs I don’t care for. Try that SeriusXM.  The 1600 engine has been around for a long time and runs like a Swiss watch. My base model also has auto on/off headlights, electric windows, as well as keyless remote for doors and trunk lid. Perhaps the best feature was the price.  It was $16,635.  One thing I like is the heat and air.  Simple to use and you don’t have to constantly tweak the temperature setting. Fog on windshield disappears almost instantly.  Kia did a lot to improve the Soul. Soul’s are tight well built cars that are fun to drive.Six months later.  Nothing has changed.  We are very happy with this car.  We have had no problems with it.  Controls are intuitive and easy to use.One year after buying.  Only issue is one tire leaks air so I have to top that one off more often than normal.  Still very happy with the car.   I see many white Soul's around town now.  Soul is very popular here in my area of Florida.  Every few years there is a car that just seems to catch on because it really fills a niche.  This is one of them.  I think it was designed for young people but folks my age saw the car as reliable and useful transportation and made it popular.",5

The heated/ventilated seats in the front are fabulous & recently sat in the heated comfortable backseat.I have not experienced driving in snow as of yet, but have driven in rain & at night.

5325, on 12/12/15 17:24 PM (PST),Brian ,2016 Kia Soul Wagon + 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl 6A),Kia has officially blown me away," Let me preface this review with the fact that my daily driver is a BMW X5, and my previous vehicles were Infiniti JX and 2 Lexus GX470's.  So I tend to be very harsh when reviewing non-luxury cars (I absolutely can't stand my wife's Toyota Sienna, but then again, I don't have to drive it).  We purchased this car primarily as a third family vehicle now that our son is driving.  My goal was to find a nicely equipped vehicle with excellent safety and great visibility.  Honestly, I wasn't too concerned with interior quality, fit/finish or ride quality.  My goal was a decent car for around $20k.  We looked at quite a few different cars:  Mazda 3, VW Golf, Honda Fit, Honda Civic, and Toyota Corolla.After test driving the snot out of all the above named cars, we kept comparing everything to the Kia Soul.  We ended up purchasing a 2016 Soul + with the audio and primo pkg's and some add ons (MSRP $25,550) for $21,325.  We actually had an offer from a dealer that was 3 hours away for $20,680 but I didn't really feel like driving 6 hours round trip to save a few hundred dollars.  What floored me is the fact that the Kia Soul absolutely blows away the competition for what you get for the money.  The interior is excellent at this price point:  Leather seating, a mixture of soft touch, hard touch surfaces and a very intuitive navigation/entertainment system with a feature called Evo that allows you to set notifications on various parameters such as traveling outside of a certain geographic radius, driving over a designated speed or driving past a set curfew (all of which are excellent for keeping track of your young drivers), plus the feeling of a spacious cabin.  The ride is firm yet comfortable and cabin noise is far better then expected and the fact that for $21k you get auto on/off headlights, leather, navigation, keyless remote entry and keyless engine start, remote start, panoramic sunroof, upgraded audio system with subwoofer (that is actually pretty darn good), fog lights, LED interior lighting, speaker lighting, homelink rear view mirror, rear view camera, heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats, heated steering wheel, leather wrapped steering wheel, etc.  Simply put, the Kia Soul was far better equipped for the selling price vs. all of the other cars we considered (the VW Golf was close to $30k for similar equipment and still didn't include cooled seats or heated rear seats).My only complaint is the cheap Nexen tires that came on the vehicle.  They are pretty bad.  Within the first week, we had a pretty light rain and I was spinning the tires from a stop.  Needless to say, I took off the Nexen and put on Pirelli's and the difference in performance is not only night and day, but the road noise has improved as has the ride quality.  The point of my review is that Kia was never on my radar screen, but my wife thought that the Soul was cute and quirky so I drove it expecting to quickly cross it off the list.  I never expected this type of quality from a car that only cost $21,000.  I remember sitting in an MBA class about 5 years ago with a fellow student doing an analysis of Kia and thinking to myself that ""Kia will never be able to compete with the major automobile companies because they make cheap crap.""  Well, today I'm eating crow....  gladly.  They've given us a very nice vehicle for a reasonable amount of money.   Great job, Kia.",5

The first was a brand new, off-the-lot EX V6 4x2, and the second, and current, is a used EX Limited V8 4x4.  Fell in love with my first Borrego's excellent freeway manners, stability at any speed, and feature-laden and cavernous interior.  Although the 4x2 was tow rated for 5,000 lbs., we wanted something stronger to pull a heavy RV trailer.  When we learned that that the V8 Borrego was tow-rated at 7,500 lbs., which is huge for its class, we searched around and bought one from a nearby private seller.  It hasn't disappointed as a tow vehicle.  Ironically, the V6 felt peppier and smoother.  But I'm happy with the V8's torque and go-anywhere confidence of the full-time 4x4 system.  I'm only sorry that Kia discontinued the Borrego as I would loved to made a three-peat. On both Borrego's, I appreciated the interior volume, standard adult sized third row seating, easy to use navigation system, no fuss dashboard and HVAC controls and layout, and just simple reliability all around.

Never gave me one issue with the engine.  Always started. Inexpensive to maintain.  At about 75k, things started breaking.  The CD player quit working, the button for volume became tricky as well.  The AC was not always great in the back,so sometimes we burned up on long trips.  The Door locks broke, and the paint began chipping and flaking like crazy.  Despite this, it was a great car mechanically. It was a trusty beast, and if not for  the fact that my kids started moving out, I'd probably still drive the gas guzzler daily.  It was just that reliable.  Of course, I'd have to insure I did not lock the doors,  or cared about having a car with paint, all while burning up and checking apps for cheap gas.  It gets to ya, it's like a good old work truck that's ugly as Heck, but you went to your first job in it, so you keep it.   I had a hard time trading it in.  I kinda felt sorry for it.  I guess that's what happens with good cars.  I guess this is a great car if you just need to drive a little bit, or you have a kid who just needs to go back and forth to school, and gas moneys no big thing it they are safe.  All in all, it's a reliable family hauler that's cheap to maintain.  I truly believe someone can drive it 200k with very little issues.  If that's all that matters to you, this is the car for you.   Just make sure you never lock it or leave anything valuable in it.  :)",4

Turning radius is great. I have a Volvo xc90 and cars are similar except I paid almost $20,000 more for the Volvo. The Volvo has better leather and insulation for wind noise. Other than that I think the borrego is a great car for the price. Gas mileage could be better but it's a good size SUV. My Volvo gets a little better gas mileage but needs premium gas.

You know it is a truck type frame over large bumps.  This also means it will carry a load with no problem.  Dash layout and control are the the best I have seen.

Also, the last gear in the tranny shifts really late, which makes you feel like it is revving too much under certain driving conditions.  It is my understanding that this is normal or was designed that way, but still a little annoying.  Overall, LOTS of room and comfort.  All back seats fold pretty flat making hauling easy.

The strong engine and brake perform flawlessly. Transmission, however, sometimes hesitates. Fuel economy is a little disappointing at 16+ MPG (mostly city).  The interior is mostly quiet, and ride is good except over rough pavement. It can get jarring, and mine rattles a bit in the back area.  All controls are laid out intuitively.

You get way more bang for your buck with this baby!!  Its has all the comforts of the more expensive bands and drives awsome.  I already sold two to other people that saw my Borrego.  I spend a lot of time at my job driving around looking and/ or estimating jobs, so comfort is big, my BORREGO is like being in a lounge chair all day!!

Comfortable ride,well placed,easy to use controls,vast cargo space with both rear rows down. Handles well,small turning radius, smooth powerfull engine. 5 star safety ratings except a 4 for rollover(it IS a suv). Better mpg than my '91 Cherokee,as much room as my '72 Suburban had,drives and handles better than either did. You do feel bumps in the road,but it doesn't beat you with them. It is after all a true 4wd, not a car. I researched vehicles for 3 years before I finally purchased this. I wanted a U.S. brand,but nothing came close in price,quality, or warranty.      ",5

We do this trip at least twice a year and this is the first vehicle we have owned, including a Honda Odyssey that my back doesn't bother me.  Very comfortable.

Just the basics with 4wd.  Totally impressed so far with the mileage (around 20 highway).  Handles well and rides very quietly.  Very happy with the purchase so far.  The true test will be the offroad ability (8.5 inches of ground clearance concerns me).  I looked for 4 months in California at multiple different makes and models.  My requirements: 4wd with third row seats and room in the back for adults.  There are other choices out there; however, the Kia had the best fit for your family.  Most importantly, the price was about $10K under the competition and they threw in a 10 year 100K mile warranty on everything.",5

I am very glad I made this purchase. I did look at numerous vehicles in this and found the Borrego had more room, more options at a lower overall cost, and had a sharper look to it.   I find the ride to be great-much like a car and you sit high like a truck. All controls are easy to find and use.  I have the luxury package and rear seat entertainment package for the kids. I recommend this set up and the cost was not bad. Well designed and very comfortable. Third row seating has plenty of foot room and space with comfortable seats. A real pleasure to drive.",4.875

AC compressor makes a knocking noise and I only have 3400 miles on the vehicle.  I have taken it in for repair twice and of course the noise isn't as loud while it's at KIA so they say it is normal.  $27,000 luxury vehicle that makes a knocking noise while going down the road!

It looks great and has all the features I want/need at a great price. People tell me when they take a close look at it that they didn't know Kia made a solid mid-size SUV.

Inspect it before buying; and try to find a K900 dealer near you; you will love the car.  I re-badged it with the Korean badges and get asked daily if it's a Lexus LS; everyone is stunned at the quality and features in a KIA.

I have had different Mercedes and BMW cars and I could say that buying this car for the price of a used 2014 BMW 535 or a Mercedes C class 2015 is totally a no brainer!!! No comparison whatsoever unless you are driving the emblem and not the car in which case changing the emblems to the ones used outside the US is only a couple of hundred dollars and then you have to answer questions from people who stare at the car and ask you what car you are driving,5

The cars are similar in size, comfort, driving dynamics and cabin noise. The difference is that the K900 is half the price. This car is a pleasure to drive and ride in. Acceleration and shifting are smooth and effortless. Gas mileage is poor in city. Navigation interface is poor, like Mercedes. Parking cameras, LED headlights, heated/cooled seats, and sound system are all excellent. Have had the car for over a year. I would buy again.Updating review after owning vehicle for about 3 years. I still enjoy the smooth ride very much. I have purchased new tires and done regular maintenance on the vehicle and it is running strong and quiet. The last 6 cars I owned, I owned for less than 3 years each so the fact that I am keeping this vehicle means something to me.",5
5394, on 07/06/16 16:48 PM (PDT),Jeff ,2015 Kia K900 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (5.0L 8cyl 8A),Buyer Beware," If you are thinking about purchasing a K900, my advice is DON'T!  I have had my K900 for less than 1 year (and less than 9,500 miles).  During this time the vehicle has had to be towed TWICE back to the dealership because it either would not start or was unable to be driven. In addition the car is on it's 3rd battery. Lastly, when the car was less than two months old the Entertainment system had to be replaced. The most recent service took the dealership 5 days to fix (and a factory engineer had to be called in because the dealership could not identify the problem). I have had more service issues on this car in less than 12 months than all of the cars I have owned in my life combined (and I am 58 years old, so a lot of them). Fortunately because the car was under warranty I have no out of pocket expense, just a lot of frustration and inconvenience. The car looks great, is comfortable, a lot of leg and head room (important because I am 6'3""), great pick up / power but extremely poor in its reliability.  One other thing to consider is if you are purchasing the vehicle from an out of town dealer because their pricing is better than a local dealer beware that not all Kia dealerships offer the K900 and only those that do can service it.  Unfortunately the nearest Kia dealership to me that can service the vehicle provides TERRIBLE service (and I have purchased vehicles from a ""sister dealership"",same owner, different brand) and their service department was great.  You have probably heard the saying that the two happiest days for a boat owner is the day he buys the boat and the day he sells it.  I feel the same about my K900 and can't wait until I am not upside down and can get rid of this albatross.",1

It has great value when comparing to A8, S550, or BMW 7 series.   I would say K900 is behind germans brands by about 30-35% in most categories.  But it leaves Germans in the dust when it comes to value.  When compared to above mentioned german brands where my payment would be 1k or more per month--I am paying $465/mo on a lease for luxury packageThis is my first Kia and I am impressed.",5

5397, on 01/30/16 06:45 AM (PST),Jeff ,2015 Kia K900 Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan (5.0L 8cyl 8A),I'll never own another Kia," I've had nothing but problems from day one with the Kia K900. Shortly sfter driving the car off the lot, I felt a vibration coming from the front of the car, immediately brought it back to Kia... They claimed that the tires were ""out of round"" because the car sat on the lot for so long. So they balanced the tires and told me to put miles on the tires and it would go away. I brought it back again... They replaced the tires, it still didn't fix the vibration. They replaced the wheels, then told me that the car was fine... I took it off the lot, and to my dismay, the fix didn't work... Then hey replaced the drive shaft... It still didn't work, the vibration was still there. Kia corporate got involved... They sent out a specialist, with a newly designed drive shaft.. Promised me that installing this newly designed drive shaft would work because they have had numerous customers that have had the same problem with their K900 models, and it fixed the problem 80% of the time....I had to wait for over 25 days for the drive shaft to be installed.... And it still vibrated... The magical drive shaft still didn't work.Kia finally admitted that this was a problem inherent to the car's design and engineering and that it will never cease to vibrate as it does. Furthermore, they informed me that The vibration is within the normal operating specs of the vehicle, and there was nothing more they could do to address it.All of the above transpired within two months of driving it off the lot. I just want to give them their car back, get my money back, so I can move on from this nightmare...they've refused to take it back. They've refused to give me my money back. It's been two months since they acknowledged that they can't fix the vibration... I now have to sue Kia to get them to take their defective designed car back and return my money.Don't waste your money or your time like I did. There's a reason why they're leasing a 60+k luxury car for 399/month..... Seems like a great bargain...right? Don't buy a Kia. I did, and never will again.",1

You know why?  Because its almost half the price...  For the price of 1 S550 I can buy two of these so I will live with a button or two that are not up to par with MB....  Speaking of MB, if I compared the K900 to what it really should be weighed against because of price I would be comparing it to the E350.  So for 60k in an E350 I would have heated vinyl seats and nav and thats about it...  You know what else I love?  its the first new car ever that has had ZERO issues...  no ""reprogramming issues"" (BMW) or ""our techs know about it and are working on a fix (MB).  Car has been problem free since day one and a joy to drive...  I'm 6'2 and 250 and fit comfortably and the kids feel like they are being chauffeured around in the back seat.   Not all of us want to take corners at 70mph and I really enjoy the fact that there aren't allot of these on the road.  I get thumbs up all the time and get questioned about the car every time I am getting gas (which is allot!)  Lease rates through Kia are amazing, about $500 a month.  My complaints about the car?  Gas mileage... but its a heavy V8 so I get it.  I wish the rear side sunscreens were power.  Only other issue I have is Kia dealers need to step up their service departments for a better experience.

The ride and comfort are exquisite and the car has a rich look and feel.  However, the entertainment system is a mess.  Pandora only works with iPhone unless you use the blue tooth option which will play the music but you have to control the app from your Android phone.

Live in Arizona so wanted a light or white interior, couldn't get it with the VIP package in white interior at that time. Fuel economy could be better , but I'm getting combined better than the highway mileage listed for car. Would have been better with the VIP packageAfter 54,000 miles, traded for a 2018 Genesis G90.

5402, on 01/21/17 15:40 PM (PST),Daniel H ,2016 Kia K900 Sedan Premium V6 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 8A),Poor reliability and price for the features," We have two identical K900s that we bought in October 2016 we have taken both of the cars in since day 2 with small to large problems. Kia Motors was aware of some of the issues prior to us buying our two cars. As an example, the cruise control set speed indicator and speedometer do not match, ex. If the cruise is set at 70 mph it says you are going 75 mph on speedometer they still have no idea how to fix it from Kia Motors and its been over 4 months since I reported it. Backup camera wouldn't show picture had camera replaced. Auto Hold Brake feature on both have issues, on one it lets off the brake when it shouldn't which could make you get into an accident. Our other K900 is also having an issue with Auto Hold but it now doesn't work at all and has lights on indicating it knows there is an issue. For both, parts have been ordered to replace a different module on each respectively one a Trac module and other an ABS module, but it sounds like the Field Technician is guessing at least with the ABS module been waiting for ABS module since November 26. 2016. Trac module was ordered in late December. Fuel door doesn't open now without using manual release in trunk along with pushing the door open. Vibration, tire and alignment issues continue to be present even after multiple times of tires being replaced. Finally, overall customer service satisfaction from Kia Motors in handling my cases is Extremely Poor, I asked Kia on December 19 for a callback and even after multiple attempts to speak with upper management and for callbacks, the first time someone called me back was on January 12. I only received a callback because I had to file a BBB Autoline complaint since they never responded to my lemon law notice even after 30 days and even though I already had an open case. Also, be aware although Kia promises on their site that K900 customers should get a Cadenza or K900 loaner car don't bet on it. My dealer only has 2 loaner cars in its tiny fleet, an Optima or Sorrento don't expect to be blown away for the start of a luxury car experience. I think it is funny that the dealer employees have to be K900 certified but they don't follow Kia's rules even though they know the rules. And if you're wondering my dealer is the largest in the world so why can't they follow the rules and meet customer expectations.",1

My car  purchased came with wrong battery installed. after 2 years the battery died, I took into the dealer to have them provide the correct battery the dealers refused.",1
5418, on 04/03/16 13:43 PM (PDT),Oscar ,2013 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 6A),Excellent value!," I bought my Kia Rio LX Sedan brand new in 2013 for about $15,000. I have the automatic transmission and also added the ""Power Package"" (Power Windows and Power Door Locks with keyless remote). The car has been absolutely great! I commute 100 miles per day, mostly on the Interstate. In 3 years time, I put more than 65,000 miles on the car. I have had zero issues, no repairs, no recalls. I change the oil every 5,000 miles and that is the only time I see the dealer.For a small car like the Rio, I am really impressed how comfortable it is on the Interstate. My cruising speed is usually around 85 MPH and tire noise, engine noise and wind noise are very low. No rattles or squeaks inside the cabin either. Car manufacturers do not make big profits on sub-compact cars and as a result most of them not only make the cars small, they also make them cheap (save money on sound insulation, thin glass, etc.). Not the case with this Rio!My average gas mileage is about 37 MPG and I am sporty driver. I must say my commute is 90%  Interstate. City driving definitely requires more gas. You can actually get 40 MPG on the Highway if you stick to the 75 MPH speed limit and don't drive with a heavy right foot. I never use the ""eco"" button. Just makes the car sluggish.Compared to other small cars, this Rio is nicely equipped. It has a relatively large wheelbase, which means it is pretty stable on the Interstate. If you push it over 100 MPH, stability suffers a bit but by that time you are also going way over the speed limit (unless you live in Germany). No other reviewer has mentioned this, but the Rio also has excellent brakes. It does not have cheap drum brakes in the rear like most competitors. Instead, it has discs all around. Stopping power is awesome.I did not pay the extra money for the EX version, but instead I got the accessories I wanted on Ebay and installed them myself (i.e. fog lights, chrome grille, mudguards). I even put a trailer hitch on it, so I can use a bike carrier. The Rio does not come with a spare tire, only a compressor and tire repair kit/foam. So I bought the spare tire kit as well. One of the features the LX did not have, was cruise control. However, the computer in the car already has the cruise control software and the throttle is ""fly by wire"". So all you need to do is buy an EX-steering wheel and install it in your LX...and that gives you the cruise control buttons!I plan to keep the Rio for many more years. It is nice to know that the engine is using a timing chain, so you don't have to worry about a belt that needs to be replaced every 60,000 miles. The transmission is a ""sealed unit"" and according to the manual, you do not have to replace the transmission fluid...ever. I'm not sure if I believe that, and my dealer recommends changing the fluid at 90,000 miles. I will probably do that.The automatic transmission is actually pretty smooth and quick. I use it in ""manual/sport mode"" all the time, so I can determine my own shift points. The engine is impressively powerful for just a 1.6 liter 4-cylinder. It does not make it a sports car, but the Rio does not weigh much and if you are willing to rev the engine a bit it is pretty quick!The last thing I want to say is that the styling of the Rio is best in class. I know taste is personal, but many sub-compact cars are just ugly.  Go look at a Tpyota Yaris, or Nissan Versa, Ford Fiesta, etc... the proportions just don't look ""right"". The Rio on the other hand is really a good looking car!Overall I am very impressed with this little car. It is great value for money!Oh, and it has a 10-year 100,000 mile warranty (but you will probably never need it).",4

We needed a car for daily job commute. Hence fuel economy, safety, warranty, powerful engine and few tech features were on our list.

As many people say that kia uses super cheap parts.The engine is strong and has good lift. ( I say this statement based on its class, small compact sedan) Outside noise is minimal.Overall this is a GREAT buy. Especially the warranty that kia gives. you'll never have to worry about the engine or transmission for 10 yrs or 100,000 miles.

I am scared to get into my car and drive it every day in fear of it breaking down on me. Also, as others have mentioned, the AC sucks all the power out of the car so in the hot summer you can't always have it on.

This Rio is very reliable, uses no oil, is easy to park, has an adjustable drivers seat (helps on long trips).  Best thing about this car is the warranty.

Even the dealer's tech had difficulty. The company needs to send every owner an addendum that truly instructs on how to replace a tail light. Otherwise you will be one frustrated driver and prone to a police stop. The existing manual has only two instructions. The second one is ""Carefully remove the tail light assembly from the body.""

This little car is just what I needed.  The fuel economy is quite good, but could be improved.  It's surprisingly fun to drive.  It's far roomier than you would expect from its dimesions.  I've never had a single problem with this car --just regularly scheduled maintenance.  Sure, I get the occasional odd look from other attorneys when they see me in my little Rio5, but I could care less.  ",4.125

The car is attractive, fun to drive, and it is good enough power-, handling-, and feature-wise for us.  Shortly after break-in, we took the car to TX (1800+ miles each way).  Never dawdling, with two adults and two kids, fully loaded with toys and gear, we got 33 mpg.  Not bad!  It would do better, though, if Kia put a 6-speed in this model.  3500+ revs in 5th for typical Southern and Western U.S. interstate driving is too much.  If I often drove on Southern or Western interstates, I would be less pleased with the car.  But in the hilly, trafficky Northeast, where I live, I highly recommend it!",4.75

The car handles and drives much better than my soul with the 6 sp. trans. - pretty smooth although the 1.6L really works hard at 65 mph and up; always downshifting on slight inclines.The GDI engine is not living up to the 30/40 MPG on the window sticker. I divide miles driven by gallons pumped when I fill up; I'm getting 25 city and 30-31 hwy. Big disappointment! With the except of the low MPG the car does not disappoint,5

The car itself would probably satisfy a lot of other profiles, but it is smack in the middle of my demo. Cargo space is not that great, but that is not why I bought this car. I bought this with the convenience package which included UVO (a cool addition) and the rearview camera. No need for nav if you already have a smartphone. Car handles beautifully and very little of the harsh rides associated with sub-compacts. Really like the looks and the interior. A lot of reviews have commented on how the interior does not look as cheap as other cars in the class. ",4.5

There are other competitors in this class that are better in one or two areas, but none have the overall combination of a terrific enginewith an excellent 6 speed automatic transmission,lots of interior room, fantastic looks, an abundance of safety features, high tech gadgets, nimble handling, and the best warranty in the industry. The RIO is extremely comfortable on long trips, which is unusual for a small car. Can you believe the outside mirrors are heated electronically and fold into the car with the touch of a button?

We have a family car that is for trips but the Rio 5 is for everyday use. We could not find another vehicle for less money with a better warantry.

When I first got it, it ran great! I was getting 34 mpg in the city, and about 39 highway. I have had this vehicle for 3 years, and within the last two year I have started having major issues. first off, you cannot get part for this vehicle from an auto parts store. you have to get it from a licensed KIA dealership. two, the engine shakes sometimes. when I am sitting at a red light it starts to shake like it is going to explode. and since the engine started to shake and the way the car is designed, the AC compressor is nicely placed right in front of the radiator overflow. so when the motor shook it burned a hole into the overflow, melting it and making me lose antifreeze and making the radiator cap break. in this specific car, you have to replace the whole radiator to replace the overflow. three, over heating issues and knocking from the motor. I take very good car of this car, it is in for maintenance every 3 months and have the paper work to prove it. but every single summer it over heats no matter how careful I am. four, going up hill... you can step on the gas as hard as you want and it will not go any faster. five, the van does not turn on all the time. I have had the Carfax pulled and there are no records of issues from the previous own. I hope this helps. but I will never buy a KIA again. I paid 9k for this car and I have put over 15k in fixing it. this car isn't worth the stress.",1

In nearly 18,000 miles so far it has had minimal problems. One trip to the dealer for a computer update because of the knock sensor code putting it into limp mode. Other than that just regular maintenance. The manual transmission is great, I love it and bombing around town feels like driving a rally car. Excellent gas mileage on the highway but with many hours behind the wheel I have to say lack of lumbar support isn't great. City driving in ""stop and go"" traffic is a nightmare but only due to the manual transmission. It has good trunk storage but it could have a bigger door area as fitting larger items is difficult or impossible.

When you turn the ECO setting off, you get a significant boost in power and throttle response. Handles great in the city, but acts like a small car would on the interstate. I love the SportShift, although not the quickest shifts, it is a blast through curvy roads. The high beams illuminate very well as do the regular lights.

Look at what you get from Toyota, Honda, Nissan in this same segment and compare all the features. I went to each dealer, Toyota had a sticker price increase of $1500 ""market adjusted value"" on the Corolla! Nonsense! I wanted something that would get good gas mileage (+36mpg), holds a couple golf bags and more in the trunk, and if needed, my family of 4 when we're not in the sweet minivan. This car has extreme value at a low price... less than $18K out the door. You can electronically fold in the heated side mirrors, which have LED turn signals. The front lights have LED markers and the rear tail lights are all LED. Engine has the most horsepower in the segment and is direct injection technology. Big 17 inch wheels on the ground, USB port on radio which is built by Microsoft UVO and I could go on and on for the features. You will see many of these features only in higher segment cars. Japan auto makers are becoming dated fast with their features and technology and are overpriced for their value in today's market. KIA shares many of their platforms now with Hyundai and the quality of their build has dramatically improved with the RIO. I have been very satisfied for the first 1200 miles. If you are looking for good gas mileage, good trunk space, great features, LED lights aplenty, etc... do not overlook this car and forget completely about KIA in 2008. In 2012 they have transformed light years ahead of the competition.",5

It was exactly what I was hoping for. It got great gas mileage (30+ on long trips) and was dependable with minimum maintenance. I only had one issue with it, which was with the spark plugs. I didn't read the maintenance guide and didn't get these replaced. So around 40k miles, the car turned on the check engine light and started shaking in idle. Got a tune up, but 6 months later it happened again. Took it to the dealership where they said Kias need Kia parts. So that was all fixed and there were no other issues, up to 58k when the car was deemed totaled in a wreck.The most important things I need in a car are reliability and safety. This car was in 2 major wrecks. Once when I was pregnant with my daughter and someone turned in front of me so that I smashed the front of my car in. The second, someone slammed into the side of the car. The side my now 2 year old was on. We were both completely okay both times even when the car was totaled for the second accident.

But all in all, this car is amazing.The inside:My version, the LX, came with bluetooth support allowing me to connect my phone and call people without ever having to touch my phone. All you need to do is press a button on the wheel and say ""Call (whoever you're calling),"" it'll say back the name it heard and ask for verification. For some reason however, some people claim they can hear me just as well as if I had the phone to my ear, and others say it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel. The seats are plain looking, but surprisingly comfortable. My girlfriend has never been able to sleep in a car during a road trip- even overnight- until we went on a road trip in the Rio. The back seats are fairly average, though there isn't much space, however, three of my friends who are grown adult men were able to squeeze into the back, and didn't have many complaints.Driving:Driving this car is surprisingly fun. It has a very tight turning angle and can make a u-turn in places other cars can't. It can take curves well at high speeds(with proper grip and good tires). Acceleration leaves something to be desired, but considering it's a 110HP engine designed to sip gas and give you 38MPG, it feels just right.Travelling noise gets gradually worse as the car gets higher in miles. When I originally bought it, it was very quiet. Now there's a lot of wind noise and the engine isn't as quiet as it used to be(still very quiet though).The engine:The number one complaint I've seen about this car in terms of the engine, is the ignition coils going out. The owners manual states that the spark plugs should be changed around 36000 miles. Most people don't change the oil in their car, let alone change the spark plugs or even do required maintenance. Unfortunately, I was one of those people around the 40,000 mile mark. My engine began to shake horribly and flashed the CEL. I had it towed to the Kia dealership(For free! Because Kia's roadside assistance for the first 60,000 miles), and they told me the spark plugs went out and it took the ignition coils out with it. They told me it was bad gas, and told me to only use Shell gas. Do not believe this. This was because the factory spark plugs don't last past 36,000(which is average for spark plugs, not a bad thing). They replaced the ignition coils for free because they were under warranty, but charged me $150 to replace the spark plugs. This is the ONLY thing I have had go wrong with the engine that wasn't somebody else's fault. Otherwise the Rio's inline-4 is reliable, and very easy to work on. Replacing the spark plugs cost me only $20 and about 20 minutes of time. It has 3 accessory belts, which is annoying, but they aren't hard to change and are relatively inexpensive.Overall:This car would make a wonderful starter car, and while it may not be the flashiest or the fastest car in the world, you can pick up a 2011 Rio for relatively cheap which makes it a perfect car for a first time driver, or a second car used to take on trips thanks to it's amazing fuel efficiency.",5

The vibration is terrible and the car often ""jumps"" when accelerating. It's not very safe. I was in a minor collision and the other drivers car was not damaged at all, but my bumper fell off and the seatbelt didn't even hold me in place as I bumped my chest into the steering wheel. Its great on gas, but there are much better cars out there for the price.",2.125
5713, on 08/23/08 17:52 PM (PDT),Ann ,2001 Kia Rio Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 5M),Thank Goodness for Warranty," Within 1 year of owning the Kia the rear wheel bearings & automatic transmission gave out.  Thankfully it was covered by the warranty & I also had all maintenance records!  Have replaced the sun visors, the rubber insulation around the doors.  Dealer replaced the pump for the wiper washer fluid and the air conditioning belt, but the belt still squeals & the washer fluid doesn't pump.  The paint on the rear bumper is very faded and paid $50 for a plastic radiator fan which likely costs 50 cents in Korea. Saving grace is the gas mileage and that the car is paid for until the next repair, as the warranty has expired.",2.75

It has some warranty and repair work done in the first two years I owned it, but I never had to pay any out of pocket expenses for repair work on the car.  After owning a Plymouth Sundance and a Dodge Neon, this is the most dependable car I have owned.  It's well over 100,000 miles now and still going strong.  I also hit two deer with the vehicle and it held up very well.  This car does not have any special features or a powerful engine, but its good on the gas and gets me where I need to go.",3.875

Kept up with regular maintenance, oil changes and tire needs; started giving us problems once we moved from FL/GA area to TX.  Have had the car in shop 3 times since Xmas, replaced fan/timing belts and radiator pcs once it died on freeway.  One month later it has completely died -  engine out and is more costly to replace. It is great for singles or couples, if you are young and starting out or at college; not meant for family car (space is VERY limited). Excellent gas mileage and great for tight parking spaces. I like Kias, just be sure to do research and know what you are paying for; newer KIA models are worth the investment.",3.625

Kia won't cover it (of course) now I have a car that looks new but doesn't run, it has only 60,000 miles and all three mechanics told me it was garbage, so be careful and listen to what people have to say.",2.125

There's a squeaking in the right side (maybe the suspension) which the Kia dealer ""doesn't know what's wrong with it"". The check engine light comes and goes when it pleases. When the weather is cold my car stalls and doesn't shift well; revs really high before shifting into the next gear until the car is completely warmed up 30 minutes later. My brakes went out once - they all of a sudden started rubbing and were completely gone by the time I got home.

Lived in CO, WV, GA, MN, and VA with this car.  Offroad, cities, and highways.                    Cons:  Rear tire camber means I must rotate every 5k and no less.  Often inner edges of tires destroyed before main tread of tire.   5 sets of tires in 102,000 miles.  Misfires on occasion ever since purchase, but never fully stranded.   Keep cranking' and it starts.  Front wheel bearing started thudding down the road at 95k.  All belts replaced at 75k.  Spark plugs at 75k (Boche platinum now, but occasional misfires continued).   Have to be on the highway to get good gas mileage; city and winding mountain roads dramatically dents mpg figures below EPA estimates.  Radio volume knob stopped functioning around 80k. Battery at 45k (Haven't replaced autocraft gold since first replacement)  Rear window seals rotted at 45k (used silicone to patch).  EVAP solenoid failed around 45k.                      Pros:  Never stranded me despite rual mountains roads, snow and ice, high elevation, and extreme temperatures.  Mpg on highway is around 30.      Summary: if you want a nice car you'll pay for it.  You could get a cheaper car than this, but this is about the bottom of the barrel within cars market so if you don't have a good income a Kia is a nice trade-off between cost and quality.

My '05 Kia Rio5 has been great, and I've only encountered things you would expect from an inexpensive car. It came to me used, from my mother's estate after she died a few years ago. It was low-mile, with the I4 and a 5-speed (ma always liked to row her own!). The LX is sporty, handles well, and the shifting is snappy and clean. Not a powerhouse, but what do you want from a sub-15k car? It's quick enough, and I learned that while off-the-line acceleration is not mind-bending, at-speed and lane-change acceleration is pretty darn good. Brakes are great, as I learned in San Francisco on the busy, hilly streets. Also, I've had two people hit me in this car (their fault both times), and after repairs the car still runs great. Now at 55k with a cross-country road trip under its belt, the Kia is still running great. In fact I only this week had one of the few off-schedule maintenance issues, a PCSV valve that's giving me a check-engine. Only replacements  besides tires/oil have been two of the Coil-on-Plug units on the motor at about $50 each. I put them in myself, they're right on top of the motor and it's pretty easy. Even a shop couldn't charge you too much for the service. At 8 years, the only issues are some dry-rotted rear window seals from it's first 5 years in Arizona, and the chrome/plastic passenger door handle which is peeling. There's some increased body noise coming from the hatch area, and it's a bit squeaker overall than when new, but I think that for a budget car, it's been terrific. No electrical problems ever, which I hear is not the case with some newer Kias. Overall, I'm very very happy with this low-maintenance long-running car. Oh, fold-down rear seats in this hatchback provide ample room for stuffing things in the back. I've loaded this car to the roof many times, then driven her 12 hours straight. She runs great still!",4

The interior may be cheap compared to the Hondas and Toyotas of this world, but then that's reflected in the price.

Korean cars are rumored to be last-generation Japanese cars that are restyled by Italian designers.  This may or may not be true, but the Rio feels like some Hondas and Mazdas I've owned in the past, which is not a bad thing.  The neat styling is what grabbed me to begin with and the hatchback is handy (can't understand why all cars don't have one).  Inside, the fit and finish is good but the materials are pure econobox, which is how they keep the price so low (the dash is one huge piece of plastic; am thinking about buying seat covers to dress things up and hold wear down).    The entry-level trim level means you do not get cruise control, premium wheels, navi or other upgrades -- but no compass?  Come on!  You do get a trip computer however.  The car is quiet but the ride is average and handling is definitely not sporty.  Engine makes a neat noise when starting, transmission shifts well but the horn sounds like a goose with asthma (if I keep the car for next winter, I'm replacing it).  Mileage is good although extremely cold weather locally is keeping it down.  My two sons can't understand why their old man, who's had Porsches, BMWs, Alfas, Triumphs, MGs, etc., would settle for a Kia.  But then I remind them we've owned an Aspire and Festiva (both were Ford ""captive"" imports) as second cars over the years and they both went the distance.  Come spring I may replace it when I buy something the top goes down on, or may just put it in the garage for next winter.  The fact that it's under 8000 miles, has a year-and-a-half left on the factory warranty and cost me under 10 grand from a reputable lot means I shojld be able to drive it the next few months for almost nothing.Update -- still have the Rio a year and a half later. Only expenses have been oil changes and a set of wiper blades.  I find the gear box the most interesting component.  You can just leave it in drive, or switch it over the a manual mode which is a lot fun when in the mood.",4

Most of us drive from A to B for errands and transportation anyway and how can you beat a great running car with low insurance rates and a 10 year warranty to boot. The only negative thing I have to say is that Hyundai/Kia found a way to get another $150 profit by omitting a spare tire and jack so get your dealer to either include one or sell it to you at cost. They're going to try to convince you that the roadside assistance they give you makes up for it but I can tell you I have sat on the side of the road for hours waiting for these people to show and then many times they can't resolve the issue anyway.,4

5865, on 12/08/15 13:46 PM (PST),Dennis Howerton ,2002 Kia Rio Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.5L 4cyl 4A),The Ideal Town Car," I bought my Rio from its second owner.  The car had been wrecked by the first owner at around 12,000 miles and was subsequently rebuilt.  The second owner took good care of the Rio.  The interior was like new when I bought it at 52,000 miles and the car had been repainted '57 Corvette red.  The original wheels were warped and the tires were horribly out of round, causing the car to vibrate at around 45mph, so I bought a specialty set of wheels and new tires that set me back about $1000.  Despite most Rios' homely look, mine actually looks pretty sporty.  There are several things I like about the Rio.  It's a simple car.  I especially like the fact that the windows and door locks are manually operated.  The front seats, while not cushy, are comfortable and there is adequate room for two full size adults in the front seats.  The back seats are strictly for kids.  Ours are grown, so the rear seat is not a problem.  Whoever designed the interior of the Rio did a good job.  The controls and switches are well situated ergonomically.  There's even a right armrest that folds down for the driver that makes driving on longer trips more comfortable.  Steering is light and responsive. It's like driving a go cart.  Visibility is very good.  The 1500cc engine and automatic transmission are adequate for around town driving but are a little underpowered for trips in mountainous terrain.  You'll get up the slopes, but you won't pass many people.  Fuel economy with the automatic transmission is good but not spectacular.  I've averaged around 32mpg in highway driving and 22mpg around town.  I use only straight unleaded gas (no alcohol) in my car (Yes, it's still available if you look for it.).  The only maintenance the Rio has needed since I bought it was the replacement of a rear shock absorber and, of course, periodic oil/air/filter changes.  Since we use the Rio as our around town car, we don't put a lot of miles on it.  The absence of cruise control is the main reason we don't use it on long trips.  Currently, we have about 73,000 miles on our car.  It stills looks showroom new inside and out when it has been cleaned up.  We love our 2002 Rio.June 2017 - We still have our 2002 Kia Rio and use it as a town car and for short trips.  Still love it.  Thinking of giving it to my grandson who will get his learner permit to drive next month.  Hate to part with it, but...hey!...he's my grandson and that's what granddads do.  Small, economical, easy to drive...the Rio is an excellent car for new drivers.December 2017 - We're still driving our Rio daily.  I had thought about giving it to our grandson when he turns 16 in July but he's a growing boy.  At 6'01"", 300 pounds, he's a mite big for the Kia so we'll keep it as our old timer's transportation.  The boy is going to need a truck...a big truck.June 2018 - Yep.  Still have our 2002 Rio.  Still use it daily.",4

I love my little Kia Rio and have never had any major problems with it except routine work.  I have an hour commute to work, so I needed something with better gas mileage, and this certainly has it.  Having never driven a four cylinder before, I was worried that I wouldn't like the slower pick-up.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover how fast it could go to 70 or 75 on the freeway.  Also, for such a small car it is awfully roomy (This is coming from someone who is 5'10 keep in mind)",4.5

I would die without my beloved kia rio.  I watched other people at work by gigantic mc-cars and felt so bad in my little kia, but NOW with gas the way it is.  I can proudly say with gas at 3.25 a gallon I filled up with $26.  The only thing that has ever gone wrong with the kia is the alternator had to be replaced when it was 5 years old.  That's it folks. Little things here and there. Door bell rings by itself, interior light comes on by itself, back seat leaks (think it comes from the trunk somehow) but who cares I love my Kia and I will have her until she dies literally.",3.5

Where can you purchase a brand new car for $8,000 with a 10 year/100,000 miles warranty except Kia? I also purchased the 7 year/100,000 bumper-to-bumper warranty.  Haven't had a chance to use it because the car is like the Eveready Energizer bunny. It has the pep of the Pontiac Solstice or Saturn Sky. It's also fun to drive and a miser with gas. I fill up every two to three weeks at $25. Can't beat that with a stick. I must say the car is not put together with the best and strongest materials, but what do you expect for $8,000.

It seemed like a cute little car.  It was also nice that it had a ""warranty"". However, the first time it rained, the entire trunk filled with water.  When I checked about the seals, and how to have them replaced, they were not covered as a warranty piece. I tried to seal it several times, but they never seemed to stick in place. At 55mph, we had a loud whistle noise in a door that the dealer could not figure out.  It was a non-fixable air leak in the window seal. Then, my favorite, at 55,000 miles, it mushroomed a piston-head.  I could only prove 18 of 19 oil changes, so it was considered not under warranty. Kia, the enclosed go-cart!",1.875

But it also loses its value rather quickly.  Then I noticed things like... the back seats don't fold down and the battery is so underpowered and short-lived, listening to the radio for more than 10 minutes drains it!  It is also extremely intolerant to delayed oil changes.  Most other vehicles, the 3,000 mile limit is for high-stress vehicles like cop cars and taxis...but watch out for lifter noise if you go that long.

The fuel efficiency has been great, and it gets around the small confines of the city very well. Parallel parking is a breeze, and the manual transmission makes it fun to drive in spite of a bit of a lack of power. Actually, driving it at about 5-6000 RPM can generate decent power for the small engine, but I drive more easily for gas mileage close to 35 MPG.  I was very surprised by the amount of space. Front and back seat passengers will not be cramped, and the trunk is surprisingly roomy.  For the low price and dependability, along with the overall good design, it's a bargain.",4.5

Second I was concerned about the performance factor since it only has 96 horsepower. All my worries were put to sleep when I had the car for a day and the way it handled and the surprising snap it had for only 96 horsepower.

The reviewers talk about performance features and such.  The car is a slug.  Going up a long incline (even with overdrive turned off) is a loud and exhausting experience.  The gas mileage is no where near what Kia advertises.  I was told the absolute minimum gas mileage was 32 in the city.  Try 22 mpg.

I am 6'3"" and felt more room in the Rio then in the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic I tested earlier in the week. Plenty of leg space and high roof give this car a spacious feel to it.

There are a number of parts replaced in this Kia, first was the shocks, which was replaced at 80k miles. Two ignition coils were replaced on separate occasions. Batteries were replaced 3 times during the ownership. Tires were replaced twice. Timing belt was replaced recently at 129k miles. This car being 1.6L 4 cylinder powered, is decent enough for city driving and occasional highway driving. The trim we got has manual windows and no power locks which is an inconvenience as you had to reach out to unlock the doors. Good thing the car is small for me to reach the locks. I tried buying a power door lock kit from Amazon and attempted to install it by myself. I ended up breaking the door handle cable on the driver side. Another thing that annoys me for this particular car is the airconditioning, the A/C just turns on by itself, you can't turn it off, something is wrong with the switch. That and a dozen other problems that happened to the car, which is typical of a car of this age and price range. Don't expect it to perform as well as other bigger sedans in terms of speed, performance and comfort.

I only have 22K miles on it, so I guess only time will tell if it holds up.  It doesn't have the power my Mitsubishi Galant has, but my Galant only gets 23 mpg city driving.  My only other real beef is that I'm only getting 27.5 mpg with the Rio with combined city/highway driving.

Get about 32 miles to the gallon.  But only have 6 hundred miles on it, hope will get better with time.  Mine is the basic no electric windows or locks.  Found out I can do without them",5

I'm in the process of trying to upgrade it as far as performance and found a few things. But it's still a new car so there's not much out there for now. But it's still a great car through and through.,4.75

Sat in the car and said, ""not bad"". Went for a test ride and said, ""WOW""! Quite an impressive ride for a small economy class. Good looks, good price, superb handling and great gas mileage. With the solid warranty the car is virtually maintenance free for many years. Indeed I was surprisingly impressed!",4.125
5971, on 08/09/06 09:23 AM (PDT),Steve Chase ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Better than I thought.," This car is easy to drive and park. I like the pick up the engine has, rides smooth, the air conditioning is great, cools down fast - living in Florida thats a real plus. Also like how the floor mats stay in place. Has a lot bigger trunk than I thought it would.",5
5972, on 08/07/06 17:15 PM (PDT),Rob ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),The right balance," I think Kia did a great job on finding the right balance between looks, safety, fuel economy and price.  You usually have to trade gas economy for looks or price for safety.  I have to drive 100 miles a day and this car gets me there as cheap as possible through initial cost and gas mileage.  I have fun getting to work too.",4.25
5973, on 06/27/06 18:32 PM (PDT),xntexan ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Not a bad car," Pretty good car for the money. Auto transmission very sluggish, but the manual has decent performance. Comfortable ride but excessive road noise. Great fuel economy and spacious for small car. The interior panels are a bit cheap, scratch easily. Plenty of safety features. Overall I highly recommend for an economy car.",4.125

It's cute and fun to drive. The gas mileage is wonderful. It gets me where I need to go and saves money on gas. I would recommend this car to anyone looking for a fuel efficient car.,4.125

It has a peppy engine, good mileage (28 in town) very easy to drive and park.  And with all the standard airbags and the great 100,000 mile warranty, I am looking forward on having this car for many years. ",4.5

Very quiet at stand still. Car sits high up for a compact. Very roomy on the inside; has great handling around corners and turning radius. Kia has the competition beat; best in class model. Aggressive European styling.,4.375

I'm 6'5"" 235lbs and the Rio fit me the best out of all the subcompacts.  Adequate power and excellent mpg.  Front seats are very comfortable!  Stereo system is pretty decent for stock.  Fun to drive...easy to park...cruises nice and smooth on the highway.  Handling is surprisingly sporty.  Interior is styled and laid out well.",5

Price, warranty, and mileage were big factors to my purchase.  The car doesn't sound, look, drive, or leave you with any impressions of your typical ""econo- box"".  After driving beaters as my commuter car for 13 years, the Rio was my first new car purchase.  I actually look forward to the drive to and from work now.",5
5980, on 04/03/06 21:43 PM (PDT),Hauber ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 4A),Wow what a little surprise," I have always been a Civic owner, but their size and cost priced me out.  I needed a reliable and inexpensive little car to get me around town. In my inexpensive car search my expectations were low, but the Kia Rio took me by surprise.  It is a well built, cute sporty car that reminds me of the Civics I used to own.  It feels solid, it is comfortable and an easy ride.  It is simple but seems far more expensive then the money I spent on it.  Plus I feel like a bit of an environmentalist driving a little car that doesn't guzzle gas.  It is a smooth ride for the most part and can keeps up with the rest of the traffic. A VERY wonderful car for an AWESOME price and warranty.",5

5982, on 02/20/06 21:23 PM (PST),Eddie G. ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),This car gives you more for your money!," When I first test drove the Rio I enjoyed the smooth ride and the great acceleration it delivers. Then I realized I'm still only driving a 4 cylinder.... who knew! It can really get up and go. With all the safety feature's and all the extras that the 2006 carries you can't beat it for the price.! My wife and I are very pleased with the gas mileage and not to mention the warranty. It takes the guilt and conviction out of purchasing a new car; we don't look at it as a purchase but an investment. Besides this car we own an SUV and a 3500 Chevy truck so while those big vehicles sit and only get driven when we ""have to"", the Rio will no doubt have its turn to show us how great it is!",5
5983, on 12/21/05 22:36 PM (PST),hunternicholas ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 4A),2006 Rio LX Automatic," Kia did a great job with this all new car, buy with confidence.  I was amazed how the big name brands are building unsatisfactory cars, and cheating on the number of side air bags if they offer them at all.  Don't trust a salesman here, check the fine print to see if they include a torso and head curtain air bags.  You HAVE to HAVE both! The Kia Rio has both the torso and head curtain side air bags. Don't confuse these with frontal air bags. The build quality of my car is excellent.  The power is excellent.  I needn't press more than 1/8 on the pedal and the car moves right along just fine--that from an old gearhead. There are too many nice features to list.  The gas mileage is excellent!",4.875
5984, on 11/23/05 21:56 PM (PST),carlovermda ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 4A),What You'd Not Expect," When purchasing the car, I read that the newly redesigned Rio would utilize Hyundai technology, being a vast improvement over the old model which was based on the old Ford Aspire platform. Though a little loud at hard starts, the engine is very smooth and not hard to get off the line. The seats are VERY comfortable which is a feature that some upmarket models still have not fully embraced yet. Overall NOW this car is a formidable candidate for anyone looking for an affordable car of high value and good quality.",5
5985, on 11/14/05 19:00 PM (PST),kiario06 ,2006 Kia Rio Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (1.6L 4cyl 5M),06 Kia Rio LX," The new designed Kia Rio is awesome. Much roomier than the older models. My husband can actually stretch his legs all the way out - in the '04 he couldn't. Great on gas. Handling has improved along with shocks.  Comes standard with 6 airbags. If there is a person under 70 lbs sitting in the passenger seat, the passenger airbag actually turns off. aA light comes up by the radio indicating that it has been shut off. This feature is in case you have a child in the front seat, or a dog in my case, the airbag wont go off to cause more damage to them in case of an accident. If you don't wear seatbelts I wouldn't buy this car. Chime goes off every 15 seconds if you're not wearing one until you click it in.",4.875

How I proved them wrong.  My Kia Rio is very peppy, auto insurance cost-effective, makes it to the gas pump every two weeks on $15.00 a fill, has a 10yr/100,000 warranty and has a great big trunk to put all my shopping in!  And I can park in the compact car parking spaces! I have never had a mechanical/performance problem whatsoever in the three years I've owned, since purchased new.",5
