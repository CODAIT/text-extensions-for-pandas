You get looks and comments from little kids, middle aged wives, and grandfathers. Everybody looks the looks of this Italian sweet heart. But an unsolvable problem plagues this beauty. My 124 spider Abarth's alarm has gone off randomly while driving. I drove her for a few months and it went off numerous times driving under various conditionsShe has been at three dealers with no success yet. This makes her not drivable. FCA is currently investigating numerous similar complaints with no resolution. I hope they can fix her.",5

3, on 04/03/18 09:56 AM (PDT),Michael Lang ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),8 Months research and finally bought the ABARTH," I had concerns over buying a FIAT. Lets face it, lemons are common but some get real good 500 ABARTHS that work well. The fact that Mazda was building the 124 inspired me to look past this. The car itself is 100 times more beautiful that the Miata version. My sticking points were ABARTHs comming to US had FIAT badge on wheel. As of March 2018 that has changed. Abarths now have proper abarth badging on the interior for 2018 but you have to look around as there are many older versions on lots. Next sticking point was that Miata's got the Retractable Fastback and FIAT's did not. What is more Italian that the RF top. Looks like the 70's Targa tops. Fiat could have branded it a Targa and they would not have been able to keep them in stock. I know all my friends were hoping for this as well. UGH! So I bought the ARARTH in Black. Wow the color is so deep and rich in the sunlight. Pictures do not do this car justice. Must see in person. My ABARTH is a bit rough in 1st gear for a manual. Been driving manuals all my life. This one I stalled 4 times on way home from dealer. The car wants to go. Low RPMs the car lags a bit and begs you to let it breath. There are two essential tweaks that fix this. One the DV+ diverter valve allows more low end and solves some issues with the cheap plastic diverter valve that comes from the factory which is either open or closed.... No in between. This DV+ also helps prevent turbo flutter which is potentially damaging buy allowing flow the turbo air flow back though the valve as the turbo winds down between shifts. Much healthier.. Second as the high pressure through the lines can bring with it some oil, it is good to add an oil catch can on these cars to reduce the amount of oil that can get back to the throttle and multiair unit which can be damaging over time. These two changes do help the car become more bullet proof. The car shifts great and has power.. Much more than the miata which I drove several times in my search trying to decide whether to drop the Fiat and just get the targa I love and deal with the angular futurist look of the miata rather than classic Italian beauty. I got the loaded version. I suggest just getting it with all options. Bose system is awesome, Navigation is easy. While touch is disabled when the car is moving, it is easy to manage shifting and using the dial to change channels etc. so the Tech in the car is great. Was able to save all my Sirius Channel Favs on way home from dealer lot. ABARTH sounds great in either Sport of Normal. Noted the Sport mode dials up the performance a bit which did feel more responsive. Im about 5 foot 10 inches tall and hover around 200 pounds and I fit comfortably in the car. If someone is over 6 foot they may find it cramped. I love the gauges and Abarth logos on seats and steering. It gives the car uniqueness and people have no clue what the car is when they see it which Scorpion badges all over it. I was asked at a gas station if it was a Ferarri. Lol I wish. Car takes corners like a champ and those Brembo Brakes really work well. I know that squirrel thanks FAIT for its life. Convertible top is same as Miata and is sooo easy to put up or take down. Chrysler and many aftermarket sites are selling a lot of after market upgrades so this car is very good if you want to make it a track car. But.. I only bought the two items i spoke of earlier. Abarth already has limited slip diff, Front and rear anti sway bars, Front and rear strut tower braces, Brembo brakes, and a killer sounding exhaust etc.. so its more performance than most people need. Im getting around 30 MPG average which totally surprised me. In summary, this car is more than I could have hoped for. I would like to see an aftermarket company make a targa top for this car but outside of that. Its my childhood dream of owning that Triumph TR7 or Fiat X 1/9 Bertone Targa car that I could never find married to modern day conveniences. I want to slap myself for even considering buying that Miata. I would have never forgiven myself. :) I am living my childhood dream of owning and driving a EURO roadster even if it is a Miata in Drag.",5

This car is 180 degrees from that. With the exception of the cup holders and glove box which are awkwardly placed, there is nothing I would change. I feel such joy and satisfaction every time I am in this car.",5
7, on 11/09/17 17:58 PM (PST),Harry ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Lusso 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Fun drive/eye-catching ride not w/o minor glitches," This vehicle is a lot of fun to drive and great to look at inside and out!  The seats are comfortable but a tight fit with just enough leg room for an average size person.  If you are really tall or maybe a little rotund, you are out of luck if you want to drive this car!  After driving this little convertible sports roadster over 2,000 miles, I have had a lot of smiles on my face but also a couple of frowns.  My vehicle came equipped with high performance three season tires which do perform very well when the temperature is above 40 deg. F, but if you live where winter temperatures dip below 40, you have to switch out these tires for all-season or snow tires... an extra expense.  Otherwise, it must be garaged during very cold wintry days.  I replaced the factory equipped tires with high performance all-season tires and they have performed very well for me even in the cold winter months.   Also, the instrument panel's outdoor temperature display at any outside temperatures is pretty much a joke.  It's response is very, very slow and you have to maintain a minimum speed for an extended period of time for it to properly function.  Finally, sometimes the automatic transmission is slow to shift but you do have the option to manually shift but no shift paddles on the Lusso trim.",4
8, on 10/09/17 07:06 AM (PDT),Marvin Goodpickle ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Classica 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),"So far, so good!"," I haven't owned a ""roadster"" since I ditched my 2000 Miata back in 2011 because it was nickle and diming me to death. This 2017 Fiat Spider blew me away. I was seriously considering a Miata again, but after I read a pile of reviews and took several test drives, I was hooked on the Spider. (Plus the local Mazda dealer was jerking me around). Granted, Fiat skimped on the ""Mattel-made"" sun visors and the bland, colorless instrumentation (not even a red line on the tach), overall, it's very easy on the eyes, very well made, and with enough accoutrements or lack thereof to meet most-but not all-budgets. My main complaint is the noise at highway speeds. They indicate in their marketing that it's quieter than a Miata, but it's definitely more noisy than my 2000. The radio is pretty useless at highway speeds, unless you have a headset. At first, I was taken back by not having a spare, but I suppose the fix-the-flat stuff in the trunk will work OK. (Maybe I should read the directions before I need it...?). Oh yeah, and it's a blast to drive. For an aging grown-up, the fit is snug but comfortable, the steering and handling are great, and it has MORE than enough power to get me very quickly from point A to B in style without acquiring too many tickets-I hope!",5
9, on 09/16/17 12:48 PM (PDT),T P G ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Classica 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Great sporty car for life in the CA desert," The more appealing look of this car compared to the Miata sold me on it.  I'm over 6 feet tall, and can't put the seat all the way back and fully depress the clutch.  While not roomy, the cabin isn't as small as professional reviewers would lead you to believe, with a surprisingly comfortable ride given the short wheelbase.  It's a bit of a drop to get in, as the car sits low to the ground, but the seat side bolster doesn't hinder access.  Exiting the car is much easier if you're able to open the door fully, as it swings out very wide.  The instruments are easy to read and well lit at night.  When the top is up, there are two pronounced blind spots behind the driver.  If this concerns you, opt for the version with parking sensors, etc.  The radio is nothing terrific, but again, it's much better than I anticipated.  Choose the larger radio touchscreen if your eyesight needs assistance.  Premium gas is recommended, but not required.  So far, I am perfectly happy with my Rosso Classica with Technology Package.",5
10, on 08/19/17 02:45 AM (PDT),Keane ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Fun roadster with fiat reputation behind it," It spends a lot of time in the shop waiting for parts; like months waiting for simple parts (wish that was an exaggeration). The car looks amazing and the Abarth exhaust sounds fantastic. If you're looking for a daily driver that is fun to drive short distances, this is the car for you. It's also the car you need if you enjoy mini-vans and most every other car pulling away from you at their normal pace (unless you put the pedal down and rev the engine like crazy to catch up). It's not a fast car and all the commercials showing it blazing away are pretty much lies. With some modifications it can be pretty quick, but the stock version is asthmatic.  The main issue with this car is quality. After waiting over 2 months for one part, I filed for lemon status on it and was approved (easy in CA), so Fiat is buying it back and hopefully scrapping it to make some useful toasters. Love the idea of this car, but Fiat just can't make a quality car (a very large % of the owners are experiencing parts problems), even when this is mostly a miata. The stock is VERY limited, but don't let that get used to justify overpaying for this Frankenstein (Base abarth with Automatic for 30k out the door, including all taxes/tags/etc...). It's a unique take on the miata, but I'd stay away from the 2017 version of this car (maybe Fiat will get their act together in 2018). After 9 months, my car has less than 4000 miles, mainly due to having driven the complimentary rental cars for a good portion of the year.",2
11, on 06/19/17 23:00 PM (PDT),Bo ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Lusso 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),2017 Fiat Lusso 6auto," First off, this car is 75 to 80% Mazda Miata. However, the similarity ends there. The car has a longer nose and much better styling in my opinion.  The Fiat sounds and feels like a sports car.  The 6 speed auto is a Aisen product, which gives the car the ability to shift even faster than a 6 speed manual.  To be fair, the 6 speed auto is enough if you travel the daily freeway commute like me. While I have had the car for less than a week, my sportscar past is not nill.  My father owned a 1988 Mazda RX7 convertible. While the RX7 could take a corner without effort,  the Fiat still does the same but is a bit nose heavy. Why? The Fiat's engine is an iron block, placing more weight over the front wheels.  Yet,  the car takes the corners well.  I am still enjoying my commute, even though I had to give up a Prius Plug-in that gets 50-60 mpg and a free ride in the CA HOV lane.  Who cares, really when the Fiat is much more fun to drive and gets 31mpg on average.  It's your call, but why waste money on a more expensive BMW or Mercedes when you can get an excellent roadster out of the Fiat 124 Spider Lusso.  Have had the car now for six months with no issues.",5
12, on 06/13/17 19:32 PM (PDT),AnClar ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Tons of Fun At a Great Price," I've owned a couple of 2-seat roadsters...a 2004 Porsche Boxster, and my 2017 Fiat 124 Spider Abarth.  The Boxster, at close to $60,000 was one of the best pure driver's cars I've ever driven.  That said, for half the price of the Porsche, I get 95% of the driving fun with my Abarth Spider.  I've had the car for about 6 months now...it was one of the first Abarths delivered in my area.  So far, with almost 5,000 miles on it, it has been pure enjoyment.  Since neither my wife nor I are particularly large people we find the cockpit of the Abarth more than comfortable, even on long rides.  The fit and finish is beautiful...ours is pearl white with the black leather interior...it turns heads wherever we go.  I've had many people ask what the car was and have gotten nothing but compliments from everyone.  I'm really glad we got the Abarth...the upgrades are worth it, and make all the driving difference.  The Abarth's quad exhaust has a much nicer note than the Lusso or Classica.  Not that they are bad...just a bit quieter than I like.  The biggest difference is the Sport mode selector on the automatic transmission.  Since my wife opted for the auto, the paddle shifters on the Abarth are a good compromise.  Also in Sport mode, the shifts are much sharper, and responsive.  Overall, this car is a winner for us...great looking, fun to drive, and a great value for the money.  If you're in the market for a great 2-seat roadster, give this one a long look...odds are you won't be disappointed!",5
13, on 06/12/17 10:23 AM (PDT),Graeme Robinson ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Permanent grin since the day I brought it home," If your idea of performance is based on quarter mile times, this isn't the car for you. If, on the other hand, carving through canyon or mountain roads is your thing, there may not be anything else on sale at any price that can put as big a grin on your face as this Fiat. Its suspension is better sorted than the MX-5 (less roll, less bumping up against the bump stops) and it has all the power you can realistically use on public roads. It also looks - to my eyes anyway - a more mature / elegant design than the Mazda. This is my third Fiat and - despite the reputation - I've never had a problem with any of them.Only caveat is that if you're more than 6' tall or over 200lbs, definitely spend some extended time in one before committing to the purchase as it is a tight fit.",5
14, on 06/09/17 16:52 PM (PDT),Mark ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Bloody GORGEOUS!," I have been gagging for this car since Fiat/ Mazda bought it to my attention. It has taken me months to drill down and get the car I wanted. All I ever found on my search was automatics!!! ( I love driving and the thought of an automatic is just sacrilege in my opinion) Of course it had to be red, and I opted for the luxury package which is totally worth it especially the LED lights and their capacity to light the road ahead at night. Just outstanding. Its GORGEOUS from every angle. Driving it is a pleasure. Love the torque and relaxed nature of the engine. Would prefer the exhaust a little louder (I have the 500 Abarth and its a mean sounding, just beautiful chorus which is subdued in the 124) Was surprised Fiat didn't option it with the flat bottomed steering wheel that they have in the 500 which is a tactile pleasure, but none the less, it does feel good in the hands along with the shifter and short throws. Italian cars really do it for me, they connect me emotionally which is lacking in other cars. Mazda and Fiat have done a wonderful job and I hope it pays big dividends for them. Would like a boost gauge and cooled seats as the leather gets really hot during the summer.",5

Figured now or never :)," Makes going to the physical therapist - lower back - fun. Fortunately, it comes with a walker :). Love the car. A kick to drive. Got the 6 speed. Comfortable.

16, on 04/28/17 15:41 PM (PDT),Alan ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Wow Love driving this car!, I haven't had this much fun driving a car since I owned a 1982 Nissan 280 Z back in the 80's I love the handling and the way it corners I have the Abarth model and I just love the exhaust rumble the second you start it. The car is just amazing to look at and the convertible top is quick and easy to put it up or back down! I do wish there was little more storage in the interior I don't mind the smallish trunk its big enough for two weekend bags! I can't wait until I get back in it to drive again like right now instead of typing this review!  Update:  after driving it for 6 months all I can say is I love it more than ever I have had ZERO  problems not even a glitch I now store it for our harsh northern winter and really cant wait until next spring to be driving this awesome car again!,5
17, on 03/16/17 18:50 PM (PDT),Sunny FL.  Why does anyone live north of NC?? ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Fantastic Car!," 2017 Fiat Spider 124 Abarth, manual with brembo brake pkg.  It is such a joy to drive.  Handles fantastic, beautiful interior, beautiful looking car outside and inside. Love the hood and design of the car.  I owned a 95' 325I for about 9 years, (very good car), and a 2006 330I for about 2 years.  The 330I cost a lot of money in repairs.  I wanted to purchase a 2014 Cayman S but the price of admission for a nicely optioned used one is about $50,000.  I test drove the Fiat Spider and for $31,700 brand new it was a no brainer.  Plus the Spider comes with 4 year 50,000 warranty vs 3 year 36,000 for the Miata.  I still would like to get a Cayman someday (but would like to keep the Spider as a second car) but for now I couldn't be happier with my decision.  I look forward to driving the car everyday.  I'm 6' 1"" and fit comfortably but it would be nice to have about 1 more inch of room so I could get the seat back a bit further ( I also wish the Cayman seat went back about one inch further).  That's why I gave it a 4 star out of 5 for comfort. I test drove the Fiat and then went and test drove the Miata the same day.  The Mazda Club with brembo brakes you can get for about $30,000 and the Spider Abarth is about $31,700 plus tax.  You can't go wrong with either car.  I believe the Mazda handles a little better and is a bit faster.  But for my everyday driving the Spider is just perfect.  It just came down to personal taste.  The clincher being Japanese build quality with Italian styling.  I like the alcantara seat fabric and the Recaro seats.  Plus the quad tail pipes.  They sound great in 1st and second gear but I wish they were louder as you go through the gears.  I love both cars but just liked the looks a little better of the Spider.  If you want wheel locks so some clown doesn't steel your wheels you can get them from the Mazda parts dept. for about $59 or order them online from Good-Win-Racing.com part # 61-1057F for about $99.00.  After reading the comments about the goodwinracing wheel locks I opted for those.  Don't think you can go wrong either choice.  Happy motoring.  And do your self a huge favor, regardless of what your wife or parents or friends say, make sure you get the manual...  Shifting gears is half the fun of owning the car. One year ownership update.  I have put 13,300 miles on the car.  Zero maintenance issues.   Car has been fantastic and dependable.   Took in for scheduled maintenance one time for 72.00.  It's a great car.",5
18, on 12/10/16 13:35 PM (PST),Leo M ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Lusso 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),What a great ride!," I purchased this Car November 19, 2016. Its a base model Lusso with no real upgrades. I have had an extended highway trip and several day trips and I have fallen in love with this car. I owned an 85 Fiat Spider 2000 and I am partial to the Italian styling evident in the body design. Needless to say the performance over the 85 model cannot be compared. The 1.4l turbo accelerates on demand and shifts smoothly up and down. I am using the Asin auto transmission. The road handling and cornering are sharp and responsive. Even so, its a smooth highway drive even on long trips. Its not the fastest 0-60 but it is quick. In my opinion, the base sound system is adequate for all but the most serious audio enthusiasts. I stream Pandora thru my phone and the sound is terrific once adjusted for treble, bass and balance. So my major positives are style and road handling. The only major drawbacks are leg room and trunk space. I am 6'1"" and I can fold my knees into a comfortable driving position, but there is not enough room for my big feet. Strangely, I have more than enough head room with the top up. If you have big feet there is limited room for the clutch, hence my selection of the auto trans. Any over 6'2"" will have difficulty driving this car and they will not fit in the passenger seat due to the trim located where the glove box should be. There is very limited storage space inside the passenger compartment. The trunk has enough room for two small duffel bags and a computer bag. That's fine for my use as a weekender car. Price point for base Lusso is very attractive. In my opinion, a lot of the extras in tech package are not necessary or worth the addt expense. Lastly, when people see it they will think its a Miata or they ask what it is. Personally, I do not think it looks that much like a Miata but there are not many on the road yet, so its understandable for mistake. its a great car for those looking for a fun weekender.",5
19, on 11/30/16 22:07 PM (PST),Stelvio ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),This much fun has got to be illegal," When looking for two seater, drop top roadsters, that capture the fun of driving a curvy, technical back road for a low price, you have a choice of a Miata (Mazda MX-5) or a ?. And Mazda does it well with a light weight, quick, well made and reliable car. But it's styling, for me, was like the rest of the car, superbly functional.  All it needed, was some passion to make it perfect and a little tuning by a culture with a rich road racing history.  Along comes Fiat, to bring it both.  The beautiful throw back looks of the 124 Sport Abarth, added to the MX-5 would have made a great car inspiring, and the looks distinctive, but it would still not be a Italian sports car but rather a better looking Mazda.  But Fiat ripped the heart out of the Miata by replacing its engine with the soul of an Italian. Now it has it own looks and the totally different driving experience that a turbo charged motor brings to a car.  But what about that tuning?  That is where the Abarth model's unique features come in .  The Bilstein shocks added to the front and rear, revised roll stabilizers, limited slip differential, 17 inch wheels with 205 low profile tires, the revised more throaty exhaust that adds four horsepower, - combine to allow the engine, suspension, and even the steering to be dialed in with the sport mode button to transform the 124 from a gentleman's sporting vehicle into a superbly controlled, feisty, canyon carver expert that blows the top off the fun driving chart. This car feels like it is nailed to the pavement no matter the road surface or the severity of the curves.  Add the Brembo brake option as I did, and you can bring down your boiling cup of espresso to a standstill in a heart beat. Put it all together, as Fiat has, and this is the most fun you can have for a $25 tank of gas that will take you 350 fun (did I mention it was fun?) filled miles..  I have only known her for 1000 miles so far, but I can tell you already that if it were possible to marry this car, I would.",5

22, on 10/10/16 11:25 AM (PDT),Wilson P ,2017 FIAT 124 Spider Convertible Lusso 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Fun Is All There," My previous sports cars include a Porsche Boxster, a BMW M235, an RX-8, and three editions of the Mazda Miata from 2006, 2010 and 2013. I mention that history because the 124 Spider from Fiat is the least expensive ( i paid right at $28K) and in my opinion, the best looking of them all. You might know that Fiat and Mazda joined forces to build this car and the Fiat style and Mazda reliability are a winning combination for me.  None of the Mazda Miata cars required more than oil changes and standard maintenance. Nothing ever went wrong with those cars. I hope the Fiat does that well. If you are a six footer the car might not be as comfortable and the attractive  interior is close at hand. The car is very drivable and steers, brakes and handles well. When most cars slow for turns, i speed up (a little) and the Spider really shows its moxie in corners. Gas prices may not stay this low but i can fill up with premium fuel for about $25. I think people who live in warmer climates or want a fun weekend ride will love this car. The more you like to drive, the more it will appeal to you. Its about as much fun as you can have for not a lot of cash.",5

Then I realized that I'd be paying $55K in advance for a car that wouldn't be in my home driveway for 6 months or more. Just to be sure I was making the right choice, i googled ""2017 convertibles"" and suddenly saw a pic of a car I'd never seen before.  Having done a test drive in a Mercedes, I was impressed with the quiet ride at 70mph on a freeway with top down. I was able to converse with the salesman at normal volume. One thing that totally UN-impressed me was that to start the newest Mercedes you MUST put a key in the ignition!  Within 48 hours of my Mercedes test drive, I was cruising in a 2017 Fiat 124 Spider which seemed just as quiet on the highway and has push-button start. When I started comparing the overall specs of both cars, the new body styling of the 124 Spider and at HALF the price of the Mercedes, it became a VERY easy decision. As the former owner of 2 Porsche, Lotus Esprit, 3 Mercedes SL convertibles and a Rolls, after a month driving my new 2017 Spider I am VERY happy with my choice!3 MONTHS LATER ... I now have just over 1,000 miles on my FERRARI 124. FIAT owns Ferrari which gave me an idea. I removed or covered ALL the FIAT emblems and now drive the ONE and ONLY car that passes for a Ferrari (yes people believe the emblems they see) but costs about 1/8 the price! I even got a Nevada vanity license plate that says NICECAR so if I pass you in a flash and you see the tag, good luck catching me! BOTTOM LINE: Not since my Porsche racing days have I had so much fun behind the wheel of ANY car, regardless of the price !!!",5

We've taken it on several road trips, some as long as six hours of driving and 400 miles in a day. For a roadster, the ride is excellent. We never feel tired, uncomfortable, or anxious for the ride to be over. It's awesome being able to enjoy the journey as much or more than the destination. For me, the Spider is the perfect blend of comfort, performance, and driving pleasure. Finding a nice twisting road through the mountains is pure joy. The handling is superb and the power is more than adequate to handle any situation whether it's climbing a steep grade or passing a slower vehicle. It stays planted in the curves and corners. The Spider has performed flawlessly with no problems of any kind.  My original review is in the paragraph below.Realizing that a two seat roadster isn't for everyone, if you enjoy driving, or would like to enjoy it and have the luxury of being able to get by with just two seats, the FIAT 124 Spider is a great choice. Unless you just don't like driving, the FIAT Spider is sure to put a smile on your face and make you want to take the long way to wherever you're going. This car isn't a super-powered muscle car, but is light weight, nimble, peppy, and handles superbly. While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, for me, this car is gorgeous. Many sports cars are known for their harsh ride - not the FIAT. While providing great sporting performance, it also has a very comfortable and enjoyable ride with the top up or down. I'm 5'-8"" and the car fits me very well. I can imagine that someone over six-foot would feel a bit tight. I test drove both the automatic and the manual and concluded that, while both are really great, the manual provides an edge higher level of driver engagement and driving pleasure. But, upon the insistence of my wife, I purchased the auto. While I enjoyed the manual, I'm very pleased with the auto. It's great cruising on the open road where you're not shifting a lot anyway, and it's also less of a hassle in city traffic. I couldn't be more satisfied.",5

To me, it was more refined, inside and out. The ride felt more comfortable as well, and the steering was quick and true. When you gave it the gas and the turbo kicks in, it really gives you a thrill. I'm going on 3,000 miles, with my Classica, and it's still a joy to throw the top down and go for a spin (trouble-free). It's like a go-kart for grown-ups, with a rocket on the back!",5

The Miata delivers its power in a more linear fashion.  The Fiat needs to get up in the Revs before it really goes.  So, it feels slower off the line.  A little more like a Honda S2000.  So it is really down to which one appeals to you more.  I would rate the Fiat at a 4 and the Mazda at a 4.5 from an everyday driving standpoint.  However, I am considering this purchase for weekend pleasure drives and I find the Fiat is more exciting to me.  I like the bit of quirkiness that it has over the Miata.  To me this gives the Fiat a bit more excitement.  If you are deciding between the Mazda and the Fiat you really need to spend some drive time in both.  The interior is similar in most ways.  It's really about do you fit and are you comfortable enough to enjoy the car.  Also, I would mention that the edmunds review of the Fiat is a 3 and the Mazda a 4.5.  This seems to me to be because of different editors approach to the car and because the Fiat review, I believe, is for the automatic which I agree is not very good with this engine.  If you want an auto the Mazda is the better choice.  I took a brief drive of each car with the auto but for me the manual is the way to go.  I would recommend reading each edmunds review with the mindset that it applies to both cars outside of the engine.  I am disappointed that Edmunds editors seem to have written these reviews in a vacuum ignoring the relation of the cars to each other.",4

Great gas mileage!!! Great power!!! Fantastic Handling!!! I feel like I'm driving a sports car. I'm glad the computer has a setting to notify you regarding your speed.  I have mine set for 10 miles above the limit and it is always notifying me as you don't realize how fast you are going.  You can't feel it shifting except when you first start out as it is a little hesitant.  The interior rivals cars that are much costlier. The materials used and fit and finish are excellent.  My biggest gripe is Fiat needs to market this car through their Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler dealers and service them their as well or at worst case scenario require Alfa/Maserati dealers to service at least under warranty. I live in a fairly large metropolitan city and I have to drive 60 to 75 miles to the closet dealer for warranty work. I only wish I drove more but I work out of my house......",5
34, on 10/04/17 10:27 AM (PDT),Ron Lakes ,2017 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),"Well made, enjoyable to drive"," My wife and I really love our 500X. It's our second Fiat (we continue to own a 2014 500L). Needless to say, if we've bought a second one, then we must be pretty pleased with our first one (we are!). We purchased our 500X with all the bells and whistles (AWD, safety suite (lane departure warning, lane keep assist, auto emergency braking, back up camera and park assist), leather interior). Our 500X feels very solid over bumps, dips and road imperfections, no squeaks or rattles whatsoever. The 9 Speed transmission is often criticized, but for the most part we're fine with it. It tries to get up into the tallest gear as soon as it can when in normal (when mode selector is in default ""Auto"" mode). I wish it had a 4th mode where it still wanted to shift up to as high a gear as possible for fuel economy, but was more willing to downshift without having to really stop on the accelerator (as is the case in the ""Auto"" mode)- a mode somewhere between ""Auto"" and ""Sport"". The 3rd mode is ""Traction+"", which has you pulling away from a stop in 2nd rather than 1st, plus it engages AWD regardless of whether a wheel is slipping or not, as well as a less aggressive accelerator pedal programming. So far no problems, though our 500L has become my commuter car so the 500X doesn't get driven so much. The suspension provides for a very good ride on the whole, though I'd say I slightly prefer the ride of our 500L a bit (it's wheel base is nearly 2 inches longer, and the lower ground clearance makes for a little bit less bouncy-ness due to less suspension travel).  The fuel economy could be better- I hope FCA is working on a direct injection version of the 2.4 liter 4 cylinder, or perhaps a new engine entirely. Personally I think the 1.4 liter turbo is the superior engine, but to opt for that in the 500X requires that you accept shifting your own gears via 6 speed manual transmission. I will say the 2.4 liter does well enough in suburban driving, especially if you're lucky on the signal lights, as I've seen better than 35 mpg on occasion. I notice that sales figures have the Jeep Renegade outselling the 500X by about 10:1, but I much prefer the X over the Jeep- how it looks and how it drives, even though they are on essentially the same platform. Finally, the 2018's will have Apple Car Play and Android Auto with FCA's latest Uconnect entertainment suite.",5

It has that either love it or hate it styling ..which I love...the driving experience with the manual 6 speed and turbo 1.4 gives that sense of control and feel for the road that seems missing in most of the made for the masses CUV's out there...its refreshing to be engaged with the driving experience instead being a slave to the computer controlled automatic transmissions that make a mad dash for the highest ratio gearing no matter what speed you are driving. I guess I am one of the 4% ers that still like to row their own gears in this style of vehicle.                   The great part of this vehicle is that it has a 4 year/50K bumper to bumper warranty for a car that is priced with incentives at $15K .  Add to that fact, that the car is well executed in its fit and finish with better quality materials than what would be found on higher grade trim levels from other manufacturers you can drive away from the dealership confident that you are not feeling car poor and still are driving a car that might arouse some envy from onlookers. ......time will tell if the thrill of commanding a fun to drive stylish CUV will fade, but I suspect given the choice of driving my RAV4 limited or the 500X in my driveway I will grab the keys to the FIAT....she is just so much more fun!I have had the car a year now.... still love driving it. The 4cyl Turbo with the 6 speed is in my opinion the better of the two drivetrains. Unfortunately a buyer cannot option the AWD system with this drivetrain arrangement. FIAT only offers a 4wd with their Jeep Renegade that uses the same platform as the 500x with the turbo and manual setup. I knew that when I bought the car and looked at the Jeep... but the suspension tuning and styling pushed me to the 500x ... I have an AWD vehicle so it wasn’t a big deal to forego the option in the FIAT... so far very pleased... lots of compliments on the car from onlookers at gas stations and parking lots...",5

I have some physical disabilities and the Abarth was while very fun to drive also hard for me to drive and was starting to find that people just do not see you in that small of a vehicle. Looking for comfort, and size over the Abarth and the high quality of a precision Italian SUV boy did I find it! The new interior of the 500x Trekking is amazing and the technology in the features blew me away! It may take me a month to learn how to use everything this SUV has to offer. Styling is great and the optional 18"" wheel package and AWD I got adds even more tremendous styling. Acceleration is so so but then again I'm coming from the Abarth. Fuel economy is also not real fantastic but still pretty reasonable. Overall I have zero complaints on this SUV. The one serious recommendation I have though is, get either the Trekking AWD or Lounge AWD model. I test drove the Pop and Easy FWD models and they do not even compare.

44, on 12/23/17 14:05 PM (PST),DST ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Lounge 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),1 year update," I've owned this SUV for 13 months and   I've put 13,500 miles on it and I couldn't be any happier with the little SUV. I'll start off with low points. Fuel economy is just ok, I've averaged 25.4 overall but short trips and very long trips seem to get below EPA min. and the hot Phoenix summers really zap mpgs. More normal conditions yield substantially better mpgs. The back seats are comfortable but really tight and if you have adults back there, the front seats need to be moved up so passengers can fit. The trunk space is small and only holds a few bags and really limits what you can pack. I think the tight space is typical for the class. I've read reviews that say the transmission shifts awkward but I really haven't noticed any issues. The only thing is that there are too many gears and it downshifts really slow. The transmission always wants to be in the highest gear and it makes acceleration slow at times. You have to stay firm on the throttle to get the most out of the engine/transmission. The transmission is noticeable quicker to downshift and stays in a lower gear when it's in sport mode but it drives awkward in parking lots or if you are not driving it aggressively. The car feels like it wants to race in sport mode, the steering wheel tightens up, the engine/exhaust get loud and the shift points are rough--it feels like my friend's Maserati but I don't think most people would want to drive that way daily. It's just fun on an open road.  The rest of the car is all positive. The handling is the best feature and the car feels really fun to drive and connected to the road and driver. The steering is accurate and direct and the brakes are strong. The front seats are super comfortable and there is plenty of room upfront. There is plenty of front seat storage for long road trips. The build quality and materials are first class. The car is really loaded with lots of cool and usable features. The UConnect is awesome but the navigation is kind of old school Garmin and takes too long to program an address but it works well when in use. The car is relatively quiet and it's easy to hear others and talk over the blue tooth. Phoenix has really smooth roads so it's hard to say how the ride feels in rough road locations but it can get a little bouncy on certain roads. I've had no issues with reliability and no repairs as of yet. It's hard to find a car today that has personality and doesn't feel like like every other car on the road but this car has really feel to it. I'm really happy with my 500X and glad I bought it!",5

There have been 5 problems, including a broken tailgate latch, a broken door handle, a broken speaker, a malfunctioning forward collision mitigation system (which took 5 times to fix!) and now an engine warning light with a message saying ""drive selection mode not available.""  Despite paying an extra $3,000 for an upgraded warranty that includes a loaner car, I have to argue with the dealer every time to actually get that loaner car.  In total I have been without this car for weeks on end and an really tired of taking it in for service and with dealing with uncaring and incompetent service personnel.  For the current problem I have now been without my car for two weeks, and when I called FCA headquarters I was told that the dealership hasn't even looked at it yet...how is that acceptable?  And FCA customer care...they have been of little help.  They denied a lemon law claim and that department refused to even call and tell me.  They had the woman who I spoke to at customer care make the call and she left me a message that sounded like she was being held hostage...she was so apologetic and actually said ""they are making me call you and I'm really sorry they won't respond to you"" -- how often do you end up feeling bad for the customer service staff?

It looks cool and has a lot of nice features, but quality-wise, it is very poor.  Road noise is excessive, I am on my 3rd sunroof so far in the first year due to it being loose and rocking and rattling in the roof.  I am on my 2nd air conditioner unit due to it smelling like mold.  I think water somehow gets into the system and molds in there, so when it is turned on, it smells like mold/mildew.  It is a fun car to drive, but the seats are pretty hard, so it is terrible for long road trips.  My old van was so much more comfortable.  I tried to get the lemon law on this car but Chrysler basically denied any problems.  I have had this car in the dealer at least 2 1/2 months of the time I've had it.  Too bad I bought it rather than leased it.  Now I am stuck with this lemon.  I would stay far far away from this car and Chrysler in general-they are the worst!",2

I was actually in the dealership to look at the Jeep Renegade, but the specific one I had come in to see had sold.  I noticed the FIAT and asked if I could test drive it. It was love at first sit. I have a bad neck and back, and it is hard for me to comfortable in a vehicle. The 500x is hands down the most comfortable seat I have encountered. The sporty look, quality of the trim and awesome sound system are just icing on the cake for me.  I will agree that the transmission is a bit 'confused' at times. However, I have learned to drive it so it shifts quite smoothly. It just takes some getting used to.  It rides incredibly smoothly on the freeway. Not the quietest car I have ever driven, but also not the loudest. The road noise is perceivable but not distracting. Overall the FIAT 500x Lounge offers a smooth, solid and sturdy ride with great visibility and plentiful features. I love my FIAT!",4

It started in November I had a situation where I was making a left turn in traffic and the car said low oil pressure and cut off, it was a stoplight downtown Wilmington I had my nieces with me and car took a few minutes to crank.  We then had received a recall notification on the car so we figured it was related to that we took fiat to dealership to be serviced.  Had the car and it since has been doing it again and putting me in danger as well as my 2 year old baby.  The tires blew out after 4 months of having the fiat, there is no spare with the car so it had to be towed.  Next we had oil changed and was told we have a leak, he said oil levels shouldn't be so low after a recent oil change.  The parking light has also went out, Took car back to dealership to look at oil they kept car and said levels were low but couldn't determine why, drive car for 1000 miles and bring back for another test, meanwhile this morning as I'm heading out in the rain holding my baby the car door wouldn't open with the keyless remote and the car wouldn't unlock, I then pulled out the key to use and unlocked the car the alarm goes of and the car wouldn't crank and the back doors wouldn't open.  I then had To run back in house with my baby and grab my spare keys and they started the car.   As well as gas I was told this car would be great for my long commute and it isn't it's getting like 24 mpg.  I've had nothing but trouble with this car and I'm highly disappointed I was so excited to buy the 500x and now I'm regretful.   I hope fiat resolves this problem with integrity.",1

I was getting pain in my hip and back because my old car was not ergonomic and I had started a new job that gave me a longer commute. I'm  a very practical person so I've stuck with Hondas and Toyotas most of my life. I decided to look for a new car, and my top concern was a comfortable, power adjustable seat. I test drove Honda, Toyota, VW, and Chevy.  Just for yucks I thought I'd stop by the Fiat dealer, which I passed every day on my way home.   The 500 was adorable but uncomfortable for me. The salesman suggested I look at the 500x and when I test drove it, it was the most comfortable seat I ever tried.  I had such a bias in my mind against Fiat that I didn't bother to discuss numbers, and went my merry way to try more Hondas, Toyotas, etc.  I couldn't get it out of my mind how comfortable the Fiat was, and I loved the look so I went back for a 2nd test drive. Sure enough, still the most comfy seat I had tried.  Turned out to be right in my price range. I've had it 2 months and still love it. Back pain is much better.  Everybody comments on my car and says they love it. A couple of drawbacks, though. When weather and engine are cold, acceleration is very sluggish.  Solution is to use remote start while walking to car, and let it run a couple of minutes before driving, but that does cut into mpg. Also, auto transmission upshifts at 2000 RPM instead of 2500, and hovers around 1500.  Sometimes it feels like engine is lugging, though it has never stalled.  I can live with those issues, all things considered. I think Fiat markets to young people but they should think about marketing to seniors, as this car is extremely easy to get in and out of, is not too low or high.  So many of the Hondas, Toyotas, etc. are downright UGLY this year with huge black grills and weird angles that make them look like a monster.  It's nice to have a car that's stylish and meets my practical needs at the same time.  I thought I hated driving because of my back pain. Now I love to drive.  Freeway mpg as high as 36 with no traffic.",5
51, on 12/04/16 01:27 AM (PST),PS ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Pop 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Better than i thought," After owning the 500X over a year I figured a review might help some people interested in the car. It's actually much better than most people give credit for. Fiat does indeed have some issues but most are for the 500 or 500L. The 500X is the only Fiat available in the US that's actually made in Italy, and shares the platform with the Jeep Renegade. I have the base model ""POP"" and actually very happy I got that one, the 6 speed manual gives a sporty feel and the little turbo 1.4L (same as in 500 Abarth) loves to rev, it sounds pretty cool too. The interior is much better even in the low end trim, the fabric is comfortable and it doesn't feel all cheap plastic inside like Honda,Hyundai etc. Make sure you Scothguard the fabric seats though they stain just from rain (but clean up well). I have had no problems yet at 10K miles, time will tell but all cars have problems at some point. If you're in the market for a small crossover it's worth a test drive and for the money the POP really has everything most people need in a daily driver (just get some nice aftermarket speakers/sub for the audio system)Update 12/12/17:Happy to report no issues at 22K miles. Still feels a solid buy and no rattles,squeaks or leaks.Fiat gets bashed a lot & maybe for good reason, but I’ve owned Toyota’s ,Honda’s, Fords and Mazda’s but never felt a connection to them like I do to my lil bambina! Those cars are good yes & so are many others, but they have no personality, no soul.You either want coffee or espresso.",4
52, on 12/03/16 15:59 PM (PST),John ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),"Mostly good, but some serious issues."," There are many things I love about this car, but I want to focus on the reasons why I am slightly regretting my purchase. The first is the terrible road noise at freeway speed, it's not bad if you have the radio on. But if you are talking to a passenger it can be a bit annoying, and taking a call on the Bluetooth system, don't even bother while going down the freeway because the person on the other line will just tell you that there is too much background noise to hear well. As for safety, I was really happy at the ratings it received. Unfortunately because of the pillar side airbags being so chunky, it leaves way too much blind area not just while making turns but can leave a pedestrian invisible at the pillar as you approach. To correct this I have to constantly move my head left and right to see around the pillar. I've never experienced so many close calls in any other car. And if you do have to break hard, get ready to veer left or right (that's part of the surprise, you don't get to know which direction it will take you). Even if you hold the steering wheel perfectly straight while moderately or heavily breaking you will veer sharply and there is nothing you can do to prevent it. Then we have the transmittion, it does not matter if it is in auto or semi-auto, it lags something terrible. Sometimes when you slow down and then begin to accelerate, it can take up to three seconds to react and downshift for any power at all. 4th and 5th gear changes are always clunky and late, leaving you to lurch about. If you are in auto and briefly (as in less than a seconds worth) press hard on the gas, it will down shift into second regardless of speed and take nearly half a minute to get back to the proper gear. This leaves you looking like a proper knob who is trying to race other drivers while you are at maximum revs. The final issue I have is that a warning light came on for the fab to be serviced (owning the car for only seven months). The dealership said that it needs an update and they would contact me in another month if it is available by then. In the meantime I get a pinging warning when I open the car door, start the car (which leaves a warning in place of the speed for 30 seconds annoyingly), when I turn off the car and again when I open my door to get out. And I have to deal with this obnoxious feature for at lease a month while they work on an update. I can't fanthom why in the world this is an issue in the first place.",4
53, on 11/28/16 07:14 AM (PST),jlm6469 ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Easy 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Great Car For The Price!!!," I was looking for a car after a deer totaled my beloved Prius.  Because we're moving to the country and it's West Virginia, an AWD was high on the list of must haves.  Went to the dealership intending to look at Imprezas.  When we got to the lot, we saw the 2 Imprezas on my list, and then noticed this little darling tucked in the corner with AWD on the windshield.  At first we both chuckled, then walked up for a closer look.  It was pretty much love at first sight!  The car is charming, both exterior and interior.  Got the keys, got in, and said, ""Wow, these seats are comfortable!""  Took it for a spin both in town and on the highway, and was pleasantly surprised at how nimble it is to drive, comfort was great, and speed -- let's just say this car has pickup!!  It was so smooth on the highway, my husband said, ""honey, you're going to have to watch your speed in this.""  Went back to the dealership to check out the Imprezas (since that's what we went for), sat in one and immediately got out.  Didn't even take it out of the parking spot.  Walked back in, asked for the Fiat 500x Easy keys back, and drove it home that day.  The drive home was 2 hours, and I loved every minute of it.  My husband drove it all the next while we ran errands and said if he was in the market for a car, he'd look for one for himself.  No, it doesn't get the same gas milage as the Prius, but Prius doesn't make an AWD, and that was more important to me this time.  Bought it used, 2016, 10,000 miles on it, not one scratch or stain -- perfect contdition.  I love love love this car!!!!  Give it a try, you won't regret it!!!!",5

So far with a couple highway trips and a lot of downtown driving we are very hoppy with the car. The only complaint I can come up with is the way the trim levels are structured, but between the nice interior that is way more subtle and stylish than it's Jeep counterpart, the ease of driving, and the driving position in the vehicle we are very satisfied.",5
55, on 10/26/16 05:20 AM (PDT),John ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking Plus 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),I traded my Miata for this!," After owning my 500x Trekking Plus for over a year now I can say I love it even more.  Its served us well , we’ve gone on several road trips and even started a new biz with her. ( Online Antiques and a booth in Vero Beach )  Fiat is a great value.. and gets a bad rap, its connection to Mopar doesnt help. In a year of owning the car the only thing to fail was a Chrysler sourced MOPAR  design fan assembly that Fiat ( FCA ) took care of immediately.  Mopar fans have a long history of failures in many Dodge- Chrysler vehicles. But FCA is great. They told me it was imperative I get the car back into the dealer and  they had the car for three weeks  ( parts delay ) but they rented another car for me and I paid nothing .  My dealers customer service was above par.  So see my experience with my Fiat is that it’s been 100% reliable except for the American part that failed.   But she is back running better than ever and I have no complaints .  My original review contnues now.. Due to an unknown injury I came down with severe sciatica in my left leg and hip. My doctor said it was probably  exaserbated by twisting in and out of my low to the ground 2013 Mazda MX5. So I was on the hunt for something that was easy to get into. By far, and I have owned 25 cars now in my lifetime as a 55-year-old man, the  Fiat 500 X is the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  Plus after even after having Mercedes and BMWs I find it's electronics , infotainment system and build quality, superior. Fiat is right up there with Mazda in their top-of-the-line cars giving consumers the most bang for the buck you can possibly get for under 30,000. Even  a stripper Fiat comes with creature comfort's that you don't see another cars like  fully automatic headlamps.  Such a minor thing but a nicety none the less . My Fiat 500 X Trekking Plus is top-of-the-line and is only missing one option , the all-wheel-drive feature and the only reason I don't have it is because it's next to impossible to get in Florida for some reason.  None of the dealers are ordering it. But never mind, my car comforts me with the heated seats ,the leather,  cornering lamps  (by the way the cornering lambs are amazing, like personal luxury  cars of yesteryear) the dual pane panoramic sunroof, Beats stereo , navigation, back up cam, crash sonar, ...omg the list goes on...it's gonna probably take me two weeks to figure out how to operate every single feature this car has. And with all the geegaws comes a glass smooth ride with none of that herky-jerky transmission stuff that other people talk about, and the solid feel that you get when you shut a BMW door..that wonderful muffled thunk.   Plus, my dealer extends the warranty to 10 years 100'000 miles !  I think that Fiat is undervalued and this car is a game changer for the Fiat brand in America.I want to address some of the bad reviews this car gets.  In reading them, I find the people who write negative comments about the cars transmission, hesitation, etc are probably bad drivers, or have expectations that could not be met by a crossover.   In owning my car and having driven several others in its class , the Fiat 500x offers the best value.  For instance , the 500x Trekking Plus has a power seat, the Mazda CX3 doesn't. It's not available. The CX3 gets praise from auto journalists, but it's based on the old Mazda 2 which was a dog and sold poorly.  So much for objectivity, the Mazda 2 has been dropped. .  Also ,to write a review based on simply driving a rental, should not be alllowed!  Rental cars get beat to Hades and back.  The 500x takes getting used to. I had to learn how the electric parking brake works, it's not the most intuitive thing. But the 500x truly  is a fun, well built rig.",5
56, on 10/20/16 01:33 AM (PDT),Raymond ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Feel very happy about this purchase!," The 500x wasn't my first choice. After carefully reading all the reviews about all the cars, I was torn between the Subaru Crosstrek and the 500x. It wasn't until I went for a test drive that pushed me over the edge. Sitting inside the 500x felt solid, comfortable, designed, and well thought out. Sitting inside the Crosstrek felt cheap and unrefined. This is with regards to the interior design. The drivability of the Subaru Crosstrek admittedly felt better. The gear system on the Subaru was smoother and lighter. Suspension felt supple. The 500x I test drove was a bit stiff, steering felt tight, but didn't hear the exaggerated loud cabin everyone complained about. I also didn't sense the jerky transmission. Perhaps it had been reprogrammed already. I purchased the car in Sep. 2016 and those issues have been addressed. My previous cars have been a 1998 VW Jetta, 2003 Audi A4, 2006 Honda Element, and most recently the 2013 Fiat 500e. I chose the 500x due to the extra incentive for being a return Fiat customer. Plus, the rebate, plus the dealer discount for end-of-year sale. The savings added up and it became a no-brainer to go with the 500x. The reviews had been so bad, that I really felt I made a compromise for the money saved. But so far, things have been great and all the claims had been unfounded. I find the handling of the 500x to be amazing. After I drop the kids off at school I take a longer drive through the hills of Los Gatos because the car is so fun to drive. I have also driven up steep hills and pushed the limits around corners and have yet to feel out of control. The acceleration is average, not as responsive as the electric 500e or the Audi 1.8T. I suppose that's comparing apples to oranges. I sat in the back of both Crosstrek and 500x and the differences were unnoticeable. They were both pretty snug with just enough leg room for somebody 5'8"". I do think that the 500x has a smaller trunk than the Crosstrek. Long story short, I don't feel I compromised just to get the better price. Side by side, if the prices were the same for the Crosstrek and the 500x, I'd still choose the 500x. It just has more personality and much nicer to look at. We'll have to see what the long term reliability holds up. But I'm comforted with a 48k/ 5 year bumper to bumper warranty.",4

I have owned 3 cabrio 500's including the Abarth!  In my opinion, you don't purchase a FIAT because it's more dependable than a Honda or because it has a better resale value than a Toyota.  FIAT ownership is about discernment for a stylish automobile.  It's about passion.  Driving with pride of ownership -- as opposed to those who buy a car to get them ""from point 'A' to point 'B'"".  The FIAT 500x is a vehicle that you WANT to drive.  I wait anxiously for the end of my work day so I can get to the reward... driving my Italian automobile.",5

Also the AWD seems to handle the rain better than our FWD Corolla. Notice some reviews complain on the shifting, my experience switch to ""sport"" when you know you need more responsive shifting. Works for us. Not really comfortable front seats but for a compact SUV I can live with it. Only real complaint is the factory navigation and trying to find an update for it online. Google maps very up to date but would like NAV to be updated so I can leave phone alone totally and use factory hands free. Look forward to this fall/winter to see how the AWD holds up.",4

It's pretty roomy in the front. The back is so-so. Great for kids or smaller people. I bought the 2.4 AWD. It hugs the road nicely. The auto shifting is a bit rough. It takes some time getting used to. The stereo rocks, and there are USB ports. It was very easy to sync the phone. The middle screen on the dash has a lot of computer ""stuff"" that you can program. IE-Alerts you when you are going a certain speed that you have set, outside temp, miles to empty etc. Plus you can have it show digitally MPH (The speedometer to the left of that screen actually is the ""old school"" 20, 30, 40 etc with the lines for each 5MPH increment. All in all I give it a 4. I would give it a 5, but it's a bit slow pulling into traffic. It doesn't ""lag"", however. It slowly but steadily increases in speed.

My reliability rating is of course based on my rental period - the car almost had 20000 miles in it and was as good as new except for few scratches both inside and out (unlike a regular Fiat 500 I rented some time back which had a broken seat folding liver and couple of loose parts at around 45000 miles).",5

First I was bummed because it wasn't going to be out for a few more months. Finally it came out.... Yay!! I took it out for a few test drives, waited for some people to buy it and put out reviews, which took forever and still there's hardly any out there. I was scared  because not too many reviews and the ones that were out there were not that good. I've always owned Honda's, so I was hesitating, test driving other vehicles. I tried the Honda HRV, seemed very cheap to me. So I kept searching the inventory for my little fiat, I wanted a white lounge model with black leather seats and a sunroof, they had them within 50 miles of me, but by the time I got more serious about finally going and getting it of course they didn't have any within 200 miles of me that had the sunroof... So mine doesn't have the sunroof, but that's ok, I was kind of worried about the mesh that's up there any ways, because the sunlight comes in the car a little too much, the lady I spoke to at one the dealer's said you could tint the sunroof, but I also thought that the mesh will eventually deteriorate......Anyhow I got a fantastic deal on mine.... And I Love, Love, Love it!! I think I will name it Marshmallow, My 20 year old daughter's idea. I've had my baby since February and I haven't had any real issues with it. The one thing is when you lock the doors with the button outside, sometimes you have to press it a few times. The transmission is a little tetchy and not real quick off the line, that's ok I guess, Fewer tickets... I was worried it wouldn't get up hills very good, but it does just fine.  The seats are super comfortable. And like another reviewer mentioned is the cool gas cap, there isn't one, yay! You just open the door and boom, you stick the nozzle in and you can't just stick any thing in there either, so you don't have to worry people will still your gas..... I was on the fence about this car (even though I really wanted it) I was worried because it's a Fiat and not a Honda, but now everyday I go outside and see my little baby, I'm so glad I got it.",5
66, on 07/21/16 08:57 AM (PDT),GregC ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Fun and Luxury in the Same Package," I have owned my FIAT 500X for almost 7000 miles, and I could not be happier with my decision.  I had narrowed my choices down to the Honda CRV, Kia Sportage, and the 500X.  Each vehicle had a nice ride and good acceleration, and also had its particular strong points.  For instance, the CRV-EX had several cool features (sunroof, lane watch, etc.) and got the best gas mileage.  The Sportage had a nice interior and the largest back seats and cargo area.  The FIAT was the most comfortable and looked great inside and out; I would compare the interior to a luxury SUV, but for half the price.  I briefly looked at the Mini Countryman S, but I did not want to pay for a turbo charger (just one more expensive item to break) to get an adequate amount of power.  I read many reviews (Edmunds and elsewhere) that gave the FIAT negative marks for their transmission and their acceleration.  I will say that I needed to get used to the gas pedal, it is different from any other car I have driven.  Once I figured out how to press the pedal (I know it sounds crazy, but give it a week or so), my driving experience became much more enjoyable.  That was when I no longer experienced the “jerkiness” that many of the reviews had mentioned.  Instead, I found that the silky smooth transmission shifts quicker than other cars, and it is even more fun to drive in the “Sport” mode.  The engine is really strong and quiet, and the ride is smooth and quiet at highway speeds.  More importantly, passing at highway speeds is very easy.  I have not experienced any of the hesitation that other reviewers have mentioned, and most of the time I am at or over the speed limit much quicker than I expect.  Gas mileage has been good but not great at 28 MPG, but this is a very small price to pay for such a nice car.  In addition to the engine and transmission, I cannot say enough good things about the interior and the technology.  It has higher ground clearance, so I can get in and out of it very easily.  The seats and the dash layout really feel like they came out of a much more expensive European luxury SUV.  I did not get all of the “bells and whistles” on my model, but I did want the options that are made to keep me and my family safe.  The one I use most often is the “Rear Cross Path Detection” that informs me about unseen vehicles approaching from the side when backing out of a parking space.  Very nice.The FIAT 500X really has made my commute more fun and enjoyable, and I never thought I would say that about a vehicle.",5
67, on 07/15/16 10:10 AM (PDT),Bronzino ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Lounge 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Great first car," I got a Fiat 500X Lounge fully equipped just a couple of weeks ago. You can consider that this review comes from someone owning a car for the first time; I used to drive occasionally and rely on public transportation. This year I decided to have a car for a life style change, and researched many options similar to my Fiat 500X: Mazda X3, Nissan Juke, Audi Q3 (this one was way above the price I planned to pay for a car). Turns out that the Fiat 500X was an excellent choice! The car is a bit small, although I was not looking for big SUVs anyway, but access in the front seat is a little tight. Fuel economy was a bit of disappointment, I only got 13.5 MPG so far but I guess I mostly drive in the city, and that is why. The car is very artsy and extremely beautiful, the final touching in styling is impeccable and really beautiful, and the car stands out in the crowd. It is a very fast, comfortable car, I used to share driving a Prius and several Mazdas, and have to say that, for a car that is not as spacious, the Fiat 500X is very comfortable and roomy. The panoramic sunroof is very pretty from outside, and functional, easy to use from inside. Commands and controls on dashboard as very simple, and the car has a tech/vintage quality that goes very well all together. It is very, very pretty! I am not commenting on repair record yet (hopefully I will take some time before this), and the only disappointment is the fuel consumption in the city. Otherwise, it is just a very stylish, functional, fun, fast car. One hundred percent charming!",5

But we're having a child soon so I had to trade in w 500x Manual. It comes with 6 speed. Boy ...it shifts better. Smooth.  Often I missed my Abarth Exhaust notes. But I'm  starting to like this 500x because even though it's the same engine, 6 speed is a lot better for both cars. Clutch is really easy to shift...it is never a chores. I was never a Fiat fun till now. Big Trunk, lots of room interior and driver seat is also comfy. I wish they put CD player. Man i miss it too. Saves gas also even though it runs premium but hey if put 70mph on cruise, you'll get like 32mpg at least. So yes..if you want manual, roomy, big trunk this is the one for you.",5
69, on 07/13/16 16:11 PM (PDT),Lars ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking Plus 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Weeks of research led me to this great decision," After my wife and I (and eventually our two teenagers) shared a VW Beetle for 12 years, we wanted to get a new car.  I researched the VW Beetle turbo, which I loved but my wife wanted a four door. Drove the VW GTI which I also loved but that's a cramped racer, we needed more room. Seriously considered a Nissan Juke AWD (turbo) -- the Nissan has excellent power but it's got small cargo capacity and most of all the Nissan has a loud cabin at highway speeds. Tried out a Subaru XV (good cargo capacity but lousy power) and a Subaru Forester (so ugly, and too large), and VW GTI.  I kept coming back to the Fiat 500x, test drove one on three different occasions.  Here's why I chose the Fiat, and what I think of the car after driving it for just three days.You get a quiet ride with the 500x, at 80 MPH the car just floats along like a luxury car.  Quieter than the Subaru XV, the 500x also holds the road like a substantial vehicle whereas the XV seems more like a lightweight.  The 500x is so much quieter than the Juke, you can hardly compare them (though the Juke has turbo and pulls with greater power).Styling of the 500x (Trekking) is superior, and it grows on you.  Every time I look at the 500x I like it more!Seats are comfortable on long distance drives.  I made one 500 mile trip the day after purchase, and I fit right in to the seats.  My 500x has manual, non-heated, fabric seats.  I like the brown leather upgraded seats offered, but didn't want to pay the high price for the options package that includes them.I have also tested the AWD function, as we had a freak rain storm yesterday.  You turn the dial to traction mode and it really works.  You can view the wheel spin percentages for each wheel on your dash, but choosing that option with the steering wheel controls.  I don't know how this technology has been developed but it seems very sophisticated.  All of this for a brand new car I bought for about $23,000.  What a great value.  Thank you Fiat.Update January 2018 — 32,000 miles on the car and it still looks and drIves great. Zero problems.",5
70, on 07/07/16 13:24 PM (PDT),Damzlfly ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking Plus 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),More than the sum of its parts," The market for compact/subcompact crossovers is not crowded, but there are plenty of options. I researched Hondas, Mazdas, Nissans, Kias and Buicks (online, in-person, test driving) before deciding on a Fiat 500X. It was a difficult decision because I was looking for a previously owned vehicle, but 2016 is the first model year of the the 500X. After four months, I got lucky and found a discounted demo that was fully loaded and haven't looked back. The transmission is... quirky. It took me a couple of weeks to find the balance between hesitancy and jackrabbit starts. I had to actively be the one to decide because the car couldn't really do it (and still can't). Braking at low speeds is touchy - again, until one acclimates oneself to the system. Nonetheless, I am still thrilled by the nimbleness of the X. When I need to pass at highway speeds, I have to do little more than think it and it's done. The entertainment/communications/navigation/electronic control panel is everything it should be. The ride is firm, but real issues in the road (e.g., railroad tracks, speed bumps) are handled with alacrity. After a month, I still wake up thrilled to get behind the wheel. So much style, so much fun.Update:Our relationship is now celebrating its half-year anniversary, and we are still honeymooning. We have just experienced our first significant frozen precipitation event, and my baby sat it out in the driveway. I do not drive on ice. That is not why I bought the car. The X handles the narrow, twisting, hilly roads of my neighborhood with aplomb even in normal driving mode when there is no ice, and that is all that I ask.One-year Update:Now that I have owned the car for a year, I have to say that I did not appreciate the significant decline in value of the car. In one year, the value has declined by one-third. Otherwise, I'm still satisfied.",5
71, on 06/20/16 12:44 PM (PDT),Robert JF ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Lounge 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),"This would be a good car, if it had a good engine!"," The 500X is a nice little SUV, with many fine attributes.  Unfortunately, it is hobbled by a sluggish engine and transmission.  The engine and transmission look impressive on paper, with 180 HP and 9 speeds.  But, they fail to deliver.  My rental, with only 8000 miles on it, had a bad tendency to hesitate at the worst possible times. Even when the hesitating was not pronounced, there was a noticeable delay between pressing the gas pedal and the car moving.  The engine has no torque below 2500 RPM.   I experimented with manual shifting and then flooring the accelerator. Below 2500, the engine was weak. Passing situations, where you may be at 45 MPH and want to move in the passing lane with traffic rapidly approaching from the rear, were unnerving.  It seems like an eternity before the transmission downshifts, and the engine builds enough torque to accelerate the car.  The Sport mode works by holding the RPM's about 1000 higher, but it did not improve the performance much.  Generally, the acceleration was either ""too little"", or ""too much"", and rarely ""just right"".  I tried moderately accelerating, but the transmission quickly goes into a higher gear, making the accelerating sluggish.  Trying to accelerate only slightly faster resulted in abrupt downshifts, and the engine racing towards its red line.  This gives other drivers the impression that you are trying to race them, when you are only trying to get reasonable acceleration out of it. An auto magazine found that the smaller engine and manual transmission was actually faster than the larger engine and automatic.  This does not surprise me. Other reviews have mentioned the balky transmission, so I don't believe that my car was an isolated case.  I am not sure about the hesitation. that is unusual in a modern car.  Driving in mountainous areas was a chore, and manual shifting worked best.   But there is little engine braking below 4000 RPM, so going down 8 percent grades was a noisy affair. I will leave the other details about the car to other reviewers.  First, see if you are going to be happy with the engine and transmission, and then look at the rest of the car's features.",3
72, on 05/27/16 20:41 PM (PDT),E in Everett ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),E in Everett loves this baby SUV!," After test driving everything in this class, and I mean everything, nothing compared to the 500X. Excellent quality, great value, and it fits like a glove. I read the reviews about it being crammed and the whining about the way it shifts. I'm 5' nothing so I have no issues with room. Power delivery is very smooth and more than enough for this class. Very comfortable both in town and on the freeway. I'm not worried about reliability. I also own a 500C and have never had any issues with it. Fiat may not be popular and that's fine with me. I get to drive something I love and not see 20 of them in the parking lot everywhere I go. I'm also getting great mileage to boot :)",5
73, on 04/27/16 13:31 PM (PDT),Bambino ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Trekking 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),One of the best decisions ever," My Fiat 500x has been named Bambino.  Awesome drive, great shifting, acceleration (especially sport mode).  I wish they had put a/c vents in the rear and a spare tire.  But beyond that, the faux leather is amazing, the sound system is great, the gas mileage is so-so, but you'll love this vehicle.  The trunk is split so you have reserved space, the rear seats are roomy (I have three kids back there everyday).  We sold our Sienna for this vehicle and NO REGRETS.  It never feels like its dying during acceleration and its terribly unique and adorable.  The sun roofs are lovely, and the technology is perfect (USB, AUX, SATELLITE- no cd). I've read reviews where they say the car feels like it can't find the right gear, that is total nonsense, the moment you own your vehicle you figure out the gears and how they feel, 9 speed-it does what it's supposed too.  I tried MANY brands (for months) before taking Bambino and I almost bought another vehicle.  I feel blessed I tried Fiat.  After two test drives the same day...I was sold! Definitely an underdog.  Deserves hand washes and premium.",5

The car was a disaster. I took it to the dealership many times. The last thing that did was to stop in the middle of the highway. When I brought it for service. Guess what had happened? the clutch BURNED. BURNED!!!! YES. Brand new car and the clutch burned. I freaked out in the middle of the highway. I had to get out and the next day I took it immediately to Rick Case FIAT. They had to give me a rental because the car was unsafe to drive. Well.. maybe I should've thought about it more carefully, but I loved the look of the FIAT so much that I decided to get a new FIAT instead. Because the other one ... well you know what happened. The clutch BURNED. So I decided to lease a 500X thinking it was a ""much better"" version of the old one and thinking this one was not going to have any problems at all. Well....WRONG! I leased this car on September of 2015. I had taken this car about 5-6 times already. The last 3 times for the same exact reason. The car is simply unsafe to drive. I do not feel safe in that car. I am scared of driving it and for something bad to happen to me. I will NEVER purchase a FIAT EVER again. I am so disappointed, upset, and simply can't believe how awful my experience has been with FIAT.",1

We have gone through several dealerships in Dallas as one closed and a new one opened up.  They have done a good job for the scheduled maintenance and have taken care of all of its needs.  I upgraded with door sill covers and the spare tire kit.  I highly recommend those items.  Thanks FIAT!  We love our European crossover.,5
77, on 02/15/16 16:16 PM (PST),Eric Moon ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Lounge 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),I had to give a car a name!," For the first time ever, I had to give a car a name. Meet Donatella who sat in the showroom with the shiny white and chrome finish, the huge sunroof open to let the light show off the tobacco leather interior and then the moves of the effortless 2.5L and taught starring and ride sold me. However, that same day in a quad-fecta of Midtown Manhattan, I drove and bargained for the Q3, X1, Countryman, 500X and then before buying the next day, I threw in the ringer of the HR-V. Over some tense deliberations at Dunkin Donughts, the spouse and I agreed to throw out logic and get the Fiat. Yes, we've been back to the dealer for squeaky breaks and a blown fuse for the locks,  but Fiat of Manhattan has been nothing but professional and accomodating with walk-in Saturday service. I've enjoyed nice lunches in Midtown and walks in Central Park and I knew very well that except for the HR-V, we'd see the dealer again.I've never had a car that got so many looks. We are often pointed out as being the ""blue pill car"", people look at it in passing and point, take pictures. I'm a star at the Whole Foods parking lot. I got followed to another gourmet food place in Redhook by a lady who came up to tell me she knew to follow the Fiat as that type of car would know where to go. The guy at my local car wash asked if the interior was custom! For particulars, I find the transmission unnoticeable for the most part. When I want to notice, I'm rather impressed with the execution but do thing it's a little over the top for such a vehicle. The engine is smooth, smooth, smooth and pleanty powerful. Donatella does like to drink in the city at 19mpg but does take it easy on the N.J. Turnpike at 30mpg with cruise mostly set at 75, um 79mph. Uconnct works very well and so much easier than the BMW/Mini system as it shows as much love for my Android as it does for my Apple phones. The dog seems happy with the back seat. The sunroof is a huge favorite and the fixed glass part over the back seat opens that space up tremendously compared to all but the X1. I feel for the previous reviewers on here. I knew going into a new build from two manufacturers not know for reliability that there would be issues, but that was the same for BMW/Mini and Audi. I read up on the USA 500xmweb forum and most known issues have bulletins on the faults. I randomly joined an Italian FB group and they go bonkers over the car but also have some similar issues. I don't need a daily driver and honestly, if the dealer keeps it overnight for some time, I'd just take the subway home and not have to worry about parking. I'd not recommend anything but a Honda/Mazda/Kia/Toyota as a daily driver but I've had those too over the years and frankly, I'm really enjoying the sense of occasion I'm getting with the Fiat. I just really enjoy Donatella's company, even when she's having an off day.Update:We just past 13000 miles and 1yr of ownership and that's more miles I've out on a car in a year that my last three. That may not sound like much but I fly for a living and live in NYC so I rarely put more than 9000 miles a year on a car. I still get the looks, friends new and old still complement the car and are even surprised it's a Fiat. More importantly, I simply like getting in it and driving it. I've had a few rental SUV's lately and although they had their strengths, getting back in the Fiat 500x at the end of a trip just shows me the sense of occasion few other products offer.That said, the 9-spd auto is still a work in progress but sometimes just works a treat and sometimes just reminds you a lot is going on. It is never rude but perhaps not always in the background. The locks blew a fuse and was fixed right away on a Saturday afternoon dealer service visit while I went for a coffee. We only had one big snow fall this past winter and at 31"" in one night, I don't care what you have, dig your own car out. We left the Fiat covered for over a week. Other than that, we love the sunroof, the heated seats and steering wheel, the remote start and the UConnect with SIRI. The sporty exhaust along with the sometimes and surprisingly sporty down and up shifts remind you someone with a soul added a bit to the car. With my yearly mileage, fuel economy isn't a real deal for me with class leading to class last equaling about $200 a year when figured with $4.00/gallon fuel. Thus, and I just checked this, we averaged 20mpg even with 5800 miles at an average speed of 17mph. 80mph turnpike runs show 28mpg and more docile 70mph runs show 32mpg. Highway mpg is competitive but city mpg is really at the bottom and both are dissapointing considering the challenged 9-speed auto. I'm a happy owner and I think the character of the Fiat will keep me that way even if something nefarious comes up in the future.UPDATE: At just under 16000 miles and 1-1/2 years with the 500x, the enjoyment of the Fiat is complemented via no maintenance visits in the last year. Loving the Fiat!",5
78, on 01/27/16 17:30 PM (PST),Donald Fitzpatrick ,2016 FIAT 500X SUV Lounge 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Biggest regret," I purchased my first car on October 26th, 2015 this car was a fiat 500x. I left the dealership from which I purchased said car at around 8:30pm the following day at noon said car stalled and began smoking, then the Electric E-Brake turned on so I could not physically move it from the street shortly followed by the steering wheel completely locked up (the car had 81 miles on it), it took two hours for the tow truck to arrive to remove the car. It took two days for the dealer it was sent to to get back to me (which put me well past my return within 48 hours policy) at which time they said that the car had parts of the engine lying at the base of the compartment, this was not true the formal report stated that a rod shot through the engine, I was informed that there was a physical hole in the engine when more parts were needed as an excuse as to why I was without my car. They informed me they needed to order a NEW ENGINE to put in my new car, which took 2 weeks to arrive because they decided to let it come in on the next shipment of parts, after the engines arrival it took a week to have the engine put in (I was told when they said the engine needed to be replaced that it would take a MAXIMUM of 3 days to put in once it arrived) After the engine was in they tested the car to see if all was in working order it was not, a new fuse and starter would have to be ordered to make the car run, receiving and putting in said new pieces took a week and a half (at this point I was at a new car that I had in my possession for less that 24 hours had hit the 30th day in the shop mark)  once the new pieces were all in they tested to see if all was in working order once again it was however while giving it a thorough test-drive they noticed stalling on turns. Turned out that a new air intake valve was needed this added a little less than a full week to my already 4 weeks and 3 days in the shop for a problem that a new car should not be having. FINALLY I got the call on December 4th 2015 that my car was ready to be picked up, when I went to get my car the employees of the dealership this car was sent to stressed how thankful they were with my being so understanding of the whole situation. Throughout the entirety of this lengthy process the woman I was dealing with at the dealership rarely called me to let me know any update I was more often then not calling repeatedly to hear anything, I probably called the dealership 30 times and they called me of their own accord without my harassing at most 5. Disgusted with the company. I at one point was so tired that I called the state representative on Saturday November 21st, who said he would give me a call the following Monday regarding getting me a refund. I have yet to hear anything from him or anyone under him to this day. The only kind thing was the dealership from which I bought this car called a couple times to make sure the car was running fine after its return to me. Would never recommend to anyone!",1

We showed this car off to all our friends and family. A month after purchase, the car started shifting very firm and overheated. After going to the dealer, I was told that there was water in the oil ( telling me that a head was cracked or a seal was bad) we got the car back the next day and was told everything was fine. No notes on the paperwork about water being in the oil. Assuming everything was fine, we took the car back. A week later the car would stall during hard braking or hard acceleration. Today while picking my daughter up from a friends house, the car stalled and would not start for over 2 hours. No help from dealership on this matter as of yet.

I experienced my first breakdown, halfway, during my one hour drive home from the dealer. It shut off at 40 mph, and was difficult to start afterwards. Was instructed by my salesperson to take it to the service department the very next day, which I did, with the engine light on for the entire trip. They read the onboard diagnostic. The service tech expained that the computer was reading fault codes and self correcting as it learns. This conclusion set uneasy with me, but I was inclined to take my service manager's advise. Was sent out the door with instructions to return if any further problems. This very same day, I made it half way home, when I stopped for a soda. Upon attempting to restart my vehicle, it would not start. After several attempts of starting the moter, I called the service dept back to report my problem, but was only able to leave a message. After waiting 20 minutes for thier call back, I again attempted to start the motor, and was successfull. Engine light was on however, and it seems to be running out of tune, with little power. The service department finally returned my call, and instructed me to return the vehicle again, which I did the very next day. And was awarded a rental car.After about 8 days, I was advised that my Fiat had a new onboard body computer module installed, and that it was fine and ready for pick up. I finally made my first successful trip home with this car. However, the very next day, The vehicle became difficult to start, and remained in 3rd gear at all times, with the engine light on. So, again, another call to the service department, and I was advised to have the vehicle towed, which I did with the assistance of the Fiat Roadside Assistance, and a local towing service, and was awarded another rental vehicle.After several days, I was advised that there was a loose/corroded ground wire on the side of my transmission, which was repared, and my vehicle was ready for pick up. Once again, I picked up my vehicle, and did make a successful trip home. However... the very next day, having driven about 30 miles, the vehicle shut off while driving at about 25 mph. I did finally restart, but stayed in 3rd gear at all times, and showed an engine light on. I pulled off the road again, and called the service department. There were several attempts at reaching them on this occassion. And my family and I found ourselves stranded for some significant period of time. After a long period of time, the vehicle restarted, engine light did stay on, however it was switching through the automatic gears successfully, so I limped the car back home. Once again, another rental vehicle and yet another tow sevice back to the service department, where my vehicle sits at this time. To summerize, my vehicle has been in service 4 times in as many weeks, remains there to date, has less than 500 miles, all of them being to the service department and back. I have serveral hundred dollars tied up in rental car deposits, and am very disappointed. The most distressing thing is shutting down while in motion. I find this to be very dangerous under some driving and traffic conditions. I will on Monday, ask this Fiat dealer to buy back my car. It is my hope that this car is the ""lemon:, and not the entire model. As I do really like this line up of cars, I am sure my dealer could satifactory place me in another like and kind of Fiat, 500X AWD, and look forward to that discussion.Just saying...beware.Okay, 2 years later. After a very hard and lengthy bout with Chrysler Fiat, my Fiat was determined to be a ""lemon"", and was replaced. It's been a couple years in my new Fiat. At this time, this new 500x continues to run strong, with regular maintenance as oil changes, etc... Only complaint I have at this time, would be the trim of the vehicle. It's all glued from factory, and has been coming off all around the car. That would be the rubber and chrome strips and moldings. Leaving a very sticking substance underneath that seams to get on everything. Clothes, hands, the dog. Very annoying, and ugly looking.But hey, it starts and goes. Would not purchase another one though. Good Luck.",1

Put some good snow tires on its steel wheels and you will get where you are going through considerable snowfall.  The seats are comfortable, but rear seat passengers will be crowded.  Handling is really quite good, though my Fiat 500 Pop would run circles around it, and the 500X could easily be called ""quick,"" but not fast.  Note that the six speed manual makes all the difference in this model Fiat, though the option sacrifices you will have to make to row your own gears are substantial.  It seems that Fiat jumped on the manual-because-we-must bandwagon and the 1.4L 6MT is basic in most areas.  They saved the really good stuff for the Easy and Trekking versions.  No matter, the Pop 1.4L 6MT is a hoot to drive, has good road manners, decent acceleration with the turbocharger and a healthy lack of infotainment bells and whistles.  I do wish accessories were more reasonably priced and the 1.4L multi-air engine didn't eat premium gas, but there is much to like and no complaints so far.  Still no complaints after 4750 miles.  Dealership fixed a cruise control issue under warranty, and while it did take a while, they gave me a loaner (500L).  Did my own oil change recently and it's much easier than my Fiat 500 Pop.  Still like the car after six months!UPDATE:  After nine months of ownership the Fiat 500X was involved in a car/deer collision, sustained substantial damage to the front, and was a total loss.  The airbags worked as designed, though the knee airbag left a palm sized bruise on my right leg and the passenger airbag (seat was unoccupied) broke the windshield.  Lost substantial money to depreciation, though my insurance company was completely transparent and efficient throughout.  I replaced the Fiat 500X with a 2014 Ford C-Max Energi that I like very much.UPDATE:  After four years of ownership I traded my Fiat 500 in on the Ford C-Max above and now have zero Fiats in my garage.  I am living happily ever after.  Would I buy another Fiat?  No.  FCA will always be the quirky Italian cousin everyone talks about, but nobody takes seriously.  That is a shame.",4

Ther was never any acknowledgement of the problems (shiftiness, tire screeching, electronic malfunction), instead they just assured me everything was ok. Well it's month six and those problems, sans the electronic, are still there. Add a horrible, annoying and constant rattling from both doors and that's what I put up with daily.

They slipped a piece of paper in my car, with information about the issue when I bought the car. Again, it would have been nice if they addressed the issue up front.I leased the car and the dealer didn't really go over what maintenance is covered under the warranty/lease. Where as we just leased a Toyota for my husband and they scheduled the first oil change in 6 months before we even left the dealership.

I had been driving a 2013 Subaru Crosstrek. I love that this is even a little more compact and that there are so few on the road. Performance probably not as good.  Subaru AWD can't be beat, and the Subaru flat 4 has a lower center of gravity. Ground clearance on the 500X is same as Crosstrek, very good. Seats ride higher on the 500X even though the heights of the vehicles are the same, so better road visibility. 5'11"" or taller is a problem in the back if you have the moonroof. Acceleration is about the same (Fiat has more HP but more weight). Gas mileage  (25 combined) is one less than the Crosstrek. Cabin noise is much better in the 500X. Rear visibility better in the 500X (I had to remove the rear headrests in the Crosstrek). Professional reviews complain about the 9-speed struggling to find the right gear, I haven't noticed a thing. Most importantly, did I mention how hot this thing is? Ow! Love it! (Cons: no cargo cover (though it's only a small gap between the back seats and the trunk), auto dim mirror on top model only, limited Fiat accessories, gas mileage should be better.)",4

I drive it a little hard one morning and I started to lose power. My first thought was the transmission. I was able to get it to the dealer on its own by not driving hard. Turned out to be a turbo issue. The dealer said a clip holding on the waste gate was missing. Ok so replace the clip? Not the case you cannot order just the clip according to the dealer! the turbo is $900.00 plus 5-6 hrs. installation. Not a problem I have a third party warranty and I am under the 100k by just 1600 miles! Feeling good until the company that provides the warranty said this is not covers because you lost the clip. According to them it is not the turbo that is bad it is the fact that you lost the clip. Like I removed it! After going back and forth with them they agreed to sent out an adjuster to evaluate. I will add to this based on the final result. Bottom line I really enjoy the car, it has been reliable everyone that gets in it is impressed with the room and ride.",2

I also love, love what I call my deer lights which are the side driving lights.  I drive on many streets with no street lights and this comes in very handy to illuminate the sides of the road making night driving a whole lot easier.  Also great for watching for animals at night.  I thought I was only going to keep this car for 3 years but I am now on year 4 and will likely keep it another 2 to 3 years.  It has been very reliable.  I also drive the manual shift - not automatic.  The shifter has a real sporty feel.  The interior is very comfortable and I love the material used on the seats.

The car loses power when accelerating leaving the driver with no ability to move the car out of busy intersections, or the ability to go at all from stops. Random occurrences so problem is hard to replicate, have had the service engine light come on - even have pictures of it on - still to be told that the computer never shows or records a problem so there fore they can do nothing. I have called and open a ""case"" with FCA and all I am told again and again is sorry until I can show and have a service tech with me when it happens they can't do anything. I guess my word isn't enough, all the other online complaints I have found of others having the same issue mean anything. I am told it must just be an isolated incident.

It's not a sports car, but it handles well enough and rides comfortably on all but the roughest or bumpiest roads. As of this writing, I have had no issues at all; just normal maintenance.

Gas mileage remains around 28,  a majority of in town stop and go will drop that to 23-24 MPG.

It is driven 3-5 days a week to work 24 miles one way. I have made numerous trips of 300 to 450 miles one way. I find the front seats become uncomfortable only on the longest trips. I track my MPG since new and average 30.3 MPG. My best is 39.8. I have the auto transmission and I did have to get used to it. It does not always shift smoothly. I had a problem with the engine check light due to a fuel vac leak. The leak was never found and the problem stopped over a year and a half ago. I love the dashboard. I like a simple layout and feel the FIAT gives it to me. The view from the drivers seat is beyond compare. Cargo room is great. I can carry 2x4x8 boards in the car. It has been a great little car.

105, on 01/29/16 09:20 AM (PST),Jeremy Stewart ,2014 FIAT 500L Wagon Trekking 4dr Wagon (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),"Overall ok, now that we learned more"," Overall this has been a decent car for us.  We've taken a number of long-ish trips (3-8 hours in the car), and we've never had an issue.  It's a comfortable ride (I'm 5'10, my wife 5'4 and we both fit comfortably in front or in back. We now have a son who is almost 1 and he's spent his entire life thus far riding in this car.  With the car seat in the middle, it's a little cramped in the back, but nothing bad. The trunk doesn't fit the jogger stroller very well, well just enough for the stroller and nothing else.  It will fit in the front seat (upside down), but it makes reaching the shifter a bit awkward.  We really should have gotten a larger car, but my wife LOVED the unique look of the car and the fact that you just don't see many of them around.The Navigation is acceptable, though I wish it had real time traffic updates and I wish the head unit had CarPlay (by Apple) support, it would make things noticeably easier for us, but after a few software updates the bluetooth connects to Siri and now we don't have the terrible default voice recognition software.  Plugging your iPhone into the USB port gets you a few different experiences, but the bluetooth pairing has been pretty good now.The only thing I haven't liked about the car is the transmission, and probably more about the lack of education about it.  When we bought the car, we were told about the different transmission, but never how it meant we had to treat the car differently than any other automatic.  A few months after buying the car, a drive through Starbucks opened up near our house to which my wife has become a regular at.  Sometimes she's had to wait in line quite a while and she'd sit in drive with her foot on the brake.  After a few minutes she'd notice a smell. It smelled like burning coolant or something sweet like that.  She tried to figure out the cause, but couldn't.  Every time we took it to dealer they could never replicate it.  Another time she actually had some smoke coming out from under her car. After some serious google-fu, I was able to track it down to the fact we should put the car in neutral when at a stop for ""a while"".  There's no documentation that says what ""a while"" is or anything, so now so long as it's not a stop sign we put it into neutral (stop light, drive through, or stop & go traffic).  We wish the dealer was more forth coming with this information when buying the car, in fact my wife may have actually changed her mind on the car with that information at hand, but all said she loves the car, just wishes it was a LITTLE bit bigger in the trunk.Update: 2/4/2017 - we've added another child to our lives and this makes the car feel even smaller. A double stroller will fit in the trunk but it takes some Tetris skills. There's no fitting an adult in the back with the 2 car seats. Maybe a super thin adult. When it comes down to it, when we are done with the payments this car will go to me and my wife will get a larger car to drive the kids around in. We should have gotten a larger car from day 1 unfortunately. If this car were larger it would be great.  Repair wise it's been pretty trouble free, which is good considering our local dealer stopped servicing FIATs and we now have to go 30 miles to get dealer warranties.Update 2/6/2018 - December 2017 the car had transmission issues with a lack of power. Could force it into lower gears via manual selection and go but it was tough moving from a stop. Took it to the local dealer (who never stopped servicing fiats even though they told me they were going to) and had them look at it. They thought it was one thing. 2 weeks later they still had it and it wasn’t fixed so they had to replace the entire transmission. That fixed it. But a new transmission at 30k miles is ridiculous. It was outside the warranty but we had our extended warranty which covers it for 10yrs or 100k miles, so out of pocket for us was $100. Would have been roughly $10k without the warranty according to the service rep. I can’t with good conscience recommend this car. I know with the 2014 or 2015 model they redesigned the transmission (pretty much standard instead of some double dry clutch monstrosity), and maybe that will improve the reliability of the car for those models.",3
106, on 01/12/16 08:49 AM (PST),Ron Lakes ,2014 FIAT 500L Wagon Trekking 4dr Wagon (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),She's a keeper!," We've had our 500L for 2 years now, though have only put on 14K miles so far, and it's my wife's daily driver. Ours is the Trekking trim with the 6 speed Dual-Dry-Clutch Transmission. In response to an earlier recent review where the reviewer gave the car just 1 star, my experience couldn't be more different. To start off, I love the transmission, but I've adapted my driving habits to ensure its longevity. It is, after all, an automatically shifted manual- not a slush box.  What I'm talking about is, for example, to select the gear you want using the manual mode when in stop and go traffic, in particular when you're creeping along, and I always put it in neutral if I'm going to be stopped for any length of time. The reasons for driving the DDCT in this way are a bit technical, and maybe that's why dual clutch transmissions haven't caught on so well stateside. In any case, for 2015 all but the Pop trim come with the Aisin slush box if you opt for an auto transmission.  I've had no problem with the car rolling backwards on a slight incline when pulling away from a stop, and hill hold assist works well when on any incline greater than ""slight"".  The engine has proven to be plenty quick enough for merging with traffic etc. and frugal if you're easy on the gas. I've gotten upwards of 39 mpg when on back roads with no traffic, 34 or so on interstates, 25 to 27 in town (lots of cold starts routinely, so the economy suffers a bit for that).  Some criticize the 500L for having too firm of a ride, but to me it is sublime, giving a very nice balance between ride and handling. The steering weights up nicely as you turn in, though I wish the turn-in response were a little sharper. It is very stable once into a corner, and it's fun to hustle it if you're in the mood, though the car is really excellent at just cruising on a sunny day, esp. if you've opted for the panoramic roof.The 500L is reasonably quiet at highway speeds, and for our small family it's a great road trip car. The upright seating position gives us long term comfort,  and the expansive window area provides for an excellent view in all directions. We've found the front seats to be very comfortable with excellent adjustable lumbar support, though folks of longer inseam are more likely to have an issue with proper thigh support.  For 2015 the front seat bottom cushions have been lengthened to address this issue. How I have the driver's seat adjusted allows me full view of the instrument binnacle, though I can see where some might have issues with that- perhaps running a lower seat height and a bit more recline would do the trick for them. The parking brake handle works OK, though ergonomically it could be better. Infotainment is intuitive, simple, and has been trouble free for us. It synchs up with my 160gb ipod classic pretty quickly too. I've had Honda's, Acura's, VW's etc. and this has become my favorite. We decided to buy a MOPAR extended warranty just for peace of mind. Our's has been stone reliable save for the recalls for an airbag and a transmission re-flash.Update: We've begun our 4th year of ownership of our 500L now, and I continue to enjoy driving it. So far we've accrued 22,780 miles and counting, so slightly less than 8,000 miles driven per year on average. It's given us zero problems, its economy continues to be excellent (about 27.4 mpg lifetime) considering that it's had a life of cold starts and short trips. The dual dry clutch transmission continues to perform flawlessly, no chattering that I've experienced when driving other makes' cars equiped with dual clutch transmissions. I continue to stick it in neutral at stops, manually select 1st gear when creeping along in traffic, etc. - these driving techniques are second nature to the point I don't really think about it, done primarily in the interest of minimizing clutch wear, however I personally enjoy the extra engagement in driving our 500L this way. The seats are awesome, and the interior has held up very well- looks almost new still, despite our Havanese's best efforts to scratch it up. And it is a solid car- no squeaks or rattles whatsoever. The suspension rides as new, which is to say, excellent. I would have to say this car has more European character, for better or for worse, than most euro imports, but there is nothing about it that is so different that you can't come to terms with it. It just feels a little special and different. If I were to down grade it relative to what is out there in the marketplace today, it would be for the tech, though that could be said of most vehicles of the 2014 model year. Spy reports show Fiat giving the 500L a face lift for the 2018 model year, and it should be available with most, if not all, of the tech you could want, including all the safety nannies- though that's just speculation on my part.update August 2018- Our 500L is now my commuter car, averaging about 15K miles/yr. Fuel economy is now averaging 34.8 mpg.",5

Purchased it as a commuter/local use. Love the room inside, lots of head room, wide so you are not rubbing you elbows and the back seat is very roomy as mentioned in other reviews.Cons:1. on a slight incline when you take your foot off of the brake the clutch takes about 2 seconds to engage, so you roll back and there is a slight pause before power goes to the wheels. Nearly got T Boned the first time, 2. going uphill the power steering looses power so you have to exert more muscle to turn the wheel, then in the middle of the curve the power returns and if you are not ready you end up in the oncoming lane, 3. As mentioned in earlier reviews the brake are not consistent, one time quick and grabby the next there is pedal drop before a smooth application, 4. The low beam headlights do not illuminate nearly far enough, I asked the dealer to dial them higher and he told me they were as high as they would mechanically go. I jus keep them on high beam all of the time and almost nobody notices, If you live in the city you would never notice but if you are driving around back roads or not spending all of your time on interstates then you will feel blind, 5. As mentioned earlier there are few dealers in the Dodge/Chrysler organization that have a trained Fiat mechanics so you have to go to the Fist dealer for anything beyond oil change despite the dealers claim that you can get service at any Dodge/Chrysler service shop, 6. The front seats are not comfortable for a drive longer than 20 minutes, there do not go back far enough for me to have my legs (5'10""), 7. The steering wheel tilts but only slightly so that if you tilt it up it stops and blocks part of the display, They give you plenty of head room but the car does not accommodate persons over 5' 5"" or so, we tested with friends, 9. we have had the car for just over a year and I was thinking about trading it in for another Dodge/Chrysler product and the dealer appraised the car at $8,000 and the salesman informed me that it was one of the worst depreciating cars in the USA and he had about 15 used Fiats. I am not 18 and understand car depreciate. I am also old enough over 45 to have driven many cars and know the difference between not liking the feel of handling of a car and not feeling safe driving a car. At first I thought I just needed to get used to it but over time it just gets worst and having to adjust my driving to keep from getting into a dangerous situation is not healthy.I made a big mistake purchasing this car for a number of reasons. I plan to trade it in as soon as I can research and purchase a replacement.",1

(Last 2014 left on lot June2015, $9k discount.)   NOTE: CAPS are used for easy reference of points in article.REPLACED--2003 VW PASSAT wagon 1.8lTABOUT US—This is our SO CA 'family' car. We’ve owned mostly German cars (BMW & MB), my European husband was reluctant to buy it. This car cost half of the Subaru Outback wagon we intended on purchasing. We both have lived in Europe, so the look, size, & power of the car are not strange to us. We installed a THULE roof rack, a FIAT garage installed trailer-hitch for our Thule hitch-mounted bike rack. We are 5'8"" & 6'3"".SHORT REVIEW—We are impressed & got a great deal. I can’t stress enough: FIND A GOOD FIAT STUDIO/DEALER/GARAGE, as this will directly affect your satisfaction.INITIAL REVIEW--The GOOD--Great bang for the buck. Fun to drive. A comfortable ride with DECENT SUSPENSION. PASSENGER SPACE comparable to our Passat with better headroom (friends 6’5” sat in the back, & another 6’6” in the front comfortably). Both front & rear seats are adjustable to customize needs and comfort. Intuitive layout & usage of COCKPIT & CONTROLS. We are enjoying the technology: SAT NAV, tech ports, 110v plug, dash trip computer, etc. Good use of SPACE (for a car this size). THE WEIRD-- Strange PARKING BRAKE. Stalled 1-2xs daily for first few weeks getting out of FIRST GEAR (different than other cars we've owned). Optical illusion of SIZE & SHAPE--Car is much roomier inside than appears.6 MO REVIEW--OVERALL—Still enjoying the ride & options. Car is now broken-in (& so are we), so we aren’t stalling out of first gear beyond normal occurrences. We’ve gotten used to the PARKING BRAKE. The GAS MILEAGE is decent (22-23/city & +26/hwy, with nearly 30mpg on long hwy trips. Seems to be improving.) The Trekking’s FABRIC SEATS (leather not available on this model) are more self-regulating than I would have assumed. After our hot SO CA summer and now our ‘cold’ weather, all is well. (I don’t miss having heated seats.) A 500L’s sunroof’s screen is perforated, so it will not fully shut out the sun even when closed, and roof racks are not compatible, so I am doubly glad we don’t have one.CRITICAL—NO DEAL-BREAKERS. But…The DOORS lack a ‘stop’ mechanism, they don’t ‘fly’ open, but don’t open in a controlled manner when exiting your vehicle. The BLUETOOTH: good as an mp3 player, bad for talking on the phone. The MIC picks up too much sound from the dash vent & such. We had the ‘DEAD BATTERY issue’ (as noted by other owners) because of a SOFTWARE UPDATE that didn’t take (our FIAT studio’s garage checked-off as ‘done’), which was remedied by another FIAT garage. This other garage is a combo FIAT/JEEP, so they had the knowledge & know-how to install our TRAILER HITCH.So,—FIND A GOOD FIAT STUDIO/DEALER. Many negative reviews stem from issues with a dealership rather than the brand. Hopefully FIAT can remedy this somehow, as they put out a decent product. We have heard about some transmission problems, but we since we have manual, we are hoping to avoid that.",5

(9/10)3.  Comfort - very roomy.  Took my wife, daughter (5yr. w/ car seat), and in-laws to and their luggage to the airport - 10/10.4.  Manuverability/drivability - 1) the lighest clutch I've ever experienced.  2) short turning radius - makes parking and U-turns very easy.  3) Sturdy - feels like you are driving a Town & Country minivan (about the same ride height)  4) 1st gear is weird, but 3rd gear is when the torque shows up.  5)  drives well in the snow.  Was able to get up/over ice/snow covered hills that I used to get stuck on with old car.  6) at 700 miles, I get 24.5 MPG city, 34.5 highway.  The highest highway MPG was 37.0 (5 peo people plus luggage - going to the airport).  I paid $15 to fill my tank (regular, even though premium is recommended) a few days ago.  Small tank, decent range. 7) Power steering is like theold luxury cars from the 70's & 80's - light & easy.5.  Easter eggs - 1)  the first day I got it, the arm rest was in the way of my shifting.  You can lower it by pulling on the feont latch and pushing it down (at an angle) perfect for resting your arm and shifting.  2)  You can keep your headlights switched to ""on"" all the time - basicall like auto headlights.  3)  When you turn your wheel (right or left) the fog lights come on to light the path.  4)  the fog lights are very bright.  5)  You can set a max spedd limit to get a reminder of when you go over a certain speed (I set mine to 75).  You can also set the Navigation to aler t you when you are druving over the posted speed limit.5.  In reverse, the rear windshield wiper automatically truns on.6.  If you make a panic stop - hit the brake hard, the hazard lights will automatically flach - alerting drivers behind you.Cons1)  There are some rattles when driving over rough roads.  The conversation mirror makes noise if you forget to stow it.2) I was on the highway, and the fasten seatbelt buzzer went off.  I un-fastened and re-fastened my bektm but it cintinued to chime.  It only stopped when I buckled the (empty) frint passenger seat.  It hasn't happened since.  3)  one morning, I noticed that the exterior lights were on (overnight?), car was slow to start/crank over, but still started.  Will turn the lights one/off manually.Regrets:  None - At first I wanted Beats and the moonroof, and the black roof (with the rest of the car white), but it was beyond the scope of my budget, and would ultimately just make the car colder/hotter/louder. Looked at the 2015 Urbanna - but didn't want to pay more.  I could see black wheels getting old/boring after a few years.  I like tge styling and floating roof design w/ Trekking body cladding.Overall 9/10 - My parents alwats drover cars different than everyone else, and now so do I.",5

Again a very underrated car.  Give one a look and test drive and see what you thinkUpdate:  now at 3 years of  ownership and we continue to love our Fiat 500L.   Sadly because of what ji can only consider to be biased reviews, sales for the model have not  been good.

Software updates by the dealer improved the 6 speed transmission. The best part of owning this car is how easy it is to get in and out of.  It is tall so it feels like a much larger vehicle. Large doors and the back seat  with a almost flat floor makes it easy for rear passengers.   I am a fan of the U-Connect system.  The outward visibility is aided by a high driving position.,3

This is my second FIAT, trading up from the 500 to the 500L.  I've come to the conclusion that people in this country reject things that are different or unique.  The design of the 500L is ingenious - for its size it has amazing interior volume.  The ride is very comfortable and it has a great seating position, sitting higher than many crossovers.  I'm not sure why the press reviews say the car is under-powered. The engine is turbocharged and - at least in mine - when I hit the pedal that car MOVES!  It handles quite well and is fun to drive, even for as tall as it is.  Most reviewers have highly criticized the looks of the 500L but I have only gotten nice compliments on it.  With all those windows, the high seating position, and spotter mirrors on both sides, all around visibility is amazing!  FIAT has some quirky features and design elements, but I think they make the car all that more appealing.  Some of the interior trim could be nicer, but most cars today are filled with hard plastics - most of the hard plastic surfaces are slightly textured, so I don't think they look cheap.  I have almost 20,000 miles on mine and aside from routine maintenance, the only issue I've had was with a rattle in the back (fixed by the dealer on the first visit).  FIAT stands behind their products with an impressive 4 year/50,000 mile warranty, too.  On one hand, it is a shame this car doesn't sell better, but I have never been one to drive what everyone else is driving, so I like driving what I consider to be the best keep secret out there!  I would absolutely but another one without any hesitation.  Do yourself a favor - ignore the press critics and focus on the reviews of people who drive these cars day in and day out.",5

One day, this garbage stopped on the road right after exiting McDonalds' drive-thru while giving out really bad smell. I could smell, my wife could smell, even the employees at the restaurant could smell the burning or melting odor. The car didn't start for 10 min. with an on-screen message like I need to put the gear to N then R then P or something. Now, it started to run again. I searched internet because it was Sunday and the FIAT dealership didn't provide any repair service. BTW, I found out that there are several issues just like me. And, more importantly, all of these reviews reported that both dealership and FIAT headquarter denied to identify and fix this issue. Only solution was just to continue driving this garbage with fear. Well next Monday, I brought this car to the dealership, and their reaction was ""exactly"" same with other reviews. ""Can't replicate or duplicate the issue"", ""There is no error record on the computer"" and ""Drive your car home as is"". Next day, I went to a Japanese car dealership and sold the garbage and bought much more reliable car. If you are rich, you can buy FIAT. But, if you wanted be frugal and smart, go to more reliable automakers. FIAT's reliability is 28th out of 28 automakers in 2015 Consumer Report.",1

I do not mind the emergency brake handle location. The car provides a great view of the road and the seating position is excellent. The ride is tuned to a good level in my opinion. I live in Chicago and this car has proven to be easy to park in tight city street spaces while providing excellent interior volume. Great cargo space for those larger purchases. Highway performance is also good, I have averaged 33 mpg.  My children love this car and prefer to ride in it vs our Ford Taurus. I was in the market for a Chrysler 200 but when I could not find one equipped to my liking I took a chance on test driving the 500L and never looked back. Yes I was concerned with the professional ratings and reviews but my experience has been all positive. I have not experienced  the brake fade some reviewers did.My car came with the Beats audio system and I frequently have too adjust the base level down as it is tuned too a level way too high.",5

Bought - a month ago - a top-end 2015 Fiat 500L Trekking Auto (with sunroof) and all the extras (park camera, fog lights, beats sound, etc.) and I cannot be Happier!! Easily, this is the most underrated vehicle in our land. Is it a stand-out? Yes. Is it of the boring same-ness of your usual highway gray/black/white avalanche of moving ""boxes"" on wheels, No! Leaving the outstanding aesthetics of this truly Italian design (at its best, think Pininfarina), how about getting 26.1 mpg in the first 1298 miles! I was not expecting this kind of fuel economy. My sticker said, 25mpg combined…so this is a bonus! Heavily driven so far in the best of both driving-validating worlds to compare - the epitome of an urban jungle - New York City's unforgiving traffic - and the pristine, meandering beauty of upstate New York, I must say, this car is a Winner. Popemobile, size-wise - no; Plenty of space Inside!! Unlike the VW sport wagon or Ford transit wagon, no cramped cockpit with your knees squeezed. Brisk maneuverability, great for parking and good storage space (at expense of smallish back seats). Quick, responsive engine - the turbo kicks in like a jet - whisks you when you need it most; merging in traffic, changing lanes, etc. Incomparable views! Visibility is outstanding. Heavy rains upstate for the past 3 days (and nights) and Not one drop inside of car…even if basically the entire roof being glass (half of it operable/can open). Seats are ergonomic/comfortable and firm (sorry coach potatoes), lumber support, excellent. Everything is adjustable so it's not just good for a 6'2"" guy…;..too bad we don't have the European long body version of it. This car also will talk to you - voice recognition works seamlessly and pairing my smartphone took 2 minutes. Infotainment system is impeccable. The space inside, along with the plethora of great sound - jazz, blues, classical, info, whatever is your wish - makes me feel like in a concert hall. To all those who hesitate, Don't! I would like to stress, it's not just the design that is great but Function-saturated feast on wheels. What's amazing is that what appears small is actually big! And once inside, you stand in a very comparable height level (i've got the 17"" wheels) with all the SUV's mastodons around you. So for those of smaller stature, you'll feel at great driving height, Without paying a fortune for a ""true"" SUV...The price value was unbelievable. I got a great deal and I quickly seized it as I bought the car for under 20k..!! My grade: A+.",5

I ended up buying the 2015 500L Trekking with the ""Beats"" sound system with SiriusXM satellite radio, AISIN Heavy Duty 6-speed automatic transmission and U-connect touch screen. I use it for driving around San Francisco with all the hills and find it handles well. I love the headlights that move to follow your turns and curves. It is very easy to fold down the rear seats and create a spacious flat cargo area. The back seats also have the ability to recline to an almost flat bed like seat. The dual climate control keeps the front seat passengers happy and as the driver I enjoy the comfort of Power driver 4-way Lumbar Adjust. The visibility is amazing! With large windows all around and front pillar split by glass and wraparound rear windows. I also own a VW Touareg and honestly have better visibility in this Fiat.  Features like the rear backup camera, rear park assist system and  hands-free phone connectivity add to safety and convenience. The 17-inch wheels hold the road well even when driving on the freeway in rain. All in all for the price I paid I feel very satisfied with my new car and must admit I enjoy the compliments from those who notice it in the bright yellow and black combination. The gloss black instrument panel bezels are a beautiful upgrade included in the Urbana Trekking Collection 1.",5

I picked a Black 500X Trekking AWD, I liked the comfortable ride and was impressed with the 9 speed transmission. While talking about the numbers with my sales person, I could not take my eyes of this 2015 Rosso Perla colored 500L Trekking that was on the show room floor. After a few days I still could not get that car out of my mind, so I went back and test drove that 500L and I loved the cavernous feel on the inside, but it isn't enormous outside (love the cargo area and fold down back seats); it sips gas, has really good visibility, comfortable front seats and a smooth drive. The AISIN Heavy Duty 6 speed automatic shifts great and responds well when I need to down shift for passing or merging onto the highway.So for me I had to have the 500L Trekking, a week after I got it we took it on our family vacation. And it was very comfortable on that long 4 hour road trip to Todd PA. It got around 34 mpg (all highway driving) and on my normal day to day driving I average around 30 combined.I do love this car. I've had no problems whatsoever with it (it's still very new, only 1850 miles, so I'll keep my fingers crossed).It's weird, cute, bug-eyed looking and these are all positives to me. I have absolutely no regrets having moved into a car that performs the same functions of getting me around, but gives me so much more enjoyment than the average same-old same-old car everyone else has.Family, friends and coworkers always ask me ""Why another Fiat?"" aMy response is always the same, go test drive one for yourself and you will see why I love them. Not every poor review about the Fiat brand is true; you can't believe everything you read.After a year of ownership, the Fiat 500l  Trekking is one of the best vehicles I have owned.

There is so much width the door armrest isn't really reachable, either.  That said...I love driving this car.  After years of soccer mom-mobiles, I wanted something small, easy to maneuver and park, better on gas, and fun.  However, we have two large dogs and stepkids on weekends.

Thankfully it is under warranty, and Fiat came to tow it to the dealership because it didn't have enough miles to get there. The dealership is 40 mins away, they're backed up and won't get to look at my car for another day, and they had no loaner car for me (although they did agree to cover my rental, if I made my way to Enterprise and dealt with that paperwork myself. Thanks for the terrific convenience, Fiat. If your car breaks on me while under warranty, you should probably consider making my experience very convenient.) On another note, we also have an electric BMW i3. I have driven it and the Fiat the same distance, and the BMW uses substantially less ""miles"" to go the same distance. I know it is said that the amount of miles used depends on how you drive it, but I find the Fiat to be far less reliable in terms of how far I can actually go, compared to the BMW (which is twice the price, so you get what you pay for!)

Dealers are currently offering nice pricing as many 2014's are coming off-lease and being turned in. We paid $7500 + tax. which seems very cheap for car that cost $30K a few years ago. The limited market and relatively high production volume keep the current resale value low.  The car is blast to drive at lower speeds...  It's very quick and can zip in and out of traffic lightning fast. It feels light, nimble and could probably beat many expensive sports cars up to about 60mph. If you install a 240v fast-charger in your garage and only commute in the city or shorter distances -- the car is fantastic. If you have to travel over 25 miles on the freeway to work, I'm sorry to say the car is a joke. I would not recommend this car for commuting. The problem is that once you exceed 50mph, the battery charge diminishes shockingly fast, to the point where you may be scared you won't make it. It almost seems as though the car needs some kind of overdrive system because it uses tons of energy at 65mph, even with no throttle. In the city, it has regenerative braking to help recharge, but on the highway the motor eats battery power like crazy. The fully-charged ""96-mile range"" can only last about 40 miles at 65mph. If you commute, you'd better have a fast-charger at work or you may not make it home.",3

167, on 10/06/16 17:20 PM (PDT),Jon Sweitzernoffenhold ,2016 FIAT 500e Hatchback Battery Electric 2dr Hatchback (electric DD),Great-ish car.," I like the way the car drives, but dislike a lot of the interior features.  First off, the performance is great and I've never had such a fun car to drive.  The acceleration sets you back in your seat and is instantaneous.   I don't mind the range as we kept our gas cars and 95% of our driving is local.  The charging has been fine with the standard 110 outlet and I don't see a need for the fast charger.  My 7 year old daughter fits in the rear seat without a problem, but I'm happy the lease will be up in a few years as we'll run out of room as she grows.  As for the bad....Headroom is awful.  I'm 6'3"" and basically have to put my head into the sunroof area to drive.  Backing out of a driveway is difficult as the rear visibility is very poor.  I'm happy for the sensors.  Storage inside the car is also horrible.  The glove box interior is flat so all your stuff comes out when you open the door.  The cupholders are too close together for even 2 medium drinks.  There's nowhere to put a cell phone.  I hate the radio.  There's a navigation warning that comes on for a while that prevents you from changing the channel...unless you take your eyes off the road and hit the ""accept"" button twice.  I don't need navigation as my cell phone does it better.  The Satellite Radio sounds compressed and worse than a cassette tape.  There's no CD player.  I love audio and honestly can't speak to the quality of the speakers since broadcast radio is the best quality thing I've listened to.  I hate that every statistic is listed in MPGe, but we fill the car in kilowatts.  I find MPGe to be a worthless number.  One cool feature about the car is the smartphone app that allows me to turn on the climate control before I get to the car.  It's just tough that it only turns on the last setting you had.  If I drove with the air off and the windows down, I have to remember to turn it back to automatic 68 degrees when I park if I want to use the app.    I also love/hate the App's function to show where the car is because it allows the person with whom you share the car with to spy on you.  I have nothing to hide, but it gets weird when the other person knows where you went out for lunch.  The regenerative braking is cool, but it doesn't seem to activate fully until the car is less than 90% charged.  i.e. It will regenerate up to -10kw, but after 89% battery remaining it will go up to -40kw regeneration.  It almost pays not to fully charge the car if you don't need the range.    There's also a weird spot between 5mph and 0 where the brakes engage differently and grip strongly into a forceful stop.   Overall I like the car as a car, but don't like the comfort features.  I'll miss it when the lease is up because it is such a unique experience.",4
168, on 09/30/16 13:53 PM (PDT),Jon Sanserino ,2016 FIAT 500e Hatchback Battery Electric 2dr Hatchback (electric DD),My Favorite car out of dozens!," I bought this car because 95% of my driving is short range for shopping, post office, etc. when I am not traveling out of the country for business.  Also - the dealer and government incentives made the lease price so low, the car was essentially free - the lease is about the amount I paid for gas monthly.   I truly did not expect to fall in love with this little car!   It makes me smile every time I drive it.  It is amazingly quiet and solid, and very quick.  You really need to watch your speed.  It brakes very well, and also handles better than expected considering it has hundreds of pounds of batteries in the floor. Whenever someone new gets in, the first thing they say is ""Wow - it's nice!  And it's roomier inside than I expected!""  It is usually just me and a dog, or the two of us, but we have had 4 people in the car to go a short way to dinner, etc.   The fact that there is NO SOUND except the (excellent) radio turning on when you ""start"" it, still takes some getting used to.  The seats are surprisingly comfortable considering that they are so small and thin.  Totally adequate for the car.  The sound system is better than my Acura's.  The NAV is a simple TomTom system, but it works, and it has nearby charging stations pre-programmed in.  The Bluetooth works perfectly as does the climate control system.  This little car really is well equipped with everything except a backup camera, but the rear bumper is about 10"" behind the rear window so it isn't a  serious issue, and it has the parking sensors anyway.    Yes, there are a few little ergonomic issues about the car that frustrate me, and the steering requires real attention on the freeway,  but in general, for what it is intended for, this is what everyone should be driving around town.    I have owned around 50 cars, and this will be the one that will be hardest to let go of.   GREAT WORK FIAT!  And thanks to Fiat of Glendale for making the purchase so easy.",5
169, on 07/07/16 22:09 PM (PDT),Califas ,2016 FIAT 500e Hatchback Battery Electric 2dr Hatchback (electric DD),Zippy Electric Vehicle," The 500e has a better response than the gas-powered version.  It handles better, has the best pickup and go, and is so fun to drive.  I wanted to lease an electric vehicle so I wouldn't have to pay for parking in my city's parking meters and garages (my city has an incentive to lease/purchase EVs) especially as I work downtown and must pay to park.  It's a dream to drive and park, and recharges when you break, so it becomes a game to get as much mileage from a charge as possible.  So far, I've had no problems with the car at all.  The lease is up the end of the year, and I've become spoiled with having an EV; it's wonderful not to pay for gas, oil, or smog check!  I hope to continue with either leasing or owning another EV.  At least in California, this is the way to go especially as the state has a pay back money incentive to own/lease an EV.",5

Has plenty of space in the backseat even though trunk space is limited. Charging is easy but know that on standard 110V outlet it would take an entire day to charge up. 24V commercial chargers can do the same in 4 hours or you can install a 240V at home. Love the styling and it's a hoot to drive. Instant torque and no shifting makes the car feel like it has way more power than it does. No problem at all passing cars with easy and it handles very well. Slightly wobbly on highway with high wind. One of the best EV out there that drives handles and performance as good with any gasoline vehicle - 500E is better than any other 500 variant including the Abarth IMO.,5

There is a major design flaw that will cost you $2000 at least once, and likely $2000 / year.  This is NOT covered by the warranty.  Before buying one, take a look at the plug (where the gas cap would normally be).  It is very fragile plastic.  Now think that for 8 hours or more a day, this will be plugged into a charger with a handle slightly smaller than a gas pump handle.  Now think that if a small child bumps that even once, the plastic connector will snap.  That simple looking connector costs almost $2000 to replace.  It is part of a cable bundle that runs to the front of the car.  It takes 7 hours to replace (at least that's what they bill).  This will break!!  Beware before buying this car!!  Warranty will not cover it because they say it is the child's fault for bumping into it, not a car problem.",1
172, on 06/18/18 16:43 PM (PDT),tsaue ,2015 FIAT 500e Hatchback Battery Electric 2dr Hatchback (electric DD),"nice commuter car, but not for a family"," If you're single and need something to get from A to B and happen to live in the city with access to a charging station either at home or near a chargepoint (where you have to pay) then this may be the car for you. I am a leasee of this and plan to drive it and give it back at the end of my 3 year stint, but I will have to say that you have to make compromises with this car. PROS/CONS as they come to me. Small, can park anywhere, stable up to about 80mph on highway, with the seats folded down you can fit a wide variety of items. If you have small kids, the back seat is great, if you are tall and an average sized adult you may have a lot of problems.  You also can not carry a golf club bag in the back if you have those seats occupied, maybe just one 3 people in the car and have one seat folded down. Charging at 32A which is the max rated for this car will take about 3.5 hours to charge to full which isn't bad. I use this car to travel back and forth to work at around 35mi away, you can barely make it back. If had to take detours you may be stretching it. I've also noticed that the battery is degrading after driving it hard for about 1 year. If you plan to drive this for longer than 5 years you may not be able to reach the rated 80mi on a single charge. Be prepared to stop or have that charging card ready. With all the short comings, I do enjoy my drive in the car, but with all the SUVs out there if god forbid you get into an accident, you may get out alive, cause there's not many crumple zones. I would highly recommend this car in city situations, but probably look towards volt or battery capable car to get you places. I think my next car will be a bolt because 200mi range is the sweet spot and calms my range anxiety. Cause you know, sometimes you just gotta go far. Many folks will need to have a backup gas car to go further places, but this may be a good interim car. I have no idea why but the insurance on this thing is SUPER expensive in CA, and parts are as well. Factor that in if you ever do get into an accident. Remember guys and gals, EVs are still new and in a few years time you're going to see a lot of choices. My recommendation is to get this car if you need to tie you over or just save up and bye our friend's Elon's brand. Thanks for reading.",3

The biggest PITA is trying to use standard driving directions.  Yes, highway mileage brings out what's probably the weakest point on the car. I've gotten my mileage estimate up to 110, but that's using my own hybrid of biking directions and knowing my way around both the roads and bike paths after having lived (relatively adventurously) in my city for 20 years.  There's also a driving style adaptation; I'm a chronic speeder, and one of the reasons I got this car was to self-impose restrictions on that.  Simply having the kWh display has been enlightening, to say the least.  (All cars should have some sort of energy-burn display).  If you drive a gas-powered car, be prepared for a change.  It's a good one, but a shift none the less.  ***  For reference, the trunk size with the seats down is about the same size as my old Forester with one huge exception: the angle of the back of the car.  I use my old trunk mat, but height in the back is so seriously lacking I'm thinking of removing the interior of the trunk panel just for the added couple inches.  ***  Visibility from inside the car is why I bought this.  It's not as good as older cars with nice big windows and narrow frames, but it's better than any of the other eCars I drove.  I've given up on being visible to other drivers, frankly, so... this one is great on agility, and the horn is loud enough while still having a polite staccato.  Traction in <4"" of snow, on ice, and in the rain is the best I've owned (but also the newest).  ***  It's really fun.  Charging stations are popping up in new places, I'm saving a car-payment's-worth in gas and oil changes, I can whip a u-turn right on the street and nab a really tiny parking space, and getting service simply having a newer car, even with Chrysler-FIAT, is a whole lot better than trying to fight for cred driving an older car.",4

This car works great as a city commuter and carries our shopping purchases easily in the ""trunk"" and the extra space made by folding down the rear seats.  We are family of two ""empty nesters"" so although this car is an addition to our gas engine vehicles (bought to complement our newly installed solar array on the rooftop), it has become the favorite car to use.

We live in San Francisco so parking is rarely a problem for this car.  This car is great at stop and go.  Often you can drive more than 100 miles in the city.  It has good handling and is fairly comfortable in the front seat.  CONS:  My worst complaint is the highway mileage.  If driving around 65 mph continuously don't expect the range to go beyond 60-70 miles.  Also, when you turn on AC you lose about 10 (estimated) miles in range so be careful.  Back seat is horrible in terms of space.  Trunk space is small but for a family of three it's big enough to hold our weekend groceries.  I like the interior design but the quality of material is really cheap so I don't think it's worth the price tag.  Everyone was laughing at the bright orange but this bright color is necessary because sometimes on the road people just don't see this compact car.

I charge a mix of at home and at work (free at work from solar unit). I average about 80 miles per charge, but that's because I drive quite hard in my commute, usually going 75-80 mph. When I'm not commuting usually see about 100 miles per charge. The only thing I wish it had was a DC fast charge option, but otherwise very happy with it. Another 50 miles of range wouldn't be a bad thing either! But I'm not complaining, overall quite happy. I've only been ""stuck"" twice and both times I was a block from home and just pushed it into my driveway. When it gets to 0% state of charge, it pretty much means it, you've got about 1 mile left at that point. Also, love burning rubber from a stop, it's very easy to do, and it's funny because there's no engine sound, just the whirring of the electric motor and the squealing tires. Very funny.

I drive it daily in city traffic, take it for spirited drives through the mountains, and have taken it to the local track day a few times.  This car has never let me down, had any real issues, or made me regret buying it.  The dealership has been very helpful with the 2 issues I have had(a bad clamp on the A/C condenser and a bad clamp on the coolant overflow reservoir).  I am 6'2"" and simply don't fit in a lot of the sportier cars on the market.  I tried the MX-5, Toyota 86, and Ford Fiesta ST and this was the most comfortable to me and I don't even have to put my seat all the way back to fit!  Incidentally this car is faster than every one of those cars that cost at least a couple grand more.  My 8 year old that is 4 and a half feet tall fits easily in the rear seat and I have room in the hatch for a surprising amount of groceries.  The interior is good quality and I have yet to hear a single rattle or squeak.  The driver's screen is very easy to read and all controls are intuitively placed and easy to reach.  The window controls in the middle throw people off but to me it just makes sense since my hand is already there for the shifter anyway.  Is this the most practical or fastest car....not at all.  Will this car have you looking for any excuse to do a rev-matching downshift and cost you hundreds of dollars in plastic surgery to remove those smile lines....DEFENITELY!",5

I had to wait for traffic to go around me and then drift backward down the hill until i drifted backward into a driveway then drifted forward in drive down the hill until the transmission engaged back into drive.  Over the next 2 months the transmission failed to engage 3 more times each a under different circumstances and each of those times when the transmission did engage the car lunged forward. Each time this happened there was someone in the car with me and once someone else was driving.  I took my car to the dealer and was told they could find no issues.  The problem continued so I called Fiat who advised I take it back to the dealer which I did and the dealer advised again no issues and had a tech from Fiat come into look at it and again they found nothing.  Fiat said there was nothing they could do.  The car is DANGEROUS, I also called Chrysler and got the same results.  Neither FIAT or CHRYSLER was of any assistance and offered no solution perhaps replacing with another car or something, anything ..not that I want another but at least an offer to rectify the situation.  DO NOT PURCHASE A FIAT car is unsafe and Fiat & Chrysler customer service is the worst I have ever had to deal with.",5

Fun is what you should know about this car. It feels fun, sounds fun, looks fun, and can be used practically as well.  I've had mine since February, and have put almost nine thousand miles on it in those three months. I'm someone who usually puts less than a thousand miles a month on my car, but this little monster keeps humming to me to drive more, drive faster, drive farther. It's simply the most fun I've ever had on tires. My one complaint as a driver is the manual shifter has a long throw, more like an old tractor than a sporty car, but there are several inexpensive (~$120) aftermarket adapters available that fix that nicely. So go try one. My car's not the quickest, or the fastest, but roll the roof down, blip the throttle, and you'll be caught too.

197, on 04/25/16 11:51 AM (PDT),Brian Vinci ,2014 FIAT 500 Convertible GQ Edition 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),Very fun to drive!," Update 10/2017: This car has about 40k miles on it now at 3 years old. It has had no maintenance or breakdown issues. Shows no signs of mechanical issues.Some things that do show the wear are the paint. It chips rather easy and is somewhat discolored on the bumper areas, not too noticeable unless your washing it. Resale value of the fiat is still in the tank, even though this is one of the special editions of abarth, which is a bummer and the biggest reason I can not recommend buying this car at any price new. Resale is ATROCIOUSLY low. If you buy it new, you are stuck until the car is 3/4 paid off at least. So the value just isn't there on the financial side and I have had way better value in, well, every other car I have ever owned. Better off with a mini cooper, honda, kia, hyundai or toyota by far. Original reviewI've owned this car for over 2 years when writing this review.The good: This car is fun to drive, its eye catching , and people always comments on the sound of the exhaust.  If your looking for something fun to drive this is a good catch.  The cabrio top is great on non rainy days, really enjoy the air and blasting the sound system, which is ample to blast through any wind noise.The steering and response is there,, it wont disappoint on the steering and grippiness of the road. Once the stock tires wore down I replaced them with Michelen Y rated tires which will last longer.The stick shift is this car is super easy,, you wont have a problem even if your a novice. And the hill assist is money. If your on a hill and need to go from 1st gear, no need to rev the engine and grind the clutch, the car holds break for you for about 3-4 seconds which is plenty to get going (really nice feature) and if its not your thing, you can turn it off in the settings.Interior: its a unique design for Fiat so theres not much in the Fiat line to compare it to,, its a nice leather finish to the seats and really compliments the white exterior. I get lots of compliments on the interior design.Gas milage will vary depending on how you drive it,, if your enjoying that punchy turbo motor,, expect gas milage to suffer,, if your easy on it,, it'll realistically be in the mid to high twenties maybe get into 30s.Parking assist is money and works as advertisedAll the controls are easy to use, reach and understand.If you want to know some cons:Might second biggest gripe would be the stock radio head unit. Its really cheap garbage. Which is sad because this car is priced high when compared to what you get in other brands for mid-high 20k range. I replaced it with a Kenwood KVT7012BT, which is the best thing you can do. Not only does it allow you to adjust the EQ the fidelity, apps, screen size and capability is just better. Sound is well improved. The Beats system is junk and is pure marketing for beats, the consumer is benefiting nothing from this system.Second gripe would be the headlight power,,  the illumination is underwhelming and in many cases will have you wondering if your seeing everything you need to be.There are some blind spots with the front windshield pillars which when in a lengthy turn scenario have blinded me to cars that were there so you have to have your head on a swivel when taking corners to ensure there is no one coming head on.Resale value on these cars is terrible!!! The number 1 reason I wont purchase again. If you buy it be prepared to keep it for many years.I do find myself wishing for some illumination around the interior at night. Even grabbing a drink from a cupholder can be difficult when its pitch black in the car, so some subtle illumination like the mini has would be stellar. Especially since this car isnt too far off the pricing of a mini.It really is a decent car I wish I could recommend. I have had zero issue with it mechanically. I had a family of four in it without issue cruising around. And taken several trips with 2-3 people in it.",4

199, on 09/26/15 11:34 AM (PDT),Wade Morefield ,2014 FIAT 500 Abarth Abarth 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),Used Abarth is a perfect second car- Update," Update March 28, 2018 - After owning it approx. 2.5 years, my 2014 Fiat 500 Abarth has proven to be a great second car. It has about 36,000 miles and remains very fun to drive and completely reliable.  That is good because the local FIAT/Jeep/Dodge/Chrysler dealer service department is very, very bad.  Oil changes are done about once per year according to the maintenance minder light on the dash and they cost about $80 (full synthetic is required).  It's due for spark plugs (every 3 years or 36k miles) and the dealer charges over $300 for that service!  I bought the plugs online for about $10 ea. and will change them myself when the weather warms up.  Gas mileage remains 30+ overall and I drive the car pretty hard.  The interior and the exterior are both holding up well and the car still looks great.  The 500 is criticized for it's interior plastic, but that plastic is basically indestructible.  The car is plenty comfortable for a road trip for two 6' tall people and their luggage.  Plenty of room in the front seats. The Abarth handles interstate highways just fine, but it clearly prefers winding secondary roads.  The engine sounds great all the time and I never get tired of running through the gears.  Backroads and 4th gear are a perfect match!  A new 500 Abarth can be had for about $20k, but I'd recommend buying a used one with low miles for just over half the price of a new one.  The 2018 model is essentially identical to the 2015 model and even that was basically the same as the 2012 model.  The 5 year 50k mile bumper-to-bumper warranty should put to rest any reliability fears, but my Fiat 500 Abarth has been surprisingly reliable and trouble free.  However... as much as I love the Abarth, if Honda ever decides to make a Honda Fit Si (with an inch more front legroom please), I'd probably sell the Fiat and buy the Fit Si.  A sportier Fit would be a perfect fit for all my needs since it is much more flexible than the 500.",5

At 70,000 miles here is a list of repairs and cost. Headlights went out, cost over $800.00 to repair, had to replace some electrical board. License plate light is out , cost over 300.00 to replace. Manual transmission it is hard to shift. There was a recall still hard to shift. Had to replace the stick shift boot because the base came a part.  And, the thing about the stick shift boot is it was replaced with a a very nice high quality boot that I had to pay for. Now at 77,000 miles the left boot is torn another $800.00 plus to replace. I have had more issues with this car but don’t have time to keep going. This car is of poor quality. Everything is put together with plastic clips.  My suggestion, find another cute car. Fiat sales are down, and the reason is this car is a piece of junk! Don’t waste your time.",1

I travel 50 miles a day to and from work and love the great fuel economy at about 38.5 miles per gallon at about 60 mph ! Also the Bose stereo rocks !

204, on 02/15/18 01:28 AM (PST),Kieza C. ,2012 FIAT 500 Hatchback Pop 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl 5M),Cute is never enough," I bought this car because my aunt had one and because it was so cute. This car has broken more times than my previous car which had almost 200,000 miles on it, I owned that one for 8 years and I've had the Fiat for 5. I did all of the scheduled maintenance, even after my warranty ran out. I have had to replace...the oil pressure sensor, the throttle position sensor, the thermostat, the alternator, the windshield wash reservoir, and I'm on my second replacement O2 sensor.  Inside the cable that moves the front passenger seat up and forward at the same time didn't last the first year, and I don't have kids so it was used that often. The fuses for the climate controller lighting have been replaced several times. The daytime running lights are nearly impossible to get to to replace the bulbs. The holders for the felt covered section that covers the cargo area broke within the first few months.  The car handles really well in the snow though, when it can get out of it's own way. It's annoying that you can't open the back hatch unless you unlock it with the keyfob, There's no button inside the car and no keyhole outside. If you get out of your car and run around to the back to get something you have to shut the car off to unlock the back hatch. Although it is nice that it's set up so you virtually cannot lock your keys in the car. The keyfob mangles really easily, like just from regular use. Right now we are trying to figure out why nothing happens when I put the pedal to the floor uphill on the highway. Oh and if your thermostat goes the car will try to kill you by registering an overheat that isn't happening which throttles the engine back without warning. Then after it has it's fit everything goes back to normal. Lastly the repair costs will put you in the poor house and dealer parts are almost always on back order.",2

206, on 01/11/18 20:16 PM (PST),Valbowski ,2012 FIAT 500 Hatchback Pop 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl 5M),Extra warranty takes me to 1M miles!," This car has been driven nearly 7 days a week almost every week, for 5.5 years.  Once a year, an oil change is called for, the car will show the warning for that when it is time.  We put a little over 8K miles on it per year, and as this writing, we are at 44K.  This is a base model, no special wheels, just a basic pop.  Aside from once a year oil changes, and scheduled maintenance, the following things have required repair - 1) the wiring harness that connects all things powered to the hatchback had to be replaced.  2) the fan switch for the heating/cooling needed to be replaced 3) and the rear oil seal on the engine began a tiny drip, which was deemed necessary to be replaced.  All of this would have fallen outside of the warranty, but I purchased the 1M mile bumper to bumper warranty.  Per visit, with the extra warranty, there is a $100 plus tax fee.  The above repairs, if I had not had the warranty, would have almost equaled the cost of the warranty!!!  So, since we drive the wheels off of cars, we will be in great shape going forward.  Really, get an additional warranty with your purchase if it is possible.  On another topic, some observations.  I am a big guy, I fill up the front seat, but this is not uncomfortable and I have driven it as far as 10 hours in one day with no suffering or ill effects.  The handling of the vehicle in snow, ice or rain is phenomenal for a small car.  Phenomenal.  I use the auto shift and move from one gear to the other myself right at 2400 rpm.  This gets you the best gas mileage.  Summer, air on, 32+/42+, fall and spring is 33+/45, dead of winter, as in under 15 degrees day after day, 31.6/42.  My drive is boring so I keep myself occupied with mpg games and metal music.  If you look at the maintenance schedule you will notice that very little needs be done, and the maintenance is very far apart too.  Love that.  To fill it up is around $20-22+.  So low.  Forget fuel cells.  Forget battery powered vehicles too.  Sit down and calculate it all, as I did, and the cost per month is almost the lowest of any car on the market.  Change the air filter once a year, don’t bother with high octane fuel, as I tested that and the economy and performance were unchanged, and buy the car.  Surprisingly, when the seats are folded forward in the rear, the car can hold a week’s worth of groceries back there!  It is really large back there I am serious.  However, if you have to people in the backseats, think again!  Short trips, sure.  But that is it.  It looks great, is fun to drive, and has tons of airbags, of course ABS and the electronic wheel control system, so there.  Not perfect, certainly not for everyone, but the fuel economy, the safety, stopping power, and the HUGE warranty make this a pick that works for me and my wife.",4
207, on 10/12/17 06:37 AM (PDT),Joel ,2012 FIAT 500 Hatchback Pop 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl 5M),A smile that lasts a lifetime," First off, my car was purchased on a whim I didn’t do any research before buying it. I didn’t need the car as I already had an suv. I was bored one day drove down to the Fiat store and the rest is history. I bought a 2015 brown fiat 500 pop. 101 hp, now it does feel underpowered in automatic mode, but I drive it in the manual mode all the time and I get better response time. So I think 101hp is manageable. I commute between towns which is about 90 miles one way. I average 36mpg on the commute! Bout $20-25 fills the tank which gets me about 364 miles give or take. The engine is stock for now, I am playing with the idea of trading it in for an Abarth. However, for what the pop offers, it’s a solid car! I use the pump under the drivers seat all the time to fill my tires with air, I love the convenience of this on board pump. Blue tooth is very handy to have when driving. I feel safe driving the car, it handles turns like a go cart! Plenty of storage with the back seat down. I fit a 55” tv in it once for a local move I made, desperate times call for desperate measures! Cup holders are a bit annoying, but it’s a small car, so I guess this is the best I’ll get out of the car. Vehicle is cheap on repairs! If your mechanically inclined like me, you can save money doing things yourself. I get comments all the time, regarding how cute it looks, or how does it handle, is it good on gas? I would for sure buy the car again! I have not been stranded once other than to replace the battery. Ac blows cold and quick, it does help to have tinted windows. I also have a VW Golf TDI, which our performs my fiat, and gets better mpg, but whenever I drive my fiat there is just this smile I get  that’s lasts a lifetime!",5

The car runs well and has not given me any engine trouble thus far. The problem with this car is that it is cheaply made. For example the first to happen was that the plastic hubcaps broke off and rolled away while I was driving it and all in a short period of time from one another. The rear view mirror started wobbling and bobbing while I was driving. We've now had to rig it to stay still. I won't touch it in fear that it will brake. The armrest has zip ties holding it in place. The ""leather"" thing to the shifter is not attached to the base anymore. And the worst thing is that the front vents to the air conditioner do not work anymore. It is like they're blocked. We have that rigged, as well, to have some air conditioning considering we live in the desert. To add to the vents not working the instrumentation for the air conditioning is faulty and now only has a choice of 2 speeds (1 and 3) and off. I cannot wait to get rid of this vehicle,  but I will be upside down on it when I trade it in because what I owe is more than what it is worth.",2

After being super unhappy with Honda, I traded in for a Fiat. As a college student who works a lot and commutes, I put a lot of miles on my cars, relatively quickly. I've had my Fiat for nearly a year and have put on about 10,000 miles on it (now has about 50k miles) and absolutely no problems so far. I don't think it's THAT comfortable of a ride, but it's not uncomfortable. I feel safe in it. It's very responsive. Stereo sounds good. I was really looking for something cost effective and it fits the bill. It costs $15-20 to fill my gas tank which I love. The only issues I have with it are minor. The bluetooth button is annoying, I don't use it and my hand always seems to hit it while steering. And the blinker is a little wonky. I'll have my blinker going left or right, take my turn, and many times it wont turn off so I'll manually put it in the middle to stop blinking, but instead, the opposite blinker goes off. I don't know if it's just my car or a known problem, but it's a pretty minor complaint. I just feel like anyone driving behind me probably thinks I'm crazy when I have my left blinker on, then right after my right blinker may turn on until I can get it to stop blinking. Otherwise, great little car with a lot more space than it looks like from the outside. I love throwing the backseats down and having tons of room. A lot of people stare at it wherever I am because there aren't a whole ton of Fiats around, which is cool. Great commuter car, I truly enjoy it and would recommend it.",4

The ONLY complaint I have, is the comfort of the seat after extended driving. Of course this could be due to my age, but I'm going to blame it on the length of the seat. The only work I have had to do on the car is the standard oil changes (get ramps, you'll need them to get under this car), new tires and the license plate light went out. That was fairly costly, as you can't just replace the bulb. The entire handle had to be replaced.

The 500 Pop is surprisingly powerful off the line, shifts smoothly, rides quietly even at 85-90 MPH, and gets great MPG. It is more roomy and comfortable up front than expected.

First off, the car  randomly powered off (the engine stopped, all the lights turned off, it just turned off!)  well making a slight left turn on a very hot day. I went to the mechanic they said it was a fluke. Next,  the car  light turned on but the car wouldn't, the engine light all of the dashboard lights turned on, but the car wouldn't start. We managed to get the car running, drove 30 miles to the dealer where we purchased this Fiat (in Ontario California),  and ritual by the mechanics to leave it overnight so they can check it out. Four days later  The dealer calls us and tells us on the car needed was a new battery (the car was still under warranty, and the battery was covered). Shortly thereafter (our warranty expired), The dashboard lights will turn on and the car had trouble starting. It was mellow at first, taking a couple of key turns to get the car running...until one day the car just stopped running. We got it to the mechanic,  this time we went to the dealership in Riverside, and they told us there was a leak, and it was dripping on the starter. They let us know it would be OK but that we needed to take care of the leak and possibly get a new starter. We drove the car home, less than 10 miles, and it completely stopped running.  Now we have to take it to get towed to the dealer, pay close to $1200 to get it fixed (and that's if they don't find any other crazy thing going on with the stupid car). Every time I see a Fiat in the freeway or on the street, I get a stomachache. This is the most unreliable car ever.",1

Worst Investment," Good afternoon all,To anyone reading this I hope this review helps you in not repeating the same mistake I have made with this affiliation. Although Fiats are cute in shape there are so many future faults. I currently own a 2012 Fiat 500c Lounge. When I purchased my car Certified Pre-owned at 23k miles I was provided with a car report which only stated car went in for routine maintenance. Fast forward to about 10k miles later I have to get a new battery, tune up etc. I thought nothing of it. I am currently at 58k miles and 8k out of warranty and my transmission light comes on randomly one day stating ""check transmission - see handbook"". I contacted the Fiat customer service (1-888.242.6342 spoke with Robin, Brenda, Mercedes & Josh -Total Calls 8) to see if they could assist with any repairs. They advised me my car history states my fiat has been sent in twice for a new radiator and once for sunroof repair (No wonder previous owner traded it in. A new radiator was installed first 2k miles no accidents just manufacture faults. I had NO prior knowledge of this issue it was never reported nor communicated to me when purchasing). Brenda, then stated they would need it to be diagnoses first to see what they can do. However, in order to do so I would need to take it into the fiat studio etc. Fiat Studio address: 196 South Dupont Highway Newcastle, DE phone no: 3023231666 service advisor: Tony - not helpful had no clue what was going on just guessing games. I was charged a total of $460 just for them to tell me an incomplete, inconsistent diagnosis (Diagnosis code P0741 had been provided to them at drop off before any work was performed - Tony said that was not helpful could mean anything. (Diagnosis means: Torque Converter Clutch Circuit Performance or Stuck Off). Since Fiat customer service said they needed additional details I told ""Tony the unhelpful"" he would need to provide additional details which is why my initial price sky rocketed from $99.95 (because I had a coupon original price $115.97) to $460. The only diagnosis I was provided was that it was a mechanical issue and repairs would be $5,975 (no lie I will never forget this number). In order to get a better understanding because I am a female and cars aren't my forte'. I asked ""Tony the Unhelpful"" what can cause these kinds of issues? He stated its a computer issue and would need rewiring. I provide this feedback to Fiat customer service  who now state since I am out of warranty theres nothing they can do. I understand that, however they should've advised me that before I went ahead and authorized Tony to do absolutely nothing but fiddle around with gadgets? The customer service gave me the impression I would be covered. I have begged, pleaded, cried, went to FCA customer service only to be directed back to Fiat customer service. I even asked that they at least cover half of the diagnosis due to useless customer service as well as mechanical faults. They continuously stated ""no"". In the mist of all of this I still remained optimistic. I continuously attempted to find the root to this problem. I thought maybe this could've have been due to water. I then contacted my insurance company who then performed an extensive investigation and stated after careful review there was no evidence of water damages - claim denied. I contacted the Fiat to advise them of this and also advise that I was told ""this is a mechanical issue"". Fiat Customer Service then states ""Carmen Chrysler Jeep Dodge"" told them my car was ""maintained poorly and it was water damaged"". (My car has a low tire thread on left side everything else is in great shape I promise). I advise the rep of this and also advise her there were no signs of water damages after my insurance performed their investigation. She then contacts shop to verify they then agree that yes in fact the only thing is the tire and confirm no water damage. Fiat still advises me there still nothing they can do since I am out of warranty. They advised that it was my fault since the tire is low it impacted my transmission. I am perfectly fine with that response. I will take full responsibility if that was indeed the case however, that was NOT the case!! After further research and second opinion from AAMCO turns out it was a system issue / computer issue - Mechanical failure the tires had absolutely NOTHING to do with this mechanical failure in fact AAMCO was $300+ cheaper (they waive diagnostic fee if you repair issue). This was all caused by a fault in the transmission so to wrap this review up my Fiat was a complete LEMON when it was first installed. I was lied to upon purchase information was never placed on carfax if it had been I would have NEVER joined the Fiat family because this is a common issue that I had no idea about until now. In conclusion, I would advise anyone seeking a fiat or even going for servicing at this location especially females to look elsewhere. For interested fiat lookers look elsewhere bad c",1

I purchased a used 2012 Fiat Pop May of 2014. In June of 2014 it needed a new purge valve solenoid and had a rotted transmission ground strap. The vehicle at that time had 54,274 miles on it. It had to go to the dealership in Johnston RI to be repaired. In December 2015 I had to replace a broken motor mount. My mechanic also stated that the control arm needs to be replaced. He called the dealership in Johnston RI and was told the parts on the 2012 control arm had been replaced with what the 2013 Fiat has because of poor engineering and that we would have to buy 2 lower ball joints, axles and knuckle bearings. The cost 1,800 not including labor. He asked if it was a recall and was told it was not. They advised him that if the vehicle was still under warranty and under 60,000 miles they would cover it. My anger comes from that vehicle would have been covered had the dealership done the right thing when the car was there in 2014. They knew at that time those parts were faulty. January I broke down and needed to be towed because of the Alternator and battery. February I need a thermostat, sensor and housing. What next???? I called Fiat to complain and all they could say over and over again “The cost of parts denied and the vehicle is out of warranty””!!!! I'm not asking about reimbursement on all the other repairs. They just need to do the right thing and stand behind the faulty parts when they knew it was an issue. Not to mention you can only get the parts from the dealership and they are rude and difficult to deal with. The cost I just shelled out for the alternator 389.70 and battery 155.69. Total for that repair with labor 741.98. I purchased the vehicle for 9,000 after my trade in. I am so angry I just want to get rid of this vehicle but can’t. I still owe 6,000 on it and when I looked up the Kelly blue book the car is worth 3,000. All I want is for them to repair this control arm issue with no cost to me and they won’t!!!!! Learn from me and before you buy do lots of research. The parts are very expensive and the dealership and customer service are sneaky and very rude to deal with.",2
222, on 01/24/16 08:48 AM (PST),KenN ,2012 FIAT 500 Hatchback Sport 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl 5M),Coming up on 4 yrs of ownership," Love the car, but hate the quality - and depreciation.  Purchased new for HS graduate in May 2012.  Rear bumper reflector just dropped off randomly - covered under warranty.  Shift knob top broke off - covered under warranty.  Steering clunk - tightened but not replaced with correct new intermediate shaft under warranty - clunk is back, but now 2 thousand miles out of warranty.  Arm rest broke - cushion fell off - fixed my self with gorilla glue.  Sun roof does not work - and pealed paint on strip in front of sun roof ( for over 20 months ) - but out of warranty - as I had no access to car since daughter had it at college.  I am deathly afraid the clutch will die per other reviews - we have 54000 miles on the car.  I do my own oil and filter changes as dealership service shop is only open during week and my daughter only comes home on weekends.  Having said all that - the car is fun to drive with great brakes and decent enough acceleration for a guy who grew up in a time when zero to 60 in 10 seconds was considered fast.  I asked dealership to make me an offer for trade in to purchase a used car off the lot ( Korean or Japanese ) - and even they don't want the car.  NO offer.  Paid 21K for it and now worth less than 7 K I expect for trade in.  The Bose stereo is awesome.   Gas mileage driving highway is above 38 mpg at 75 mph, so decent - but bigger cars get that now days.  Would I buy again - no - way - ... will I keep it - probably will take it over and keep as 3rd car.I'm 6 foot 2 and just barely stay under the (broken) sunroof - so I can live with it - driving position is strange, but I am used to it.  I like the car - I hate the quality and/or lack of responsibility by Fiat / Chrysler for standing behind the product for the following issues - Steering rack clunk / Paint peeling / arm rest - can't comment on the Sun Roof other than I read it was glued in from the interior and there is no way I'm paying for that repair.",3

It drives GREAT, when it's working but I live in the U.P. of Michigan.  Hard winters are common and the car doesn't have much clearance (which I knew purchasing the car and wasn't worried).  However, the digital displays do not work after 20 degrees (and in the winter that is normally -20 degrees).  25 minutes is usually how long i had to run the car to warm up the car enough for the digital displays to work properly (which wouldn't be bad except the accurate speedometer is digital).   When I first logged on to their online service/maintenance report- I had seen that it was in for electrical work (I believe) twice, and did not think anything of it at the time.  However, around Thanksgiving of that same year I had to send my car to the car dealership in Traverse City for work to be done.  I did not get my car back until late December 2015 because the parts were out of stock.  The customer service department was very nice about the delay, and towing to the customer service department was paid by the Fiat brand because it was under warranty (I paid for bridge tolls $50.00).  I had to make arrangements to get a ride to Traverse City to pick up my car because they were going to charge me to bring it back. The dealership in this area that sold me the car, Fernelius Hyundai, would not help me in the slightest besides giving me a lender car for three days around Thanksgiving- they said it was my problem and I should be thankful for their generosity. When I received my car it worked fine, but then in February of 2015 the same thing happened again.  I received free towing to Traverse City, and I had to pay bridge tolls again.  This time customer service in Traverse City said they couldn't find the problem, but it seemed to be working fine (my theory was that since it is warmer in Traverse City they didn't have the same issue). Now it is January 2016, we had a warmer than normal winter.  AGAIN, I have the same problem with my Fiat.  I again will have to send it down to Traverse City to get it worked on, however, I don't believe it will fall under the 4 year warranty/50,000 miles.  This means I will probably have to pay for the towing and bridge tolls out of pocket.I cannot in good mind sell my car.I believe Fernelius Hyundai knew of these problems. I no longer have access to the previous service records on my car that I can tell.  I believe I have no protection in this but want to try. I can't believe there isn't a recall on my 2012 Fiat after having the same problem YEARLY.",3

It's a 2012 Pop 500, which is now three years old. Last January, I got in it to go to work one morning, and could not get it into gear. This baffled me, as it was perfectly fine the day before. Turns out, I had to have it towed to the dealership and they claimed that a bearing wore out in the clutch kit and an entirely new clutch kit had to be installed. At that time, the car was two - I've NEVER heard of such a thing and was horrified! The service manager was vary vague in answering any questions. Fast forward to this Holiday weekend...my daughter and I were headed out for breakfast in honor of my Birthday, when suddenly, the 'new' clutch blows in the middle of a busy city street, leaving us stranded with people honking and waving their arms madly behind us. This time, the car was stuck in first gear, the clutch would not engage and I was in a panic. We finally managed to push it out of traffic to a safe spot to wait for the tow truck. The kicker this time is that my beloved dealership, where I bought the car and have had it faithfully serviced for three years is closing it's doors on Monday!!! This left me having my car towed 15 miles south to a huge dealership that I've never dealt with before, whose online reviews for service are nothing short of appalling. Let me recap by saying that I thought I selected my car very carefully. I have absolutely loved an adored it, even though I've replaced both headlights (they are not cheap!) and tail lights and more hubcaps than I can count by now. I can live with those petty annoyances, but what really concerns me is that I have 16 months left to pay on this car, and the THIRD clutch is being installed this week. For the record, I baby my car, and most certainly do not beat up on my clutch. In fact, I'm hoping how someone can explain how a bearing gets sheared off, resulting in a brand new kit being installed, then the clutch plate gives way in the brand new kit, 10 months later. Looks like I'll be trading in my car as soon as it's paid off! I lack the words to express how incredibly disappointed I am. The WHOLE reason I bought a brand new car was so that I did not have to deal with maintenance problems like this. VERY, VERY POORLY DONE, FIAT!",3

Since day 1, the dashboard isn't happy unless there is an indicator light on! It's always something wrong with the car, things that should hardly ever go wrong. The headlamps are always needing repair. It's a three year old car and already I've had the engine worked on 3 times, all lights replaced, a new airconditioner put in, the starter went out and that was over $500.00 in repairs, and most recently the gear switch cord broke...another $500.00 repair. I'm afraid to drive it and unfortunately I still have 2-3 years of payments to make on this car. I'm so very sad I trusted the good reviews and the commercials saying how great the car is. As far as fuel consumption..I pay just as much as if I had a larger car. I bought the car to help save money, help support dealers in in America and to have an economical car while I'm going through a low paying job transition and it has made me late with all my bills because of always needing repairs.

The Fiat 500 is an urban vehicle by definition. It is half the size and weight of a Ford F 150. The Fiat 500 works good for its design purpose. The five speed transmission (manual) is as smooth shifting as they come.I have had a speaker blow out in one of the doors. The Blue and Me full functions are a joke as the program only works for Microsoft phones.  Visibility is excellent.  The doors are very wide making getting in and out easy. And finally, the car always has a smile on the grill.I notice time and again people smiling back at the car and children turning around for a second look. The Fiat 500 is fun to drive.UPDATE: While getting my oil changed at the Fiat dealer a red with bright green wheels Fiat Pop 500 came into the service center. The owner needed a new wiper blade. His car had 123,000 miles on it with no major problems.--> At 19000 miles transmission pressure plate and transmission synchro started to fail and I got a factory recall notice for a problem related to clutch failures. My Fiat 500 Pop was a cute car but I traded it. I replaced it with a 2016 KIA Rio and a 100000 mile, 10 year warranty.  My Fiat days are over.<--Safety: The little Fiat places the vehicle occupants in serious danger in a rear end collision as there is nothing to crumple.

Due to the wide trunk we are actually able to fit a lot in the back of my fiat with the back seats down including our lawn mower. I have had to replace my windshield several times due to rocks hitting the windshield while driving in highways due to fiat being so low to ground. I also think the windshield glass is not strong as the rocks were not too big and I was far from the trucks. Another issue I had was my hubcabs continuously fall off, I paid for two and then decided to stop paying for them and have had one missing for 9 months now as I refuse to pay for another. The clock in my car is always wrong, small detail yes but annoying, as I have fixed it to the correct time a dozen times and it weirdly keeps going back to 7 minutes behind schedule. The inside of the car is very hard to clean including the steering wheel and dashboard due to the texture and different finishes. It either doesnt clean it at all or leaves streaks, I have tried a bunch of different cleaning products at this point. The ride is beyond bumpy, my friends who have ridden in the car have stated that it feels like they are on a carnival ride. The back seats are not comfortable at all and not full side seats, so if you want that dont get a fiat. The front seat  surprisingly has a lot of leg room per my husband. The car is easy to drive and park and gets great gas mileage. I have people asking me about my car and peering in the window all the time.

I got a great deal on the new car but the trade in on my 2012 Fiat Pop was really low due to issues pertaining to the clutch and the engine noise.  After reading some other reviews I am apparently not the only one with these issues.  Someone else had to get a new clutch under 40,000 and mine has only 34,000. Also another review complained about changing spark plugs and their costs at an early mileage. I just had to replace mine. The engine noise just got so loud in the last few months - out of nowhere.  Service kept telling me it is a Fiat.? Again in another review the engine noise gave them a headache. Then there is the electrical.  Tire monitor light went on after 15,000, some sort of electrical problem.  I had the same problem mentioned in a review. I was constantly checking my air pressure.  Service couldn't help. They just would check the air pressure and say it is fine.  I had to replace both headlights at 34,000, also mentioned in another review and of course replacing the hub caps two or three times a year at $55.00 a piece.  Hope I have better luck with the 500L.

This was 2 years ago and it had 36,000 miles on it. (Found out it had been a former rental car...in Las Vegas). The only reason I chose this one was it was the only used automatic they had (I can drive a manual but in L.A. I choose not to).  Electrical problems from the start. Warning lights always coming on (Check engine). Half the time they couldn't say what was wrong. For a couple months the car went to service every other week. Finally got that to stop then one day I turn on the car and the mileage was blinking. Again to the shop for resetting. I took my car in for an oil change a couple weeks ago and was told it had a leak (somewhere where they needed to drop out the engine). $89 for parts. Over $1k for labor. (Not had it done). This past Friday I pushed the button to lower my drivers window and heard a thunk. Window dropped an inch and has stayed there. Getting it fixed today. Thankfully (without being consulted when I bought the car) I somehow ended up with the extended warranty - Maximum Care. So the window will be just $100 (deductible). Going to find out if the oil leak is covered as well. I wanted to trade in the car for a new 500L since they contacted me looking for 2012 Pops. Too much negative equity. Well no kidding. This thing had negative equity when I bought it. Kicking myself for not buying the brand new Toyota Prius C that I test drove at another dealership. As soon as I can this car is gone!",3

Bought it because it was adorable, inexpensive, and great for my city-street/low-speed commute (which is now a freeway commute). Here is my take on the car:The GOOD: Cute as heck. Verde Chiaro color still turns heads. Good little car for putting around town (grocery-getter) on city streets. Brakes are responsive. Storage space in the car is about what you expect - not a lot of room but with a little bit of tetris skills you can fit a lot. Decent gas mileage (I expected better for a car so small).The BAD: I fear for my life on the freeway - no joke - and I am a very good driver who has never had an accident. Blind spots galore! Acceleration is extremely unreliable - sometimes you give it gas and it reluctantly goes slowly, other times the engine revs but it sits there... So if you need to make an evasive maneuver that requires accelerating, hit the gas and hope for the best. Engine noise gives me a headache. Interior shows scratches easily. My tire pressure monitor sensor stopped working at 15k (I haven't the time during the week to have it taken care of since the dealer won't do anything other than oil changes on Saturdays). My boyfriend said it's like a beer can on wheels and worries about my safety every day. Must use 91 octane or better gas for best performance. Doesn't always start on the first turn (Fiat said this is normal for this engine - ???).I foolishly accepted a lease term longer than I wanted and am almost done but am seriously considering eating the penalties for turning it in early. Especially since it looks like it is prone to having more mechanical issues that I would be responsible for.",2

My car suddenly was undriveable (a potential safety issue), it was stranded 200 miles from my home, it cost $1200 out of my pocket to repair and over $300 in rental car fees to get home and then get back to pick up the car. This at less then 40K miles. ",3.125

I bought it one year used with 11,000 miles on it. It's now 28,000 at miles and it's had problems with everything from cosmetic issues like peeling paint, to an air bag sensor failure, to a very serious no-warning clutch failure (which was not covered under warranty after 15,000 miles). The clutch replacement at a FIAT dealer has taken 10 days so far and is costing a small fortune. It's a fun car but just not holding up!

I have had a 1974 124 Sport, which was fun as could be to drive. I owned a 1980 Fiat 2000 Spider convertible ( also known as a 124). That was  a blast to drive. I went through a midlife crisis and got another 1981 Fiat Spider convertible, this will always put a smile on your face, something about the top down and the wind in your hair and face. Forward to the 2012 Fiat 500C Pop, what a great design to put a cloth retractable top inside the roof pillars, much safer and way cooler. The car rides and feels like a big car, it is very solid and sure footed. I am 6 foot 1 and have plenty of room and I find the front seating extremely roomy and comfortable. I always sit in the back whenever i purchase a vehicle to see how much headroom and legroom my less fortunate passengers will have. While i am an empty nester, i tend to flop the rear seats down and create a nice little cargo hauling area that is very practical for hauling my two dogs around or for groceries. I bought my car used with 20,000 miles on it in 2014, i have since put 60,000 miles with regular oil changes and tire rotations. i have changed my own spark plugs twice, which is fairly simple, as is changing the air filter and cabin filter.  I purchased an aftermarket warranty, but I have never needed to use it. There was a recall on a manual clutch spring replacement, where they also have to replace the brake sensor, but that was covered under the recall. I am sad that the cars do not hold their resale value, but I believe that the 500 C model was done correctly. I know there have been alot of complaints with the 500 L 4 door, but that is a different engine and model altogether. I love my 500C Pop convertible manual transmission. If you dont know about manual transmissions, they are the best kept secret. They are a lot more fun to drive. You are more involved with the driving experience and that is what you are doing driving! therefore one tends to pay more attention. I spoke with a used car salesman recently and he stated that he specifically bought a manual transmission vehicle for his daughter.... Because she would not be able to text and drive!  She was initially upset.. but she thanked him later for this. Something to think about. I have had my Fiat up to 101 MPH and it rides the same at all speeds, 50-70 is the perfect speed for this vehicle, I cant stress enough ,  the big car feel. This is something American cars are getting better at, but I honestly do not know if I will ever buy American. I have owned several German cars and brands and there is nothing quite like their feel for the road, however reliablity and parts and pricing is a different story.  I have owned Japanese and Korean and found them to be the most reliable. To make a long story short, on a beautiful day with the top down and a nice day trip planned with you and that special someone, I highly reccomend that you take the route less traveled in the vehicle (Fiat 500C Pop, Manual) less driven. You will not be disappointed. Just do your homework and check the car fax maintenance records.  Good solid car, great gas mileage, unlimited smiles and Italian sexy.",5
271, on 09/05/17 13:59 PM (PDT),Ed the Fiat Owner ,2012 FIAT 500 Convertible C Lounge 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl 5M),"Endearing, comfortable, reliable but quirky"," This purchase was for fun, a cheeky weekend companion with a full-length cloth sunroof. Yet the 500c is incredibly convenient for any drive that requires a parking spot hunt or urban commute. Heated leather seats are upright and comfortable, its good sound system and Sport driving mode make it more engaging. Top down, it makes me smile and the multiple positions for the top allow as much nature into the care as I choose. Loud exterior sounds are muted when the insulated top is closed, and it's remained secure and waterproof. The trunk opening is narrow, but reasonably sized for groceries and gym bags. The engine sounds a bit agricultural, but it scoots along. Fog lights are helpful, and the A/C is powerful. Gas mileage reflects my eagerness to toss the car around, and the visibility with the top down is poor. Switchgear puts style over ergonomics, but I love the use of color and materials. The plastic on the doors feels cheap and shows scuff marks; Fiat's 1957 Edition uses a different design. My only issues in six years: resets of the top mechanism (the fix is thoroughly described in the manual), a squeaky seat frame, a low front end that scrapes on some speed bumps, and a battery failure. Overall, fewer trips to the dealer than my Honda and Toyota!",5

The Fiat 500c seemed the perfect fit, literally - my son is  6' 5"" and he slipped right in to the driver's seat with ease. There was plenty of head and leg room, once the tilt wheel and seat were adjusted. This car handles extremely well and is very tight on turns. What surprised me was the amount of interior space - the outside appearance is deceiving, as once you get inside, it is a well distributed area for 4 people.  Equally so is the trunk space, which provides a deep, larger-than-expected compartment for all kinds of storage.  Even better is the feature of the split rear seat, which folds down and allows for larger items to fit from the folded down seat to the trunk space.  Very smooth ride - takes those bumps in the road really well which reflects a good suspension system. Plus, it's a convertible !!  What's better than that?  Although I have firmly told my son that he is not to put the top down and stand up while driving, with his feet on the wheel....!   Also comes with some nice options like a 7-speaker Bose sound system, fog lights, hands-free Blue-tooth phone system, heated seats and special chrome trim that comes with the ""Lounge"" (high end) model.  It is a great little car that is super on gas and a blast to drive - my son loves it.  Life is too short, and for a car in this price range, loosen up and go grab some fun.  You won't be sorry!",5

The back seat was occasional used (sometime by me) by adults with no difficulty as long as the passenger seat was move forward a little.

I've been told that some people love them......but I think it's a standard answer for those who already have them.   I was teased by acquaintances who suggested I put the Fiat in the back of their car.    My wife, me and two suitcases were hard to squeeze into it!

The seats are sporty and the fabric feels robust.  Racing Stripes, Racing stripes!  How did they get inside my car again?  The seats have a single red stripe going longways, I'll keep em.  I use this car to commute through city streets and park it on the curb.  Those big rims will get scratched, hail will damage the steel roof and eventually someone will drive their car into my car followed by driving their car away.  Such is life.  This is a more fragile car than anything I've had, the intercoolers are in the edges of the front bumper, meaning a fender bender will cost f$ht dollars.  The brake calipers are within fingers reach of any passerby.  Putting new tires on will scratch the rims very badly if you don't go out of your way to find a specialty shop.

A Camry or an Accord are for everyone, and when you make something to please as many people as possible you end up with middle of the road blandness. That's great for some, not for Abarth owners. This is a performance car based on a relatively humble small European city car, originally designed for dense urban areas. So, yeah, if you have 5 kids and two dogs, guess what? It's not a car for you. If you like space, fuel and technological efficiency, are concerned of your footprint on the planet but really like to drive, then an Abarth may be for you. It oozes character, it sounds fantastic and I love that it doesn't look like it's angry and wants to kill you, like so many other cars on the market. It's actually pretty comfortable for long trips, and despite its compact exterior dimensions, it has a lot of space, more than a Mini. I'm 5'-10"" and 190lbs and I can sit comfortably in the rear seat behind myself. It's easy to park and cheap to fill the tank, and no one get s annoyed at you when you pass them. Try doing that in a BMW or Mercedes.I considered a Ford Fiesta ST, but was turned off by the four door-only bodystyle, and although objectively it was a tad more refined than the Abarth in some areas, it just didn't feel special, and certainly wasn't as much fun to drive. The quality of materials is not on par with say, a Lexus, but then it doesn't cost Lexus money. I've had mine for two years and the only issues I've had were a burned out light bulb in the cruise control switch and a faulty tire pressure monitoring sensor. Nothing squeaks or rattles.

I was an hour from home in Feb on a freezing day with an infant in the car, but when I my husband arrived the car started and he drove it home like nothing had happened.  Sixteen months later, the car died dead again while driving near the beach, this time I had AAA and had it towed to the dealer.  Gone nearly 2 weeks and they just replaced the alternator & battery.  After that the car would no longer start on first turn of ignition but roared to life on second try... but six weeks later would not start at all.  Almost 2 weeks at dealer as they replaced the starter.  Two months later, it still won't start on first turn of ignition and it has randomly refused to start at all 3 times in the past month.  If I move the shift, open/close door, step on brake and go thru antics it starts, usually after I have called AAA to come get me and have to call them back to cancel the tow.  I have had it.

Was warned might come on again. It did. Took to home dealership. Was taken care of. You cannot compare this car to other outside its segment. So, for all the people that complain about how small it is and that its not safe on the freeway, then why did you buy one. Means that you didn't check it out to see if it met your needs. DUH. As for me I love this little Abarth. By the way I suggest buying into MOpar's extended warrenty IS A GOOD INVESTMENT. If your concern is everything falls apart after factory warrenty expires. Most car's do have issues here or there. Why do u think the manufactured brands only go so far with their warranties. side skirts detachment  had become an issue. Fiat took care of problem. Still think it is more fun & better than Cooper S Clubman I had. Seats way more comfortable.  Handles better. Sounds great. Everything remains the same as it maintains the fun factor.

At the same time as the computer going out the service department stated the steering was in need of repair at a cost of nearly $300, at this time I have yet to repair the steering and am driving it as is since the service person said it wouldn't keep me from safe driving.",4

It drives and handles so much better with more than enough power and much more connected. The soundtrack from the exhaust is phenomenal, has to be the best stock soundtrack out there. Fuel mileage is consistently 33-34mpg. I use premium seeing as it's turbo charged. My Prima averaged 36-38 mpg. Love driving this car. It's a blast. Looking forward to the Abarth convertible!",4.75

While looking at the Sport model, this Abarth was left behind by the original buyer. I snapped it up as I overheard him declining to buy it after ordering it. Let's see, this car goes like stink, gets phenomenal gas mileage (I'm averaging 38 on the highway at 75 mph), looks like nothing else, is built well, is very uncommon, is surprisingly comfortable on any sort of trip, has standard options that most cars would not in this price range, has an exhaust that makes a Ferrari jealous, and it's priced perfectly. Abarth is like the Carroll Shelby of the 500 world. They took something that was nearly perfect and made it perfect. ",4.875
306, on 01/11/18 06:35 AM (PST),Jeff Brown ,2016 FIAT 500 Hatchback Lounge 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl 5M),It's a conspiracy," Fiat is very popular in Europe and that success enabled them to buy Chrysler motors. These days cars are mostly built well and if maintained properly will provide good service, why not drive a car that looks good doing it? I think people tend to abuse a small sporty car like the 500 and then give a bad review, NEWS FLASH! Even though it sounds like one, driving it like a Ferrari In Affordable Trim is a mistake. Driving this car feels like you're going faster than you actually are so you needn't abuse it to get the fun Italian sports car feel. That in itself is my daily reminder of why I bought a Fiat, but in all honesty I bought it for it's super cute looks, I think the bad reviews are unfounded and highly recommended Fiat despite them.",5

When it came around to buying a new car, I was more inclined to Fiat because the bang-for-the-buck factor- I tell people that constantly, and it's one of the reasons I recommend Fiat so much. How many brand new cars can you get for less than $20k, taxes and fees included? Not many. One of my favorite things about my 2016 Fiat 500 Easy is the turning radius. The smaller size of the car combined with the tight-turning ability allows me to make a U-turn in the tightest of spaces with ease. It's zippier than I thought it would be too! I decided against the Sport and Abarth because I don't personally need the extra power (that, and it might be tempting), but the acceleration is just fine and SO MUCH FUN. Another one of my favorite features is the space inside- I recently went on a 6-hour road trip with a passenger, dog, 1 luggage, and a dog bed and we all fit wonderfully. Just fold the back seats down and bam, you basically have a mini SUV. I'm still surprised at how well this car handles in snow and rain. It's not GREAT in snow, but I was pleasantly surprised for how well it did in 2-5 inches. In rain it's fine, however I do find going over the large, unavoidable puddle to be terrifying because this car is small and light. However, it feels good to drive- what I mean is although the car itself feels light in snow and rain, it is SOLID. Whether you're driving or in the backseat, Fiat's feel like quality vehicles to be in. The interior is beautiful with the houndstooth fabric seats, comfortable, high quality, and durable. Sure, the backseat isn't the greatest for comfort as the seats are slightly firm, but it's better than you'd think. It's quiet, gets great gas mileage and is a smooth ride. My only negatives are that in cold weather it takes a long time to warm up, and the blindspot when looking over your shoulder at odd angled intersections is bad. Overall, the style, the drive, price, comfort/interior make me love this car so much. I highly recommend.",5

The only car immediately available was a Fiat 500 with automatic.  We took it.  On a 100 mile road trip to the event venue, the car proved to be more than adequate to the task.  While acceleration was slow, once at speed the car maintained interstate speeds without trouble.  We drove 80 and even 85mph, passing many more powerful cars.  If you know how to drive a small engine, this thing will do the job.  It was comfortable for two and luggage space was adequate for a long weekend trip.",4

I ended up purchasing the 2016 Easy, because there was one in a color I liked at the closest dealership.  This model is an extremely affordable way to have a convertible, manual transmission, cruise control, great climate control, and bluetooth (U connect is super user friendly, I've never had a vehicle with bluetooth and started using it the day I bought the car).  I have enjoyed shifting gears in my 500C IMMENSELY, and I'm sure the experience is similar in the 2017 Pop.  I honestly don't miss all the extras the lounge offers, because I'm not a fan of leather seats (freezing in the winter when I leave for work around 6:20 A.M.).  I also love the simple knobs for A/C and heat, as well as the interior air filter, etc.  The design of the interior is simple and intuitive.  Plus, the 500C offers the best of both worlds in practicality and owning a convertible.",5

I’ve owned mine for 3 years and almost 40k miles and it’s been one of the best cars and nearly trouble free I’ve ever owned. It is definitely a little beast to barrel around town in yet it’s also really comfortable. I don’t truly understand how that is even possible, but I can drive several hundred miles on road trips and still have a good time and it’s relatively smooth and comfy all things considered! 🚙🚙🚙🚗🚗🚗",5
311, on 04/04/17 15:54 PM (PDT),Brian Ach ,2016 FIAT 500 Abarth Abarth 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),My angry little car," Here's the thing--there are a lot of cars with more room, better build quality, more cache, better reliability, and more room. There are cars that have way more updated electronics, navigation, etc. and are more functional in terms of rear seat space, ergonomics and the like. None of them will be more fun than this car. None of them will make you smile, laugh, look forward to driving them, talk to people about them, or write a review. The Abarth (mine is a 2016 automatic in yellow) puts fun first and functionality second, but don't take that to mean it's a toy or not a good everyday car. The automatic is a hoot (I own three other stick shift cars including a Porsche 911 in NYC) and blips the throttle with a roarty exhaust backfire when you get on the brakes. It pulls hard in point-and-squirt traffic when in ""Sport"" mode (the only mode you should be in) and hugs off-ramps like velcro to wool. It's fun. No one looks twice at your Mini Cooper S or your GTI. I catch people looking at this yellow bee all the time. The amazing thing is how good the ride is. Short wheelbase and stiff springs don't add up to comfort, but on the highway and terrible pavement, those dual-mode shocks work their magic and it is amazing. Seriously. Front seat space is good, visibility is great (a by-product of the high seating position) and when you fold the rear seats down (or delete them) it's like the world's smallest SUV. It's as much car as you want, but no more car than you need 94% of the time. Can humans fit in the back? Better than you think...but it's tight. Can I park anywhere? Yes. Do what I did--find a used one with less than 5K miles on it, with a full factory warranty, let someone else take the depreciation hit, and drive off into the sunset. Does the exhaust sound better than a Ferrari? Yes. Is it fast? Not really, no. Does it know it? No. It's like the chihuahua who thinks it's a Pit Bull, but it's tongue-in-cheek. It's fun. It's probably just what you need.",4
312, on 08/03/18 12:09 PM (PDT),RoniSue Lee ,2015 FIAT 500 Hatchback Pop 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl 5M),"Sufficient, efficient, and cute!"," I drove a mini-SUV before this, and it seemed ridiculous to cart that much vehicle around just to and from work (7 mi. each way). I went ""minimalist"" with the Fiat Pop and I love it, so far! I get twice the gas mileage, I love the big windows and having such a great view of the parameters of my car. I'm 5'1"" tall, with very short legs. This car fits me well, but there is a lot of leg room to work with for those who are taller. I have planned a couple of large events, and everything I needed, including two coolers worth of food, fit in the back, with room to spare. I love fitting into tight parking spots with ease, and I love the look of this little car! NO REGRETS, truly! I will offer these considerations for others, though: the ride is noisy compared to my SUV which offered a nearly-silent ride, I have to turn up my radio to hear it over my AC, the road, etc., and making phone calls on bluetooth is ok, unless I'm on a really noisy road and blasting the A/C, then I have to really turn up the phone volume and yell a bit, to have a clear conversation. The tools for tracking trip miles, setting the clock, etc. are not intuitive, and the owner's manual is only minimally helpful for these. I see what professional reviewers mean when they say this car isn't as ""powerful"" in it's normal mode as other cars, but I don't need a crazy amount of power. Mine drives fine on the freeway, and if there's heavy traffic and I feel like I might need to do some extra lane changing, passing, or maneuvering, the ""Sport"" mode gives me everything I need. I like getting great mpg, so I only use that when I'm in heavy freeway traffic. Otherwise, the car drives comfortably enough for me at 65 mph without Sport mode. When I shift from reverse to drive, after backing out of my driveway, I have to give the car a second before I accelerate or I will sometimes get a slight delay when I hit the gas. It's not bad, and I've adjusted to this, it's just something to note if you're a demanding driver who can't wait a second. I'm truly happy when driving this little car, I gladly choose it over the bigger gas hog I used to drive, I love the eco/minimalist values it fits with for me, and I'm happy to be seen with it, even at work where people are judged by such things. If you want a tiny car, you're a safe driver, and you like keeping things kind of simple, get one of these! I have no regrets!",4

I had the worst experience with a certified FIAT dealership, LITHIA Dodge in Las Cruces New Mexico, 2 hours away from where I live, for a safety recall on the clutch on my perfectly functioning car. The awful service caused my clutch to fail completely. It left me stranded on the highway miles from home. I had to push it off the road and have it towed to my house. We fought with FIAT to have it towed back, possibly to another dealership, but FIAT instead towed it back to the same one. It took 2 weeks after that to have my car repaired. Two week of calls with no return calls or information from FIAT to know what was going on. We gave them phone numbers and email, but it was my husband and me who had to contact them to get ANY information.  The case manager misrepresented some information, that our case was going to be escalated and that never happened. Nobody cared that I lost three days of work without pay and initially they told me that I could rent a car and ask for a ""possible"" return. The customer service is plain awful. I hate to say it, but I regret buying a FIAT.  I used to love my little car, but now I can't trust it anymore.",1
319, on 08/20/16 21:36 PM (PDT),Kirsten ,2015 FIAT 500 Hatchback Turbo 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),"500 Turbo - anti-Yaris, anti-Fit, anti-boring."," The 500 turbo - slotting in between the non-turbo models on the low-end, and more powerful turbo Abarth model on the high end, is definitely a bit of a ""goldilocks"" fit for people interested in commuting. This is my second FIAT purchased new, and I'm generally pretty pleased with the car. My one modification is the exhaust system like that of the Abarth - a loud, open exhaust. This car will turn heads because of the sound - in a good way (it doesn't sound like a fart-can Civic from Fast and the Furious, but more like the sensational Alfa Romeo 4C). In any case, this car is a competent handler once you get used to the high-riding seats. It's easy to drive in stop-and-go traffic with simple hydraulic clutch that has nice progressive engagement, and a snappy five-speed stick with fairly close ratios. If you're nice, this is a car easily capable of beating it's EPA ratings, especially on the freeway, where I've seen averages approach 45mpg. And even if you're naughty, you're still going to struggle to do worse than 25mpg city which is great fuel economy for a turbocharged car with a close-ratio gearbox being driven inefficiently. With the seats folded you're going to be able to carry plenty of groceries, and even with them up, you can fit luggage for two on a weekend getaway. Yes, the newer Fiats can stream audio over bluetooth and have infotainment stuff, but that's not the point of this car. What this thing is is simple: it's the cheapest performance-oriented turbo car for sale in the US, and it's a real driver's car. Your money is buying not just the 240,000rpm turbo which pushes 15-18psi of boost, but you're getting a forged crankshaft and pistons, with oil sprayers to keep those pistons cool. You get twin intercoolers, an upgraded transmission, and the most notable thing - upgraded brakes (bigger rotors, performance pads). The brakes are among the grabbiest and firmest you'll find in anything for sale for less than $40,000. They are probably the best brakes, period, on a car that stickers for < $20k. All of this makes for a compelling little car that wants you to be happy and have fun. If you look at a grey Yaris, or silver Fit and think that cars like that are a punishment, this is the car you want. It's a pitbull puppy that wants to tear the face off of your coworker's Fiesta. It wants you to take the backroads and have a laugh. It doesn't take itself too seriously, and reminds you to live life and have fun. Now, a final word about these cars: in the same way that they're not boring Honda or Toyota products in the ways mentioned above, they are very Italian in one other way - they need a little TLC. Mine has had a few little things (power window motor needing adjustment, bluetooth software issues) dealt with under warranty. If you look at other reviews, people seem to lose their cool about this stuff, which is unfortunate because it can happen with any car. Especially if you decide to buy a turbo car (any turbo car, not just a Fiat), be aware that maintenance matters a lot more, as does paying attention to things like fluids. Turbo cars like the Fiat may use a little oil (consume, not leak)  between oil changes - it's a good idea to keep an eye on it. The sticky Pirelli tires that come on this car from the factory aren't going to last 50,000 miles like the crappy eco tires on the Yaris. But if you love cars, and are willing to spend a little extra effort and patience loving this one, it's get to to 50,000 smiles, guaranteed.update 02.26.2018: my car has not had any significant mechanical faults, but I have had two dealership visits for warranty-related service. The first replaced a leaking radiator hose; this is a fairly common issue with these cars. Not a big deal, just got it repaired and was on my way.The second was an ECU electrical fault whereby the car was throwing check engine lights repeatedly for misfires, etc., when there was no actual mechanical fault. They reflased the ECU after doing a lot of diagnostics to rule out any mechanical problem, and no mechanical problem was found. Fiat of Albuquerque does great work, and they do it efficiently!Beyond that: new tires at 21k miles and 41k miles. New front brakes (wear related) at 37k mi. New spark plugs at 32k mi; really important for a turbo car. Given that it's a performance-oriented car and I am driving with high performance tires, slotted brakes, etc., this car has been really cheap to maintain. :)",5

Perfect for in town and work commutes.  I'm married with no kids and our other auto is a mazda CX-5, so storage or backseat space aren't an issue for me because I can take the Mazda when I need it.  If the Fiat will be your principle vehicle I suggest giving some consideration to your stuff and people transporting needs, as it's not equipped for much.  Having said that though, I'm a big dude who is high waisted (long torso and short legs :( and I fit just fine in the front seat.  Also, I recently gave my teenaged niece and her two friends a ride across town and they said it they were fine.  I wouldn't plan on stuffing full grown adults back there though.     The 500 offers three power/speed levels: base (101 hp), turbo (135hp) & Abarth (160hp).  I tested all three and found the Goldilocks fit with the midlevel turbo.  It's speedy but not as noisy or tightly wound suspension-wise as the Abarth.  Some days I wish I'd bought the Abarth, but then I quickly remind myself I'm not 25 anymore and can get a speeding ticket almost as easily in the Turbo.  It's definitely got pep, and as I understand it, is the same drivetrain as the Abarth, just detuned for 25 fewer hp.  Bluetooth and HVAC systems work well.  The Beats stereo system isn't quite as powerful as I expected, but it sounds great and again, I'm not 25 anymore, so extra loud music with extra thumping bass probably isn't good for me anyway :)  As sub-compacts go this thing has plenty of personality. If you're in the sub-compact market, definitely check out the 500.",5

The 500 is efficient, easy to park and peppy with the 5-speed.  Plenty of room for 2 and I am a big guy.  This little car brakes and drives well.  It was not built for acceleration so even with a 5-speed is not fast but adequate.  My last car of this size was the Ford Fiesta ST which was more cramped had a horrible ride quality although much faster.  The car seems to perform better on premium grade fuel.  At a 10 gallon capacity on the tank it will not break your wallet to by better gas and performance is much improved.  I had a hick up with the blue tooth system in the car after the install of Apple 9.3 on my phone. I just disconnected the battery cable for 10 minutes and the system reset itself.  If you want fun and style this is a great car.  Space is limited for more than 2 adults and so is storage.

As a car guy who just came from a 300hp car, it takes some getting use to,  but, once you realize how much better the mpgs are (36-40highway)  and the handling improvement, it's actually more fun to drive than my 12 challenger. It has torque so going up bridges and hills is actually easier than other cars.  The interior style is a great way to be received everyday.

Three years later I still have He same love/hate relationship with my car. Let's talk about the cons first, 1. Cup holder are not practically laid out in the front of the car two large drinks cannot sit next to each other. 2. Car feels a bit under powered, however if you drive the automatic in the standard mode it does much better! You can buy the Abarth and have more power, but if you have a pop like me just switch from auto to the standard mode and you will be fine. I tinted my windows to limo tint, it makes a huge difference in the summmer! I don't have to run my AC on high, which allows me to conserve on fuel. Let's talk about the positives! 1. Small and economical I can park anywhere I want, people let me in to traffic because I'm small, and people like to smile because they think the car is cute. 2. There are many color options, and this car is customizable for those who like to tune their engines and lower their cars. 3. Gas mileage is decent I average anywhere between 28-34 depending on where I'm driving and the conditions of the road. 4. Maintenance, is awesome the only things I have replaced on my fiat has been the battery, left headlight and left tail light. In three years that's pretty good! I use full synthetic oil, and only put cheveron gas in my car. 5. Room in the car is enough for daily life, I wouldn't say the car is family friendly for those who have larger families, however my wife, daughter and I fit in here comfortably.

Only have 3000 miles so I can't speak about reliability.Update: 15000 miles.  Reliable so far. Still makes me smile and lots of fun to drive.

I liked the way the Fiat looked so decided to give it a drive. Turned out I really liked this cute little car. So bought it that day. Red with automatic transmission. I can see where some of the interior parts will likely not hold up well, but for the money and styling, I think it's a great deal. I don't really drive a lot anymore and this is really perfect for me. Comfortable, peppy, and fun to look at. This is a follow up to the review I did last year. I have put about 7000 miles on her, like I said I don't drive much and she is still doing great. I really have no complaints at all about this car.

It fits myself, my wife, and my daughter’s car seat with ease, even being so small, and still has room for our stuff if we are reasonable about what we bring with us. It also has excellent technology for its low price. It is easy to stream my Apple Music subscription or my Google Maps directions to the stereo using Bluetooth. Unlike many other, even larger, vehicles, it is almost as if this car’s interior was designed with actual human occupants in mind, as it has plenty of drink holders in convenient locations, and all interior controls are easy and convenient to access while driving. In short, this car is an absolute pleasure to drive, whether on a short drive around town or a long multi-state freeway vacation. Unfortunately, it is not, and has never been a reliable vehicle, which really ruins a lot of the fun of owning it. The clutch pressure plate snapped and the car had to be towed to the dealership to have the clutch replaced within the first week of buying the vehicle new. The clutch is not sufficiently covered by warranty as a so-called “wear item,” but mine was replaced at no charge. The transmission developed a nasty grinding noise when shifting gears and the entire transmission had to be replaced before the first oil change. The car now has a problem with surging in speed when in first and second gear, that the dealership was unable to fix and says is “normal for this vehicle.” Trying to control something that surges in acceleration like a bucking bronco through parking lots is not fun.",2

Now at 23k miles  on red. >>No<< problems. Average around town 28 mpg (premium) but have been as high as 36 mpg on trip ( at about  65 mph).  Quick with sport button on as it supposedly adds 20 ft/lbs torque. and you can feel the difference with sport button on . All three dealerships ( Baltimore,MD, Tysons Corner,VA and Melbourne,FL have been very good overall.  I came from a 2011 MINI Cooper S 6spd. The MINI was more sophisticated but the ABARTH is a true  hoot ,especially hearing the exhaust.  FIAT /ABARTH- I suggest direct injection ( not older port injection), suggest IRS (not beam axle rear suspension) ,  suggest 17in wheels standard (not 16in) , suggest better gauge design . (Although 2015 was improved you are not there yet...needs to be like the 595 and 695 in Europe). Suggest improved exhaust ( a ""T intersection"" at rear... really?) , Suggest KONI shocks on all four wheels.(not sure if this was addressed on 2016 on) , Suggest bigger brakes front and rear. Suggest standard rear ""sway bar"" needs to be much stiffer to reduce lean in corners.  FIAT has reduced price to now start at 20 k which seems quite fair.  If you are seeking a harder core and cheaper alternative to the MINI Cooper S then try this.  The ABARTH is priced closer to a MINI Cooper 1.5 134 hp /162 ft/lbs than the Cooper S.",5

Own this car since April 2016 and its brought nothing but joy, it has a great car community, so many mods, the overall experience is pretty special. The Italians know how to strike the right emotions when creating a car. I took out the rear seats(about 50lbs) and added Speedlab Rear Diffuser, also added a Torque Arm Insert which really makes the car feel more premium and stout.

339, on 12/06/16 20:50 PM (PST),KJS ,2015 FIAT 500 Abarth Abarth 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),Owning two Abarths," I have now owned two ABarths...a 2013 5spd basic car and a 2015 6spd automatic also basic . I have tended to like the automatic better and have just returned from a long trip getting 36.5 mpg at about 75mph average speed. 30mpg around town driving. The auto has 183ft lbs torque ( more than the 5spd cars)  as well which adds to the ease in drivability and it is a 6spd auto ( vs the 5spd manual). The car needs an update at this point (IE direct injection, a dual scroll turbo for quicker spool up, an independent rear suspension and it should have had Koni shocks all around ( now since changed for 2016) right from the beginning. The sway bars should have been stiffer as well especially the rear sway bar ( which can be resolved through the aftermarket.- a wise choice which does help minimize understeer) . You will need to keep the tire pressure at 40psi all around to get best performance. Mine had the optional 16 in black wheels ( not the 17inchers ) so the higher pressure was not objectionable. The car is a fun ,raucous ,unique little runabout but is only ""fast"" when in sport mode ( worth 20ft lbs. more torque when sport button is pushed).  After owning two I would not buy another unless there was a total top to bottom update as the original was released around 2008 in Europe. It is now overdue. Not many drive these so you will need to be dedicated.",3
340, on 10/16/16 18:12 PM (PDT),Mark ,2015 FIAT 500 Abarth Abarth 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),Love it," I've had my Abarth about 6 weeks now.  I park in a crowded parking lot at work, as far as I can tell its the only one on the lot.  It stands out.  Mine is red with the upgraded $500 sixteen inch wheels.  The best feature of this car is its compelling value and its unbeatable fun factor.  I was originally shopping for the Sport which I test drove and loved, probably should have bought for the gas mileage alone and almost equally cool in appearance and appeal as the Abarth.  But I loved the Abarth too, particularly the exhaust, badging, and leather seats.  Keep in mind the exhaust is great, exhaust porn to the extreme, great at drive thru's and underpasses, will put a smile on you face every day, best described as a friendly companion and not at all intrusive.  Its absolutely fab!  If I'm careful I can average around 35 MPG on a tank with 60% of that a suburban commute to work.  I keep it out of sport mode for the most part just to save on fuel.  The Beats audio system is good, very good, but I can't imagine the base system also not being very good.  I did not do the comparison before I purchased.  Seems all the 500s I was interested in had the Beats so I just went with it.  Also, no backup camera, but it does have the backup warning feature, a $250 option that I feel is very useful and well worth it.  Driving this car with the stick is easy and fun.  I think it's is the only way to go because of the gain in MPG and the fun factor.  Also, the fit and finish is perfect.  I examined it with a magnifying glass, no paint blemishes of any kind, no gaps in the panels or doors (as compared to my 2005 Maxima purchased new, a Nissan embarrassment for which I will never give them a second chance.  Shame, shame, shame on Nissan).  The ride quality is also great, no rattles at all, a little bouncy because of the small wheel base, but an able and compliant suspension as well as a handling marvel.  Road noise is minimal, this is a small car from the outside but doesn't sound like it from the inside.  I test drove a Honda Fit, didn't like it but was willing to buy based alone on Honda reliability.  The front suspension gave the impression of the wheels trying to come thru the wheel wells let alone the road noise.  This car may be reliable and have great reviews, but I don't see why.  It's a cheap car with a cheap price that will make you feel cheap as long as you own it.  Also, the dealer played the online bait and switch despite having the online quote in their very hands.  This happened at two dealerships within a week.  Done with arrogant Honda... forever!  Thank you Honda for being rotten, I think I've gotten a better car for a better price.  Also, the electronics are all that.  Perhaps all new cars now come with sophisticated electronics, but please be aware, this was an inexpensive car where the fun, price, and appearance are its strengths.  The electronics are a bonus that bring it up to the standards of much more expensive cars.  Also, the interior and electronics are intuitive and easy to use.  This is no accident, it is well thought out design.  It's not just a lot of features thrown together haphazardly like my Maxima for bragging rights.  This is a comfortable car in many, many respects.  The high roof line allows for more space then can be imagined.  This car does not feel cramped and you sit up high, its easy in and easy out which gives great comfort to my aching right hip.  I also looked at the new Civic.  A great car if you don't mind spending north of $27K for the one you want with the wheels you want, and you have to do the limbo to get into the darn thing for the privilege of nearly sitting on the ground.  Its great once you're in but you may need 911 to get out.  My hip and checkbook feel the Fiat is not just the better car, its the smarter car too... and better looking.   I can't say enough about how great a value I feel this car is.  Also, this is a specialty car and the dealer lots are full of unsold Abarths.  Most people I think will fall for the 500 but the real car people, of which there are fewer, will look to the Abarth with an appreciation of how different and special this car really is.  Consequently, huge and disproportionate discounts are to be had.  My car listed for $27,495 (no sunroof, no navigation), final price $22,295.  I think I overpaid and could have done better by about $2,000 without even asking had I used some online tools.  But I don't feel bad about the purchase.  I liked the dealer, patient and kind, easy and nice.  The follow up has been nothing less then remarkable.  I feel like I've joined the family and a special community.  The dealer followed up and FIAT themselves too after receiving several welcome gifts.  Any problems, call and a person will answer who is able to give answers.  I will remember this as a pleasant experience, it the car proves itself as reasonably durable which I think it will, then I'll stick with FIAT.  They have put a priceless smile on my face.",5

Not in a super-car kind of way, in a goofy, balls to the wall, don't give a damn kind of way. It's always ""on"" meaning it's always ready to play, like a puppy dog. It is comfortable enough for long hauls and with the standard 16"" wheels it tracks like a little freight train down the freeway, really! On highway trips I'm getting around 33-35 mpg which is exactly the EPA rating and around town probably more like 22-26 mpg (much more dependent on how you drive it). The only thing I'd change would be to redesign the center vertical tunnel stack thing because it does interfere a bit with my knees (I'm a big guy, weighing in at 300 lbs and 5'10"").",5
342, on 07/28/15 00:21 AM (PDT),Cameron ,2015 FIAT 500 Abarth Abarth 2dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),great little car," I've had this for around 8-10 months, so I can't really say much on long term reliability, but its a fun little car.No parking aids on my, but then again whats the point. just aiming it in the general direction is good enough. It's small enough where i can just go ""Eh, good enough"" and it is.It's a quick car, and still has decent acceleration at 60+ mph. It handles and grips well, is a lot of fun as a daily driver, well at least when there isn't too much traffic.The driving position is quite high, coming from my 98' BMW, but it somehow just adds to the fun.I've seen people complain about the lack of space, and granted, the rear seats kinda suck, but there's more than enough room if you only need to drive yourself or one other person around, not to mention it just is a physically smaller car which I like.If I'm careful, I can get 36-37 mpg between city and highway with traffic, could probably get 38-39 if there wasn't any traffic, but I generally don't bother with it. More fun not worrying about mileage, and even when being rather liberal with the gas it still gets decent mileage. Get's about the same range as my BMW did, I use a higher grade gas, and it still costs ~15$ less to fill up the tank.I think the ride is quite good, though my dad said the BMW felt like a rock (never really noticed myself). It makes a nice sound making it somewhat ridiculous, but not over the top. It's not super loud or anything, but it's enough to put a smile on my face.I couldn't be happier with it,Edit~2 years later, been reliable enough, it can go through a bit of oil, not a leak, just keep an eye on it. Also fairly easy to modus probably hit the gas more than I should, and I'm almost always in sport mode I get a combined of about 30-31mpg.",5
343, on 07/31/16 17:27 PM (PDT),b-Row ,2015 FIAT 500 C Abarth C Abarth 2dr Convertible (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 5M),Awesome little commuter/city car," I got mine used.  Fiat's rather undeserving reputation for poor quality works out for those of us buying used.  Car was probably 33000 with every single option available new and I picked it up for 14000 with 15k miles and 2 years old.  So, not the car you want to absorb initial price on.  Even if the price stayed strong like a honda, 33k would be a bit much for a car this size and power.  A great MX-5 could be had for less than that.  PRACTICALITY-  It can seat 4 as long as they're all middling size.  I'm 6'3"" and can fit my teen children and wife in there.  Not for long, but it can be done.  Not much cargo space on the cabriolet, but enough to do a grocery run without putting the seats down.  Gets good fuel mileage without giving up power.  INTERIOR AMENITIES- Beats Audio is pretty great.  I've owned a lot of cars and this has the best stereo ever.  I thought the HK in the Mini S was nice.  No where near.  Controls are simple.  Not many options.  Has an easy to access menu in the gauge cluster to adjust beeps and DRL etc.  Instant and trip MPG.  Normal car computer stuff.   Bluetooth is lacking.  Technically you can use it to connect phone calls.  But NO BT STREAMING AUDIO to the stereo.  Unforgivable.  Does have the requisite USB and 1/8"" jack though.  Seats (leather) are comfortable.  Height adjustable (a la VW).  Passengers complain about the rear headrests.  The rear seats are almost perpendicular to the ground and the headrests stick out in front of them.  You pretty much have to lean forward.  BUT... technically its for safety.  Safe isn't always comfortable. The arm rest is only on the drivers seat and is perfect for me.  My wife considers it to be too high (she's short).  It can be stowed if it bothers you.  Seats are bolstered but not straight jacket.  You sit high for a sports car.... but its not a sports car.  Its a hot hatch.  Good visibility.  you never notice how small the car is till you park it or squeeze by into the turn lane that's almost blocked.   DRIVABILITY-  I came out of a mk6 GTI most recently.  The GTI was almost too perfect.  It lacked fun.  You had to bring it to a track to get ""on the edge"" safely.  The abarth isn't an ""est"" car.  Its not the fastest, not the best in corners, its not the most powerful.  What it lacks in power and skid pad and rapid weight transfer, it makes up for in spades with FUN.   It must be driven on the edge.  You don't sit back and marvel at your speed through the turn.  You earn it.  It handles better than most things on the road and anything in its class, but it doesn't beat your brains out on rough roads.  It has a very sophisticated shock absorber that lets it soak up bumps and still perform.  The shifter is spot on.  Some call it sloppy.  It doesn't offer a lot of feed back, but I've NEVER missed a shift.  Only thing weird about it is that it will let you try to put it  in reverse if you forget its only a 5 speed and try to grab 6th.  When you come to a stop in a 3 point turn, if you quickly shift from forward to reverse you might hear it grind as the transmission spins very freely.   The ASC is VERY intrusive when ""all the way on"".  Starting from a green light can find you bogging down if you try to start quickly at all.  The tiny firm tires try to spin on intersection rubble and the ASC/TSC kicks in and cuts the throttle all but completely.  I generally drive it on ""1 push"".  That is.  Tapping the ASC controls put it in a ""sport"" mode.  It allows a bit of wheel spin and will let you performa an ""L"" turn with the hand brake before it stops you.  It still assists if you start sliding around a corner, or stab the brakes too hard out of a dip.  Push and hold the ASC button for 5 seconds and you're in track mode.  Full off as far as I can tell.  Smoke the tires, pull J turns, drift through chicanes, spin backwards into the gravel or trees.  Not a great idea for the road, but kicks butt on the auto cross circuit.  The ASC has saved me a couple times.  It has my trust.  The noise... OH the noise.  Pops and crackles.  Pull away from the drive up window and you hear the turbo spin up.  Build full boost at anything below maximum torque curve and let off to a satisfying after fire.  The car has NO MUFFLER!  Catalytic converter into down pipe, into a small flex converter---- 6 feet of straight pipe, T to the 2 outlets.  Its obnoxious in confined spaces.  On the road its not even noticeable.  No drone, just a very european crackle.  Blip the throttle between shifts.  Sounds race car.    The pedal box is perfect.  My wife automatically learned to heel toe.  She had never even heard the term before.  It just comes naturally in the 500.  ""I can brake and rev match without taking my foot off the brake"".  Its amazing.  The steering is responsive but not heavy.  The steering wheel could be better.  I can't find a perfect place for my hands.  It wants you to be at 10&2 but I prefer a 9&3.  The car has a bit of body flex and body lean, but nothing dramatic.",5

No it’s not a miss print, a 2013 with 4K on it. 4 days after owning the car it started to make a ticking noise. Brought it back to the dealer, on the way to the dealer a boost hose came apart, I limped it into the dealer ship. 3 days of diag later they say the inputshaft bearing went out on the transmission. So they put a transmission in it and fix the boost leak. 3 months after owning it the a/c stopped working. It’s been back to the dealer 3 times for that and they can’t find out why. 4 month after owning it the driver’s side window starts to rattle when it’s 1/2 way down. Bring it back to the dealer and they said the window track bolts were loose, they repaired that. Then around 12k the engine starts to consume 2 quarts of oil every 2k miles. So we start to do an oil consumption report, which is basically drop the car off and have a tech check the dip stick. Now we’re at 18k and on the last dipstick check the dealership calls and says it needs an engine. So they order me up and engine and now it’s sitting at the dealership. I also found out when checking out the warranty coverage at the last dipstick check, the selling dealership put an engine in it at 3k and never disclosed it at the  original sale. At this point I called fiat  corporate and started this process. The put me with a case worker. I wanted to turn the car in but apparently fiat does not do buy backs and they wanted to connect me to some one in sales to try to “trade” it in on another product. So at this point my warranty runs out in September of 2019, which I will be trading it in. It’s a very fun car to drive. It’s got snap and hugs the corners very well (after I took the stock parrellies off and put on a set of coopers) which buy the way the tires were shot at 10k. Basically when it’s not at the dealer its fun to drive. Would I buy another fiat product again, hell no! Do your self a favor stay away from fiat.",1

It was my first used car since the mid 90s. A used Fiat 500 can be a great deal. Things I love: this car has great attention to detail in it's design - it has character and little things that delight, like the white instruments, controls, and steering wheel that make it feel unlike any other car available. The 2013 model has my favorite version of the interior because the dash lights are all orange and match; later models went to a different set of instruments that don't match the radio colors. I've put almost 10,000 miles on mine now going back and forth to work, the gym, and running errands - it has the easiest driving manual transmission I've ever owned and the electric power steering is a pleasure around town. I can always wedge it into that parking spot nobody else can use. You can drive it all out and never get into much trouble, and it has plenty of power for the freeway. The iPod integration, Bluetooth, and stereo are excellent and easy to use. On the down side - the seats have short bottoms and are not the most comfortable things, though that may be personal. Due to the short wheelbase, it can have a busy, sometimes nervous ride compared to a larger car. I feel quite content zipping around town with my little Fiat - it makes me smile. Like most of us, it's faults are the mirror image of it's strengths. I get impeccable, attentive service from my dealer (Fiat of Kirkland, WA).",5

We were rear ended by a impaired driver on the highway and the traction control saved us from a potentially  horrible situation. 6 months later a guy in a mustang ran a red light and smashed into the side..(Southern California Drivers) Both times were minor injuries although I was banged up a bit in the rear end collision. It gets about 30 - 40 MPG with the automatic and is a great value. I would advise anyone NOT TO GET WHEEL COVERS and step up and get aluminum wheels or zip tie those caps to the wheel as they always FALL OFF. irritating....",4

We have enjoyed the car for three-years. In the last few months, we noticed a ticking noise on the right side when the car is in motion so we bring it to Fiat of Manhattan for a check-up. I'm told the entire bottom of the car, including all the rims, are bent - as if the car bottomed-out - resulting in a repair cost of ~$3K. I live in NYC, purchased the car from Fiat of Manhattan. 90 percent of my driving takes place in NYC. I try to avoid potholes when possible - which are everywhere on our NY roads - and I've never hit one that made me say, oops, that broke my car. Now, the Fiat is absolutely horrible when it comes to any bumps. They all feel like you're getting hit by a cement truck. But for a three-year old car that hasn't experienced anything other than driving in NY, I'm astounded that the car wasn't built properly to handle what any other car can. So now we're worried that another three-years from now, we'll be doing this all over again because of a faulty, or cheaply made undercarriage. This makes me sad. I want to love my Fiat, but I'm so angry at the manufactures for marketing a car for city living but not backing it up with the framework of a vehicle that can endure city roads. Boo.",3

It had about 15k miles on it but the price was GREAT. I guess that's a caution if you plan to buy a new Fiat, but I got virtually a new car for under  $11K. I thought I wanted a used Miata but when I test drove the Fiat I knew that was the one for me. Not as sporty a driving experience perhaps, but a helluva lot more fun. The top can be stopped at any stage of opening, but has 2 built-in detents in addition to fully open. 1st position is basically a sunroof, second is as open as you can get without affecting rearward visibility, fully down is the quietest but like an old VW bug the folded down top is in the way of rear vision. Not really an issue out on the road but not the best idea in a parking lot environment. Styling is charming, capturing the retro feel but also seeming practical and logical for modern driving. My city driving in Sport mode yields about 36MPG. Also note that the storage capacity is quite limited compared to the non-convertible which has a full hatch. The convertible has a small trunk lid not a hatch. So I don't think this could be a grownup's only vehicle, but it's a blast to drive and every time I look at it or meet one on the road I feel happy! Reliability has been excellent. Only trips to dealer are for recalls and to add a conventional spare tire. Service here at Hendrick Dodge in Cary, NC has been excellent.November 2017 Update: The car continues to be fun to drive and I have had no reliability issues whatsoever. I have yet to see another convertible I'd prefer.May 2018 Update: Changed the spark plugs at 30K miles. Still runs great and love the car.",5

I don't think they have made many changes since them to the Abarth. I did not give it a poor rating on things like ride quality and storage simply because the car is great for what it is. The ride quality is very stiff due to the sport suspension, as is the steering. It's what I wanted and what I expected, so it has not disappointed me in these regards. It is also noisy due to the awesome exhaust (which one dealer told me is made by Ferrari).   My only ""poor"" rating is on the visibility. Even looking out the front you have to be vigilant. There just isn't a lot of clarity no matter how you slice it.  Two other things I do not like:  no Bluetooth connect from phone to audio (unless calling someone) so if you want to listen to Pandora, you have to have cords. This is probably not the case if you get the navigation package. The other thing I do not like: terrible turning radius! Crazy. Feels like driving a boat when trying for a tight turn. These things being said, I thought that when I bought this car I would get tired of it after two months. It's loud, fun, stiff, small, fast, manual. I got it on lease for three years, so it was a gamble. Well, I have not tired of it at all. It has been great. You will get close to 40 mpg on the highway, and I average about 30 in mixed city driving. Also, I fit a Laz-y-Boy in the back! (Only because you can separate the seat from the back  with a Laz-y-Boy.) This is not a super fast car, but it FEELS super fast and it is a blast to rocket around. I will say that the turbo lag is a bit much. I hear that it is not so obvious in the automatic transmission. Also, Fiat often offers some great deals. I got this as a lease so had to pay the list price. The same car was on sale for about $4,000 less when purchasing. So leasing may not be the most economical choice. I have noticed that a lot of American reviewers are pretty hard on Fiat. I don't know why. Consumer Reports rates them with awful reliability yet I have not had a single issue. I test drove the VW GTI, and that is a great car, but a whole different animal. The GTI is faster, way more refined in terms of ride quality, but the Abarth feels like it is made for rallycross and wants to chew something up. It is just bursting to go when you put it in sport mode.  You can only get a sense of the Abarth by driving it and really pushing the pedal. Again, I'm not sure why it doesn't get amazing reviews, but I am not a car expert.  One person described the driving experience as ""driving an angry hornet.""  That is right on.On the highway, it holds very firm. I have driven it fair distances and been very comfortable, but again, it is quite loud. I would seriously consider getting another Abarth when my lease is up in 2016, but the girlfriend is not in favor. She says it makes her dizzy and it is too loud for us to talk on a road trip. Also, the racing seats are not conducive to her reclining to take a snooze while I drive. So....a word to the wise. In a nutshell, if you test drive this car and finish by getting out and telling yourself you feel like you just got out of a cocktail shaker, this may not be the car for you. If, on the other hand, you get out and you find yourself eager for more, then you know you have found your next car. It will not disappoint.",5

Great value, provided you don't pay the MSRP (I got mine (with 3 year tire insurance - which I already used once for a repair) for 19K US$ + tax with end of year discounts of 6K.)Was considering other small/light 'fun' cars such as the Mini/Mazda Mx5/BRZ-FRS, but for similar performance/features it would be 10K more, anyway, I just kind of fell in love with it after a test drive.With the 17-inch wheels and P-zero tires this light weight car feels fast and nimble, not always stable on the edge. Provided you keep it in the mid-rev range the torque is strong and turbo lag is not an issue. Update: now at 22,000 miles/3 years later.. still a lot a fun to commute with - still puts a smile on my face.. - added a GoPedal (major improvement to response/lag), Craven Speed Short shift kit (feels much better than stock shifter long throw), a Madness high-flow intake (actually made some difference to holding boost and also the turbo sound)...... tiring for long drives such as San Jose to LA - no telescoping steering/high seats..   still love this car.. concerned about the San Jose dealership closing..  so far it's been reliable (even though I drive like I stole it (when alone - when very little traffic/clear road ahead/back-roads)) - except some minor interior back-light issue on the air controls - fixed under warranty.",4

I will start on a High note and say that it is a Blast to drive, sounds great, and is an amazing small performance car.  Now for the bad!  I bought mine used with 4100 miles on it for about $10000 less than a brand new one, $27,500 sticker price.  This should have been a sign that they don't hold their value at all.  I missed having a larger car and wanted to trade it in, they offered $14,000 trade in with 6000 miles on it.  Now with 16,700 miles on it I have had a brand new radiator put in it and have an appointment for a speedometer that stopped working today!

But this is absolutely a niche vehicle that is lots of fun as a run-about but gives up a lot in utility/flexibility.  There is no way I would have bought this as an only car in the household--something like a GTI would make way more sense or a Focus ST if you wanted more edginess.  That said, I felt the Abarth had way more character, was more fun, and was more unique for a hot hatch.  It feels a more raw and simple than the competition--which I like.  It gets me to work every day, puts a smile on my face when I drive it, gets good gas mileage, and for short trips fits a family of three and groceries for a couple of days.",4.25

My car enthusiast friend fully endorsed my decision, touting it had the ""best stock exhaust ever"". It's fun to drive in the city, especially under the raised train tracks in Chicago - you can actually hear the car roar. Unfortunately it's so far from practical it's not even funny. Inevitably the fun runs out in a couple of months and you look up trade-in value to see that this car holds absolutely zero value. And good luck explaining to the car dealerships that your Abarth is in fact different than a standard 500. I really wanted to love this car... it just didn't happen. Oh, and I had SILLY repairs two months in.",3

I purchased a Fiat 500 Sport instead. It was not a complete dog like the regular mini cooper and I loved the extra space that the MX5 did not have. I can go to the grocery store in the Fiat! About 9 months ago I purchased an Abarth. Best idea I ever had. I have a 45 minute commute each way in traffic. The car zips in and out of traffic and I have had no mechanical problems. I have driven many of my friends Mini S, which cost a lot more (I paid $19,000 for new Abarth at year end clearance sale). Abarth drives so much better and the sound is spectacular. The sport button turns the car into a monster. :)",5

I was told only Fiat dealers will work on them now -- not other nearby Chrysler dealerships. It's not like there are any close to home. We had high hopes for Fiat but are sadly as disappointed.

I was very pleased with my 500 Sport (35000 mi) but longed for a bit more 'oomph' to play with. It's handling and overall demeanor was really good and involving but getting up to speed was lacking. Enter the Abarth. As someone else stated in a previous review, the many changes made to the car to cope with the added power turned it into a different animal. The power is there, the steering more direct, the brakes (helped by the 17""tires) are like hitting a wall, the shifting is more direct and positive. Short of driving a race kart on the streets, this is 'it'. You just have to hear the engine fire up. Love it! ",5

I waited for the 2013 model to arrive and then I went for a test drive - don't do this unless you are ready to buy one. The Abarth is everything I liked about the Pop raised to the tenth power. Comparing the Abarth to the Pop is like comparing an Alpina to a base 3 series BMW - you know the cars are related,but so many components have been upgraded that it is a completely different car.

I decided that buying the car just didn't make sense for me. A week later I bought one. Sense had nothing to do with it. This car is loud, raw and rides like an ox cart. It is also FUN! I traded in the best car I ever owned, a 2012 VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI, that averaged 40 mpg. The Abarth seats look great but hurt my back. The shifter is rubbery. It could use a sixth gear.

I test drove a Mini Cooper S convertible for 7 days and found it to be a noisy cheap car that really felt like a poorly built cheap car (shame on you BMW).  I looked at the beetle (just ok), focus (awful style), fiesta (nothing more to say), and many more, but just could not find the fun factor I wanted.  Then I happened upon a Fiat Abarth 500C and thought that looked interesting.  I test drove it ... and wow ... it was incredible.  It was perfect!  It had the fun factor with the exhaust note, convertible, 5-speed, and the power is great.  It also gets great gas mileage, low insurance cost, can seat 4 (yes the back seats are small but work just fine), feels solid/stable, and best of all a low mileage used car can be found for under 19k ... and then I find that the warranty is 4 years/50k ... Bonus!  I have since put over 25000 trouble free miles on this car including a couple of long distance trips.  This car never fails to make me smile and always a willing partner to have some fun.  On top of that, I get many comments on how nice the car looks because it is a limited edition Abarth 500c.  For 2013 there were only 250 imported to the USA ... so it is extremely rare to even see another one.  LOVE my car!",5

Just completed a 1200 mile trip with wife and daughter (yes in rear seat) and it ran perfect at 85-90 mph the whole way!  I would have liked a sixth gear for lower RPMs at higher speeds because at 85mph you are running 3600 rpm.
