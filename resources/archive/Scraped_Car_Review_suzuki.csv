0, on 04/08/10 13:10 PM (PDT),Keair ,2008 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Convenience Package (2.0L 4cyl 4A),My '08 Reno," I just bought my '08 Reno a few days ago, and so far I'm very impressed with its performance and ride quality. MPG aren't too bad, but they could be a little better. For about 20-25 dollars you could expect to ride for a pretty good bit on a full tank. That's pretty good compared to a much bigger vehicle. My roommate has a minivan, and that take anywhere from thirty to forty dollars to fill up, and gas doesn't last half as long as it does in mine. I'm 24, and this is my very first vehicle, and so far I'm very happy, and well satisfied with my purchase.",4.625
1, on 02/04/10 02:21 AM (PST),Tony ,2008 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Great Buy," I bought this '08 Reno with 2,400 miles on it. It's my ride from home to work and back. This is the first small car that I have ever owned. I traded in my '98 Lumina (168k miles)and $5400 cash and drove it off the lot. So many of the reviews have been less than complimentary, but as an owner, I think this is a great little car. 3 year/36k mile bumper to bumper, a 100k powertrain warranty, and 24 hour roadside assistance. I don't like the fact there aren't many dealerships around for service concerns, but I have only had one issue with the airbag light staying on all the time. Remember that you get what you pay for. I bought a 4-cylinder automatic. I don't expect to keep up with a Vette!",3.75
2, on 09/02/09 14:37 PM (PDT),rc ,2008 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),fun small car," We bought this car with a sonata in mind but the price point was to much to pass up.  Its peppy and quick for such a small engine. Plan to put on wheels, Cruise, tint and keyless with an alarm.  Love it get lots of second looks in the parking lots.  Put on a coat of turtle wax ice and it looks great. Only problem was pass seat airbag light but was resolved in one visit. 12k out the door cash and we are really happy with it! Lots of room for a small car and with some things like new wheels and tires maybe springs it will handle even better. Also try a k&n airfilter it will bump up the hp and gas mileage! Had a Suzuki motorcycle and this lives up to the name!",4.625
3, on 05/30/08 23:13 PM (PDT),rye ,2008 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback w/Convenience Package (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Practical with a small kick, I drive 90 miles a day and I get from 420 miles to 380 miles on a full tank of gas so the mileage is alright. Needs cruise but hey it's a good price on a car that get me to were I gotta go ,4
4, on 05/26/08 14:58 PM (PDT),Don ,2008 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Better than experts say it is, I just purchased this vehicle but thought it odd there were no reviews from users on this vehicle (expert reviews are unkind). It truly is a bargain and drove every bit as well as a Ford Focus. Yes it is basic but for $240 a month for 60 months and 0 down how can you go wrong especially with the warranty this manufacturer offers. We all are facing some realities with gas prices escalating and while the given mileage specs aren't overly impressive most people are getting better than posted mileage. The interior is very nice a pleasent surprise This is the first time I have considered a compact car and I will be ok with this. I didn't feel silly in it and the Suzuki moniker adds intrigue,4.25

6, on 06/07/18 15:45 PM (PDT),Dan ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Garbage, I would’ve given it all 1 star but I’m an honest man.... headlights are garbage they just love to short out.....  transmission is garbage no dipstick maintenance free and the mechanics can’t give me a transmission flush because it takes a special square tool to get the access port  that they didn’t have and Autozone and advanced auto didn’t sell it either online it was 49 dollars. Transmission skips like crazy and is a safety hazard.... Visibility is poor out the front but horrible in the back.... listen this car is garbage the bad out weighs the good,2
7, on 08/07/16 07:16 AM (PDT),Shauna ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),2006 Suzuki Reno," I got an '06 Reno in October of '15. It had 51k miles. I was surprised to find that this vehicle did not have cruise control, as many older vehicles (different make) do. The mpgs are not very good, even when using high octane fuel and keeping maintenance regular (correct air pressure in tires, clean air filter, oil changes ever 3k miles). I've already had to replace the head gasket in the engine. Come to find out there was an air bag/warranty issue for Renos, that effect/affect mine, according to the VIN. Not sure if it was the best choice, but I needed a car. It's still good, just think that an '06 vehicle, regardless of who it's from, should have cruise control. According to good 'ol Google, '06 Renos get 20 city and 28 highway.",3
8, on 12/03/15 20:01 PM (PST),Sansaloo ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Worst mistake of my life," Bought this car and an emergency car in January 2014 after I totaled my last car. Car was great for 5 months when the check engine came on. Turns out it was the throttle body,  which was no longer made. Dealt with it for another year and few months before everything started going wrong. Lower control arms needed replaced, quickly followed by having to replace the entire shifter assembly.  Both front and rear struts need replaced, including the mounting and stabilizers. Rack and pinions are starting to leak, has to replace a oil gasket, and now the throttle position sensor is shot. Only a dealer can calibrate a new one, and you have to replace the whole throttle body, not just the sensor. Only 69100 miles on this car, it shouldn't have all these issues!",2
9, on 12/13/13 15:00 PM (PST),aaron98762001 ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),I dont get it," I've been reading reviews and not one was good. My reno will fly, i read one that said it had trouble keeping up in traffic. To be a 2.0 this car is fast, i believe very dependable. I've had no trouble,it's a little rough on gas. But alot better than my 6 cylinder.",4.625
10, on 05/16/12 16:36 PM (PDT),dora5 ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),2006 Suzuki Reno," I purchased my car in 2011 at 48,000 miles, and the biggest problem is that it isn't good on gas. Also, I was told by a mechanic at a a Goodyear Service Center two days ago that I might need struts, rack and pinion work and rods!!! Even though the car was given a clean bill of health just six months ago, and only has 52,000 miles on it. Today, I went to the Suzuki authorized service center and they said I don't need anything but an alignment and new wipers. They thought the struts where getting dry, but not a problem. Seems to me Goodyear wanted to make a little money.To be safe, I am taking it to a third shop just in case. Luckily, I purchased an extended warranty.",4.125
11, on 10/18/10 00:00 AM (PDT),Ed ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Piece of junk," I purchased this car in 2006. Since then its been in the shop at least 6 times. I've had major issues with the transmission sensor. When the sensor goes bad the car does not move. I was driving this car to work at the speed limit of 50, then I had to stop for a light, when I was taking off the check engine light came on and the car had almost no power. If I knew then what I know now I would have opted for a better car. I would never purchase another Suzuki. I guess you get what you pay for. Oh and getting rid of it is much more difficult considering its worthless.",2
12, on 07/17/10 00:54 AM (PDT),CableGuy30 ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),2nd Reno and would buy again," Ok. So I see all these bad reviews on here, and dealing with the public I know more people complain than compliment. So here goes my story. This is my second Reno. First one had for 9 months, 27,000 miles. No problems. Until it got totaled when got hit by a semi truck. I walked away from the wreck. This one now has 76,000 miles and no problems. The a/c is poor, but tint the Windows and that takes care of 2 things at once. Makes the car look even better and helps the a/c. I wish they still made this car cause I would buy another one.

13, on 07/12/10 11:35 AM (PDT),Renee' ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Okay Car for the Money," I bought this car used.  I have not had to do anything to it except oil changes and standard maintenance stuff.  It's almost time to replace the tires.  The price of the standard tires was higher than I expected.  Every tire place I went to said they were not a size they stocked, so that was surprising.  But overall, I really like the car so far.  Have not had any mechanical issues.  The main thing is to remember it is an inexpensive car, don't expect it to drive like a Mercedes or you're setting yourself up for disappointment.  But great car, glad we bought it.",3.375
14, on 05/21/10 16:43 PM (PDT),Jena ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),The worst car ever!," I purchased my vehicle in 2007. I hate it. It only has 3,000. miles on it. My transmission is failing, the air bag light is on, and engine light is on too. I called Suzuki to help me. But I have to pay for everything to see what's wrong and most thing aren't covered. It doesn't start always. I have 2 children and i am unemployed at this time. They told me that only interior thing are covered under warranty until 100,000 miles. The transmission is not shifting right and it jerks when it shifts. Gas not so good. I called corporate and they couldn't help me either. Not worth the money. Too many problems. And its not only me. What should I do.",2.25
15, on 12/27/09 13:57 PM (PST),dk676 ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Worst car ever buyers beware, I purchased my car because i needed a four door due to having a child & i wish i never had! I had over $600 in work done and was told it should help the gas mileage it made it worse. Now they tell me its normal. They dont tell you about recalls until you call for other issues or hear about it from someone else. I had the transmission replaced & that took over two weeks & 2 different transmissions. The dealer never called me i had to call them to check on the car. My brother also has one and he has had his in the shop more than he gets to drive it.  My suggestion is dont ever buy a suziki they are the biggest piece of crap ever made & they dont care as long as you are making your payments! ,1.875
16, on 12/17/09 16:39 PM (PST),Wunderly ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Great Car for a Low Price," I bout this car used at 4600 miles for about 6 grand at an auto auction.  I have had this car for almost a year and I have have no problems with it so far, engine is easy to maintain.  one issue is that the dashboard can glare on to the windshield, but other then that small detail the car is a good one to own for high school and college age kids.",3.5
17, on 11/16/09 16:56 PM (PST),Jamin ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Underrated Commuter Superstar!," I work as a salesperson in the car business and I drive a variety of cars and trucks on a daily basis. Some are nicer, faster, bigger, and tow better than others. For me, this vehicle works. I work downtown and I needed a small, reliable commuter that was reasonable on gas but still fun to drive. This car delivers. I bought it with just over 40k miles on it and so far have had no problems. The flat torque curve of this engine allows it to pull even in 5 gear which is unusual for a car this size. I went with an 8 for reliability due to my short ownership. The car handles like a go-cart and winds up nicely. I paid 6k used (it's a 2006)- (a deal a customer could have gotten) Value-wise-- 10!",4.5
18, on 05/15/09 22:39 PM (PDT),Harvester ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Reliable Little Buggy for 2 Years Now," This has to be one of the best deals I've ever gotten on a used car. Bought  it less than a year old, with 8500 miles.  The cost was already 2/3 of a new one.  All the complaints I've read about have never happened to me.  There were 3 recalls that the Suzuki dealer performed - one for a wiring harness, one for a seatbelt thing, and the other for the running lights.  I took this car on a road trip across Texas and back and was very good on gas.  For $200 I put a Pioneer radio and it made all the difference in the world.  The speakers are actually very nice sounding if you put some wattage behind them.",3.875
19, on 04/24/09 06:10 AM (PDT),PSJ ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),"No problems in 30,000 Miles", Love the car. Got what I expected which was reliable service with no a problem to date at 30 thousand miles. Car has good vision fields and ride is tight and solid but it is a small car ride so if you think you're getting a Lexus at this price wakeup... although with all the radio and cruise controls on the steering wheel you will feel like you got more than you paid for.

I think the car stayed in the shop more than we drove it; head light continues to go out for now reason, airbag light on, dealer don't know why, no good a/c heater output, replaced tires under a year, middle console will not close and we had to the timing belt in less than a year.  This car is a piece of crap, can't trade cause it's worth nothing.  Biggest mistake we ever made",2.375
21, on 01/08/09 14:51 PM (PST),Kat ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Bad Car," This is the worst car I have ever owned. I started having problems when it was only a few weeks old. It took forever to get the problem fixed. Then the car had the head light not working problem. Then my front drivers seat came disconnected from the base. The tires wore out in under a year. The check engine light keeps coming on for no reason. The mileage is not good for that small a car. I was just told that I already need to replace the rear breaks. The service from Suzuki is bad. They knew about the starter problem when I called and told me they were working on a fix, I would just have to wait. I only had the car for less then a month. It is a bad, bad, bad car. I used to love Suzuki.",1.625
22, on 07/14/08 08:14 AM (PDT),BK ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),So far - so good ," We have 30,000 miles on our Reno and have not had it in the shop yet. It starts easily and is pretty good on fuel. I drive 40 miles round trip to work and run a few errands around town in it.  It is a manual 5 speed and we average 35 miles per gallon consistantly around town. The air is pretty weak and living in Florida can be a bit frustrating. Overall, we have been pleased but we are holding our breath. We also owned a Suzuki Verona at the same time that was a nightmare - we finally got rid of it, thank God.",4.125
23, on 06/20/08 00:20 AM (PDT),Good & Bad ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Some Quirks," To start, let me say I really do love this car.  But, it has had many problems that make it annoying at times. I had the problem with it not starting for the 1st 6mo I had it-the dealership could never fix it but it stopped happening. Then I had an airflow problem (scary)- The tires wore out (low profile)at 24000. And, I've had non-stop issues with the airbag sensor, that they just can't seem to fix. I was just told that it would probably need a new Serp. belt soon. But, the car is fun to drive, sporty, decent on mpg. MPG could be better for a car this size, but It's better than an SUV! If you know how to drive the automatic as a manual (as you can in this car) really gets up and goes. ",4.75
24, on 05/29/08 06:05 AM (PDT),Reno Owner ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Happy so far.," We bought a 06 Reno a few years ago and so far has been a reliable car, overall I like the car. I'm around 6-2ish and I fit comfortably into the vehicle. No knees into the glove box, no hair touching the upholstry on the roor. Has gotten a bit cramped with the addition of a car seat, had to move pass seat forward.  Have not had any major mechanical problems to this point. Have not experienced the bad starting as some others have. Did eat through the factory serp belt though by 36,000. Have flushed the engine cooling system and serviced the auto trans, no problems with the fluid exchanges either. MPG is nothing to totally rave about, but full it once a week, not terrible.   ",4.5
25, on 03/15/08 04:31 AM (PDT),Robert Garrison ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Reno's great mileage and Comfort," I kept looking at that Reno sitting up a pedistal outside the dearlership for about a month. The looks and the price was very attractive. I decided to stop and see how the performance was and to tell you the truth. I was actually surprised by what that 2.0 liter will do. If your not afraid to put your foot in it, it will get you down the road quick. Anyway, I am 6'2"" and I fit in that car like Jim Carey says, ""like a glovvvveee"". It handles real well, and the mileage...OMG...I go to Illinois from Alabama and I don't stop for gas until I get to Champagne which is like 450 miles from Huntsville. I love this car. Great car!",5
26, on 08/12/07 22:25 PM (PDT),russgoble ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Awesome toy," I bought the car and to be honest with you, stock, the car isn't much, but after putting some 17"" rims, limo tint, a sound system, underglow light, a custom grille and much more, that car has turned into a one of a kind here where I live. The manual has a lot more power than it look like. Adding NOS, turbo chargers, intake, exhaust will really make this car get up and race with the best.  If anyone wants a car at an affordable price that you want to fix up and make unique, then I recommend this car",4.5

It's great on gas, I went from Patchogue to Riverhead everyday and it costs me $20 - $25 filling at 1/4 tank, depending on the gas prices for the week. For the price it's a good car, I haven't had any problems.",4.5
28, on 11/21/06 11:15 AM (PST),John ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback Convenience 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Nothing but Trouble from the Start," I bought this Reno new and since day ""two"" it's been nothing but trouble.  The second day it left us stranded and wouldn't start.  The dealer towed it back said it was fixed.  We got six miles from dealer it stopped again.  The dealer had it for six days returned it said it was all fixed.  Then three days later the same thing happened, it wouldn't start.  The dealer had it again and replaced more parts.  It runs now, but gets poor fuel economy - only 20 mpg in the city.  Yesterday my wife started it, turned on heater, and it sounded like a bomb went off.  There was some acorns packed in heater.  We called dealer and he said it was not their problem.  I took it apart and there is NO screen over the heater motor under hood and it was full of nuts.  The tranny still doesn't shift right.  I will never buy another Suzuki.  It is the worst car I have ever bought!",2.875

With ""European Styling"", a comfortable and spacious interior,a fun driving experience, and an affordable price tag, the Suzuki Reno is perfect for the average college student or young person. The Reno is an all-around fun car, and you wont be embarrassed to show it off to your friends. I would suggest the Suzuki Reno to anyone in the market for a very nice and practical new car.",4.75

I had to crank my '06 two dozen times once trying to go home from work for an appointment.

After I had the car for just five days, I began to have problems starting my 2006 Reno every morning. After two and a half weeks with the car in the shop, I was put in a 2007 Reno, which developed hard start issues, again in five days. In both cars, the passenger airbag off light stayed illuminated regardless of my having a passenger. The dealer put me back in the original Reno, claiming its been fixed, which I do not trust yet. Suzuki never returns my phone calls. Their customer service is non-existent. If I could get them to void my contract, I would and I would never again buy a Suzuki or recommend one to anyone, even my worst enemy. Dont even consider this car!",1

It has had so many problems.  I have had it in the shop for the transmission (5x), the washer fluid box (2x), the air bag (1x), the windshield wipers (2x), and the AC (5x).  Every time, the dealership promises the car is fixed, but it certainly is not.  Now they are saying they are not going to pay to have the AC fixed because they claim a mouse has gotten in it.  Yet, they have no proof of this.  I'm really getting fed up with Suzuki.",1.5

I like the usefulness of the hatch, the features, and best of all the price.  I have not had any real problems with the car with the exception of a computer reflash that fixed the idle problem.  I hit it a bit on performance (see below), but the car is fun to drive and performs up to expectations and then sum when compared to the direct competition.  I still like to drive my expensive sports car, but don't miss it too much on comutes in the reno.  Oh, its gas milage is realy good.  I keep track of it.  I geuss Suzuki doesn't overblow the numbers like most do.",4.75

These things have a lot of value in the Southwest desert. It runs smoothly and is very quiet at and above the posted speed limit on the highway. The seats are comfortable and the audio is great.

It has more power than the Toyota Yaris, Honda Fit, Scion xA or XB, and the Chevrolet Aveo. It has more standard features and a longer warranty as well. I bought this car for well below invoice. I love this car. You can not find a better value.  Compare it piece by piece to the others and you will see. ",5

The build quality, fit and finish a reliability challenge the best compacts out there. But it seems that the rest of the world sees Suzuki's as ""bottom of the barrel"" cars. This is definitely not true. I have been so pleased with my Reno. My gas mileage is better then what the sticker stated. I average 32-34 mpg with local driving. The car is extremely roomy and comfortable. The transmission is smooth and easy-maybe not as refined as a Sentra or Corolla - but better than any Focus, Cobalt or Elantra. I just bought my wife an XL-7, she loves it. If you like the European style and the practical benefits of a hatchback, test drive a Reno-you will be pleasantly surprised.",4.75

I actually got it for well below invoice price, which was one major reason that I purchased it.  I am pleasantly surprised by the quality and performance of it.  The interior is simple yet stylish, and has plenty of room.  The exterior is a sleek, European hatchback look.  There are great features included for the price.  I am actually pretty happy with my purchase.  The only thing I am disappointed in is the fuel economy.  A car this small should be able to get more than 22 mpg (city).  My '03 Honda Civic gets 29 mpg.",3.875
39, on 04/22/06 12:47 PM (PDT),Ev ,2006 Suzuki Reno Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5M),A great overlooked runabout," It's easy to miss the Suzuki Reno. It is overshadowed by the heavily promoted Scions, Toyotas and Hondas, little Suzuki is well, little known. I hadn't heard of the Reno until I saw one at the auto show, and was immediatly drawn to it. After an hour of test driving it, the Reno sits in front of my apartment. Aside from the obsurity of the car, what really sets the Reno apart is the amazing level of standard equipmet. My base model came with side airbags, power windows, locks and mirrors, steering assist, 8 speaker am/fm/cd/tape, and of course the European insired hatch design. My only complaint is the gas mileage is not up to the standards of the class (see Honda Fit, Scion xA, etc). ",4.625

Value for the money, you can't beat this car.  No problems whatsoever.  I have entered this car in several autocross events and it has shamed cars costing at least twice as much.  The styling is distinctive and euro, a nice touch.  Interior is simple, the way I like it with just the right amount of convenience such as power windows, mirrors, and locks.  Although the car's suspension is soft (see below), the overall balance is great.  If Suzuki can bump the car up to about 150 bhp and stiffen up the suspension at least 50% the car would be a hit with hot hatch enthusiasts everywhere.",4.25

It's very European looking.  It could be that the car is actually a Holden Viva from Australia which was basically rebadged as a Suzuki.

It has nice 15"" tires with full wheel covers.  I also like the 8-way driver seat plus 3-position lumbar support. It's no hot rod, but for less than $14,000 there's a DOHC 2.0 liter 4-cylinder GM-designed engine that is more than adequate (made in Australia).

I read reviews and the person did not recommended doing this, but to me it's a very reliabable car.  I drove it during the snow and it took me to and back from work.

The braking with the 4 disk brakes is sharp and the speed sensitive steering is awesome...especially in parking lots etc.  The only knock I have so far is the gas mileage isn't great.

If you are looking for a good reliable car this is it.  For all the standard features that came with it, it was a great buy. I realy enjoy driving it. For as small as it looks it has a lot of room in the inside. I looked around at a lot of cars , but the Suzuki Reno had everthing that a lot more expensive cars didn't for the very reasonable price. Yes it may not get top gas mileage, but it gets good mileage. I live where it snows and it just snowed a few days ago, it drove and handled very well.

If you're looking for an inexpensive / economical yet stylish little car I highly recommend it  Mileage has been about 30 in combined highway / city driving and as high as 33 in straight highway.  That's not to shabby.  Power is average but adequate and I concur with the professional reviewers that recommend the 5 speed over the automatic, it couples the power to the wheels much better than the auto.  Styling does turn some heads and I've been asked about it from a few people. Interior is good and functional. List of standard features is great but has no cruise control standard which is strange.

Very weak AC, which I found in all three Renos I drove. Sub-par at best.  2. Poorly designed sunroof operation, with no ""one-touch"" closing, requiring you to keep a finger on the button and your eyes on the sunroof as it closes, meaning having to take your eyes off the road to make sure it stops and seals where it should instead of going into vent mode. Frustrating, and a safety hazard while driving.  3. Tight rear storage. Not enough lateral room for my guitar cases without putting seatbacks down. That means no passengers.  4. Sub-par gas mileage  No thanks.",3.5

The manual will give you more power, more control, and it's a heck of lot quieter than the automatic. Take my word for it, you'll love the car.

A few things need to be changed but overall it's a great car. The main selling point of any Suzuki is the warranty.  You can't beat 7 year/100,000 miles.  Plus, if you are a loyal customer to the dealer for your services, you get free tires as long as you own it.  For a base model, it has a lot more than any other base model you can get.  We were looking for budget...and that's what we got.  But this is by far the best bang for your buck as far as dependability goes.  Power isn't all there.

This car has never given me any problems and from what I have heard, I don't expect any down the line either. ",4.5

As a small 4 cylinder, I expect some noise, but once up to cruising speed, its suprisingly smooth and quiet. Extra space of the wagon makes it feel not-so-small.

But even with new ones, they kept leaking for some reason, so would have to put air in quite often. The rotors went bad very quickly also.

I found my 2000 GLX wagon on craigslist for $2500.00 with only 92k miles. It has every available option and is in excellent shape. I bought the car as a spare vehicle to save miles on our much more expensive Toyota Sienna. My daily driver was a deisel VW Jetta. But after the Jetta had a mechanical problem I started driving the Suzuki. That was 9 months ago and now the Suzuki is my daily driver. I love the reliability, gas mileage and hauling capacity of this GREAT little car. I do all the work on my cars and I can tell you Suzukis were designed with a mechanics input. They are cheap and easy to service and the parts are still available. Don't let the fact that Suzuki motors is no longer in business scare you off. This has driven the prices down and that is a plus in my book. If you loved the reliability and ingenuity of the cars Honda designed back in the 80s and 90s you will love Suzuki. These are great cars and I'm going to be looking for more of them when my kids approach driving age. Update: Feb 2018....still have my Esteem GLX wagon. The car has 140k miles now and other than an idle control valve and alternator, the car has been trouble free. I hate to recommend one of these as a first car for a teen because new drivers tear up cars and that reduces the number of these great little cars. But my son is approaching driving age and I’ll have let him use this car (sigh).... On the plus side I loved my Esteem so much that I decided to buy another Suzuki. I now own a 2009 SX. This is now my daily driver and I love it too. All wheel drive and every option for less than $7k.  Love it. Buy a Suzuki and get these guys back in the US car market where they belong.",5

The only problem we had was the outside door handles snapping some piece when it was very cold outside - it was an easy and cheap repair, but you can try to avoid it and just be very careful opening the doors when it's cold.

The back seat has been able to sit three kids on a regular basis even though two of them have been adult sized or nearly so. We do not take it long distances and I am sure that would get old with everyone in it but for distances up to an hour this car does fine even with my sons who are 6' tall sitting in the back seat.

The most expensive issue I've had with this car was the alternator, which is not really expensive compared to other issues that could have arisen. As far as comfort this car is extremely roomy for someone who not too tall or too overweight, it's not made to be a family car in my opinion( for a big family at least...get an SUV or mini van if that's what you're looking for) However, I can comfortably fit five people in my car with enough space for everyone. The trunk space is perfect, and the interior space is as well granted I don't have a back seat full of car seats.

Soon after that the suspension needed replaced. It wasn't long after that the inner and outer tie rods needed replaced. The materials are cheap. I had both inner door handles break off with little effort.  The headlight switch had a recall and it costed $100 to replace because the dealership I bought it at went bankrupt the check engine light will always come on for various reasons and each repair was costly because every part seamed to be a dealer part and most of the dealerships were closed by that time so I had to special order them. I had the car for almost 10 years and the transmission final went out on me after only 71000 miles dispite regular routine maintenance. Would of know the transmission was garbage when it would take forever just to get it up to 35mph and that was when I first bought the damn thing. For its size, it has poor fule mileage compared to midsized cars of its time and coolant was always leaking I to the fule system which ment if you didn't catch it in time, the engine would over heat.

Those were replaced under warranty.Other than that I was getting new rear pads almost twice a year.That's until water all of sudden showed up in my oil.

I'm tall and there is plenty of room, for me and my passengers. Doesn't leak oil, or anything like that. It starts up every morning, rain, snow, sun, anything it doesn't complain.

I purchased it used with 6,000 miles on it.  Then, when it hit 20k miles, there was a problem with the brakes and it wouldn't go into gear. Needless to say, the brakes are only covered to 12k miles. Now, the door handle fell off, my speedometer is off by 5+ mph depending  on your intended speed, a valve gasket is blown, and the power steering pump needs to be replaced. It only has 33k miles on it! This shouldn't happen, and while the warranty covers it, I'm still disappointed that I spent 10k on this when I could have bought a different make and had less problems.",3.125

I had it into the dealership 5 times for the same problem, corporate offices had to step in and fix it finally.

I was in the market for a Corola, but found the price too high. I paid at least 20% less, so I can live with the compromises.

I don't mind shifting, so the 5-speed gearbox is fine for me.  The downside to opting for a small, light vehicle is that you don't have the comfort or heft of a larger sedan.  Consequently, it can get a little uncomfortable on a road trip.  But for local trips this makes a good second car.  My only criticism is that the flow of air from the heater to the floor is insufficient.  I had this checked out by the dealer, and was told that everything is operating normally.

The A/C climate controls broke on both, only 43,000 miles on the second one! Right after warrantys were over of course! A $300.00 part! Had to pay the Dealership $90.00 to look at it and say ""yep its broke"" so they could send a report to the Manufacture in the hopes of fixing it free of charge or some kind of help? But of coarse they declined to help at all! This Multi Million Dollar company screwed over a loyal customer for $300.00!! The Dealership has never been very helpful or that friendly after you buy!

The stereo was good and was the most comfortable out of all the cars I test drove.  This is my work vehicle so comfort is important.  I have over 106K miles and the only thing I replaced is the brake switch.  It took two days to get from the dealership and cost me $15.00.  I replaced myself in their parking lot.

If only I had been wiser. It worked well for about the first 2 years. However, city MPG is usually 20 or less, which doesn't make much sense for a car of this size/class. I've had numerous issues with the car alarm randomly sounding & the engine not turning over at all. At one point, it took over 30 attempts to turn the engine over. It was in the shop 5 times, yet the Suzuki dealer couldn't solve the problems. Go figure. The paint job is cheap & chips/scratches way too easily. Buyer beware: you can get a brand-new used Corolla for about the same price as a new Forenza. Get the Corolla, avoid the hassle.",2.875

This car is rough and shoddy.  After the initial 500 miles were put on, any semblance of confidence in it was worn off.  I'll spare the details and just go on to two main points.   First, the value has dropped like a rock.  Second, anytime something needs done to this car, you better be ready to wait for the part to come in and be ready to pay through the nose for it.  I just got the brakes done - discs were $90/each and I had to wait a week.  Call your tire stores and find out how many of them stock 195/55R15 tires.  Few, if any will I'm sure.

I like the idea of it being a heavier car in its class, a little over 2700 lbs. I would only say this, if Suzuki put the muscle it puts into its motorcycles into its cars, WOW! I realize that Daewoo makes most of their autos but this company has such great potential in being more than it is. They say most of Suzuki's cars are quirky and I agree but this is why I like it. I am aware of some of Forena's mechanical problems, they are small and few compared to its competitors. Suzuki still has one of the best warranties in the Industry! Keep on digging in!",3.875

I don't doubt that these problems do indeed exist for its owner's but I have had only two problem's with mine. The CD player usually takes 10-15 insertion's before it will play.  This is the second one and it is as bad or worse than the first. It was replaced under warranty. The second problem is an erratic idle. Sometimes it will idle at 2,000+ RPMs at start-up or even after driving on the freeway and exiting, but I found a fix for this 98% of the time.  At 15+ MPH come to a HARD stop (no skid) and wait 3-4 seconds.  Why doe's this work? I have no clue. Otherwise I have has no problems. Also, performance tires make a HUGE improvement in the handling.

The interior is way better than the Aerio's lint trap.  The lighting resembles that of Lexus and Mercedes. I did have a few problems such as the ssps going out shortly after I bought it, and had it repaired three times. The headlights also went out completely. I have also put four headlights in the car in the last year. The center console / armrest really bugs the heck out of me though. I eventually broke the plastic latch, it has been bent both ways from getting in and out of the car and putting weight on it (imagine that, putting weight on an armrest).

That is, I would have right until I found out nobody sells parts for them but the dealer.  Before you buy one of these give your local parts store a call and ask if they carry Forenza parts.  Anything beyond something simple like an oil filter and it's back to the dealer you'll go, and you know the prices they charge.  Yup, I love the car all right, but the lack of repair parts means I'll get rid of it soon, and I won't buy one again unless that changes.  Too bad...",4.625

I did not however know where to start. If interested in buying this car, don't be. There is a lot of matience that comes with the type of car. I did purchase my car from a pay here buy here and I know it's not the greatest place to get one but as someone who is just starting to get started on establishing some credit it's hard to find somewhere to get a car. I saw this car I particular and I was very intrigued by it. It was my favorite color and it had great gas mileage and it would be a reliable car I was told. However the opposite is true. I have spent so much money into making this car driveable. So far I have had to replace normal wear and tear (tires and windshield wippers, etc.) I knew I would have to eventually. I did not think that I would have to spend so much though. I have since getting the car almost a year ago, replaced the engine, fuel pump, radiator and spark plugs. All in the matter of about 8 months. I had the car sitting from the first week I got it for 4 months because I could not drive it because of the fact that the engine pistons had bent inside of the engine. So in all I have only had the car for about 3 months out of the year because then it sat again because the radiator busted so I had to repair that.Edit.... I now do not have the car and sold it to a shop to take it apart and use it for scraps. At the end, my ignition started to go as well. I would drive it in the neighborhood and all of a sudden the car would slam on the brakes by itself and then start going again without me pressing the gas or break. If I did try to press either, the car wouldn’t do anything. It became a danger to not only me but the cars around me as well as my family. I had no other option but to sell it to a shop because of the danger it could cause to many more people. It has been a year since I sold the car and I am so happy that I did because now I know that the buy here pay here place that I got it from did not know anything about the car and that they only wanted money. Please please please, if you are searching for a car for your teenager, that you look at official shops and make sure that the car is thoroughly checked out. Also get a different car, yes gas mileage was the best with this car and I only had to fill it up a few times a month, if I drove long distances, it is not worth the hassle. I also saw that my car had a ton of reviews for problems with it and I had almost all of them in the first 8 months of having the car. If that doesn’t tell you that it’s not safe, then I don’t know what will!",2

I have spent thousands and thousands of dollars on every expensive repair you can imagine.  The car has been regularly breaking down and in and out of the shop once every 3 months or so.  In the past 6 months alone, I have spent over $1500 replacing serpentine belt, spark plugs, engine valve cover, alternator, and radiator.  Even after all these repairs car is non-driveable, now being diagnosed with a blown head gasket. Also the cadillidic converter is bad. Time for the junk yard, and car is only at 109,000!   Terrible fuel economy, terrible driving (very sluggish), slow breaking, heat and cooling system inside vehicle stopped functioning properly years ago.    I only drive this car 5 miles to work each day, mind you, at the speed limit.  What an awful vehicle.  And awful resale value, even if it was in perfect condition (blue book value of less than $1,500).",2
409, on 01/14/16 00:03 AM (PST),julie ,2007 Suzuki Forenza Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Hunk of Junk (but I've been lucky)," I got my 2007 Suzuki Forenza at Carmax in the summer of 2008. It had 5,000 miles on it. At first, it was a reliable car. When I hit 40,000 miles that's when the trouble started. The transmission started slipping. The transmission sensor went out and I had it worked on. They didn't fix the problem. There's no Suzuki dealership nearby me so Ford took over their issues. They have attempted to fix the transmission censor twice. It still slips. There's a useless ""hold"" button that I think may be part of the cause of this. The paint peeled off the door handles. (I've been lucky enough to not have a door handle break). The paint peeled off the bumper so badly that I took it to the car wash and blasted the paint completely off the entire bumper. It looks better black than peeling paint. Wheels warped. Windshield wipers decide when they want to work now and when they don't. At 72,000 miles I had to have the motor replaced. The head was cracked. I'm convinced that the dealership did NOT replace the motor (as they claimed). The head is cracked again and now they say the car is ""too old"" to replace the motor they said they just put in the car 2 years ago. If this were a ""new"" motor,  then why won't they stand behind it? I have to drive this car like I am driving a stick shift, even though it's an automatic transmission. It acts like its in neutral when I put it in drive. I have to start out in 2nd gear. Always. This car did not get that hot for the head to crack. The only way I even knew that it was overheating was when my boyfriend noticed that the temperature needle was on H. It only steamed. Did not boil. The seat belt latch on the driver side is broken. The passenger side is getting difficult to snap shut now. This car chews up tires. It has no takeoff power now. Lately,  I've just been pouring antifreeze in it every other day. The replacement parts are outrageously expensive for this cheap car. I refuse to take it very far, and when I do drive it, I worry and pray. This car has 95,4000 miles on it now. (That's why I consider myself llucky). It sounds like a John Deere tractor.  Thank the good Lord above I'm going to get another car next week!  Since this car has no resale value,  and isn't worth anything anyway, I will have to sell it to some poor Suzuki owner that needs it for replacement parts. I bought this car for the ""wonderful gas mileage"". HA! Not so great on gas after all. The best thing about this car is the seats are comfortable and it has a lot of room to be a small car.",3
410, on 10/13/15 20:38 PM (PDT),Mariah Driggers ,2007 Suzuki Forenza Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),NEVER PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE," This is by far the worst car ever. The transmission sensor doesn't work, it may at first but goes out in every single suzuki vehicle (check all reviews). The car locks go on and off while I am driving and makes a really loud noise and when I lock my doors it does it again and ends up leaving it un-locked I'm guessing thats another sensor out? The check engine light is always on. Not much of a gas saver to be honest. When you press on the gas it takes so long to kick off and makes a loud noise, when you shift gears it literally pops and the car shakes. The radio is not loud. Once I was on the interstate and my car just went into neutral, if a car was behind me it would have rammed into me. I have also been at stop lights and my car won't move because the sensor will think its in neutral. Never let a young adult drive this car they will not be safe!!!!!!!

It is sad that there are so many problems and no recalls. I have a 2007 Forenza & have had multiple issues. Tires are always in need of balancing, the door handles paint is starting to chip off, oil changes once a month because the oil light comes on and the engine knocks really hard even though there is plenty of oil, now as of yesterday, while I was driving, the trasnmission hit hard and the check engine light came on. The gear indicator flashes with a square with a line through it. I also almost got into an accident. Pep Boys ran the codes and as of many many other Forenza drivers, 7000 & 7005 came up. ",1

All of the good reviews are from 2006-2007 when the car is fairly new with not a lot of miles on it.  Seems like once it hits the 50,000-60,000 mile range is when things start to go pretty rough.  Our front door handles broke off quite early, but they replaced them at the dealership no problem.  Just recently the transmission has been slipping and has almost caused a few accidents.  I've noticed the tires aren't the greatest either, seems like a pretty uncommon tire size, too.  Luckily the car is under warranty, so hopefully I can get the transmission problem fixed soon.",2.625

Knock on wood.  That's all. I drove this car from Lawrenceviile, GA to Houston, TX twice (so you get the ideal miles I put on this car). I only now use this car to and from work.

While browsing for a few days I came across this car that only had 8500 miles on it for $9980.  One reason for the price drop was they dealer took the stock rims off and replaced them with 15 inch black rims with hubcaps on them. That was alright with me though because I can always replace that.  My Forenza is a manual transmission and unlike what other reviews have said on some Forenzas mine accelerates perfectly fine. The one and only complaint so far that I have about this car is that if the tires pressure is not perfect I get a light on in the car because of the TPMS. Overall though, good car so far!",4.75

The Forenza began to roll backwards into oncoming and merging traffic in a two lane construction area. I was able to avoid a serious multi-car accident with quick use of the emergency brake. The dealer wasn't immediately sure what went wrong and contacted Suzuki Tech Support. Sight unseen, they were told to order a list of parts including water pump, timing belt and complete head assembly. Suzuki denied the frequent occurrence of this failure, but knew the exact parts to replace? The water pump pulley had been installed backwards, allowing the timing belt to skip.

The main thing that I am not happy with is the gas milage.  I only get about 24-25 which is horriable and that's with babying it.

Easy to handle and rides very smooth. One drawback on the interior is the steering wheel blocks the speedometer. The seats adjust easily and are quite comfortable. Controls are easy to reach and use. Gas mileage is great I get around 34-35 hwy. It is an attractive looking car with many pluses when you compare it with the price of the vehicle.

The Forenza met all of my expectations and then some for this vehicle class and price range (base $10,499). I own a 5-speed and an automatic S-model version. The automatic shifts smoothly but lacks HP. The manual trans is peppy in comparison but stills lags behind it's competitors (Honda, Toyota, Nissan). Fuel economy is better with the manual trans.  My opinion remains high of this car. Needs a few improvements to be more competitive.",3.875
526, on 08/11/05 14:42 PM (PDT),Robert ,2005 Suzuki Forenza Sedan S 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 4A),The Good And The Bad," Overall I am satisied with the vehicle. It has a rigid body, well constructed and free of rattles or excessive road noise. The engine is strong, transmission shifting smooth, it should be better on gas though. It responds well to throttle and has good braking. The S mode provides many good standard options included in base price. By far the biggest mistake is in not providing cruise control as part of the standard options. The dealer is unable to install a cruise control as Suzuki does not offer one as a dealer option.  No other cruise control is offered by any other vendors. Now I am stuck with no hopes of ever getting a cruise control installed. ",4.5

First it would jut die while driving, then it idled all over the place, transmission (automatic) is rough and jumps a bit coming out of 2nd gear. And now the engine began making alot of noise so I took it in and the repairs are not being covered by that oh so wonderful warranty. I have been told three different causes for this trouble from the samw dealership mechanic. I don't believe they know what they are doing there. I will never own another suzuki again!

I bought the car new and have really put it through its paces. I have taken it from southern Kentucky down to Miami at about 1100 miles, three times. Most of the miles put on this car are highway. A/C went out after about 36000 miles with the warranty running out at 35000. The seat cloth pulls away and doesn't matter if you put it back on track or not.  Its a five speed so that may be why I am gettting better gas mileage than most of the reviews. I had to take it in for some recalls with the water pump and my dim lights went out because of the wirring harness. Overall not impressed but it's still running.",2.875

I looked really smart because the price of gas went through the roof right after I bought it. The only problems I have had was first it eats tires which I remedied by going to a 60 series tire instead of the 55 that it comes with. The other problem was when a critter ate the wire harness. The dealer fixed and was able to get most of the cost covered under warranty. I get over 30 mpg and drive the care everyday to work and to drumming jobs. The car holds so much that we take on our vacations even though my wifes car is bigger. It is great car but too bad Suzuki has discontinued it for 09. ,4.875

I REALLY didn't want it to be totaled & was so disappointed when I got the news from the insurance company. I really wish I still had my car. The Grand Vitara was the most reliable car I've ever owned, along with a Honda Civic I owned in the 90s. And I've owned lots of different cars- Oldsmobile, Mazda, Mercedes, BMW, etc....I never had any problems with the Vitara whatsoever. It had over 87,000 miles on it when I lost it, and I had never had to take it in for anything other than oil changes, battery replacement, and a recall on the catalytic converter. SUCH a reliable car! I took it to the mountains, it did great. Took it to the beach, it did great. Drove it for 12 hour drives out of town on more than one occasion, did great. Handled well on clear roads, snow & rain, smooth ride, super quiet, really comfortable, good speakers, good gas mileage. I could drive 5 hours straight on a full tank. The ONLY complaint I really can think of, is that since I'm pretty short, the headrest curved a bit towards the back of my head, so when driving long distances, my neck would start to hurt just a bit after a few hours- but that's literally because I'm short and due to where my head was in relation to the back of the seat. In the end, my head actually hit that part of the seat in my auto accident & caused me a nice bump. If you're around 5'3"" like me with a short torso, I would still highly recommend the car but just be aware of that. The cargo area was quite spacious- I have moved plenty of boxes & a desk at once with the back seats down, no problem. Suzuki did a great job with this car. It's really a beast & can handle lots of situations well. I'm so nervous to try any other car now!",5

I just wanted a small SUV because it's just me and my son. I'm 5'5 and have extreme back problems and can't stand cars because the pain of getting in and out of them was just too difficult. The GV seat is place exactly for my height. I can just sit and swing around to the front painlessly and effortlessly. The few things I wish it had was an outlet for my ipod, but they started making those even in other vehicles a couple of years later. I wish my steering wheel controls lit up. If I had only waited for the 2009, I see that was standard for it. It would be nice if the rear window could go down so my golden retriever could be placed in the back where's there more room, then in my back seat. My vehicle honestly doesn't use the gas everyone keeps saying it does. It's not the greatest, but it is 6 cylinders and an SUV so I don't know what people expect. In 2015 now, my GV only has 56,201 miles on it, and the kelly blue book price for trading it in sucks. My GV was hit while I was shopping and all they had to do was replace the plastic bumper and side door, which even came pre-painted, but it makes sounds like it was in a major collision, so I get value points dropped for that. It would also be nice to have removable cup holders so I could take them out and clean them. The back seat fold all the way up, but really it doesn't create more room, it would be nice if after folding them up, you could push a button to remove them. Mine didn't come with fog lights and I haven't checked to see how much it would cost me to get them put in. They now have an upgraded stereo system with navigation and all the plug-ins you could ask for and I'm tempted to purchase it, but if it won't upgrade my trade-in value, then I don't see the point....The only thing I don't like about my GV is the antenna.

I mainly do city driving, so yes, the gas mileage isn't the greatest, but not the worst either. I have taken it on a few runs to nearby states, and actually got top gas mileage. And I can fit us comfortably in it and we can look good in the new SUV! I too, would like lit features on the steering wheel, and a rear window that opens would have been a big plus!

I'm not kidding when I say it was the best car I've ever owned. It felt solid and was dependable. Very capable in snow. It helped save my parrot's life - I had to take her into the doctor's office during record snowfall and we made it. No major repairs. Just regular maintenance, be sure to keep fluids up especially the transmission transfer case and differential. The V6 engine is pretty fuel efficient if you keep the speed down to 55 or 60 mph. 23 mpg combined with mostly highway driving. I loved the design of the dash - major lights were white and blue, secondary controls in red. Very beautiful. The interior materials - dash and instrument panels where the radio is - are a step up from previous Suzuki's I've owned. My only complaint is with the CD Radio for the 2006 year. Plan on replacing it - the CD seems to break down quickly. If you replace it with a 2007 or newer CD player it will last. Great trivia - The Suzuki V6 engine is also used as an aircraft engine - for a 3/4 scale P-51 Mustang WWII reissue. Suzuki also helped design the Saturn Vue. I had to sell my GV because I am going on a long trip to Arizona and I needed something with less miles. My replacement car, a Mazda CX5 is nice but it doesn't have the feel of my GV.

It had plenty of room for all our kids' stuff, roomy backseat and windows that roll all the way down in the back. It is fun to drive and handles very well for an SUV. I do wish that it got better gas mileage but that is a factor that i am willing to sacrifice. It looks cute, and i LOVE driving it in the mud puddles around the house. Most of the time it is a muddy mess but after a trip to car wash it reveals perfect paint. NO fading or anything else. I might mention it is black. My opinion... 2 thumbs way up.

Really poor mpg, underpowered. Handles well after replace OEM Yokohama tires, which lasted only 20,000mi. Have had to replace the driver's seat cover because of poor fabric quality. Second will not last, either. Very cheap upholstery and even cheaper carpet (have covered with rubber mats). Brakes are spongy (common complaint) low-beam headlights have shadows and point at the pavement (can't be adjusted). Have an intermittent engine miss or transmission slip dealer can't find. Have ping in a u-joint that dealer replaced a faulty rear hub instead. Overall, this is not worth the money and has not held value.",3

Handles nicely. Being from the old school, keyless entry and drive is a waste. Too many settings for both windshield wipers and lights. Door locks drive me nuts. Up here in the mountains of NC it could use some extra hp and torque. The performance is much better in FL on flat land. We have taken this car on several trips and I have little complaint other than the mileage. The poor hwy mpg really is an issue for a small engine of this size.

I am a mechanic by trade and this setup is easier to maintain. However at 15,700 miles, the factory Yokohama tires are shot. I don't believe it to be an alignment issue since they are worn only on the inside just cheap tires. My wife insisted on the solid red one and I am very dissapointed that the paint is rapidly deteriorating, the mirrors are already faded to white on top. Also, there are too many cheap plastic trim pieces interior & exterior that easily fall off and im finding out resale value is really bad.

Just the normal oil & lubes and maintenance. My front brakes finally had to be replaced at around 42,000. My only complaint is that the MPG is too low for this size SUV with a 6 cylinder.

The power from the 2.7L V6 is adequate for most situations; I've never felt it didn't have enough power to pass or merge.  Could it use another 20hp and 30ft/lb of torque? Sure it could. For what it is, the little V6 does just fine.  The trans. sometimes stays in a lower gear longer than wanted (uphill climbs).  Releasing the gas pedal and allowing the trans to upshift, and then reapplying throttle very  gently, usually works to keep vehicle in highest gear possible.

This vehicle handles good on normal roads but when winter came it quickly changed. If I hit a patch of ice it swerves left to right. Had it checked out by the dealer--nothing wrong. Was told I must have driven too fast for conditions.  How could that be when everyone was passing me? Handles well in snow and heavy snow but forget the ice or slick spots on freeway. If you stomp on it so the 4x4 kicks in it helps but when you let off it we start slipping again. I don't feel safe in this car. I'll be trading it off soon. I'm going back to Ford. ,3.375

It handles very well, it's comfortable, I can take it off road, unlike other small SUV's, and it looks great. It's also the perfect size vacation vehicle for a family of three.  ",4.75

It has strength, but you'll be downshifting up hills and its not too soft about it. 2 weeks ago my wife swerved to miss a raccoon, flew off the road, flipped and rolled 6 times. The air bag deployed and this little car landed upright, my wife is alive along with two dogs. We just bought a new Suzuki to replace this one. Great Car!",4.25

It always starts, never gets stuck, and at 225,000 km has no rattles. I have never seen a vehicle like this that just keeps on going. Going to see if I can get to 300,000 kms. I am just antsy to get something else for a change. I think this is the real deal as it will go off road, has rear wheel drive so it corners well and with the v6 has lots of speed and power with manual tranny.

Thankfully there is some power behind the wheels. I have driven RAV4's and CR-V's they are totally gut-less. I love that there is a gush of power when you want to pass someone on the highway. The best part is that the gas mileage is great. The 2.5 litre 6-cyl. engine is the smallest 6-cyl. in the world. When you compare that to a common 4-cyl. displacement which is normaly 2.3 or 2.2 litres, it's not that much bigger.",4.625

Even after reaching 75,000 miles the engine runs strong, and the a/c works well.  The only negative is that Suzuki does not make its repair manuals available and few aftermarket products are readily available to the consumers.  I've had to fabricate the cold air intake, using a K&N filter and a piece of pvc tubing.

The GPS and owners manual were lost but I use my phone for GPS and Googled the manual. Almost 7 years of ownership and it just turned 49k miles with no problems. I live in the Phoenix, Arizona, area so it’s fairly flat. 25 MPG is normal. The 5 speed manual isn’t perfect, meaning it doesn’t shift like a Mazda 3’s 6 speed.  It’s not geared for speed off the line and 5th gear is a 1:1 ratio so there is no overdrive (a 6 speed would’ve improved things a lot). The front seats are not comfortable after an hour although I did add sheepskin seat covers to help a bit. Two sets of tires so far — the original Yokohama’s wore out quickly. Only took it to a dealer twice for minor recalls but there aren’t really any dealers anymore.  No problems though; it’s reliable and rugged.  Still looks good.  I use synthetic oil and drive about 8 or 9k between changes. Just drove it 2k miles to North Carolina with no difficulty. The side-opening rear gate is perfect for me. Good cargo room.

I decided on an SUV for the cargo capacity and wanted something compact, and different. Back in the 90's I had a Geo Metro, and my wife had a Geo Tracker, both were very well made and reliable, so it was a natural to go to the Grand Vitara.  I love this SUV, very well made, comfortable, and looks great. The only problem is a 16 gallon gas tank. Averaging 25 MPG, the tank is too small. Also, the radio stinks,too dim.

Now, the Suzuki SX4 Sport had all the options of the Mazda 3, the cool interior similar to the Sentra, and only a little more expensive than the base-model Cobalt. The paint is fantastic, I got the dark grey. And it drives like a sport sedan. ",4.625

It's always eager to downshift wich makes it hit that right note at all times. My mom even wanted to borrow it and she has a 07 BMW 3 series. She loved it until she crashed it. Wasn't anything major but the front bumper, radiator, grill and headlight needed replcing and she still rides the same if not better then the day I got her.

Not the fastest car on earth but it will put a smile on your face. So far we have put nearly 5000 miles on the odometer with no issues. Our sedan has the optional 17"" black painted wheels with machined face and they really set the car apart. With the addition of front fog lamps it looks great.

Suzuki needs a 5 speed auto in place of the 4 speed. I'm surpassing the city estimates easily, but the highway number seems pretty accurate.

She is garage kept and has her regular maintenance. I've never had any major issues. I believe there were 2 or 3 recalls which the dealership fixed right up with no problems. One of the dash lights where there gas gauge is located died about 2 years after I got her but it wasn't worth the price to pay to have it fixed, I can see the gauge with no problem so that never became a real problem.  She is super fun to drive, so much so my husband likes to drive her on the weekends. She's zippy, easy to handle, small enough to fit just about anywhere but yet it's roomy enough to fit a bike in the back with the back seats down. The AWD is great, we live in Central Florida and get lots of rain and I've always felt safe. My teenage daughters learned to drive in my car and have always felt comfortable. If I could I would buy a newer model but for now I will stick with my lil baby. When I see her in the parking lot I still think she looks so cute, sporty and fun. Mine is pearl white and has tinted windows which makes it look really sharp. When I see others without the tint I think it looks unfinished for some reason.Now the cons on her are all cosmetic. I still have the factory stereo which sounds great but there isn't a USB or Aux input for my iphone so I had to purchase a compatible plug which wasn't a problem. I'm sure I'll probably put a bluetooth stereo in soon. The other con is no front arm rest, so I purchased one online that sits in the middle holder and has a compartment. Also it seats 5 but the back seat isn't really comfortable for 3 adults. I got lucky and had 3 children but they did always complain it was uncomfortable and the headrests had to be raised up which was bad from me as the driver because I had a hard time seeing out the back window.I love this car and will love her til she gives out on me which hopefully won't be for a long time.**UPDATE: 6-13-17 I still own my car but my 18 year old daughter drives it about 90% of the time. She loves it and has decided that instead of her purchasing a new vehicle she would like to buy mine and for me get a new car. Only reason I would give it up is because I feel it's a safe, reliable, well maintained car for her and she's very comfortable in it to drive to college. She's 5'4"" about 135lbs and she says it's the perfect fit for her. We did put an aftermarket bluetooth stereo so that was a big bonus for her.***OH Knock on Wood!!!

Guess what , if you aren't aware , your emissions warranty runs out at 80,000 miles and there's no getting around it. The trouble code is for a catalytic flow efficiency problem that is more likely an oxygen sensor fault like Nissan has just experienced .

Very fun to drive despite the relatively sluggish performance. The outward visibility takes some getting used to but in general it is as good as it gets in a car of this configuration. I've discovered one odd thing about this car that prospective buyers should know: the owner's manual says that the AWD/AT version cannot be towed with either the front or rear wheels on the pavement due to potential damage of the drivetrain. I haven't asked my dealer about this yet but I can't believe that any car maker would design a car that requires a flatbed tow truck. The standard transmission and FWD versions do not carry this warning.,4.625

If rear facing, it has to be in the middle and it's hard to get it as stable. If you put it on the outside areas of the backseat, there is no room for the front seat driver or passenger to get adequate leg room or tilt their seats back. And we're NOT tall people.

True it could get a few extra miles per gallon and a little extra highway power would be welcome but overall this AWD is a real find. Great looks, a well thought out interior and lots of space for a subcompact make the selection easy. The price is a real bonus.

In the market for a new VW Golf originally. On the way to pick up the Golf, we passed by Suzuki, the SX4 caught our eye,we stopped in for a last minute look. The styling, wheels and features had us nearly sold on it before driving it. Once we drove it, that sealed the deal. It was way more sophisticated than a Honda, Toyota etc. and was much funner to drive than the Golf, not to mention $6K cheaper, better warranty and more features. I do agree with the other reviews in that it could use leather, sunroof and heated seats, like you can get on Corollas,but Suzuki had to leave some room for improvement I suppose.",5

I was considering a jetta, my wife liked the mini Cooper, but after contemplating we landed at 2 Suzuki sx4s, one hatch back (cuter than a Cooper) and a sedan with the se package.

Overall the 150 hp engine is enough with manual 6 speed (I test drove automatic and it was also adequate), but not as much fun. The car gets attention, people always like the styling.

And it has a six, count 'em SIX speed manual transmission!  I was looking for a car with a manual to use as a commuter, and was able to buy this 2010 (in 2016) with 71K on it for $2700!  I was pretty happy, let me tell you.  It has been a blast to drive, even though in central Illinois the roads are pretty straight and flat.  The clutch take-up is p-e-r-f-e-c-t and the shifter is smooth and creamy - the nicest and easiest manual I think I've ever driven.  I think the Italian design is attractive/cute and this thing zips in and out of traffic lanes and parking spots with ease.  I have yet to reach it's handling limits, but will tell you they're very high.  This is like a reliable version of the Mini (which has pathetic reliability and costs much, much more).  The only things with which I take issue on the car are the sun visors that don't tilt forward enough and block my view (and let sunlight in on the sides) and poor AM radio reception.  That, and parts being a little tougher to find since Suzuki (cars) left the country.  Still plenty of parts available if you search hard enough, though - and oil filters, air filters, plugs etc are pretty standard sizes so super easy to find.  Oh, and insurance is a bit high - higher than my wife's '14 Honda CR-V, for some reason.  MPG has been good for me - about 31 mixed 60/40 hwy/city.  Plenty of front seat room - I'm 6' tall and 230 lbs and don't feel the least bit crowded - plenty of fore/aft and up/down adjustment.  Rear seat room does look tight on legroom, though - so it's probably best for short trips for adults or for mini-me's.  After doing my research, the only problem areas on these seem to be an errant airbag light (covered under recall), and the A/C compressor clutch.  Most genuine Suzuki's are bulletproof (not the Suzuki-named Daewoo models like Verona, Forenza, etc. though).   Anyway, this is my commuter and I'm getting to work with a big grin on my face (not that I'm happy to be at work) and looking forward to my next drive - it's seriously THAT fun.",5

It is comfortable to drive and has a surprising amount of interior room. It is not a luxury car, but the interior appointments are nice and as good as what you would find in other Japanese cars of this size. The fit and finish is above par, and the materials have proven to be durable to me under normal use. You can fold and flip up the rear seats to get lots of cargo carrying room with a fairly flat floor. I am the second owner of my 2009 which has the Technology package that came standard with a Garmin Nuvi navigation device that is cleverly built into a retractable compartment on the top of the dashboard. While it has a small screen, the voice directions are very clear, and you can download map updates from Garvin or third parties via the Internet.  The SX-4 scored well in crash tests, no doubt due to its rugged construction with front, side, and curtain air bags. It handles and brakes with precision. Its small size makes it easy to park  and drive on crowded streets, but it is stable enough for 70 m.p.h Interstate highway trips. Its acceleration is adequate. Its fuel economy is good. With 86,000 miles on mine, there have been no repairs needed except for normal maintenance like oil changes. A downside is that Suzuki no longer sells passenger vehicles in north America, but they do honor the 10 year 100,000 mile powertrain warranty at a network of dealers (my warranty is still in effect). I have heard that sourcing parts can be a challenge for major stuff if needed, but I have not needed any yet, and you can find many parts and accessories on eBay, including ""dress-up"" options, many of which come from China. Mine is not equipped with All Wheel Drive (we do not get winter road conditions in Florida), but I'd imagine that would really be good in many areas of the country with those ice and snow conditions. The resale prices are probably lower than equivalent cars due to Suzuki having gone out of business, so if you can find a low mileage SX4, I don't think you could go wrong in buying it.",5

So we took it in - the two catalytic converters are going bad... and guess how much it is to fix it... 3 grand. If something else goes wrong we're trading these in for something else. I'm so disappointed. Suzuki made older cars, like the X-90 and tracker which are nearly indestructible.",4

The only downside is less gas mileage than I would like.

When you see cars pulled off the side of the road, or trying and failing to climb an icy hill, you won't have a problem keeping going. Perfect if you need to get to work or to the Denver airport in marginal road conditions.

It was in perfect running condition and I pampered the car the entire time I owned it with monthly trips to the car wash and oil changes every 3,000 miles at Jiffy Lube with all recommended service being performed as well. Before I get into the demise of this vehicle I will warn anyone considering buying one of these, they have a ""known issue"" with O2 sensors failing every 2-3 years. Read various Suzuki forums if you don't believe me, it is notorious for this issue and Suzuki never did anything to resolve it. Expect to spend $150-$300 depending on the morals of the repair shop to have the sensor replaced, every 2-3 years. So, in 2008 my radiator sprung a leak, then the radiator hoses, then the pulleys started failing. First it was the accessory pulley, then the crank shaft pulley. Then the AC compressor and condenser both failed in the same month. Then the front brake calipers failed followed by the rear drum brake shoes. Then the tail pipe fell off, the manifold developed a leak and then the exhaust mounts failed. Thermostat failed, engine coil failed, and the rear brake light fell down. Pins that hold the bumpers on started disappearing, the handle of the oil dip stick snapped off, the interior driver door handle broke off, the exterior driver door handle snapped, the hood brace clip broke and the hinge for the fuel door has disintegrated. Now, I am not saying this vehicle isn't reliable, I put 220,000 miles on mine, but it has cost over $5,000 in repairs to keep it running. Once it hit that 6 year mark there was something each year that failed on the vehicle requiring repair. Suzuki left the US market, as a result, I would not recommend buying any Suzuki vehicle. You will run into difficulty finding parts to keep it running and the O2 sensor can and will fail on you frequently. I forgot to mention the steering knuckle also failed which required me having to find a part from China on eBay to get it repaired as the repair shop couldn't find one from any of their suppliers. I'm sending mine off to the junk yard to get whatever scrap value I can out of it.",3

The battery has been replaced four times, brakes twice, and windshield wipers, twice (still noisy). I have had to replace the oil pan, alternator and door handles. The entire underside is rusting and a recent mechanic asked me if I parked in a field because of the rust.I park in my driveway.

Had 2 mechanics try to fix it and the 1st put in a brand new compressor. Hopefully it can be repaired. Gets mighty hot around here in the summer! I saw an Aereo just like mine list for $5K.

She wasn't crazy about the car when i first bought it. Her complaints: You can not see the front bumper, you must allow extra turning room, extra room in front of you when driving, watch for curbs-ours sits low to the ground-previous owner added things to make it sporty looking.  She loves it now--she would not give it up if you asked her too.  I have kept up the servicing and except for the expensive cost of brakes and tires- I have had no other cost but oil changes and regular keep up. I Have been told by the guy who services it that parts for it are hard to get for it and that new parts for it usually need to be specially ordered and shipped in from over seas.  Our car named Midnight has 94 thousand miles,  48 thousand miles of it is ours-due to her n collage.  Car is still running strong, runs great on high grade fuel. As of 4/25/2017; {please remember we purchased our vehicle from someone we knew-not from a dealer. There was no warranty on it when we bought it.} i am still keeping up on the regular servicing for my daughter. Our guy that services it-checks everything, and i mean everything-including the cars wipers when i bring it in. Except for having to replace the radio/disc player that stopped working, I have had no other major repairs/there has been no big issues. Midnight is still running great and has almost 103 thousand miles. Today my daughter swears her car gets 36 miles to the gallon. it is more reliable then any of our other vehicles. Starts up and goes everyday.  It even runs wonderful in the snow. We have no complaints.  My daughter says she loves it and has us on the look out to pick up a second one in case something happens to Midnight-but at this time we haven't had any luck. I agreed on looking for the 2nd because I couldn't ask for a better car for her.",5

I've never had to do any major repairs, all I've ever had to do was regular maintenance  (which does include some hoses, etc.).  My milage is closer to 26 to 28 mpg or better.  I do have two complaints: 1. It's too low to the ground. I've tore my bumper up on parking curbs.  2. It doesn't have enough room between the seat and the petals--for me, I have long legs for a woman--I use the same length as a 6'2"" man on the truck I drive for work.

One of the all time best cars I have ever owned.  Rugged, dependable, useful, economical, easy to work on, and FUN!  It only had one dangerous problem.  I bought it for cheap 18 months ago in the summer and put 2,000 miles on it by winter.  Everything went well until it got really cold, and then the brakes literally ""froze up.""  Rock hard pedal and no stopping!  Scary!  My brother suggested I plumb-in an extra length of heater hose and wrap it around the brake-power-booster.  I did.  No more hard pedal, not even at 25 degrees below zero.  Now this little wonder is closer to perfect than it ever was!  Update:  It is now the fifth of March, 2017, and ""Rattles,"" as my humorous wife calls the yellow ray of sunshine, is still going strong, although I had to finally break down and put struts, rear brakes, and rear anti-sway bar bushings on it.  Small price to pay for all it does for us.  It is our parts runner, loaner car, occasional clean metal scrap delivery mule, and otherwise general gopher and ever-ready default vehicle.  It's like a Swiss Army Knife on wheels.  I can't say enough good things about it.  Precise Japanese engineering and eye-catching Italian design.  What more could anyone ask for?  Oh, and did I mention?  It's good, clean fun!  UPDATE 09/06/2017:  Still going strong, although it might be time for a front end alignment because it's pulling a little to the left.  Also, the plastic headlight housings must be about as el-cheapo as you can get because I have to work the cloudiness out of them about every three months.  I looked up the price of new ones and found that they average $220 for the pair.  Ouch.  I watched a video about changing them, and discovered it takes several hours because you have to remove most of the front end body parts to do it.  So I guess I'll keep sanding and polishing the old ones.  But it's worth it.  My wife and I took it (it took us, whatever) on a long drive through the countryside as part of our 33rd wedding anniversary celebration, and I was reminded of how good it sounds when downshifting to climb a hill or pass a farm tractor.  Fun, fun, fun.  And when we finally got home, the gas gauge needle had hardly moved.  UPDATE 09/06/2018:  Since the brakes aren't dangerous anymore in cold weather, we got to drive it enough last winter to really see how it handles snow.  Despite it's overall lightness, low ground clearance, strictly street tires, and slightly over zealous first gear ratio, it did better than expected, even through as much as 4-5 inches of wet stuff, as long as we slowed way down, planned ahead for turns and stops, and prayed continually.  During white-out blizzards and such we used our 4x4 truck.  Less white knuckles and prayers of thanks instead of for our hearts to slow down.

We also have an A6 quattro. The Audis have been unreliable and expensive.  We will never buy one again!   We were happily surprised to find an affordable AWD car to replace our daughter's A4. I only drove in the car when we first purchased it, from CT to FL. It has a super ride! It's roomy, comfy, and has nice dash controls w/great placement!  The cloth seats are awesome!  Our daughter thinks it is ""cheap"", but she was spoiled driving an Audi. She says that the AWD doesn't feel like it works, so I recommend you test drive the AWD in rain/snow if possible as I can't confirm daughter's complaint. I do know that I want my own Aerio.",4.625

It might depreciate faster than the Toyota, but I plan to keep car until the end of its warranty, at least seven years.  What I like most about the car is how it is so easy to get in and out of.  You don't sit down in this car, you sit up - just slide right in and buckle up. It has lots of foot room and lots of headroom in the back.  Does this height compromise cornering? As I do not do high speed chases through town, I haven't noticed. There is an occasional creak coming from somewhere that I could do without.  Also, I would have liked 16"" wheels.

Interior style nice, exterior different but we like it. Build quality not Lexus, but neither is price. Very peppy, amazingly little wind noise at 80 mph.

It's a little seen car that will last forever and is a blast to drive. It has plenty of headroom (something other Japanese cars like Hondas and Toyotas sometimes lack), has a spunky engine, performs well in winter. I drive my Aerio around to conventions all around the midwest, racked up tons of miles and any repairs it needs is routine maintainence and oil changes. And the best part - they are totally affordable! I bought mine used at 52,000 miles for $7,500. If you discover this hidden gem for sale, buy it!",4.75

I have beat this car into construction sites, drilled a guard rail doing 65 mph backwards, and drove it off road nailing rocks and going over logs. I replaced tires, two front wheel bearings at 150,000 miles, 4 front brake rotors, a serpentine belt.  It now needs a full exhaust system and a radiator, its not the most comfortable car on the market or the most fuel effecient but keep good fluids in it and it should provide you with adaquate transportation.

Suzuki made these cars with 'power- assisted' steering rather than power steering (so you have to put your shoulder into it), and 2. when you open the driver's window you break the vacuum seal and will feel air coming in through the floor speaker grill.

I did serious research on this purchase as it was my first new vehicle purchase and it came down to the Equator and the Tacoma.  Toyota did not seem to care if they sold the Tacoma to me, no incentives and the frame design is really sad compared to my old Toyota. So I went with the Equator which is rugged, durable, high quality, and well thought out and executed.  Course I have only had it a few months and any new vehicle is a good thing.  Still, I am really happy with this truck which sees lots of hunting trip use.  Well done, Suzuki!",4.875

The plastic trim crumbles, the exhaust manifold cracked and had to be replaced, the AC was not that strong.

The car has been very reliable with some problems here and there, but its mostly due to age. The transmission has never given me any problems. Its amazing in the snow; after 10 years of ownership, this year was the first year it got stuck in the snow because the street wasn't plowed and the vehicle got high centered. The snow was up halfway to my thighs (I'm 6'2). Recommended transmission fluid change for the A/T is at 100,000 which I reached 2 years ago. No problems with the transmission even though it had the original transmission fluid for 16 years. This car has a rust issue, but it has seen very severe winters over the years being in Boston when my cousin owned it and now here in NY with me. The rust has gotten so bad that the part where the chassis meets the bumper is has almost completely rusted away on one side. The most expensive repair has been the 4WD auto locking hub in the front left wheel that slipped out of place which was due to my dad accelerating too hard when he engaged 4WD; that part cost around $450-$500(labor inc). The other two expensive repairs was the EGR valve and alternator that each cost between $200-$250(labor inc). The car has been very reliable over the years. Being in NY it doesn't feel as solid as it once did because the potholes in my area are horrendous, at one point even loosened the plates in the muffler which caused it to rattle. We average about 12 mpg city because of the heavy traffic in our area and about 25mpg on long interstate stretched. The car has been great, but it is now 19 years old and its time for a new one.",4

It now has 110k on the odometer and I'm here to tell you that it's the best car I've ever owned in regards to being problem free and reliable.  This beast has never failed me.  Other than regular maintenance items, a p/s pump is all I've replaced.  When shopping for a new car back in 2006, I did my homework and checked all the sources for reviews and buying advice.  I knew that I was buying an old school SUV with full frame and that it wasn't going to be cutting edge with stability control and other modern features at the time.  Even today, the switch gear and controls still feel like new.  No rattles or squeaks and everything still works perfectly.   It's a bit clumsy in terms of handling and ride quality, but that's expected in the design of an 11 year old SUV.   The fuel mileage could be a little better and in all honesty, Suzuki should have stuffed another 20 or so horsepower into this little 2.7 V6.  It's definitely a little hp deficient, especially if you live in the mountains like we do.  On a positive note, this thing will literally climb a tree in 4wd low range.  The winter traction is truly unbelievable.  In summary, I've raised both my kids in this vehicle and would do it all over again. I will truly mourn the day I look in the rear view mirror and see our Suzie being left behind for a new SUV.",5

The reason I bought it was the warranty, the design, and the trade in deal they gave me.  It feels very solid and handles well, I am 6 feet tall and there is a lot of headroom.  I think the XL-7 could be a bit longer, but it is adeqaute with smaller kids.  We have the 3rd row seat which is very tight.  If the SUV was a foot longer the 3rd row would be a bit more pratical. We bought out XL-7 with 6,000 miles on it for $20000, $15,000 with our trade.  The dealer gave me $5,000 for a 1994 Ford Explorer Limited with 99,000 miles on it.

Considering you get automatic temperature control air conditioning, CD player, cruise control, and antilock brakes in the deal that's not too bad.  I've put 11,000 miles on it and have had no problems.  The build quality is quite good and the doors sound solid when you shut them.

My only regretis not paying a little more for theoptional 3rd row seat and rear a/c...thetruck's standard a/c can barely keep upon hot summer days.,4.625

I disagree with the reviews comparing this vehcile to a honda CRV.  In my case I compared it to a Honda Pilot.    Very Close in almost ever catagory with the exception the Honda had a Power seat.  In the end I did not see where the Honda was worth $6000 more.  Would highly recomend this vehicle,5

The third row seating converts in a second to flat storage after shopping and changes back to a bench just as quick for toting the kids carpool. Seriously, the 3rd row is cramped for adults but fine for children. It's compromise between storage and extra seating.This is my ninth new car purchase and by far, my favorite.",4.75

Very nice updates to the interior. The leather seats are very comfortable and of good quality and Suzuki has done a nice job of moving the placement of the radio, A/C controls to give the inside a better look and feel to it. Fully loaded my cost was just under $26,000. $26,000 for a fully loaded 4WD SUV with heated leather seats, CD-changer, power sunroof, power windows and locks is a steal. Other SUV's with those features will cost you $10,000 more easily. At $26,000 you can't beat what you get from the XL-7. ",5

The engine was replaced due to a mishap with the ""fast oil change place""not tightening down the oil plug, so My replacement engine has 50,000 less than the body and purrs like a cat.Self-adjusting timimg chain and all. Love this beast, and 22 mpg with 4x4 capable is an awesome value for reliable and capable travel. Keep an eye on the rust especially the frame and treat it early due to salt and sodium chloride on the roads . This rig is a one owner (16 years) and I don't look forward to getting rid of it.

Amazingly, the rear drum brake has never been changed and it always passes the inspection. It's on 170,000 mile now.Comes with lot of upgrade if you really into it. I installed rear catch net, rear door net storage, window rain deflector.Overall, you can not find any other car like this even today 2013 that is true 4x4",4

Had the over-size wheel/tire (option?). This XL-7 has been awesome. Dealer repairs VERY expensive. Driver seat back torn out due to years of toddler abuse (LoL). Car still drives like new. Fast steering - handles very similar to my Miata in fact - may give some used to the GM slush boxes some fun in the wind at highway speeds. Only problem was aluminum chips in early production A/C compressors caused a lot of failures in 01 02 XL-7s; and replacement / system flush averaged between $2000 and $2500 at the dealers.,4.625

Too bad that the dealer were so bad on fixing this one problem.  Other than that, the car has been perfect.  Love the fact that the gasoline door is on the passenger side.

However, the interior is small and compact in all roows of seating.  The dash organization is poorly done.  The radio is on the bottom of the dash and hard to reach and see, which I think makes it a danger to change stations when driving.  As far as the driving of the vechicle, it's okay on a perfect day with NO wind.  With even the slightest wind, it's nearly impossible to handle, for male and especially female adults.

I have never had a single mechanical problem.  The four wheel drive is excellent.  And, I like the versatility of the third row seat.  However, better quality interior materials would be nice to consider as a future improvement.  My son frequently rested his feet on the rear passenger seat when he was a toddler so that the pocket on the back seat ripped open.  In my opinion, for a car that is marketed to moms with kids, the seat ripped a little too easily.  And, the plastic trim around the sunroof has an annoying habit of coming loose.

The 3rd row seat is unusable.  Children barely fit never mind and adult.  And the gas mileage is horrible.  The inside is cheap looking.

There are some inconvenient, lack of room between benches, or a bit noisy once it passes the 50 miles per hou. The 185 HP is not enough either, but its performance in general is very good , considering that the price you pay is in the low 20s .

I've gone through all the normal stuff like tires, breaks, batteries, windshield wipers, headlights, oil changes and have very few complaints. 1 - not quite enough space for a rear-facing infant carrier. I have to pull up the passenger front seat to the point where only a small adult would be able to sit comfortably. I'm 5'7"" and can't sit as a passenger up front with a rear facing infant seat in the vehicle. 2 - I've got a bit of an oil leak and lose about 2 qts a month. 3 - my fuel economy has dropped to an average of 13-15 mpg regardless of city or highway miles. BUT THAT'S IT. Everything else about this vehicle has been amazing. It handles more like a car but after putting a tow hitch on myself (ridiculously super easy by the way to do so) I've been able to tow trailers and even drift boats without any issues. My XL7 handles well on both sand and even pebbly river banks (with a trailer even). It handles well in the snow and even ice, though I would suggest adding a few sandbags for extra weight when there is ice on the road for more than a day. It's a great height for transporting both kids and dogs as both can easily climb in and out on their own. There are child LATCHes which make it easy for child car-seats, booster-seats, and infant carriers to be snapped in and secured quickly.

It sits well and it feels a lot heavier than any economy car out there.  When driving at high speeds the Verona is as good a ride as you will get with some of the better known sedans.  Additional interior features like stereo controls in the steering provide an added bonus to owning this car which lacks popularity and resale value.  However, I have to admit that the transmission shifts awkwardly when decelerating sometimes and it's really not that great on gas.  Overall this car is a decent buy if you can get a great deal on it.  Otherwise, if you have a few hundred dollars extra to spend, I'd suggest you get a more renowned car.",4

The acceleration is a little on the poor side, but it is quite smooth and going high speeds is no trouble.  I have to step on the gas when I start it because it is so quiet. but remember it is a luxury sedan, not a sports car.  I also do not hear any wind noise whatsoever.  On the handling you have to drive the car for at least 600 miles to get the feel for it. I can handle mine pretty well now.  I went from a Volvo to a Suzuki.  Overall it is different and I do like this car.",4

The speedometer needle fell off (no kidding,it fell completely off and was sitting in the bottom of the gauge housing).  My car has been stalling during sharp acceleration.  This is very dangerous, it would stall and almost die.  As you can imagine, this is not much fun when pulling into traffic.  The dealer could not do anything to repair this problem.  It must be a characteristic of this car.  It has done it since it was new. It is hard to start when it is cold outside.  The dealer I bought the car from quit dealing with Suzuki.

I still can honestly say it is quicker than the Ford Taurus base V6, and much quieter to boot. This is a family sedan, not a sports car. I love both the unique interior and exterior design.

Most reviewers assume that you want a 4-cyl for fuel economy and a 6-cyl for power, so they knock the Verona for not being either one.  But Suzuki chose a 6-cyl that was as small as the average 4-cyl on purpose: smoothness and even power.  It cruises over Rocky Mountain passes at 75 mph without straining at all.  I'll probably spend only $1000 more in gas over the 5 years I'll own it, but I saved $4-5k on the sticker price similarly-equipped Accord or Camry.  It looks better, too.

We were impressed with how it drove, the feel and comfort levels inside of the car, and for parents of 2 small children, it was imperative to have space in the trunk to carry strollers, etc.  The Verona has lots of basic needs, that cost extra on other comparable cars.

Just recently, however, I had to have the timing chain kit replaced again after only two years. No warranty coverage this time and it wasn't cheap. $2000!  Additionally, the wheel bearings on the front wheels also needed replacing. And the hatch struts had to be replaced again. I was not happy. Inferior replacement parts, perhaps? Other than that the car continues to be reliable. It seats seven adults, though the rear seat should be reserved for smaller folks or kids. I've had three teenage girls ride comfortably back there! It rides comfortably and fairly quietly; it has an extraordinary number of standard feature not usually found on a base model. And it can be used to haul a LOT of stuff if you choose to put all the seats down. The gas mileage is not great - 15-17 around town and 22-28 on the highway.

I had a Jeep Grand Cherokee before this car so I wasn't sure how I was going to like the AWD compared to the 4 wheel drive but it handles really well. I have never worried about getting places and I've driven in pretty deep snow drifts. My husband has to keep reminding me about the speed limit because this car just wants to go! The ride is comfortable and my Grandma likes it because its easy for her to get in and out. I wish Suzuki would keep making these because I would buy this car over and over again!,5

2432, on 07/14/16 07:19 AM (PDT),David ,2006 Suzuki XL-7 SUV Premium 4dr SUV 4WD (2.7L 6cyl 5A),Best $27K I've spent," Bought our XL7 Premium 4x4 new in May of 2006 and still own it.  It now has 110k on the odometer and I'm here to tell you that it's the best car I've ever owned in regards to being problem free and reliable.  This beast has never failed me.  Other than regular maintenance items, a p/s pump is all I've replaced.  When shopping for a new car back in 2006, I did my homework and checked all the sources for reviews and buying advice.  I knew that I was buying an old school SUV with full frame and that it wasn't going to be cutting edge with stability control and other modern features at the time.  Even today, the switch gear and controls still feel like new.  No rattles or squeaks and everything still works perfectly.   It's a bit clumsy in terms of handling and ride quality, but that's expected in the design of an 11 year old SUV.   The fuel mileage could be a little better and in all honesty, Suzuki should have stuffed another 20 or so horsepower into this little 2.7 V6.  It's definitely a little hp deficient, especially if you live in the mountains like we do.  On a positive note, this thing will literally climb a tree in 4wd low range.  The winter traction is truly unbelievable.  In summary, I've raised both my kids in this vehicle and would do it all over again. I will truly mourn the day I look in the rear view mirror and see our Suzie being left behind for a new SUV.",5

A-pillars block vision around turns. I find my knee rubs on the console and my shoulder rubs on the b-pillar. Window switches are poorly-placed. Overhead console is garbage. Seats are comfortable enough but other factors distract me from a comfortable drive. You get what you pay for.",3.375

The AWD and the automatic stability control do not affect the joy of driving it but it feels different than our old one.",4.875

It's roomy, handles nicely and is unique and stylish.  I feel like I bought a luxury car without the luxury price.  Mine is the base model and does not have the 3rd row of seats, so I have loads of cargo room which is great for groceries, and the kid's sports gear or whatever else I need to haul.  It rides very nice, getting in and out is easy because it's not that high off the ground, but it's not too low either.  But when you're driving it, you feel like it's up a little higher than a car mostly because of the adjustable seat.  I'm short, so I have it the whole way up.  All in all, the more I drive it, the more I love it.",4.875

Areas of future improvement should be the brakes, which require a significant amount of pressure, and rear view visibility is limited. Fuel economy on the highways has been fair at 24 mpg. After 3500 miles not a single problem. Good value for the money. If you do your own oil changes it is no fun to get the oil filter off since it is easier to take out an appendix.",5

For mom versatility and room of a minivan. For the kids style with dvd & gaming input. For elderly parent easy of entry and exit (ladder not needed). We bought the limited w/dvd and everyone just loves it and after 12 years in a minivan, that's a lot for a crossover. If you are looking for a crossover or minivan, don't overlook the suzuki XL7 '07.

It's little but has a powerful engine.  Now my wife drives a brand new XL-7.  It is roomy, handles like a fancy sedan, responds excellently and there's no way it compares to the Equinox. I tested both, the XL-7 has European window switches, a charger 4 manual speed, and most importantly my whole crew (3 kids), grandma, and grandpa fit comfortably in it. My salesperson provided outstanding customer service.  I paid under $23,000 for it. We are very happy with it.  We can't wait for the summer and drive it up to Yosemite. It;s too fancy for off road driving. ",5

It is hard to find all this for the price that I paid in any other make/model.  this truck is very fun to drive and looks great too.  ",5

The engine was replaced due to a mishap with the ""fast oil change place""not tightening down the oil plug, so My replacement engine has 50,000 less than the body and purrs like a cat.Self-adjusting timimg chain and all. Love this beast, and 22 mpg with 4x4 capable is an awesome value for reliable and capable travel. Keep an eye on the rust especially the frame and treat it early due to salt and sodium chloride on the roads . This rig is a one owner (16 years) and I don't look forward to getting rid of it.

Amazingly, the rear drum brake has never been changed and it always passes the inspection. It's on 170,000 mile now.Comes with lot of upgrade if you really into it.

I have gone from 91k miles up to 215k and it's still running like a champ despite my lack of consistent maintenance. I've gone through all the normal stuff like tires, breaks, batteries, windshield wipers, headlights, oil changes and have very few complaints. 1 - not quite enough space for a rear-facing infant carrier. I have to pull up the passenger front seat to the point where only a small adult would be able to sit comfortably. I'm 5'7"" and can't sit as a passenger up front with a rear facing infant seat in the vehicle. 2 - I've got a bit of an oil leak and lose about 2 qts a month. 3 - my fuel economy has dropped to an average of 13-15 mpg regardless of city or highway miles. BUT THAT'S IT. Everything else about this vehicle has been amazing. It handles more like a car but after putting a tow hitch on myself (ridiculously super easy by the way to do so) I've been able to tow trailers and even drift boats without any issues. My XL7 handles well on both sand and even pebbly river banks (with a trailer even). It handles well in the snow and even ice, though I would suggest adding a few sandbags for extra weight when there is ice on the road for more than a day. It's a great height for transporting both kids and dogs as both can easily climb in and out on their own.

I have gone from 91k miles up to 215k and it's still running like a champ despite my lack of consistent maintenance. I've gone through all the normal stuff like tires, breaks, batteries, windshield wipers, headlights, oil changes and have very few complaints. 1 - not quite enough space for a rear-facing infant carrier. I have to pull up the passenger front seat to the point where only a small adult would be able to sit comfortably. I'm 5'7"" and can't sit as a passenger up front with a rear facing infant seat in the vehicle. 2 - I've got a bit of an oil leak and lose about 2 qts a month. 3 - my fuel economy has dropped to an average of 13-15 mpg regardless of city or highway miles. BUT THAT'S IT. Everything else about this vehicle has been amazing. It handles more like a car but after putting a tow hitch on myself (ridiculously super easy by the way to do so) I've been able to tow trailers and even drift boats without any issues. My XL7 handles well on both sand and even pebbly river banks (with a trailer even). It handles well in the snow and even ice, though I would suggest adding a few sandbags for extra weight when there is ice on the road for more than a day. It's a great height for transporting both kids and dogs as both can easily climb in and out on their own. There are child LATCHes which make it easy for child car-seats, booster-seats, and infant carriers to be snapped in and secured quickly. Overall, I have been thoroughly impressed and VERY PLEASED with my XL7. Like I said 215k miles and still going strong!",4

It had a good, higher powered engine that was fun to drive and could accelerate faster than most similarly priced SUVs. Very smooth ride and great traction even in snow. Felt like you were riding on a cloud!  Stood out on the road with its unique lights and grill, too. Gas mileage left a little to be desired though.  The main purpose of this review is to praise the safety of the vehicle though. The car was broadsided during a left turn directly in the drivers door by a sedan going over 50 mph. The side air bags and door impact frames absorbed the blow completely. We were thankfully able to walk away with no damage whatsoever.",4.5

The seven year 100,000 mile power train warranty provides long time peace of mind. The automatic ac works beautifully and was an extra not expected in a vehicle of this price.

After years of renting a car and paying their fees, I decided to buy one. The idiot in me decided to buy a car over the internet and not test drive it. Unfortunately, it was the XL7. It had decent reviews online, a great warranty, it was cheap, and looked pretty good. But after 6,000, my thoughts have changed. The engine struggles around 65mph, and is full on panting at 70mph. The altitude may play a roll in this, but not that much. The car is put together well, but everything is a hard, hollow plastic. I get the MPG they say of around 17-19 Highway.

I then started to look at the specs and wow...it had a lot of features (especially for the price and the iAWD system). Not even a single problem so far. The only complaints is the wipers are not the best and the gas mileage could be better, but I mean it is a heavy car that does not get stuck in any snow/ice. It has a wonderful Rockford Fosgate audio system and you can put it front-wheel drive or intelligent all-wheel drive whenever you want with a push of a button. I had 2 Audi A4 Quattro in the past and the Kizashi handles even better. It is basically an A4 (same features, same look), but a lot cheaper and more RELIABLE. You won't regret it!UPDATE (July 2016/62 000 km or 39 000 miles) : Still the best car I ever owned....incredible in the snow! Very reliable, comfortable, etc. The audio system is awesome. I did not change anything besides the original tires, the rear rotors and all the breaks.UPDATE (July 2017/80 000 km or 50 000 miles) : No issue to report. Still an awesome car!UPDATE (June 2018/ 100 000 km) : No issue to report. Thinking about my next car (3-4 years from now probably), but I still love my Kizashi!",5

2879, on 11/08/11 17:13 PM (PST),edbearnz ,2011 Suzuki Kizashi Sedan Sport SLS 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Is this the best value car you can buy?," We recently purchased our second new car, (weve had many second hand cars over the years), having had to sell our 12 year-old Nissan Pulsar SLX due to me breaking my back in a car accident last year. The seating position of the Pulsar was no longer tenable for me and I had to get a vehicle with a higher, more ergonomically correct seat. We bought the Pulsar new in 1999 and it had been a pleasure to own and was well specced for the time with ABS, driver's air-bag, four-wheel disc brakes, air-conditioning, factory alloys and the engine was chain-drive DOHC with VVT. It was the cheapest car to own we'd ever had and I was sad to see it go. After briefly considering second hand cars, I was conscious that had I been driving a vehicle with traction control, I would not have crashed, spinning out on oil, so when looking at later models with this feature I decided to go with another new car. My requirements centered around my physical needs, but I wanted several other things. The car had to have the latest in technology as I felt it was a waste of time buying older technology that was already outdated and due to be replaced. I wanted fuel economy that was at least as good as the 1600cc Nissan Pulsar auto we'd just sold and the car had to be value for money.  We wanted an automatic so manual cars were not considered. This ruled out the otherwise excellent Ford Fiesta Econetic as it was only available in manual form. So too, the Toyota Rav4 diesel, the petrol being too thirsty. It became apparent early on that the small cars of today are excellent vehicles and all were superior in power and economy, ride and handling and of course features by comparison to our 12 year old Pulsar, with the Honda City the best over all, but the Swift being cheaper equalled the ride and comfort factor emphasising to me just why it is NZ's best selling small car. Also in the early running was the Honda Insight hybrid, which I liked but the passenger seat was uncomfortable and my wife didn't like the rear view through the mirror, the split window was disconcerting to her. So despite the lowest running costs, even over the Fiesta once RUC's, were counted, (Road User Charges - New Zealand has a separate charge for mileage on diesel vehicles on a $ per Kilometer basis, and Diesel fuel is not taxed at the pump. Depending on size and type of vehicle you pay a particular charge per Kilometer), the Insight dropped off the list. I looked at SUV's but despite the great performance and economy of the new generation diesel's, with the Hyundai ix35 being the best of them, I didn't need the size and expense. On a $ per km figure including RUC's they were going to cost the same as the medium sized petrol cars to run. So that left me to look at the medium car market as an alternative to buying a small car. The Suzuki SX4i AWD is unique and a great wee SUV with comfort, features and power, but let itself down on wind and engine noise. A shame because otherwise I'd have bought it! It was amazing to realise that the new cars with 2.4lt engines could equal the Pulsar for fuel economy while being a lot bigger and a lot more powerful! I compared the Ford Mondeo Titanium Hatch diesel, the Toyota Camry, Honda Accord Euro, Hyundai i45, VW Passat and the Suzuki Kizashi Ltd. and Sport. The Camry was the first to go as it was dearer and less economical and while the ride and seating were comfortable it was very plain-Jane. It was also a run-out model, due to be replaced with an all new one. The VW was too dear as was the Honda Accord. The Hyundai was my early favourite for technology, style, economy, features and seemed good value. It was perfect in driving position and nearly took the prize. Until I tried the Kizashi... What can I say? I run out of superlatives to describe this car! All the neighbours are jealous, all our friends love it, especially the colour and my wife doesn't want to get out of it. The heated seats and dual-zone climate air were the clincher for her, as was the colour and tints which set the car off beautifully! My back is happy and we look forward to many years of service from what has to be the best mid-sized car on the road today! ",4.75

I encourage anyone looking for a midsized or sport sedan to do yourself a favor and test drive the Kizashi, due to poor marketing efforts by Suzuki the Kizashi is not known and is not selling very well which gives the buyer good leverage when negotiating a deal, I got mine for $3600 less than the sticker price and I also got 0% financing for 60 months.",5

It has plenty of pep, and handles hills well even in cruise control, and the transmission crosses the hills efficiently and quietly, unlike some cars I've driven. Bought the car for my wife, and she loves the memory seats. I purchased the FWD for a bit better gas mileage. Lived in Buffalo 15 years and even there never needed 4 wheel. Happy that Suzuki made the FWD available. ",4.875

I saw it, drove it, and could not get it out of my mind. I test drove the 2011 Hyundai Sonata, 2011 Subaru Legacy, 2010 Chevy Malibu, 2010 Ford Fusion, and the Kizashi beat them all. The layout of the controls on the steering wheel is perfect. Everything is in the right spot and on the correct side. I have been averaging 25-29 MPG while using AC. The doors close solid, it is smooth and quiet on the highway, and the interior quality is the best. It turns on a nickel ( a dime is really too small). I only have 1006 miles on my Kizashi but nothing compares. I am so glad I picked this car. I like it more every time I drive it. ",5

So far, really like the smooth drive, very comfortable interior.  Has good acceleration and power.  Haven't used the AWD, yet.  Will use it for ski trips in winter.  The mpg is not quite as high as I thought it would be.  The styling is sharp.  I like having a unique car; easy to find in a big parking lot.  Haven't seen another Kizashi on the road.  ",4.875
2906, on 09/04/10 00:00 AM (PDT),ToddA ,2010 Suzuki Kizashi Sedan GTS 4dr Sedan AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),10 out of 10  - Not your typical Suzuki," I honestly was looking at Mercedes and Audi, the C300 Sport and A4. In between the two dealerships was the New Sutliff Suzuki. Having owned 2 Suzuki's before I knew they were good, reliable, tough little cars... But what's this big BMW looking car on the lot? After a little deliberating and going back and forth between the Big two I choose the Suzuki. Why? It's just better all around. The lower cost is a bonus. Having the only one in the corporate lot is a big plus. It drives like a BMW (think 2002-2006 3 series), has build quality like a Mercedes (seriously, not kidding around it does) and all the safety features of an Audi A8 (10 airbags, EuroNCAP 5 star-higher than C300)!",5
2907, on 08/28/10 18:26 PM (PDT),jim ,2010 Suzuki Kizashi Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Great car, feels expensive"," Driving off the lot, I could not believe that I had gotten such a cheap deal on a car that drives like a BMW. And I've had BMWs. The interior is excellent, every time you take the time to look around it, it feels like you're in a car that's worth at least 20K more. The exterior is excellent as well, it's a lot like the Lexus IS but has a bit more curves. I really believe once you get in this car, you'll be sold. The problem with Suzuki is that not a lot of people know it, but it's really a well kept secret worth discovering. The only negative thing about this car is the uncertainty of reliability, it looks like it will be a great car as it's solidly built. The 10 year warranty is comfort",4.75

I spent 20+mins going over the exterior of this car looking for defects in the paint ( scratches, chips dents ) and nothing was visible. I drove the car home ( approx. 4 km ) and was very shocked to see several paint chips in the passenger side door.  The next day I drove this car to work on paved roads ( approx. 70 km ) The car now has several more paint chips.  This car most definitely has a paint issue.  I am not sure if it has something to do with the coating they applied for me at no cost.  I will be talking to the dealership about this, however I have no confidence that they will support me based on other reviews I have read.",4.625

It is very solid, interior is simple with a tasteful design.  I can either just sit in or stand outside this car and stare at it.  It is so pleasing to drive and it  easy to speed due to the quiet and solid ride. I've had it almost one month and have 1400 miles on it.  My friends love it as much as I do.  The design reminds me of a Jetta or an Audi.  I wanted to buy an American car but noting appealed to me.  I like the new Buick but that is not in my budget.  I feel as if I got all of the luxury features or more expensive cars for so much less.  Just drive one you'll see what I'm saying!         ",4.625

Handling is comparable to a BMW, styling is over the top! Price, WOW. 24,695 sticker, paid 21,000 OTD. For the individual's commenting on the paint quality, I agree it may not have the thickest paint coating, but it's very durable. Try waxing your car with a polymer based wax. Performance on this car is great with the 2.4 and 6 spd manual, I did not care for the CVT. Do your self a favor, BUY ONE!!  ",5

Only 10 days old with 700 miles on it and the car's gears stop shifting and the rpm were running 4-5k at 30-40 mph.  We switched to manual mode and the car worked for a little while but switched automatically to drive mode and revved the engine again at 30-40 mph.  Pulled over for the third time and shut car off and tried again in manual mode. This time car gas pedal would not work.  Car worked in reverse not in drive or manual mode.

We had a long courtship.  Yesterday, we tied the knot.  For months I dated a VW CC, Hyundai Genesis, Nissan Maxima, and this little terror named Kizashi.  My friends said, ""Don't pick her.  She's weird, has a funny name, no one's heard of her, you surely can't get your golf bag in her trunk.""  But every time I took her out (and I test drove her 4 times), she was awesome.  Now, she's mine.   Comfort?  A.  Technology  A.    Driving sensation?  A.    I could have married a slightly faster or prettier one, but I'm not much for gold-diggers.  I like value.  We are gonna go the distance.  And the golf bag fits just fine.  ",5

MacGregor ,2010 Suzuki Kizashi Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl CVT),What a Change!," When we purchased our Kizashi,we put Pur-gen in the tires and switched to Mobil 1(synthetic oil). We then gave it a wax job.  The first time out, we averaged 33.9 MPG on the highway.  On the second trip we averaged 35.6 MPG.  On the third trip which included half city driving, we averaged 32.5 MPG. The car had excellent control and power on the highway and is very comfortable. I did not like the low profile tires as they seem to have more road noise, but was definitely quieter than my previous vehicle when it came to other noise. The Uni-body is solid and tight. What a great surprise.    ",5

At first I thought it was rock chips but the more I paint chips I find on my car it appears to be a defective paint job...paint lifting off the car and flaking off.

Interior is great too. Having a lot of fun driving this car. Turning a lot of heads . Yes Suzuki make great cars too.

I had never heard of or seen a Kizashi until I was in the local mall and they had one on display. I fell in love with the exterior look, and after a week of research, I owned one. So far I have zero buyer's remorse. I am 37 years old and this car fits my style to a tee. It has a classy feel, yet it has a youthful spirit that makes it very fun to drive. The CVT transmission is slick and combined with the fine tuned suspension, this car feels like it is riding on air most of the time. Usually I stay away from a car in it's first year of release, but I am happy I am one of the first to own one of these slick little rides.",5

My vehicle has numerous paint chips in it and I have had it for < 2 months.  I live in the mid-west and haven't even driven it on a dirt road yet. It also has scratches everywhere from rocks.  Paint quality is horrible. Took it to the dealership I bought it from that was 2 1/2 hours away.  The service manager took pictures of every chip at that time.  Came home and discovered there were 10 new chips from my 2 1/2 hour ride home on the highway.  Suzuki says they don't consider this to be a paint issue and it is not covered by the warranty.

My last car was a 2009 Suzuki SX4 AWD automatic touring crossover. The SX4 was just ok, and didn't ignite any passions. Then, I test drove the Kizashi when it finally came to Denver. It reminded me so much of my most favorite car, a 2005 MB C-Class 4matic. I was instantly in love. For over a month, I thought long and hard about whether I really wanted another Suzuki. I really have never been a fan of the company. But, perceptions can change. I ultimately got a 2010 Suzuki Kizashi SLS AWD Automatic in Platinum Silver. I love it more than beloved baby Benz.",5

I have a pearl black fully loaded version, the only version sold in Canada. So far, the car has been phenomenal. It is quiet, refined, interior is all leather and very well put together. The sporty ride and good power are as advertised, and very impressive. I am getting used to the CVT, but the paddle-shifters compensate for tranny issues, as I would have preferred a stick, but it is not sold here. It is not an Audi, but is very close, and for $20,000 less than a comparably equipped A-4, I am a happy camper. I will likely avoid all of the reliability issues/problems encountered with the audis in the long run. Great job.",5

The entire car feels like it's carved out of a solid piece of rock! Ergonomics are terrific. Interior design and materials are topnotch. Gives the impression of being a much more expensive car. Beautiful gauges, especially at night. Engine is silent at cruise and idle and has plenty of power. The CVT took some getting used to, but seems to work well especially at highway speeds. Been averaging 27 mpg mixed and about 32 mpg highway. For me, this car is the perfect size.  Most other midsized cars, like my Mazda6, have grown too large.

Suzuki did a great job with the interior of the car, one will notice excellent interior materials and ergonomics, in my opinion it is much better than usual competition. The awd is a plus and the fact that one can turn it off is an excellent feature.

My only Con about the car so far is the CVT while in ""Drive"" mode tends to upshift you into 6th gear WAY too soon, and if you're not heavy with your right foot, it tends to Bog down. However, in Manual mode, where ""YOU"" make the shifts, the accelaration for this 2.4 Engine is Amazing 3rd & 4th gears..even 5th are Great for on ramps & passing..6th is a Take it easy overdrive.

It is quiet with little wind intrusion and has a great Rockford Fosgate stereo (10 speakers w/subwoofer) to eliminate any noise that might otherwise exist. The 6 speed manual shifts well and the clutch is easier to use than the A3. Love the smartkey system and am amazed at how fast the heat comes on.
