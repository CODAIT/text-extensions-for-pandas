The emergency cable never really engaged properly so it had to be adjusted as well as the sunroof at a cost. A faulty ABS contact reeel and front axle shaft had to be replaced due to recalls. The headlight washer fell off and had to be replaced twice. As if we didnt feel nickeled and dimed already, we now have to replace the Fire Trap Housing not covered on the warranty. We are very disappointed.",3.125
1, on 08/29/10 08:28 AM (PDT),aikiman ,2008 Volvo S60 Sedan 2.5T 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),First Volvo," This is my first Volvo, had an Acura and Maxima before this.  I've had this car for approx 18 mos, bought it used with 9500 miles and love it.  It is built very tight and feels heavier than it is.  The turbo gives it a lot of power when merging or trying to pass. Highway driving is excellent, it definitely loves to cruise. The back seat is tight, I have  an 8 year old and 10 year old and I have to move the passenger seat and my seat forward for them.  Quality so far is fine,front headlight washers needed new motors and the computer has had to be updated once because the immobilizer would occasionally get triggered preventing it from starting.  Problem fixed but it still does it sometimes.",4.625
2, on 05/09/09 11:51 AM (PDT),Central Florida ,2008 Volvo S60 Sedan 2.5T 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),My first Volvo, I've had my Volvo 10 months and love it! I traded in my SUV in order to save on gas.  I have not had any problems and I get better gas mileage than I thought I would --- about 35 Hwy as long as I drive 69mph. Very very happy overall!,5
3, on 11/21/08 18:11 PM (PST),lordway ,2008 Volvo S60 Sedan 2.5T 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),Relability Stinks," I liked this car a lot when I first bought it. Now I regret my purchase. It's too small for a normal sized person and forget about fitting anyone in the back seat. It's too small for even a child. The trunk space is not practical. It's not a true sport sedan and the gas mileage is poor considering its size and that it has only 5 cylinders. Furthermore, the relability is suspect. It has been to the dealership 4 times in 4 months for two intermitent problems (antilock brakes and the radio). No resolution for the second problem yet. The dealer has not been able to fix the problem without keeping the car for a week at a time. Bottom line: Don't make my mistake, buy Japanese.     ",1.875

Wife and myself sat in the S40 just looked at each other and  knew that we didnt want another small car, took the s60 out for a test drive and we were hooked. It was love at first sight. Within 3 hours we drove the machine home. This is not a car, its a driving machine. Of course that coming out of a Nissan that dragged you down the road while the S60 gives you a ride on the road. It was late and the s60 tank was on empty, stopped for gas 3.65 a gal it took $44 to fill the tank. Now I remember why I bought the Nissan. Driving it home we were all smiles.",3.875

Out of the whole its a bit tnetative but the turbo takes it to the moon. Passing cars on the highway is a kick and shooting the mountain passes is like driving grand prix. Only real downsides are rear seat has very little room (kids only) and the fuel economy is not that great, 25mpg at 75 on highway, 22 at 90.",4.75

The AWD is awesome.  The car is heavier than my last T5 S60, although inside it is almost identical. The drive is powerful, and the acceleration with the geartronic transmission makes the car very fun to drive.  The leather, stereo, etc., is just enough luxury for me.  Sad to say I haven't had it 2 full months and it will be in the shop already because the temperature gauge does not work and the fan will not stop.  Car currently sounds like a jet plane after starting it.",4.125
8, on 11/01/07 19:27 PM (PDT),Mc Mom  ,2008 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 4dr Sedan (2.4L 5cyl Turbo 5A),Not a minivan - thank goodness," This car is fun to drive and is just beautiful to look at. It's great for driving kids around, but even more fun when you get to drive it on your own. No one will ever suspect this is Mom's Taxi. This is no minivan, but has lots of room for 5 and a huge trunk. I never thought I would drive a Volvo, but my T5 is just awesome.",4.75

The adjustable suspension and stereo are amazing.This car does take some getting used to, however.I cannot start the engine without feeling as though it guzzled an 1/8th of a tank.The turning circle makes you think of Kirstie Alley trying to do gymnastics, when in a parking lot.Once you unleash it on the road however, all of that disappears as fast the cars in your rear view mirror.",4.5

12, on 10/23/09 05:02 AM (PDT),Lynne ,2006 Volvo S60 R R 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Disappointed With Car, I purchased this care when I gave my Nissan Altima to my daughter due to her car being totaled.  I am totally disappointed with the care and am trading it in after only having it for less than two years.  The turning radius is bad and the main problem is the alignment.  I have had to buy two complete new sets of tires during that period.  Last time was because I had a blowout on the highway.  The alignment has to be redesigned so it isn't so sensitive to any bumps.  Car definitely didn't live up to my expectations.,2.625

The car is super powerful and extremely comfortable. It is a pleasure to drive and the Dolby Pro-Logic II stereo sounds great! So far, fuel mileage is much better than expected at about 22- 24mpg around town and 28-30mpg on the highway. My only complaint is the most common one amongst R owners: turning radius. ",5

With only 22,000 miles car smells and drives like it just rolled off the assembly line. One issue I have is the summer OEM tires which are worn out. They're being replaced with Ultra-High Performance M+S Yokohoma's Advan S4. With a treadwear rating of 400 and rotation every 6,000 miles I should get approx. 40,000 - 50,000 miles out of these Yokohoma's) C4 Suspension settings >> Comfort, Sport and Advanced.

But speed trumps safety if you slap an R badge on the boot! This car is the ultimate in sexy edge exterior design and endless creature comforts. Not seats, thrones!  Ive had the car for a little over two years now and everyday I cant wait to get inside! Especially now with a custom 3 turbo-back exhaust (solves your turbo lag problem BTW). ZERO maintenance issues save for the 2006 software gremlin that magically turns your R into a 240 DL. Great Fuel economy!

HOWEVER, for about $10,000 less than these German competitors, the Volvo S60R is an outstanding value.  I just leased a 2007 model and got an amazing deal.  A 36-month lease on an Audi S4, BMW M3, or Mercedes C55 would have cost me an additional $250 per month - not worth it in my opinion.  The value proposition presented by the S60R was hard to pass up!

24, on 11/05/06 22:50 PM (PST),FastCar ,2006 Volvo S60 R R 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Discreet Fun," I looked at BMW, Audi, and MB, and by far the best power/quality/features combination for the money was the S60R.  The car performs at its best with quality 93 octane gasoline.  By quality I mean from Shell, Exxon, Chevron, etc., not Texaco, Citgo, etc.  Any low quality gas or under 93 octane and you will have a non turbo S60 2.5L.  Also, it is important to have the foot on the entire accelerator pedal for best results. City driving and hard acceleration now and then, yields 21-22 mpg.  Almost nobody knows what is under the hood, so it is fun to see other drivers trying to race you from light to light and being left behind every single time.",4.75
25, on 11/03/06 19:51 PM (PST),Satisfied Dad ,2006 Volvo S60 R R 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Not just your average sophisticated look," I considered the S60R for over a year before I purchased. In fact, until I saw it in Grey I had decided to buy another brand. I AM SO HAPPY I DIDN'T.  The car is unique to look at , you hardly see R on the road and anyone who's knows performance sedans is aware of what it can do head to head. My neighbor ended up ordering the new 300 Lexus with the 307hp motor. My car came in a week earlier then his, the look on his face said ""I wish I had considered the R"".

The impact sent me into the car ahead and broke my seat (Volvo safety design, break-away front seats).  The Honda Insight which hit me square on the back bumper was totaled, and unless you looked at the rear deck of the Honda, you wouldnt know what it was that hit me.  The Volvo trunk, bumper was smashed back to the rear wheels and some damage was found in the bracing, not the frame.  The car wasnt totaled since the damage was about 24K and the value was north of 32K.  The main thing was I walked away!",4.5
27, on 07/22/06 07:41 AM (PDT),MyS60RRR ,2006 Volvo S60 R R 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Peace of mind," I have had a lot of cars over the years, but the Volvo S60 R sedan is probably the most fun to Drive and the safest. I traded in my Infiniti G35 coupe for the R car. I like being able to select my suspension setting from comfort (soft) to Advanced (Stiff) where you can feel not only feel the bumps in the road but also the cracks. The acceleration is outstanding. The car is also all wheel drive and will be useful in the winter. ",5

I initially looked at an STI, but figured I'd need a kidney transplant after a long trip.  I'd never heard of the S60R, but when I learned about it, I found it fit my lifestyle to a ""T"".  It's a sports car when I want it to be, and a people hauler when it needs to be.  The trunk is surprisingly large.  Passengers can't stop commenting on how supple the leather is.  I can't wait to go to work in the morning because I get to drive my car there.  I bet it'd be a kick on the racetrack...on/off ramps are a hoot.  This is the best car I've ever owned.

The best feature of this car is the active chassis setting. You really see the difference in handling on the different road types. The performance of the car is great. My transmission is auto, the manual trans take away one full sec from 0-60. The quality of the interior is excellent; you will see all the gizmos that the car has. The space of the back seats is very small. But if you have kids just buy a mini van. If you are going to buy a Volvo s60r I recommend you to buy the sport body option. This option gives the car the sporty look that will turn head.This car is also AWD; basically the car is glue to the road. ",5

I think it's super quick with the automatic; feels a lot quicker than an '05 demo I drove last year and faster than the spec. Great seats, and the adjustable suspension really works.  So far, it's been problem free for 5 months.  Good price: $37K for automatic with some packsges(amounted to $300 over invoice AND less $2250 incentive.)  We may have gotten the last one for while, since it doesn't look like Volvo will make an '07 R and there's talk of dropping the S60 altogether.

Best advice!  We loved it and bought it.  More luxury than we expected, handles amazingly and so damn fast!

34, on 03/21/06 18:20 PM (PST),Paul from MA ,2006 Volvo S60 R R 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Volvo's Secret," Volvo's secret is the buy of the year. Fast, safe, stylish and 10 to 15K less expensive than an Audi S4 or BMW 540i.Great interior(except for the roof liner). The Brembo brakes inspire confidence to drive faster than you should. The shifter is quick and precise but the clutch is a little quirky. Steering could be a little more precise, but this is subjective as my last car was an Audi TT. The suspension in either sport or advanced provides a nice tight ride and in comfort(which I use when my wife is with me) is still fun and very smooth. Its a ggod thing that few people know about the R or I may have had a much longer wait to get this car (2 weeks, it was on the boat).",4.75

Also didn't want a common choice (Audi, Infinity, Acura, BMW) however we tested them all.  The S60R was a real suprise in the interior department - VERY plush and comfortable.  Back seat is for children only, though.  Trunk is large, and doors are easy to enter/exit.  Safety features are everywhere. Exterior is real sharp with sleek lines and sporty look.  The fun part of this car is it's speed and handling.  High velocity going around a big bend in ""advanced"" is thrilling - tight with great control.

I would have liked to purchase more of the extras, but wanted an S60R now!  After the test drive I lost sleep waiting to purchase.  I would have purchased two, but opted to purchase a Dodge Charger SRT-8 as our ""bigger"" car.  The sixth gear is an asset.  The fuel economy is nice.  We traded in our 2004 S60 and feel that the R version is heads and shoulders above the competition and other S60 models.  The gauges are gorgeous!!  The overall interior room could be a bit bigger (this is my one and only negative point).  But the size is just right for a small family.  As you step into the car, an ambiance of complete safety surrounds you. ",5

In 4 months time, I have had 3 tire blow outs, replaced a rim, had a faulty passanger airbag that does not work(the sensor had to be ordered since the car is so new) and my ipod adaptor broke.  I was tired of spending more time at Volvo service than driving the car. I was fed up with all this happening with a 4 month old car.

However, it is the most well balanced car.  It is like a japanese katana blade, it has a fierce power in the torque, horse power and the AWD really really HUGS the road.  S60R is not only a fast car but the safest on the road. Volvo has finally stepped up in its foundation in safe now they are moving into speed.  i love it when you turn on the car the turbo sound really speaks to me like its telling me to drive me FAST!  i top this car at 138 i would had gone faster but didnt bother too.

My selection criteria were: 300 hp, AWD, and convertible; and I looked at GS300 AWD, G35 AWD, Z Roadster, M3, 330 xi, C55 AMG, SLK 350, WRX STi, and S4.  None of the cars match all three criteria, but the S60 R did the best at the most affordable price.  I also like the fact you don't see them everywhere like you would with a BMW.

I put on a lot of highway mileage and am constantly surprised at the reserve of power available.  Ramps and corners can be taken safely at speeds that would couse wrecks in other cars.  The Canadian model comes with every option (except snow tires) that anyone needs or could want.  I considered Audi, BMW and G35, but these cars just don't have the same power/safety per dollar value (the Audi and G35 are also very unattractive vehicles, in my opinion).  BMW (M3)is too small, lacks 4WD, expensive to repair and more suitable for people who want snob appeal.",4.75

Great handling and tire grip. . 4-piston Brembo front and rear brakes stop on a dime. The BEST feature is the adjustable suspension, which has 3 positions: Comfort, Sport, amd Agreesive, which increase suspension stiffness and enhance handling further! And the agressive mode puts the transmission in the Sport mode, which inceases acceleration! Comfort, considering the 18"" wheels, is very good, but don't expect the ride to be as soft as a Buick. Also, rear seat is a bit cramped. Just one more inch of leg room would help! Great reliabilty, great durability/build quality, and excellent value! Phenomenal car!",4.75

49, on 02/11/18 14:08 PM (PST),andy ,2006 Volvo S60 Sedan 2.5T 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),"Good performance, bad steering"," This car looks great and performs great. The turbo gives a good boost of power for merging. The steering radius isn't awful but isn't good. You need to get used to having to turn the wheel more if you are transitioning from another car. It isn't terrible for making turns, etc., but for avoiding potholes and such you will need to jerk your wheel more. It isn't instant response like expected. The interior feels pretty high quality. It rattles a bit in my car and some carpeting on the front pillars are peeling off, but I attribute that to the age. There are strange decisions like how the back seats don't have door pockets, and the anti whiplash headrests for the front seats are too tall to give backseat passengers a good view out the front which is lame. There is little backseat legroom, but it's not absolutely awful. There are interesting features like auto folding back headrests, and an additional two cupholders if you unlatch the cupholder part of the center console (that's 2 cupholders in front + 2 extra cupholders in front + 2 in rear). There is some cheapness like if your model does not come with foglamps, the buttons are still there and there are cutouts for fog lamps on the outside which are empty. The controls could be less confusing. The radio is just unnecessarily complex and climate controls are unnecessarily complex, but once you figure them out it isn't too bad. I don't like how there is no knob to adjust radio stations, just an auto scan button. The volume knob on my vehicle is broken, but the steering wheel has them built in which is nice. Still surprising it broke. The non-premium sound system sucks. There is barely any base or clarity, and my 18 year old Buick Century's stereo was 4x better with stock stereo (until it blew). Very disappointing. The leather seats are really comfortable and you get a lot of adjustments including lumbar support for front, and they don't look too bad for the age (just a few aesthetic cracks). I don't understand how the trunk really works. Sometimes pressing on the handle to unlatch the trunk works, sometimes it doesn't. I do not like how when you unlock the car it doesn't flash the lights. The key fob will work from afar but you can never tell if it really unlocked, but it has a neat remote light activation feature. The headlights will turn off if the car is off regardless of the knob position, and can't be manually turned back on as far as I can tell. Only the high beams work when off. It isn't a big deal, but it's a strange decision. The headlights/tail lights should stay on and turn off automatically after a few minutes for safety in my opinion. The glovebox is too small, and the center console storage is deep but not long enough. The wiper controls don't make a ton of sense. You have several positions for the wiper stalk, custom speed position where you use the knob to adjust speed, low speed preset position, and high speed preset position. It appears to make sense once you learn it, but the custom speed position sets a max wiper speed and you must use the low speed or high speed preset if you need it faster than what the wiper speed is when the knob is turned as far as it can go. I don't like how the windshields are designed. They are ""set into"" the car. That is, they have a raised border on the left and right edges, so removing snow is a pain because the snow gets stuck on the edges. The door handles are the old design and can freeze, although the doors on this car are pretty well designed because they don't really freeze. I do not like how the access door to the trunk from the backseat is designed. The release button for the trunk access door is in the trunk, and it opens into the rear seat instead of into the trunk, covering the armrest when it is down. And if you need to close the armrest, you need to close the trunk access door too and you can't unlatch it again without going into the trunk. The trunk has pretty good space, by the way. For a car all about safety, I'm surprised foglights, tire pressure sensors, and stability control aren't standard, although there is a plethora of air bags and neat anti-whiplash front seats. By the way, the car is pretty safe, although it is not as safe in side impacts as some other non-safety-centric cars of the same era ironically. Repairs are probably expensive, but this car seems to have an okay if not good reputation for reliability.",4

All worth it after seeing the incredible damage to her car (probably will be totaled) while ours was not only driveable but barely touched (repair costs TBD).  The WHIPS system really worked to reduce the feel of the impact and our 2 year old in the back seat didn't even know we were hit.  If safety matters, the S60 is an excellent choice.  We often joke that we feel like we are driving a tank - but this time were grateful that we were!    All the little electronic issues seem worth it now.  ",4

When we saw the high performance Volvo at a much more reasonable price than an M car, we had to try it. Car has great styling, raw power, sophisticated suspension and powerful brakes. The interior is very comfortable and the seats are simply the best.  The car is stable and corners very flat. There is no real noticable turbo lag. The suspension is expectedly stiff, even on the ""comfort"" setting. Engine is not as smooth as some others but it comes across a bit as a hot rod. It is pretty thirsty when driving spiritedly (which you will want to do often).  The S60R is a bargain and we have been very pleased. ",4.75

174, on 07/27/17 09:46 AM (PDT),Edan S. ,2004 Volvo S60 Sedan 2.5T AWD 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),Volvo S60 Is Just Alright With Me," I'm not quite sure what to say about the S60, I bought it to replace my 2000 Volvo V70, which I loved.  I sort of bought this car because I was getting reading to take a winter road trip to Montana and wanted something with AWD.  I would have preferred an XC-70, but couldn't find one for the right price or in the time I allotted myself.  I ended up seeing my S60 for sale at the local BMW dealership for $6995 with 102,000 miles.  It was a one-owner vehicle purchased from and always serviced on time at the local Volvo dealership in town.  After taxes and fees I think I ended up spending more than $8K, which in retrospect was way too high.  I did, however, end up getting new tires (Michelin all seasons) right away, the old ones were ""ok,"" but not great, some sheep skin seat covers (some of the stitching split on the driver's side seat), and some OEM Volvo all-weather floor mats (all worthwhile investments).  So the car, it's much smoother than my old wagon, great acceleration despite the additional 600lbs of the Haldex AWD system, decent gas mileage and road handling.  Like all Volvos, the seats are supremely comfortable--second-to-none!  My car's trial by fire was a 900+ mile road trip to  Montana in December amid regular blizzards and arctic temperatures.  My gas mileage was pretty decent over 28mpg at over 80mph most of the time.  As with most vehicle, it handles really poorly on ice, it does however, do great in the snow.  Once those back wheels start to grip, the thing can go almost anywhere (within reason).  I did find out at the dealership during my last service that my control arm bushings are bad, so that might account for some of the sketchiness on the ice and just the freeway in general.  Much to my surprise yet again, the A/C and heating systems are some of the best I've encountered!  Some of the other reviews have mentioned the cramped nature of the backseats, that is true, it's very tight with a full-size adult sitting back there.  The trunk while spacious has a fairly narrow opening which makes it a difficult to put some things in.  I have a wheeled cooler that I like to take to the beach which often has to sit on the backseat rather than in the trunk.  It fits fine in my wife's 2007 Jetta, but that has a higher and wider trunk I guess.  Overall, I don't have a lot of gripes with this car.  I enjoy driving it and it's a nice looking vehicle.  One of my biggest concerns though is the creeps, groans, and clunks I was experiencing over the winter.  Anytime I would go over uneven pavement or speed humps the car made some weird noises from the front end.  Maybe it's some back chassis bushings, maybe it is the control arms, or it could even be the struts?  All I know is it makes me apprehensive when it happens.  It's been great over the summer though, no issues like that whatsoever.  I can foresee this car treating me well for the foreseeable future.  Will it be as good as my old V-70? Only time will tell.",4

But then I see that most people raving about this car also say this is one of the only cars they've ever owned, so that puts things into context. This is HORRIBLY EXPENSIVE AND UNRELIABLE CAR. I'll get into that in a little while, but let me list the pros and cons before I list all the reliability issues. Pros- Exterior has a classic, timeless look. Not unlike a similar year BMW 5 Series.- Luxury car with low resale value, inexpensive to buy- Great Handling on corners- Turbo Engine available with non-premium gasCons- TURNING RADIUS IS THE WORST IVE EVER SEEN IN A SEDAN. - Horribly designed cabin. Cheap hard plastic at literally all of the places you rest your knees when you drive. (Door handle and side of middle gear shift console).- Small back window and poor visibility- Fuel Economy is crap. It's 19/27 and most of the 3 years I spent driving this car, I averaged sub 21 mpg. It's only recently with 90% highway driving that I'm getting 24 mpg combined- Sound System and Speakers are lacking - Center console/dash is just ugly- Green interior lights give it a 1980s feel. My 03 Honda Accord Coupe had red and gray. Now for the REAL problem. I bought this used with 75K and am now at 120K. I made the decision early on not to put money into this vehicle unless it was for required maintenance Best decision I've made as it has saved me over 10K in repairs in that time.- CD Player doesn't eject any CDs or take any CDs in. On/Off button is glitchy, and there is an electrical short somewhere in the car that I'm 90 % sure is related to the non-working audio system. I haven't used it AT ALL for the last 15K miles because it almost killed me, twice. - That electrical short, on TWO occasions, KNOCKED OUT THE TRANSMISSION COMPUTER AND MY CAR FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO EXPLODE! I HAD TO PULL TO THE SIDE AND CALL TRIPLE AAA. I literally haven't turned on stereo since because I'm scared for my life when I drive this car. Both times the transmission shop said that nothing can be done because the short is ruining the transmission computer unless I want to spend hundreds of dollars to find the short. Better not to use the stereo at all. - The driver's side leather seat has completely ripped at both sides. The passenger's side power window adjuster broke so now I can't use that window (the part is 300+) and the shocks on that side are messed up too. - There is rattling from 3 or 4 different areas and the window noise from the passenger's side window is super loud. - The Fuel gauge is idiotic. 75-80% of your car fuel can be used and still be on half way and then the other half of your fuel gauge empties out incredibly quickly. This is a HORRIBLE car. I had a 03 Honda Accord coupe that was in a frontal collision and drove for 130K miles with absolutely no problems even coming close to the issues I've had with this car.

I had previously owned a 2003 BMW 3-series that was riddled with problems and kept my wallet pretty slim... I needed AWD/4WD because I go to school in an area where it snows a lot. I have yet to report on how the AWD is in the snow but I've been disappointed so far with how it takes off in the rain (maybe its because of the KUMHO tires)... In terms of reliability, I've gotten the oil changed 2 times already at my local Volvo dealership, both times, they've said the car looked amazing and needed nothing. I may get the Transmission fluid done on my next visit because sometimes from 1st-2nd gear it flares after a long highway drive. My particular car has the sport seats but doesn't have the GPS or the Xenon headlight option... bummer. The seats feel amazing, even after sitting in the car for 7+ hours non-stop!!! The back seats seriously lack leg-room and the turning radius absolutely sucks.... Aside from those two negatives, I'd totally recommend this car to anyone! Mine of course was a 2 owner car, very well taken care of at the dealership/volvo indy shop. After 11 years, this car still looks amazing and people still ask me if its brand new. Take care of it, feed it premium fuel, only use synthetic oil, and it'll return the favor!!!",5

Almost 15 years later, it now has 201,000 miles on it and is still going strong. Other than a tiny parking lot door ding on one side (very annoying), which I will have a mobile dent guy repair, and a bit of wear on the door side of the driver's leather seat, the car still looks like new when it's just had a good wash. I agree the turning radius is bad and can make u-turns challenging. I understand Volvo fixed the problem in the new models. It is certainly the most comfortable car I have ever driven. When I bought this car, I was considering a Mercedes or BMW. But the Volvo was so comfortable and had such great get up & go that I abandoned the Mercedes/BMW idea as soon as I test drove the Volvo. I have followed the manufacturer's maintenance schedule, except I now get regular maintenance every 3-4K miles instead of every 7500 miles. And I use oil for high mileage cars. MPG has dropped as it's aged, but I can still get about 25 MPG on the highway and about 20 MPG with city driving.

243, on 11/15/15 22:45 PM (PST),MYOB ,2015 Volvo S60 T6 R-Design T6 R-Design 4dr Sedan AWD w/Prod. End 6/14 (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),"29 months in, very pleased but wish we got the V60"," S60 R design Platinum.   Zero issues over the past 2 years plus.  Mileage is 22.5mpg short trips mostly with a couple of highway trips a year, 28 mpg on expressway at 70mph,   Gas tank is maybe 17 gal so range is only about 450 miles w/o pushing your luck.  Acceleration is as much as a sane person would every need.  Effortless and tons of torque is around way down low in the rev band.   Smooth engine that growls if you punch it but is otherwise quiet.   Throttle uptake is very touchy, unfortunately, taking a light foot to avoid lurching forward. Steering is precise but could use more road feel, though almost no cars have that any more.  AWD and 350 lb ft of torque are a great pairing, as you can floor it from a stop and turn into traffic with no fear of fishtailing, and it gives great confidence.  Minimal body roll, changed to almost none with the addition of an aftermarket tuner rear anti-sway bar.  I have since removed the aftermarket bar and sold it, finding it unnecessary.  Handling is confidence inspiring.  Reviews that talk of small differences between this and BMW are living in a fantasy land where people oversteer their cars around curves on public roads.   The G forces you feel in turns are more than enough to have you slow down before the grip of the tires is lost to understeer.   This is a sport sedan, not a sports car.  Braking is not as quick as the XC60,  with the pedal having more play before it really bites.  Once you're used to the difference it's fine.  Ride quality is firm but never harsh, noise levels are good on good roads, higher on bad ones.  But again, never uncomfortable.   Better ride and noise levels than our E90 BMW 3 series with 18"" wheels, I'd say.   We have the 19"" on this R design.   But this car will not please those looking for luxury quiet first and foremost.   On concrete expressways you get tire hum.Trunk is pretty small,  rear seat room isn't an issue for us but it isn't big.  But we added 2 more dogs for a total of 4 so we wish we'd waited to find a V60 R design for the extra space in back. Insurance costs are low ($850/yr full coverage $500K liability) but we are middle aged.  The upgraded Platinum level Stereo is surprisingly good for having no dedicated sub-woofer.  The Nav system is not very good at all.   Just use your phone or a Garmin.  It will send you on crazy turns on small roads and the interface is cumbersome.   The dash is great looking and the big digital speed readout really makes a HUD superfluous.   Climate control works fine, the interface for the entertainment system is not touch but works fine once you learn that the button on the wheel controls most things. (along with one on the panel your passenger can operate)Comfort is great on long trips, the seats are the best I've had in a sedan.  They soften with time, btw.   Visibility is not great in blind spots.  I thought the BLIS was a waste of money, but it really comes in handy in heavy expressway traffic where long looks at your blind spot are not always safe.   I still check, but do so knowing my BLIS will back me up and alert if I try to signal a turn with someone there.   It also has the ability to ""See""   cars overtaking you and prevent you from getting in front of them if there isn't time for them to react.   It works very well and unobtrusively with a light most of the time, alerting only if you attempt to change lanes.  The interior has held up well and I expect it to continue to.  Material quality really is superior, it's just that some people expect to see German or Japanese design and this has a Swedish mentality to it.   Basic, sparse, but high quality.  Negatives would be that the transmission is a little lazy in regular mode.  Sport mode sure solves that, but at the expense of holding lower gears a little longer than you'd like in routine driving.  But for spirited driving, it's great.  Another issue would be that the bluetooth streaming will cut out for a second every now and then at first, then eventually settle down and work well.    The Nav is a disgrace, The 5 year warranty with full maintenance we got free during a summer promotion helps offset the biggest negative, the poor resale value.    We thought about trading ours for a V60 but found it was worth about $10,000 less than we paid for it after a year.   This will flatten out, but for some reason all Volvos seem to take a steep initial drop in value, and some, like the S60, keep dropping.     We paid about $6500 less than MSRP in 2014.Overall, besides the BMW 328i, which will cost a little more and be a little less quick,  I wouldn't seriously consider another make for this specific class of car.  However, I do prefer slightly larger vehicles for the interior ""elbow room"".    The BMW will have a bigger back seat.    And yes, Volvos are built like vaults.   Very solid.   Still loving it and we're hard to please.",4

It is very composed, fairly quiet, and extremely comfortable while commuting back and forth the 80 miles to work. The car is an absolute rocket, whether in sport mode or not. However what is truly nice is that you have an option. In normal mode the car will accelerate off the line with the authority dictated by how hard you press your right foot down, but you can also drive quite leisurely. Switch to sport and the car is absolutely manic, press the gas and hold on. The car feels like it will never stop accelerating. The only draw back in sport mode is it feels twitchy all the time. ",5
246, on 09/05/18 13:41 PM (PDT),Valentina Deriabina ,2015 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 Drive-E 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),A very pretty tank," Great car, great great great car! Super safe, very smart, reliable, great breaking, very good on the road. The only reason i am on this web site is that i did not negotiate my lease well enough and my lease payoff is way too high to keep my car. But over all this is my third Volvo, the previous was s60 2012 and it drove slightly different (they change the wheel to electric one on 2015) also 2015 is way more safer. It will get you spoiled in terms of standard safety features. The ones i personally use the most are: BLIS (blind spot aid), cross traffic (it's when you are pulling out of your parking spot and dont see the approaching cars in the isle - the car spots them and if needed automatically applies breaks), citi traffic feature is very useful too - it applied breaks a couple of times when my car approached another car too close in slow to semi-slow moving traffic. The seats are ... can i get one like those for my living room please? I drove about 10 times from DC to NY and back and never felt tired sitting in the car. Breaks are super, the car stops on a spot! the road handling is very good too - i feel safe in a rain or snow. However you need to be careful when there is a lot of snow - back in Snowmageddon of 2016 I was driving home when there was already about 3 inches of fresh snow on a road and car was swaying from side to side just a little bit. Having said that, navigation is horrible - routinely would tel me to make an exit from the left last second when i am in the far right line, or to save my money would take me back streets instead of the paid highway (even though settings set to the shortest route) (and that's exactly why, by the way, i ended up driving in 3 inches of snow back in 2016), or you will have to use that rotating knob to enter the address for about 15 minutes and then the system would tell you ""no such street"" or offer you another building. You will be better off using apple maps. Ride is a bit on a stiff side, but what do you want from the very cute tank? And that's exactly how I think of my car - it is a very cute, very smart tank with lots of babble wrap inside to protect me.  I am currently shopping around.  Audi A4 looks very dull compared to my car (everybody said the ride is much better, I tried Q3 - and its not THAT much better). BMW 300 series and merc C300 both drive nicer, but way more pricier and not as safe. XC-60 is just like my car, I feel totally home in it - but brakes are slightly weaker and headlights are not as good too. I mean, its a very very nice car, I have hard time being completely swept away by other cars in the same class. Cons: navigation sucks, slightly stiff ride, and apparently volvos in general depreciate very fast and loose value, so if i will get a new volvo - i am driving it to the ground. From the consumer reports reviews i know that 2015 is probably was one of the worst quality wise years (nothing major, just small stupid things that drove people nuts - like oil lamp is on, nothing wrong with the car, but its still on, stuff like that) but my car so far hasn't given me a second of grief. Also I have one of the prettiest combinations of black paint with red shine in it and light leather inside - so pretty!  I am sure will be sad to part with my car!",5

If you want something different, reliable, safe, fairly sporty based on how you outfit it, you’ll be happy with your purchase. Top notch materials, sensible, well organized instrument panel. I stepped up to the 19” rims and two tone leather interior because I could get more for less than some of the German sedans I was looking at.

Not all it's cracked up to be"""," Though I am a baby boomer, I never aspired to own a muscle car. I was always more intrigued by the European cars with classic lines and implied quality. Beemers were trendy but cars like Saab and Volvo were something to aspire to. With one of those, you had quality and class. Right? Not anymore. Sadly, they've killed Saab. Ive now leased my Volvo just over 3 years and it's time to turn over the keys. There's nothing about this car I will miss. Not the random way the e-drive would kill the engine just as the light turned green (reminiscent really of learning to drive my first stick shift car and popping the clutch to a lurch and dead engine). I won't  miss the eay bluetooth would randomly go on strike. Or the way the warning beeps that so steadfastly warn when the car is too close to a curb or wall or another car... until it doesn't.  Or just for fun starts randomly beeping when you are certifiably in the middle of nowhere with no obstacles for 20 feet in any direction. I could go on but why. This car was a disappointment. My local dealer (the ONLY Volvo dealer in a metropolitan area of over 2 million!) Over promises and under delivers and features a service department who specialize in mansplaining. I especially loved the way I would schedule service with a confirmed loaner car for the day only to be told there were no S60s available that day. Fine, I said...  give me something else. You would have thought I'd asked for the shirt odd his back. Turns out they had a caste system for loaner cars. I drive a lowly S60 and an S60 is all the loaner car I'm entitled to. God forbid a lowly S60 owner sully the steering wheel of the XC90. After standing my ground and waiting for the snootysnark of a service advisor to go to the service manager I was allowed to drive a loaner car (THAT I HAD RESERVED) waaaay above my station in life. Save yourself the disappointment. Go get yourself a 1974 Ford Pinto instead of this Volvo. At least you'll know up front what you're getting and you'd be throwing away about 42,000 fewer dollars.",2

I miss my turbo C30 which was much peppier and way better looking in my opinion, but it was time for a grown up car that was refined yet affordable. I would say this fits the bill nicely and in a few years I will spring for the V60 wagon or XC60 crossover, since I prefer them both to a sedan. I wish I could have got the adaptive cruise control, but I would have had to go up a trim level to platinum and didn’t want to spend the additional $5k for the cars that were available with this option. Too early to say much about reliability but I’m hoping for the best. Road noise is not bad and the ride is nice. Not to cushy and not too tight. The stereo sound sucks but the Bluetooth works seamlessly. The interior is attractive with good quality materials, although I’m not in love with the colors and displays directly above the steering wheel. I like floating center panel. This car definitely does not make me want to race anyone at the stoplights. It does make me look and feel like a responsible adult which was necessary for my line of work.

Sound system is very good quality ('tho the antenna is not very good compared to most other cars).   Excellent interior materials.  Dealer support is excellent.    NOT SO GOOD: 5-cyl ""T5"" engine has decent power, especially at lower speeds where it is very torquey, but unimpressive at highway speeds.  Some noticeable wind noise, fair amount of odd or annoying noises from the many electronics.  Volvo GPS navigation is okay but slow, very slow, really sloooooooow, and entering destinations can be frustrating or even impossible, but does make good calls on traffic conditions.   No ""cubbies"", so no open or casual storage for driver stuff beyond the glove box and console box, both of which are okay but awkward to reach while driving.   the alleged ""city traffic"" automatic braking feature has never worked when tested (??).   NO SPARE TIRE INCLUDED; The standard gel tire repair system may serve for most punctures, but if a large puncture or tear, it's useless, and it can potentially ruin wheel balance and/or the TPMS sensor so add cost and trouble to your follow-up repair woes.  Adding a spare tire is in my opinion the right thing to do but it's not cheap and the trunk then goes from ""small but okay"" to almost useless.   So much for this being an expensive luxury car!    Things going in and out of the trunk will chip the rear bumper paint, no rubber bumper guard like on most other cars, even low-priced ones.     BAD: REAR SEAT ROOM is honestly a cruel joke unless midgets are in front seats and front seat pulled all the way up, and even then the roof downslope makes it claustrophobic.  There is a ""stretched"" version of the S60 with more rear seat room that I think is the only way to buy an S60, still not great but at least acceptable and useable.

I've already had one internal sensor replaced at the recommendation of VOLVO Central and it's likely that this current repair will require the replacement of a cylinder.  I've had this vehicle for less than two years, and it has ""granny"" miles (coming up on 18,500) yet somehow it's required days worth of repairs.  Recognizing that these repairs are all covered under the current warranty (thank God) it's still a bit of a disappointment because I enjoy this vehicle.

263, on 05/18/16 09:33 AM (PDT),SE ,2015 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 Drive-E 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),First Volvo," After multiple Japanese and American cars, this is our first venture in a European based car.  So far we are very pleased with our choice.  Getting to consider the Volvo was due primarily to the very positive experience we had with the dealer group (Fields Automotive) while we owned our 2005 Infiniti G35 sedan.  That was a great car, but we were not enthused about staying with Infiniti (great driving experience, but expensive operating and maintenance costs).  Same group had a Volvo store and decided to check it out.  First impressions: clean design, interior and exterior (typical Euro/Scandinavian functionalistic, without being cold);  good driving experience: totally surprised by throttle response from the T5 engine, handling; visibility, and  comfort. Also appreciated that the tech interface was not the centerpiece of the dashboard like most new cars.  Good combination of actual buttons and knobs with screen controls.  Has a screen saver option, so the display goes dark after 20 seconds, instead of staring at you.  Looked at an Acura TLX 2.0 4-cyl (poor engine response, dash is way too busy) and a Lexus ES (nice car, still a Camry, and pricey).   So we went with the S60 (thought about the V60, but didn't need the extra room, and the sedan was a bit quieter).We've only had it 4 months, but still very pleased. Good on the highway: plenty of power even at speed, quiet: some road noise, but not obtrusive.  City driving is relaxed.  Auto Stop/Start is a little weird at first, but you get used to it.  BLIS is great.   Back seat (which has been described as tight) has been totally comfortable for 2 adults.  Trunk has also been adequate for our needs.  Great gas mileage: 25/35 (which is tremendous coming from about 16 mpg on a good day). Only issue was the electric defrost built into the windshield, which comes with the Climate package.  Was very distracting: Volvo replaced at N/C with standard windshield.Update:  Have had for about a year now.  Still very pleased.  Tires showing some early wear, but that seems to be the norm for the factory installed Continentals.",5

(I am small)," I am petite (AKA short ; 5'2'') so finding a car I can drive well and comfortably is always a challenge... I like car seats that I can move up, tilt the bottom part, adjust pretty much everything so I can reach the pedals and also see the road... this car is perfect for me in so many ways but the seats are the most important... I also love confortable seats and these are truly amazing.  I love gadgets and technology and I feel this comes loaded, love the number pad.... I make many calls for work so I find it very practical, I was very annoyed by the start-stop engine system but you can disable it when you run the car on , which is great. I wanted the MB CLA but they did not give me a good deal so went with the dealer that sold me my VW and after looking at the cc and Eos wasn't convinced , they are great cars but the cc felt for older people and the Eos was again a 2 door car and was tired of having a 2 door car... it does look  bit like many new other cars out there pretty much every make has a model similar to the S60 but it is still a good looking sedan with nice clean lines.  The adjustable lumbar part of the front seats and heated seats are also a plus... I use it even in the summer in FL. I am not a fan of the dual AC ... it is kind of annoying. at least for me. I like that the cover for sunroof is totally sun proof unlike mercedes and vw which are not 100% sun proof and I can't stand feeling the sun on my head specially since I can't be under the sun.

The 2015.5 platinum makes an already good car superb. It's simply fun to drive -- not as fun as my old Merc C230 coupe, but still pretty darn good for a sedan. Mileage in the first few months is about 33 hwy and 28-29 combined -- that should get better, indeed I hope it does with the touted drive-e engine (I was at 24 combined in my 2012 T5).14 months later my combined mileage barely holds on to 29mpg -- that's equal to or less than many CUVs on the market now; one would think it'd be well over 30 in a small sedan. After being saved by the collision mitigation warning light and beep (almost rear ended someone), it's now something I ignore. It will go off when I'm driving in housing divisions and weaving around parked cars on the road. What I REALLY wish this car had was more tech, or easy tech. I want to be on my phone or desktop and EASILY send directions to a destination (because it takes FOREVER to do it in the car). You have to use a special app / website, then it doesn't always load in the car, and if it does, it will take many, many minutes. So, still a lot of updating to do there. I also wish with voice nav you could say ""Nearest Arby's"" or whatever, instead of being forced into ""Nearest restaurant"" and scrolling through the list forever; all that time when my eyes are not on the road. But hands down one of the BEST radar cruise control systems -- takes you all the way down to zero and has excellent distance (much farther than my wife's loaded Mazda 6).Otherwise, great performance, love the turbo, awesome seats on my long trips, still looks good, not many others drive one (a shame!), and the value is superb for what you get. Absolutely a BMW and MERC alternative.",5

The front seats are very adjustable and provide a lot of head/leg space, and the telescoping steering wheel range is better than in all other cars I tested in its class. Many reviews mention that there is limited leg room in the 2nd row. What are people expecting? This is a mid-size sport sedan.  When you have people in the back, you have to adjust your seat and drive in a less-than-optimal position. Get real.

273, on 03/17/17 08:53 AM (PDT),Kent Lupino ,2007 Volvo S60 R R 4dr Sedan AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),'R' is a Wolf in Sheep's Clothing," I'd been looking for a P2 Volvo S60R for many months, and finally found a 2007 1-owner, low mileage example locally that I just couldn't pass up. I purchased it a little over a month ago and so far haven't regretted it at all. I should be clear that the 'R' moniker for the 2004-2007 S60 series vehicles indicated a very different kind car than all of the non-'R' variants. So if you are looking for a review of any S60 model that doesn't have the 'R' badge, you can stop reading and move on to the next review. A significantly re-worked 300HP 5-cylinder engine, sport exhaust, electronically-controlled suspension, Brembo performance disc brakes, and AWD give the S60R a completely different driving character than its siblings. It's quick, nimble, and produces an angry snarl--not too loud or thrashy-- when the tachometer goes over 2k RPM. In terms of styling, the P2 S60's are admittedly divisive. People seem to like it or hate it. I like it. Fortunately, Volvo didn't go overboard with plastic cladding and spoilers on the 'R' models, adding a slightly different front and rear fascia, subtle 'R' badge on the front black cube grille and rear trunk lid, and great-looking 17"" 5-spoke alloy wheels. I love the fact that other than the wheels, the car looks a lot like any other S60. It's a classic factory hot rod that looks like a 'sleeper'. The interior is also a step above other S60's, with premium leather sport seats that are amazingly comfortable, and classy real aluminum trim on the doors and center stack. The two things that I love most about the 'R' interior are the subtle contrasting blue stitching on the black areas of the door panels, handbrake, shifter boot, steering wheel, and dashboard and the metallic blue instrument dials. Classy! However, let's just say up front that the downside of the 'R' badge arrives with certain kinds of repair bills. Those 4-piston Brembo brakes are unique to the 'R', and definitely not cheap to replace. Neither is the big KKK turbocharger. Or the electronically-controlled struts. But if you take care of the car, those kinds of $$$ repairs don't come often. Now, I freely admit that the S60R is no BMW M3 in terms of overall performance, but I love it precisely because it's NOT a BMW M3. Nobody expects a pre-Polestar era Volvo to have a sporty character, but this one does, along with the safety and build quality that Volvo is famous for. But instead of flaunting that extra performance for everyone to see, it only reveals its superpower when called upon. Awesome.",4

I do take very good care of my car, however, I enjoy having fun in it as well. With the DTSC system combined with AWD, the back country roads couldn't be more fun. This was my first car, and have had it since I was 16, so I'm sure you can guess the limits I've pushed this car to... None the less, it has held up better than I could've imagined. I recently took the car for a full 130 point inspection and it passed every single one. My mechanic doesn't doubt if I'll see 300k miles with this car.

Cosmetically in very good condition. Ride on the highway is excellent and gas mileage at around 30 MPG is acceptable. However, in town, the car is very cumbersome with a heavy feel and a terrible turn radius making it difficult to park in tight spots. In the year that I have owned it, 2 rear light bulbs and one of the headlight bulbs have gone out. The headlight bulb cost $150 at the dealer and would have cost me then again as much if I had not installed it myself. The coolant level light has gone on 4 times so I'm losing coolant. Since I only drive such that the level is down every 2 months, I have not looked into getting it repaired. The check engine light came on and the code indicated a failed fuel system emissions pump failing. When I checked with the dealership, they told me they would have to diagnose it again at a cost of $130. When I explained to them that after checking on the internet I found that this was a common problem and was due to issues with the software and that there should be an extended warranty covering the software update. Was told my car was out of warranty by 2 months even though the mileage was only half the limit. Went back on the internet and discovered that Volvo offers a free software update that covers all issues. Called the local dealer and after convincing them that I do not have to have any ""service"" done to qualify for the software upgrade, finally had it done. No issues with the check engine light since. Overall, I see why the resale value is so low. Having said that, the S60 is a lot of car for price and I'd buy a used one again. Probably not a new one, though.",3

Originally a T5 - 2.5 Cylinder turbo...and now with a more refined 2.0, AWD; and a real luxury feel in the Inscription model. The extra length loses about 10% of the sportiness of the shorter versions, but the solid value of understated elegance is quite apparent. And although I was expecting to move to the newer US model, my lease ran out and acquiring this 2018 iteration proves that Volvo's are getting better all the time!  It fits like a glove!",5
313, on 04/05/18 14:49 PM (PDT),RBentin ,2018 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 Inscription Platinum 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Great Buy," The vehicle I purchased has a few add-ons such as BLIS, heated seats, and 19-inch wheels. Being a baby-boomer having driven for many years I originally felt the safety technology would be an unnecessary distraction and possibly an outright annoyance, but having driven the vehicle only 2,600 miles I'm sold on it. The blind-spot and cross-traffic alerts are unobtrusive and the auto-brake tends to be in-sync with my own braking habits. The few times the auto-brake has engaged have been within a fraction of a second before applying the brake myself. The interior materials are high quality and the fit-and-form are excellent. Little extras such as the entry/exit lighting and theater lighting while driving are nice touches that add to the luxury feel of the vehicle, as do the soft-touch premium leather seats. For audio buffs (as I am), the Harman-Kardon audio system is fantastic. While acceleration is strong and smooth when getting heavy on the accelerator the 8-speed transmission is a little disappointing on the lower end of the RPM scale. Under modest acceleration the transmission shifts prematurely (in my opinion) and gives the impression of ""lugging"" the engine. Accelerating somewhat strongly to avoid the feel of ""lugging"" the engine has thus far produced an average city/highway MPG of 31.4, which is all-the-more impressive being a ""green"" engine. The 19-inch diamond-cut wheels look great and provide excellent handling with little additional road noise but do enhance the impact of bumps and rough road surfaces, a price I was willing to pay for the great handling. Overall I would highly recommend the S60. Feature-for-feature and dollar-for-dollar the S60 is a wise and enjoyable alternative to a pricier Mercedes, BMW, or Audi.",5

My first S60 I owned and sold it in 2015 because my wife insisted on me driving a car with all the safety improvements. This brings me to one of the very few problems with the S60 and that is resale value. Like so many other cars nowadays my near perfect car with normal mileage was worth less than 50% on a trade. However the up to date safety features prevented me from two serious accidents so it was worth it. The car drives great. The comfort, quality feel, gas mileage and all the features work great. The only reason I ever go back to my dealer is for recommended maintenance. What I like about the S60 is I never feel bored driving it. I recently leased an end of year 2017 because the incentives to turn my 2015 in early were so sensational it made sense to do it. For the first time I got the Inscription model with the platinum trim. The extra legroom in the rear seat answered another issue with my two previous S60s. This is the best version I have had yet. The car now comes with an automatic shade for the rear window and manual shades for the two rear passengers. These are great to keep the kids cooler. This is a very good car.",4

This was my fourth Volvo.  All of the ads on this feature made me wonder how I or my family could drive without it.  A month after purchase, a man slammed on his brakes in front of me when a child went into the crosswalk (not dissimilar to the TV commercial).  My car not only didn't stop but didn't even slow down and rear ended the vehicle in front of me.  How could this happen when I had City Safety?  I sent a letter to the President of Volvo and was routed to customer service.  They sent a technician to check the ""black box"" and let me know the system worked just fine.  Read the fine print in the owners manual, they told me.  City Safety really only works in certain condition and the advertising is not accurate.  In other words, they mistake is yours.  You trusted us.  Volvo makes a just fine vehicle -- but this feature does not work.  #VolvoSafetyFail",2

Starting off with the fact that it is the only ""luxury sedan"" where you do not need to put premium gasoline in it. The seats are incredibly comfortable and I actually do have a lot of back problems and commute about 50-60 miles a day. The cabin is incredibly quiet and even the T5 has great acceleration. The trunk space is adequate however I do wish there was a tiny bit more room in the back. Materials on the interior are high quality and the car has no squeaks or rattles. I love the Volvo on call service I get and the app that controls it. Gas mileage is great and the car in general is an overall great car.

I currently own a 2017 S60 Inscription model.  I did not realize that Inscriptions are made in China, not Sweden. My first drive on the highway revealed an air-leak noise when the car gets to about 60 MPH.  The dealer has attempted to fix this problem without success.  We drove another Inscription model vehicle; same noise.  The wind noise is very loud, so this is not a minor issue.  The dealer discussed problem with Volvo in an attempt to get me out of this vehicle and into a different car (Dynamic model).  Volvo refused to do anything, claiming that the noise is a ""characteristic"" of the vehicle.  Ridiculous response, as this noise should not be found in a $40K+ vehicle.  I have about 4,000 miles on the car and I am looking to get rid of it.  Anyone thinking of buying an S60 Inscription model should drive it on a highway getting to at least 60 MPH.  Not a normal part of a test drive, but advisable for the Inscription.  You will likely buy a different car.  I wish I had.",2

Fun to drive and pretty good economy but it requires Midgrade (89 octane).   The issues thus far after 1 month are mostly annoyances rather than problems. Navigation does not seem to update traffic or construction. Dual-zone climate controls have no sync option. Exterior door handles are pinchy (watch your fingers or you'll be sorry).  The AT&T Wi-if is almost useless and difficult to setup with very, very slow speeds.  The menu system is NOT intuitive and to make matters worse, the manual is not applicable to the actual options in the menu system (e.g. There is no ""My car"" category in the menu system, which is frequently referenced in the manual).  The visors are not extendible so you have no way to block sunlight coming through the side windows (heck, even cheap Fords offer this).  The tire pressure system only tells you if you have a low tire.  No specific info as to which tire is the problem or how low it is.  No PSI display for the tires (again, even very modest vehicles offer this feature) however it does for some reason have a ""calibration"" process for the tires. Seats are a bit stiff and not great for long trips.  Bluetooth connection is iffy and sometimes does not connect with phones.",4

327, on 02/21/17 20:05 PM (PST),wbm ,2017 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 Inscription Platinum 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),S60L - China Rules!," This is the first major Chinese car exported to the USA- I got the S60 Inscription, Platinum from Princeton Volvo.  We were looking for a car for long trips up to Canada that is both comfortable and fuel efficient.  I looked at Lexus, Audi and VW cars (we had a Honda, and had a bad reliability experience with the Mercedes E320 wagon).   The Audi is more quiet, but has a smaller interior with a smaller fuel tank - for long trips we really appreciated both the larger cabin, and the good fuel mileage.  We recently did 1000 miles up to Canada and back and can testify that the car performed very well.  Our son was comfortable in the back reading - in the Honda he got motion sickness.   In particular, while some journalists do not like the adaptive cruse control, I found it fantastic - once one gets use to using it, it makes long drives on moderately busy freeways much much more enjoyable and stress free.  The S60L has a longer wheel base which reduce handling, but increases stability - the car performed perfectly on busy highways with large trucks that can blow a car around.  Many journalists complained about the lack of a touch screen - I strictly preferred the S60 to both the S90 and Audi A4- the navigation screen is perfect - I find the heads up display very distracting, and once one gets the hang of it, the S60 system is efficient - the hardest thing to do is enter an address, but with Volvo on call this is easy - find the address on ones phone and then send to the car. The negatives are the following - small trunk - holds about 4 roll-ons plus a bit  - we got the spare tire that reduces trunk space (which for long trips is something we value - being stuck on a highway with a flat at 2am is not great).  Second, one can put a Class 2 hitch for a bike rack or cargo carrier, but for the moment there are no roof racks for the Inscription - Rhino Rack says they may do them in the future, but Thule (and hence Volvo) says they will not do them - so I would not recommend the car for a family that needs more space - with roof racks and a cargo box, the car could be a good family car - large cabin plus comfortable, but precise ride.  Finally, the car can use regular gas, but 89 octane gets 12% better mileage, so we will use that going forward. Overall, we would get the same car again, unless there is a V60 Inscription, which would solve the lack of cargo space, while giving more cabin space.Update August 2018:  Our initial impressions have not changed much.  The following seemingly small issues would probably lead me to buy a different car this time:1. Headlights are not great - it would be nice to have running lamps - I have these on my other car and have found that they do improve driving in the fog and snow.  Volvo used to have these, but no longer.2. We did use the spare on the way to the airport and so it saved us from missing a flight - wish they would make more room for a spare.  3. Still no rack for the car.  Really irritating, especially if  one skis.   I put a hitch on for a bike rack that I do us frequently, and had a wiring harness put in for towing - Volvo does not support these, so it was after market.  4. Windshield wipers are not very good, and given the unusual specs I could not find an aftermarket pair that would do better.Overall, it is a nice car, but for the American market Volvo really seems to want to force people to large gas guzzler's for car's that have utility features .  A sedan is great for day to day driving, and the extra room in the back is very nice.  However, for holidays one would like more usability features - overhead rack, better wipers, better lights.  In the theory the cross-country is suppose to cover these, but then why the small back seat? The longer Inscription is a definite improvement.",5

The suspension is not sporty and the seats are like home theater recliners, so I get a nice comfortable ride.  At 6'4"" 230 I fit easily in the front seats.  The fuel economy is also surprisingly strong, I get about 27 MPG.  So what are the drawbacks?  The electrical system hasn't cost me any large dollar figure, but I always seem to have to replace bulbs.  And when replacing a front head lamp, be careful, the housing is brittle and easily broken.  Also, adults can't fit very easily in the back seat.  I'm glad I bought it, but I will look for something with a little more engine kick and a more spacious back seat in my next ride.",4.125

404, on 12/11/16 18:07 PM (PST),Andres ,2003 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 Fwd 4dr Sedan (2.3L 5cyl Turbo 5M),Great Reliable car but transmission sucks," I bought this car from a previous owner in 2008 (Volvo S60 2003 T5 FWD), I've had it since 2016 so far and now will be going into 2017. Transmission problems are several in this car sadly as I was hoping it would last until 300,000 miles (Only at 180000 miles) although maybe frequent transmission fluid changes may have allowed the car to last longer as my fluid is now black and burnt smelling(Volvo's ""Life Time Fluid"" don't believe it"" ) I've wanted to change the fluid for the tranny a few years ago but my dad insisted not to because volvo said so as I wasn't very knowledgeable about cars at the time I was array of doing anything I've should have done it anyway. Will be driving it until the transmission goes out (maybe next year or 2 years from now but who knows, Park to Drive Delay, Slipping, Clunking, Hard Downshifts, sometimes bangs when turning etc... works fine when cold but problems occur when hot so tranny may just be overheating, cold works like when I first bought it)              Now for the good about the car, the car is a-bit slow to accelerate from a stop but it does go fast about 0-100 within 6 seconds( Electronically controlled is to blame, mechanically controlled would have been better) but none the less it's a good car to drive. It's very comfortable inside but the rear seats passengers typically need the front seats to be pulled up a-bit to be a little more comfortable. My car had the premium package with leather seating, etc... but the premium stereo system is an amazing piece of work, the sound is truly lovely, although this car has a wonderful stereo system the only way to utilize it, with the CD Player, Got an aftermarket adapter for AUX etc.. then it broke so just spent about $900 dollers for a aftermarket stereo which was worth it. It came with all the nice features of a modern car of power locks, power windows, rear window defroster(no wiper which looks much nicer in my opinion), and a nice little garage opener button. The steering is a-little different, the turns are really wide then the other cars I've drove almost feels like a Pickup Truck when turning but it's still good. It has anti skid system which was pretty good when it was raining or snowing really helped when I was slipping. Had a problem with headlights blowing very 4-6 months, ended up just getting Aftermarket HID bulbs and they haven't blown for 2 years and they look really nice for $100 dollars well worth the money of spending around $15 CAD very few months on halogen bulbs; I've searched the internet and spoke to mechanic experts for electronics in cars and Volvo dealers they had no idea so the only solution was to get aftermarket bulbs. Overall the car is still an amazing piece of work, hopefully it'll last a few more years, this is my second car (I'm 19 haha) and it has treated me very well and I felt very safe and comfortable in this car and have rode it outside the country many times without any problems arising it was a very reliable car it will be missed when it goes. I'd buy other Volvo when I'm more financially stable but the Chinese have bought out the automotive department of Volvo and I've heard their are many problems with the transmissions on newer Volvo's so I'm gonna steer clear until they make a car as good as this one.",4

(I have 2.4T) Interior design is fine, but could be a bit more refined for a luxury sedan. (See Infiniti) Gas mileage is surprisingly good. An excellent used value, as Volvo's don't hold value like a BMW/Mercedes. Again, it's not perfect, but I love mine and doubt you'll do any better for the money in the used market. ",4.125

Very good reliability compared to other cars at this performance level.  Insanely cheap compared to similar cars from other manufacturers.  The Atacama leather option is really unique, and it ages well.  Volvo is very good about using common parts between their car product lines (the timing belt kit fits pretty much every car they made for a 15 year run), so parts are readily available and cheap.  It gets fantastic gas mileage (28 MPG highway on premium only).  On the downside, the factory stereo is pretty awful (highly recommend upgrading to a quality aftermarket stereo), the paint on the body rails is not nearly as well done as the rest of the body, and the AWD system makes regular alignments a must (a recommend buying a lifetime alignment when you buy the car).  The V70R wagon is pretty much the same car, but the highly-desirable 6 speed manual is far rarer in the wagon.",5

On my drive to work (25 miles one way) I can average 30+ mpg easily.  Turbos are great for this, you can tweak the mileage in your favor if you drive it gently..but hey, who wants to always do that? You have to let it GO sometimes  :-)",4.375

The 6 speed will make even the most seasoned stick drivers feel like a 16 year old learning to drive a manual tranny, it's never the same clutch twice.

The full-time AWD keeps all rubber on the road, even on wet pavement, though the P-Zero tires are NOT suited for icy or snow driving.  Fuel efficiency is better than expected: 25mpg average combined (window sticker claimed 24 highway--I regularly see 30-32mpg on long straight stretches at 55-65mph).

What really makes the value pop is not just the mileage, but also Volvo's legendary safety and reliability attributes.

It was a two day trip home and I couldn't wait to get behind the wheel the second day.  I've never felt seats so comfortable.  Some road noise is heard from the wide tires and rough patches are felt through the steering but that's to be expected from a sports type sedan.  This car is solid, not one rattle or squeak.  The steering is tight.  I notice no real turbo lag and if there is any, the car makes up for it quickly.  Punch it at highway speed and you'll have no trouble passing just about anything.   For $995 you can upgrade the ECU and increase the hp from 257 to 318 and the torque from 258 to 328.  This car is fun, fast and comfortable.   ",5

Seats are the best and interior features are great and easy to use.  Gas mileage around 24- 25 around town and 28-30 on long highway trips and it uses regular gas which at $3+/gl is a huge plus.

I was looking at the Infiniti G35, but I was able to negotiate a much better deal at Volvo and was surprised that the Volvo was only marginally slower with better looks and comfort.

I knew of their existence but never did a double take. My company leases their vechicles to the employees as a company vehicle. Then when mileage hits 85-90k miles, they first offer it to the original driver of our company, then to any other employee in the company. I just happened to check the listings in Phoenix, AZ and the first one on the list was a 2012 Volvo S60 T5 Flamenco Metallic Red. Then I saw it was our branch manager. I walked over and asked him how he liked the car and said he loved it and threw me the keys and said ""see for yourself"". I was so excited once I sat in the amazing leather cockpit and slapped in the boxy key and hit start. He had a smile on his face as he walked away knowing I would probably enjoy the drive. The handling was great! The acceleration was great! Oh, then I noticed sport mode. That really helped me decide about the purchase. So after cranking the 8 speaker stereo with upgraded 160 watt amp, and opening and closing the sunroof / moonroof...I was hooked. I kinda said under my breathe...Volvo, for life. I have had the car now for about 1 month and I am still not tired of driving it. The controls in the console are easy to use. The power seats are a treat. The solid state hard drive I plugged in to the USB port in the center hidden console supplies me with 256GB of tunes that will last on any road trip without repeating a song. By the way, the first thing I did for maint was replace the headlights with a little whiter shades, replaced the spark plugs with double platinum. Replace the cabin filter (not fun at all). And polish up the leather seats for a nice new look. I did notice that the newer 2014-2016 speedometer cluster was easy to swap out but a few features would not show up so I decided to keep the old cluster and enjoy the simple yet semi-sporty look. I also did opt in on a very good deal for the 2 year extended warranty that covers major repairs.  Hoping to get a good 3 or 4 years from this beautiful piece of machinery.  Happy 2018!",5

I paid more for this car than any car I've ever had.  I waited my adult life to have a car like this.  It is the greatest disappointment I could ask for.  I pay monthly for a car I can't drive without ear plugs.  I would expect this from a cheap car, not a Volvo.

I told them that I had found in my research that this is an issue that others are having & Volvo is aware of it. They acted like it was with the t6 models & that this issue wasn't with the t5 model. They agreed to do an oil consumption test. I was told to come back in 3000 miles so they could check the oil level. I told them I wouldn't have any oil! They told me not to add oil, they needed to see it. I kept an eye on my oil level. Took it back at 2000 miles & it was barely on the dipstick. I also had the TSB in hand that I had gotten from a local shop. They said it did indeed include my car! I tried to show the dealership but they said they had it. They told me they were giving me a loaner for free. Although they charged me $150, supposedly for tax!? It has been 7 days! My car is still sitting untouched.

After much consideration, I replaced the vehicle with an equivalent 2014 model, which is the first year of a minor design refresh. This model has been considerably more reliable in all respects. I cannot recommend the 2012 based on the numerous quality issues and the oil consumption problem that was specific to very early second-generation S60s. Original review: I have owned nothing but Volvos. That said, I'm a bit of a car guy and know the comparisons between my 2012 S60 T5 and its competitors. While it may not handle as tightly as a comparable Mercedes or BMW, a T5 beats a base 3-series or C-Class hands-down when it comes to speed and comfort. It's also a sharp-looking car. My primary motivation for purchasing this vehicle was because it was the second safest car ever tested by the IIHS (next to the Tesla Model S) at the time. I bought it certified pre-owned from a Volvo dealer with about 30,000 miles in 2014. It has the premium package (sunroof, leather, power passenger seat) and climate package (heated seats, headlight washers, rain-sensing wipers). The draw to the CPO car was the 100,000-mile/7-year drivetrain warranty. While I adore this car, I am also very, very glad I have the extended warranty. I don't think I've ever had to take a car into the shop so often. At the time I'm writing this, I have taken the car in four times to fix a leak in the passenger floorboard that they cannot identify (I will give the dealer credit for their exhaustive efforts with this). The silver trim on the steering wheel and console began to peel, which they replaced. They also replaced a broken air vent. One leather panel on the backseat has begun to flake while the ones beside of it have not. It's obvious to me that the tiny panel in the middle is made of inferior material to those surrounding it. The dealer would not address this because they ""found evidence"" that my dog had ridden in the backseat. Most problematic is that the oil pressure warning came on 4,000 miles after my most recent service, meaning that it was four (of five) quarts low. It goes in later this week to have that issue figured out. I maintain this car well, having my services done when (or before) they're due, and only use synthetic oil. It shouldn't be having these problems. But most importantly to me, I'm safe, comfortable, have the power to escape a treacherous situation, and look damn good doing it. But, of course, it is as I'm on my way to the dealership for the millionth time for warranty work.",3

I wound up with a gorgeous sapphire black S60-T5.it's fantastic!",5

The exterior really wowed me initially when I saw this car at the Minneapolis Auto Show during the Fall of 2011.

Controls are well situated and I really like the standard connectivity. As advertised, the seats are really good and supportive!Last, the car drives very well. Very smooth power delivery.

For years the cars were little bit more expensive than competition and the designs were not general enough. The S60 design turns heads. I can always spot it on the highway.Volvo has really stepped out their comfort zone with s60. I love how fresh and futuristic S60 looks but it still feels safe, comfortable and durable. The most amazing thing is how smooth the ride is. I can barely hear the engine. Every little interior details makes sense, there are no random buttons that complicate the interaction.

I'm a long-time BMW owner and would never have thought I'd like an S60, but I was immediately impressed by the combination of comfort, performance, build quality, and classy interior. This is a front-wheel biased vehicle and it will never quite have the handling edge of a RWD car like a 335i, but Volvo found an excellent balance between comfort and performance.

It was my plan to buy the car after the lease was up.  Everything was going well.  I serviced my car as required.  The problems began after two years in 2018.  My car began saying ""High engine temperature.  Turn engine off."" I took it to the dealership and they topped off the coolant.  Simple enough.  They didn't even write a ticket.  In early January, the same thing occurred. January 26th, the same thing the car continues to say the same thing.  They checked the blue tooth for proper contact.  February 8th, after bringing the car in again, the thermostat housing was replaced.  In February, same issue, the low fuel pressure sensor was replaced.  Towards the end of March, it began saying ""High engine temperature. Stop Safely"".  At this point, I was not allowed to accelerate the gas.  This occurred on the beltway in Washington, DC area in the midst of traffic! The water pump was replaced on April 9th.  At this point, I no longer wanted the car.  The last thing I want to happen is for the car to stop on me in the middle of the road/highway, risking my life, perhaps the lives of others in the car and/or countless others around me.  I expressed my concern to volvo and was told they could not replace the car or get me out of the contract.  On April 23rd, the car was brought in again and was fixed for the same problem.  I was told the car could be exchanged, but only if I took on a new lease.  My lease was up at the end of the year. The car was brought in again April 27th. After over two months on July 21st, the car was returned to me after being with the dealership for about a month.  It received a brand new engine.  On Friday, July 27th, the car was returned because it said, High engine temperature. Stop Safely"" and ""High Engine Temperature.  Turn off Engine"".  (Remember the car always says this) At this time, the engine wouldn't let me go over 17 mph in the middle of DC traffic.  Although three months of my lease was returned from the Volvo company. (they initially only wanted to give me one or two), all I want is to feel and be safe driving a car from one location to the next.  This is not what I feel in my Volvo, nor is it something that Volvo (the company or the dealership) is willing to give me.  Volvo, the car company supposedly known for safety, is not keeping me safe.  They continue to put me in the same car.",2

655, on 10/08/16 12:57 PM (PDT),Jack ,2016 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 Drive-E Inscription Premier 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),A hidden gem in entry luxury cars," Owned the car for over two months now and my experience is extremely positive.I was looking for a car that is comfortable, safe, quiet, powerful enough yet with great fuel economy at the same time.  I researched various cars like new Accord touring, Acura TLX, 2017 Audi A4, Bentz C300, Lexus IS350 and S60 Inscription. I narrowed it down to Volvo S60 inscription and Audi A4.  After test drive, the Volvo S60 Inscription stands out to be my top choice: it has the most head room for me and it is easily one of the smoothest to drive at all speed range. Standard features include leather interior, HD radio,  rear window sunshades, city safety and glass sun roof etc.ExteriorThe 18"" titanium wheels look handsome and provide very good ride quality. The tall roof line makes entering and existing the car extremely easy. The car looks small from outside while roomy inside.InteriorHigh quality leather seats, simple yet elegant color combination is pleasant to my eyes. The sit position is more upright compared to other cars, together with excellent all-round support and wide adjustment range from the seat as well as from the steering wheel, easily provide the most comfortable experience among all the cars I've tested. The silk metal trim gives solid and luxuries feeling, the steering wheel has the perfect size, it feels really good in hands.DrivingI own a Honda accord and my first impression driving the S60 is that the cabin is whisper quiet, much quieter than my Honda. The acceleration feels like a powerful V6,  the S60 feels very solid on road. It does not have much body roll when making turns, at the same time it filters uneven road surface nicely.Safety featuresSafety feature includes the ability to stabilize the car in case of a flat tire; also good space between the front bumper and the radiator that can reduce damage in case of low speed accident (There is a sticker on the rear window of the passenger side that indicates the car's rear and front bumpers are designed to withstand 3 miles/hour hit limit, which exceeds the standard 2.5 mile/hour limit, which result in no structure damage and minimum bumper damage that can be fixed easily ); the city safety triggered once when a biker cuts in front of my car when my car was moving slowly, nice!EntertainmentI loaded all my music collections on to a USB stick and plugin to the USB port in center console. The album name, album photo and track names are displayed on the LCD screen. I can now enjoy the high quality music on my daily commute.Overall the S60 inscription is an elegant car that meets all my requirements, it provides an extremely well balanced experience that makes the daily drive a true joy.Update (11-19-2016):The combined MPG is now 29.4 at 3316 miles, compared to 28.4 at 1800 miles, my daily commute includes mountain road with  a lot of up and downs. Started to use the front seat heating feature as it is pretty cold now in the morning. I can feel the heat in less than 10 seconds. I hope the steering wheel could also be heated.",5

On the technology front, I simply don't want to drive anything else now (haven't driven my wife's Touareg in months - anytime we go out together, it's in the Volvo).  The adaptive cruise control has more than once alerted me to stopped traffic on I75 outside of Atlanta, and applied the brakes sooner than I would have by myself.  Combine the adaptive cruise with the blind spot detection, and it's like having a very competent copilot with me on every drive.  The cross-traffic alert is also very helpful - scans for people or moving vehicles as you are backing up and sounds an alert.  Ride comfort is a 10/10.  Incredibly comfortable leather seating and solid, quiet ride.  Reliability has been outstanding so far - I just passed the 20K mark with zero problems.

Better riding vehicle due to the longer wheel base and  much more comfortable & spacious backseat.

I love the adaptive cruise control and use it every day.  The safety features (lane keeping aid, collision warning, etc) alone make it worth it.  And being able to use regular gasoline is a big plus.  Bluetooth connectivity to my phone is wonderful. The system text-to-voice system reads incoming texts to me and I then ask Siri to respond to them.  Built-in USB port in the console just makes sense.  Oh, and the dealership (Keystone Volvo) was fantastic.  They advertise ""No hassle, no hype"".  I didn't believe the ads before.  Now I do.  Terrific experience.  The only possible change I'd like to see in future versions is a larger display but that will always be true.  One other thing - I should have taken advantage of the free trip to Sweden to get my car from over there.",5

Looked at MB C  class, Audi 4. BMW 328, Mazda 6.  All had their strong points but I settled on a Volvo S60 Inscription.  Did not need the extra back seat room but sedans are hard to find in the platinum edition and I the deal was hard to pass by.  At first I questioned my decision but now appreciate the vehicle and highly recommend it.  No, it will not blow off your socks but it will move out.  The bells and whistles are awesome.  Cars, like dogs reflect their owners  and if you are looking for a good value, great safety features and performance for majority of us, you cannot go wrong with this vehicle.  Plus is uses 87 octane!  That is a huge money saver!  Eight months in now and no issues!",5

Was time for us to buy a sedan and move on from the mini vans and suv's. I had been wanting a Volvo for some time. Went to test drive a used T5 with open mind to other options, if price was right. Wound up comparing the 5 cylinder, AWD (used) to the 4 cylinder Front WD (new). Both cars felt very similar in handling, pick up etc. The better gas milage of the new, 4 cylinder won us over. Got a great deal at our local dealership. Super thrilled with our purchase. A couple minor disappointments. No standard back up camera. We were very used to this option and are considering putting one in. Trunk space is quite an adjustment. Half of a decent grocery trip winds up in the back seat. Other than that, I am a happy girl!!",5

Volvo does front seats better than anyone in my opinion; these are sculpted and amazingly supportive in beechwood/black leather. The feel of the car is luxurious, tight, quiet and cocoon-like but it gives you a sense of being in touch with the road and very much in control. Consumer Reports recommends this car and says reliability is ""better than average."" This trim line comes with  an excellent Harmon Kardon stereo with 12 speakers, LOADS of safety features and electronics; my car insurance went DOWN 25% due to Volvo's safety record! The lighting throughout the cabin--which is very important to me--is really nice...with foot well lights front and back and lots of little ambient lighting touches throughout. The center console storage area feels small to me and is a little too vertical in comparison to my last car. The car feels welcoming and calming inside with its beautiful Scandinavian design cues and subtle luxury touches. This car has the extra 3"" wheelbase and therefore backseat room which is really nice. It feels sporty and nimble and can take corners quickly without a squeal but isn't a sports car per se. I shopped Audi A4, Lexus 250, BMW 328 and Volvo felt like the best overall choice for me in European sport sedans. (Most striking to me was that the current A4 was rated ""poor"" in one critical IIHS front collision test!) The Volvo trunk is spacious. This car comes with intelligent cruise control, backup camera, parallel parking assist, Volvo's BLIS system, keyless entry, fold-up outside mirrors, home link, navigation and mine has the 19"" alloy wheels with big Pirelli tires. I will check in again in six months and hopefully still be as happy then as I am now with my S60.UPDATE: Six months in, I am still very glad I got my S60 Inscription! It is quick, nimble, very comfortable to drive in city & on the open road. The safety systems are superb & work exactly as designed! The radar-controlled smart cruise control amazes me every time I use it & the sensors front & rear and side-to-side make any parking pickle a breeze. And those industry-leading Volvo front seats do not disappoint. Awesome audio, too. The only small complaints I have are: some creaking in the interior on the rear right side of the cabin (although no squeaks or rattles of any kind) and I find that the wiper/washer/headlight washer system sprays excessive amounts of windshield spray which doesn't drain off the car properly & requires numerous wiper swipes to clear. All things considered, I would definitely buy Volvo again.",5

This was my first car, and I still drive it. One thing people need to understand about this car is that it's an old luxury vehicle. Most old luxury vehicles aren't built for long term use. They're built to be driven off the lot for two years to be returned to the dealership so the owners can get a new lease. I'm so thankful Volvo doesn't fit into this category. This car is an absolute tank. You can go to hell and back with this vehicle and not only will you be safe, but your vehicle will be able to run on as well. I've been driving this think with a broken transmission for 3 years. Let me repeat that. This thing still drives with a malfunctioned transmission. This car is durable and it will stand the test of time. As long as you keep up on maintenance and aren't an idiot, this will be the most reliable vehicle you've ever owned.

Great! It was a good deal, $5,200 for a cute looking car with only 60-some thousand miles on it-- leather, sunroof, great looking Carfax... This was in 2014. Two and a half years later... I wish I'd gotten a Toyota or Honda. The few mechanics in my city that specialize in Volvos/European cars are always busy-- so busy they don't even pick up their phones... What does that say about Volvo reliability?? Driving it home I noticed a loud, scary rattle... the exhaust pipe was falling off! Plus the engine was gunked up. Got all that fixed... Fan motor on A/C developed an annoying chirp. $$$. Oil changes were pricey. Brakes needed replacing sooner than expected... outrageously expensive!!! Bulbs ALWAYS going out. Then it developed a gas smell so strong that I couldn't park the car in the garage because the house would smell like gas! Had it looked at by 2 diff mechanics... one couldn't figure out the problem, the other wanted $350 just to do the work to diagnose. One of the mechanics told me he thought the transmission would go out soon too! Replaced a part myself, didn't fix the gas issue... Finally said screw it, I'm getting rid of this thing. So only 30,000 miles later, I've sold it for $1,100... and I feel sorry for the person getting it.",2

The quality of manufacture is excellent, nothing feels or looks cheap, except the faux wood paneling in the interior.  The key access port for unlocking the truck is badly placed and difficult to get to, but you'll probably use the remote entry anyway.  The anti-theft alarm is hit or miss.

756, on 05/22/17 12:18 PM (PDT),John H ,2014 Volvo S60 Sedan T6 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),"Value, Performance, Sex Appeal (in that order)"," I researched vehicles in this class thoroughly before making a buying decision.  First, let me state that I have no need for any of the common bells and whistles that manufacturers have been adding to vehicles these days such as lane departure warnings, park assist, even navigation.  This review does not evaluate those areas because quite frankly I don't care about them or use them.  I'm motivated by the following:  how does the car drive, how does the car look, does the car meet my interior/storage needs and how reliable is the car?  That's it.  With that in mind, let's get started.  I narrowed the field down to the Audi S4, Lexus IS350 and the Volvo S60-T6 since all had similar performance specs like 300 HP and AWD as well as identical 0-60 times.   In terms of pure driving performance and sex appeal, the S4 and IS350 win without question.  I'd put the IS350 as the champ.  However, after many test drives I came to realize that 90-95% of the performance those cars offer can be found in the S60-T6 for only 70% of the price.  In other areas such as rear passenger area & trunk space, the S60 was the winner.  I've only owned this car for 30 days so I can't speak to the reliability yet, but I'm expecting industry-standard costs.  One of the things I've noticed is that it's not as smooth in Sport mode both in up/down shifting as the others, but in regular drive mode it's fine.  Aside from that, it's a joy to drive and at a fraction of the cost of it's peers.  And even though I didn't need a luxurious leather seat, it truly is like sinking into a Lay-Z-Boy recliner--amazing.  Bottom line: if you're looking for best in class regardless of price, look to Audi or Lexus and expect to pay $7k-$10k more.  If you want the best interior comfort & space, equal acceleration, 95% driving dynamics and 90% sex appeal for 70% of cost compared to rivals, the S60-T6 is the choice to make.  I've been incredibly happy with it.",5

It is just an all-around competent vehicle that is a pleasure to get in and drive everyday. It has a super high quality feel - like it's built very solid, something I didn't get in my Accord or Camry Hybrid. I just love the leather interior in this car - it is thick, comfortable, and smells great. The performance is more than adequate with the 5 cyl T5, steering and handling are excellent, and the comfort on long road trips is great, even with two bikes on the roof. Reliability has been fine - just routine maintenance required, and one A/C component replaced under warranty. I couldn't be happier.Update - still happy with my S60. I do sometimes wish I had the newer 4 cyl Drive-E, as it gets better mpg with the same performance, but everything else about this car is superb,  so I'll live with it.

Sure it has 4 doors but the back seat is useless. The trunk isn't much better. At 12cu. ft. even a simple weekly trip to the grocery store requires items to be put in the back seat for the trip home. As for a road trip with more than 2 people just forget it. There is no way to put enough luggage in the trunk for anything more than a weekend and anything bigger than an infant in the back seat is a joke. Ironically, the only people that would fit in the back seat only make the lack of trunk space worse because they require even more stuff. Fuel economy on a vehicle of this size is awful. I owned a Accord before this vehicle and the mileage was on average 35% better for a vehicle that was bigger and older. The audio controls are confusing and lack simple functions. The Volvo system stores information some logical and some not so logical places. The resale value of this car has plummeted and I am not in a market where there are a number of these vehicles available so oversupply is not driving down the price. If we had not traded a paid in full vehicle against the purchase I would be upside down on the loan.

772, on 03/31/16 13:14 PM (PDT),Brian ,2013 Volvo S60 Sedan T5 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6A),A solid workhorse in a field of sprinters," Here's the deal, this car is a niche buy and tell you why. But first some background. My job is in the automotive electronics world, so working with car companies and design engineers is what I do 50 hours a week. What most engineers will tell you over dinner is that Volvo's have and do have the most solid design in the world. What that means is that they favor safety and long-term reliability over short-term aesthetics and performance. Here is where the problem begins. There are large segments of car buyers and this one fails to hit a big group. I'll get to that later. But here goes my personal review.This is an awesome car, but I'll give my 3 small criticisms. 1. The backseat. There are no 2 ways around this. The backseat is comfortable but insanely small. If you're over 5ft 8 inches, people will be uncomfortable sitting behind you. 2. The instrument cluster/infotainment. The speedometer takes a little getting used to. I'd expect a digital one to be honest, but you don't get it here. Can't say why its off a little, but its a minor annoyance.3. Front seats. This is really dependent on the person. I'm 6ft 5in, so I'm a big guy. This car has really nice, comfortable seats, but they sit low and the whole car has kind of a low profile. For the extra long trips, comfort is a bit of an issue. But this is really just a big person problem. My wife and brother in law have driven it long distances as normal sized people in great comfort.Now the good. Where do I start. I have the AWD version and live in Minnesota, so you can do the math of how much fun you have when you mix a turbo with AWD in the snow. But that's not unique to this car. What is unique is the build itself. What you'll find when you drive european cars like this is that they just feel tight, from the suspension to the steering. But the S60 has an extra feeling of being just solid and that doesn't wear off. If you care to do so, just open the hood or go underneath it. I've done a little work myself and can tell you that they are meticulously well built and designed. There is a really rugged simplicity to them.  the car is sport, quick and responsive. Don't believe reviewers that tell you otherwise. Simply google the 0-60 and other tests, it performs well. This is where it begins to distance itself from the Audi's and BMWs. These Volvos are best bought by people that plan to own them for a while. the target market is someone who wants a nice European style sedan with Japanese reliability. I've only had to have on repair done and it was the electronic parking brake motor (under warranty). But I can tell you that the repair bills will be nowhere near that of its European cousins, but will be higher than an American or Japanese car. The bottom line is that no matter what you hear or are told by Audi fanboys and the like, the S60 is a better car if you care about long term reliability and affordability. You may get a little more short term spunk from the Audi and BMW counterparts, but the only other place you'll get more is the price tag and the repair bill. There has been a ton of market research on this point and there is a significant segment of the population that buys European cars in this price range. That segment is men, ages 25-40. The main reason they buy them is the name recognition and status. The problem for Volvo is that Audi, BMW and to some extent VW own this space almost completely. There are 2 companies trying to crack that market. Cadillac, with their ATS and Volvo with the S60. Both a failing for the most part. The reason is that they don't have 4 rings or a blue and white badge on the grill. Long review, but I feel this car deserves it. Don't fall victim to the popularity contest. In this class of cars, this is the smart person's choice.",5

Unlike the same feature in many other cars, the Sport mode enhances performance considerably. It is quiet, smooth, and much faster than I had expected.

I wish I had the voice activated phone and built in garage door opener, but that's only on the top of the line. Overall, it's the best car I've ever owned. I have owned a T5 AWD automatic premier for 2 years now. While I initially got poor gas mileage, it has improved to almost 22 over all, and I got 32 MPG highway on my last road trip.  I get about 21.5 in typical suburban driving and commuting. (FYI: In 2015, the new 4 cyl engine is faster and gets 25 city, 37 highway.) Other than that the car handles great, is very smooth and comfortable and has very good acceleration. I have had no problems so far. Another negative is that the controls, radio, seat heater etc. are a bit difficult to operate, but eventually I got used to it.

And this car passed the newest type of crash test at the IIHS which Mercedes, Audi, BMW didn't pass at all. Acura barely passed. Do other cars get better performance specs?

The S60 is smooth, quiet, composed, solid, quick, very comfortable with superb seats and firm suspension that is never harsh.I recommend the Polestar modification that makes the vehicle faster, reduces throttle/pedal travel and makes power available more immediately.

I bought my used car at 79K and put over 24K miles in less than 2 years. Every other month something major needed repairing. Things that I never ever had to repair on a 2001 Honda Accord EX which I put over 240K miles. Things like the throttle, system tire service, two front wheel well, anything to do with suspension is not covered after factory warranty even is you buy additional warranty from the dealership.  I spent more in less than 2 years on my S60 than I've ever have on my Accord.  The difference, I bought my Accord brand new and all the miles i put on it were mine and I took very good care of my Accord so I definitely got my money's worth.  Because the previous miles on the Volvo were not mine, I can only suspect that drove it rough and did not take great care of the car.  OR it is just a car that needs LOTS of ATTENTION and REPAIRS.  I will NEVER buy another Volvo because it is too expensive for repairs and not very reliable. This would be winter number 2 for my Volvo and I'm not expecting much.

They also often do not repair what you asked them to repair. Recently I ordered a new key and remote for my 2009 Volvo, which was missing one of the two when I purchased it.The key and remote were about $300.

The proportions are perfect, and the styling is classic.  The interior is the best place to be of any of the 50 plus cars I’ve owned.  The aesthetics are perfect.  The performance of my T5 AWD is what I expected, not a killer, for sure.  I knew that going in, and if performance with a capital P was totally important, I would have sprung for the T6.  My driving is mostly highway, and 250ish HP is a OK.  And now the minuses.  The corporate 4 cyl. is....well, a 4 banger.  It isn’t particularly smooth, and doesn’t sound that great either.  It’s obviously a modern motor, but suffers from a cylinder deficiency in a large car application.  Sorry Volvo, but one size really doesn’t fit all.  It isn’t a horsepower issue, it’s about refinement and smoothness.  Lastly, the ride...it’s not that great.  Even on a smooth interstate highway, you can feel too way much road.  I understand it isn’t a Rolls or Big Jag, but it isn’t an E class either.  Volvo would do well to farm out the chassis tuning if they can’t do better.  Bottom line the S90 is one or two cylinders and a more compliant chassis away from a World class near luxury sedan.",4

The touch screen eliminates all the draw pads and knobs which I thought were a pain.  Everything is so simple and intuitive.  The auto pilot beats every other gizmo out there.  I waited to see th 2019 Lexus ES300h, which I also owned when it first came out and loved the gas mileage. That is not such an issue these days, and, I’m tired of how Lexus keeps making their grill more and more crazy  horizontal, vertical, etc.  The Volvo has an elegant look, and the back seat has even more room than the Lexus.  It drives nicely and has a huge sunroof.  The rear seat has buttons to move the front seat forward, and can also adjust the sunroof shade.  Both rear seats fold down for extra trunk space.  The trunk opens with your foot and closes automatically.  In addition to the touch screen, which behaves like an iPad with swiping, Volvo has a great iPhone app that starts the car using On Call.  It can also lock and share stats.  It’s much better than the Audi app that was created with weird, multiple tabs.  I got the T5 for better mileage. The engine is a little noisy, but, that’s ok.  I’m very happy with driving this luxury sedan and got a good deal on it.  Signing the contract was awesome.  Th finance office desk is a actually a 3 x 4 giant screen and all you do is review and click.   Completely paperless!  I was in and out in minutes and they didn’t push all the extra warranties like Audi.   Very pleased!",5

I love the Thor's hammer headlights and the wide stance of the vehicle with the big 19' Pirellis. I've got lots of extras on it, which are functional and work super well. But my only concern with this car is the ride...at times very hard and not as sophisticated as a car at this price point should feel. Excellent gas mileage; great on the road feeling. LOVE LOVE LOVE the backseat legroom and the extra right passenger side buttons that control front right seat and sunroof. The car LOOKS serious, which I love. I've gotten many compliments on it. Pick up on this super well designed 4-cylinder turbo is beyond impressive. Love the stereo (standard) and the 360 camera. At times, the sensors for parking and other safety functions seem a little too sensitive but rather that than the opposite. Seat comfort is FANTASTIC, front and back. Ventilation and climate control are superb. Interior materials on all surfaces are FAR SUPERIOR to many makes of car. No rattles, squeaks or creaks throughout.

I am not a big fan of fancy cars, but was looking for a new car anyway; so I decided - why not. After one month of driving Volvo S90 T6 AWD Momentum here is my couple of cents.  1. Driving dynamics: Superior in every aspect:acceleration, braking, keeping the line, softness/firmness combination etc. 2. Radio: Could be better in a car with MSRP> 60K. 3. A/C heater fan: very loud, could be quieter in 60K car. 4. Infotainment/Comfort controls: everything is incorporated in Ipad like touch screen device. It is very confusing and it is not safe.I would change it back to buttons in a heart beat. As I said in a title: Excellent car for 325 a month. For 400 I would shop around.

It was as if the entire car depended upon a Windows 95 operating system that needed defragmentation and rebooting every day.  Systems froze constantly but at random, providing a bad entertainment system of a sort.  Applications never worked.  Mobile WiFi connectivity was usually beyond the car's ability (displaying a nearly-ubiquitous  message of ""No connection to service"").  On my last drive the driver's seat moved on its own, the cruise control failed, the pilot assist failed, and the rear brakes (which had been replaced once) resumed their habit of bringing the car to a stop (when in reverse) with a lurch and a boom (as if I had hit something, which was never the case).  I have driven a Volvo for 33 years and still own some older ones, but I do not think I will ever buy another one.Update: I traded in the vehicle and took the loss now as opposed to later.

The interior and exterior style is one of the best in its class; the Audi A6 feels uninspired, the BMW 5 series is just basic, only the Mercedes E class might be able to hold a candle to the S90. Here’s what I love about the car:1.	Design is absolutely incredible. 2.	B&W sound system is incredible!3.	iPad-like infotainment system is intuitive and awesome4.	Safety systems. I can never go back. The Auto-pilot, adaptive cruise, lane keep, collision detection all work as advertised and are amazing.5.	Heads up display (HUD) is a cool trick! I thought it was gimmicky but now love it.6.	AWD performance in rain is incredible. On snow… not so much, but I blame the tires not the car.7.	Heated/cooled seats 8.	The diving profiles really change the characteristics of the car.9.	Ability to send the car destinationsMy issues with the car: 1.	Fit and finish. The car has excessive squeaks, rattles, and road noise for a car with this price tag. I was caught up in the moment when during the test drive, but now after a couple of months, I need to drive with the music playing in order to enjoy the car and drown out the squeaks coming from the door seals and plastic bits. The road noise is also incredibly intrusive on Oregon/Washington pot-hole and crack-laden roads and highways. The luxury feel is compromised by the noise which is really unfortunate. 2.	My second issue is with the front seats. The seats use a wire springs to support the driver. Unfortunately there are also some hard metal support beams that provide structure and rigidity to the thigh and leg support portions of the seat. Under the weight of the driver, these support 'beams' dig into your leg and thigh. No amount of adjusting will prevent this. Volvo should have used higher density foam or a full metal support under the seat to prevent the driver’s weight from compressing the foam and causing the support to dig into the drivers legs. Again, I must have been caught up in the moment of the test drive, because I didn't notice this until after I took the car home. So I'm relegated to using a donuts or foam cushion for long-hauls. 3.	Opportunity number three. The infotainment system is ever so slightly under powered. It takes a lot of time for it to boot up. Thankfully the instrument cluster starts up right away. 4.	Four, certain items need to be turned off every driving session. For example, the auto high beams, the auto start/stop, or my preferred driver setting -- I need to turn these on/off every time I start the car. Other manufactures got this right. For example, BMW let customers change the default setting for auto start/stop to remember the last selected setting. I WISH Volvo would do that.5.	A/C has a tendency to kick into high gear randomly and it becomes really loud. You’re forced to turn it off if you are on a call. I think the problem is with the logic for the auto climate particularly when you have the 2nd row turned on. It’s as if the system was trying to compensate for the temperature differential and just… overcompensates.6.	General reliability: Since taking ownership in February, I’ve gone to the dealership 4 times (I’m writing this review in April). Issues ranging from recall notices (for leaking A/C lines and trim pieces fall off) to excessive condensation in the headlights (which still isn’t fixed even after new headlights) and a bunch of software issues. I’ll be scheduling a new visit to the dealership soon for break-related issues.7.	Wifi hotspot stopped working. Maybe because of my trial ending, but It stopped about week 2.8.	The on call app is a bit limited in its utility. At this point it’s not worth paying for after the trial period ends.9.	One last minor gripe. The manual claims that there is a power rear sunshade. I beg to differ. Found no mention of it being an option.Overall, the car is soooo close to being perfect. My biggest concerns are with the rattling noises, uncomfortable seats, and with general software issues. I really wish I didn’t have to have a routine of turning on/off my settings every time I turn on the car. These fit-and-finish items are what hold this car back from really being able to compete against the refinement of the A6 and E class. I’m still holding out hope that these problems will be worked out in future Volvos built on this platform.",3
834, on 04/10/17 03:50 AM (PDT),Llefty ,2017 Volvo S90 Sedan T6 Momentum 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),Great value," I don't know why my rating is coming up as two stars.  I'd rate it four stars.  I've only have my S90 for a short time, but so far, it's everything I wanted: all-wheel drive, fuel efficient, roomy, stylish, four heated seats, individual climate control, dynamic cruise control, LED steerable lights, handless trunk, good user interface.  I have a 2015 Lexus GS 350 and the Volvo turned out to be a better value than a 2017 GS 350.  Where I live, you can't find a Lexus with comparable equipment.  And if you want a user interface that will drive you nuts, try Lexus.  My only two complaints are that the stock stereo is a bit anemic and there are a few settings, like auto highbeams, that have to be turned on every time you get in the car.  Also, the car is more of a cruiser than a sports sedan.  However, that it is not to say that it isn't stable or sufficiently responsive.  Unlike the previous reviewer, I haven't had any problems navigating the Sensus tablet-like interface.  Nor have I found Sensus to be slow to start.  I also am able to have my iphone chord come out of the center console while keeping the console closed.  I agree that it would be nice to have more usb ports rather than cigarette lighter outlets.  I absolutely love the dynamic cruise control, which works like a charm.  I've put 10k miles on the car in six months and love it even more than when I got it.",4

I have driven it almost every day since for 20 years. In that time, I have replaced the Radiator and repaired both the A/C once and the Drivers side window. The car has 232,000 on it ( 50/50 city highway ). Never has it failed me yet. It is even still using the factory installed Bosch Platinum spark plugs. However, the car EATS batteries. 24 months!! Period!! Any kind, any use, 24 months almost to the day and the battery is fried. Also, it rides a bit like a truck. On the highway, it's a cloud and the faster you go, the better the gas mileage and ride, but in the city you feel every crack in the road (albeit gently).  This sounds terrible, but the car starts first time, every time, from 45 below to 123 in the Desert, accelerates well and has a Ludicrous Top Speed for a luxury car (168 mph). Snow, Ice, Rain and it's relentless. Even on Ice it holds it's own well. I LOVE this car.  Another down side is parts (struts and spares are becoming impossible to get). Nevertheless, It's been solid, durable, and dependable beyond my wildest expectations. If they made this same model today, I would buy 2 more, hang the price.",4

A lot of people complain about the little things like sunroof or power window issues, which can often be fixed at home, but they are missing the point. The point of this car is to get you from ""A"" to ""B"" in style, comfort and safety. I have only had regular maintenance performed on the car and it runs like a champ every day. I love the smooth power of the I-6 engine. Comfort is amazing even with my 2+ hours of daily driving I have no back pain when I get out of the car. The stock speakers are mind blowing. The drive train is rock solid. It's now at 165,000 and I expect it  to double that. This is my 3rd car and I plan to keep it forever! ",4.5

It does eat tires for some reason, it seems like I'm replacing the Michelins about every 30k miles, buy the tire warranties.  This is the last of the pre-Ford rear wheel drive Volvo's.

855, on 02/15/16 09:16 AM (PST),Bingham ,1998 Volvo S90 Sedan 4dr Sedan,Classic Swedish Style And Grace," The S90 is the last remaining iconic rear wheel drive Volvos produced and the 1998 model year was its swan song. The S90 production was only about 18 months.This model not only competes very well with its European cousins such as Mercedes, BMW and Audi but excels in overall fit, finish, performance and reliability. The S90 has such understated elegance, that belies its true heritage. Make no mistake it is a true Volvo with safety a paramount issue and was the first to employ side air bags in this model year. Although some 17 years now into service, not many are available in the pre owned market.Many of the S90's were used as transportation for royalty, diplomats, executives and UN duty the world over based upon the safety measures that are employed in the S90 as well as its overall performance in emergency situations. One will feel totally safe in this car. Regardless of going out shopping, or a night on the town or a lengthy road trip, the S90 excels in all climates and situations one may find themselves faced with. With its powerful Porsche designed engine cruising the Interstates is a breeze and has low end torque that will sprint you away quickly. Has the tightest turning radius of any sedan in its class, which means even in the smallest of parking situations the S90 excels with ease. Throughout the years of designing and building cars, Volvo's purpose has remained the same: to deliver its occupants to their destination safely and comfortably. Our 1998 Volvo S90 adds another adverb to that list: stylishly. That's right - the famously boxy buggy lost some of its squareness for this the model year, both literally and figuratively. With this beautiful sedan, Volvo lets style ride in the front seat with safety. In other words, ""Sure, we're the safest, but we're darned good-looking, too."" You've seen these pass you out on the roads, and most likely you've noticed the guy behind the wheel going about his commute with a smile. This is the result of rolling down the road enjoying truly exceptional handling and performance while feeling confident that this vehicle, which received stellar ratings in NHTSA crash tests, will protect you should something go awry. Plus the Narcissus in every driver loves knowing that in this car he looks great doing it, too. Spend awhile behind the wheel and you'll get the feeling this car was made for the highway, where you're sure to be all smiles. The Volvo S90 offers you a great choice if you're shopping for a Sedan with a few extras. Add in the Swedish comfort and impressive performance and you have yourself a winner not often found.S90 Description:Basic Information: Model Year: 1998Make: VolvoModel: S90Body Type: SedanSuspension:Independent Suspension: IndependentStabilizer Bar: Front And RearIn Car Entertainment:Audio System: AM/FM Stereo w/CD & CassetteSpeakers: 8Antenna Type: Power RetractableComfort:Air Conditioning: Automatic Climate ControlTrunk LightsDash Trim: Genuine WoodMats: Carpet Front And RearReading Lights: Front And RearRearview Mirror: Day-NightSteering Wheel Trim: LeatherVanity Mirrors: Driver And PassengerDoors:Front Doors - 2Rear Doors - 2Engine:Engine Description: 2.9L I6 24VFuel Type: Premium GasCam Type: Dual Overhead CamFuel Induction: MPIValves Per Cylinder: 4Aspiration: NormalMPG Automatic City: 18MPG Automatic Highway: 26Instrumentation:SpeedometerClock Fuel Gauge w/low level alertTachometerAmbient Temp LCD Readout with Black Ice Warning that turns display Red.Seats:Seating Capacity: 5Drivers Height: PowerDrivers Lumbar: ManualDrivers Power: 6 way with memoryPassenger Height: PowerPassenger Lumbar: ManualPassenger Power: 6 with memoryFront Seat Type: BucketUpholstery: LeatherPrivacy Pockets: Front Of Both Driver & Passenger SeatsCenter Armrest: With Pass-ThruHeat DuctsHeated Seats: Driver and PassengerFeatures:Floor Covering: Deep Pile CarpetBumpers: Body-ColoredDimensions:Luggage Capacity: 16.60 Cubic FeetMaximum Seating: 5Length: 191.80 InchesWidth: 68.90 InchesHeight: 55.60 InchesWheelbase: 109.10 InchesCurb Weight: 3521 PoundsDriveTrain:Transmission: 4-Speed AutomaticDrive Train Type: RWDDriven Wheels: Rear-WheelWheels Rims: AlloyWheels Spare Rim Type: SteelRoof and Glass:Front Wipers: Fixed & IntervalRear DefoggerRear Windows: PowerSunroof: PowerPrivacy Glass: LightConvenience:Cruise ControlWindows: PowerSteering Power: Hydraulic Power-AssistSteering Adjustment: ManualOutside Remote Mirrors: Power RemotesPower Door Locks: Power With 2 Stage UnlockCupholdersDoor PocketsPower Outlets 1Seatback Storage: 2Memory Features: DriverMemory Features Number of Drivers: 3Keyless EntrySafety:Driver and Passenger AirbagSide Airbags: Seat MountedABS: 4-WheelAnti Theft SystemBrakes: 4 Wheel DiscSafety LocksHeadlights: HalogenHeadlight Cleaners: Wiper And WasherDaytime Running LightsFog Lights: HalogenTurning Circle: 31.80",5

Although some 17 years now into service, not many are available in the pre owned market. But by chance you find a well cared for S90, I recommend you buy it fast. There are no dissappointments with this vehicle and has all the creature comforts of anything offered today.I have had many Volvo's over the years and the S90 is a prime example of Volvo's time honored tradition of safety first. Cabin comfort is far and away in the tradition of fine craftsmanship. The fit and finish of the leather has to be seen to fully appreciate. And with the side air bag in the seat bolster, along with the SIPS system ensures driver and passenger safety. All seats have springs for added comfort with lumbar support. Same holds true of the rear seating. All who have rode in the back seat have given positive praise to the comfort and the rear reading lights add that additonal touch of class. Finely appointed wood trim and rear console that has two compartments. Eight speaker entertainment center with both CD and Cassette playback as well as AM/FM Radio. A very quiet and user friendly cabin.The S90 has more than withstood the test of time and continues to deliver the promise of what Swedish Luxury stands for. I have mine, now is the time for you to acquire, before they are gone forever. Not many S90 were made.",5
857, on 09/17/13 09:38 AM (PDT),kblupino ,1998 Volvo S90 Sedan 4dr Sedan,The Ultimate RWD Volvo," Although the Scandanavian cubist design was starting to get a bit old by 1998, one thing that they got spot on was the interior--it is absolutely fantastic. The leather seats with suede inserts completely coddle their occupants. And the tasteful, real(?) wood accents would not look out of place in a car costing much, much more. And while I was a bit uncertain about the Volvo 24-valve V-6 engine, they had gotten all the kinks worked out by the '98 model year, and it's nice having decent (by 1998 standards) power in a Volvo. I drove it as my daily driver for five years, and now my kids drive it. With full front and side (in 1998!!!) airbags I feel safe with them driving it. The car is barely middle-aged in terms of mileage, and has many years left in it before it's in need of retirement. Yes, sometimes it can be costly to repair, but as long as it's maintained it really doesn't ever need repair. And while the boxy design was a cliche for Volvo for many years, I kind of like it. Simple, functional, and different. The S90 represents the ultimate old-school, rear-wheel-drive Volvo.",4

By the way, if you are up in the air between this car and a 99- 2003 S80 go with this car much less issues.  The S90 is RWD and has an amazing turn radius and cornering ability.  If you like to do your own work on your car this is a blast! Easy to work on and junkyard 9 series parts (940,960,S90) parts are all for the most part interchangeable!

The heating and air conditioning unit is above average. I live in Massachusetts, it gets cold up here and the heated seats are just great for the weather. The car gets warm faster than most cars. This is my first volvo and i have no noteable complaints. Little things on my volvo have gone, like the horn, sunroof, emergency brake, and the doorhandle.

I have had the maintenance done on the car that the book suggests and have had very little problem with it.  At 130,000 miles, I will still take it anywhere.  The 6 cyl engine is still as smooth as it was.  Still handles great.  She still looks new.

Small problems can occur in this car but its like that with any car. I have owned this car for almost a year now and its been a great car. If you don't get at least 170,000 miles out of this car then there is a problem, it's built to last just like all Volvos.

Can you believe that the dealer convinced me that they needed to drop the fuel tank, and re-weld the seams !! What a rip-off they were. Other than that, this is a good, solid car.

It outperformed the 3 series BMW in my test drives, and continues to impress. We were really skeptical on the MPG claims, but it does fairly close to it (if you can resist the temptation to enjoy the surprising pickup). We generally  are ""green drivers"" and get better than usual miles, but I still doubted the 37mpg highway claim. Yet, this morning, I got 33 in a 15mi city drive from my kids' school to the office (A/C on as it was ~90F outside), but this is Raleigh NC traffic (mild). This weekend we had the car loaded with 2x large adults, 2x kids(in giant, heavy, 5 point boosters), 2x 10gl coolers full of drinks and ice, a small bag of clothes, 2 large picnic blankets, 2 folding chairs, and a 60lbs dog, but we still did 29mpg in a mix drive(60mi city/25mi hwy) of 85mi (round trip). The trunk space is great. All that stuff fit and the giant poodle still could stretched out on his bed. The software for trip computer and other things could be simpler, and the breaks feel too smooth for people that enjoy the sporty action of an audi, but the car is excellent in every other way. Ohhhhhhh, the seats are amazing.Updates: over a year in and we continue to be very happy with this Volvo. It is comfortable, has ample space for us, it is versatile, drives like a sports car(except for soft/smooth breaks), and gets decent mileage if driven accordingly. Only snag is that the cell app is impossible to get working for us, so I don't get to turn it on before getting out of the house, etc.",5
889, on 06/06/16 15:07 PM (PDT),Donald North ,2015 Volvo V60 Wagon T5 Drive-E 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),My best driving car yet!," I'm a long time Saab car enthusiast owning several over the past 20+ years including the classic 900 Turbo, 9000 CSE Anniversary Edition, and 9-5 Aero wagon. My 2003 9-5 Aero wagon was a great car to drive, being very comfortable with plenty of cargo space. However at 266k miles, with a daily 90 mile commute, it was time to replace it. I wanted a car as comfortable as it, which is not easy to find. Most cars have poor front seats for long term driving comfort. I like to move around a lot of stuff and need cargo space, hence my interest in only wagons. I briefly considered the 328 wagon - I like its exterior styling, however as typical BMW their seats are uncomfortable to me and you sit too low in the car. My wife recently leased a 320 (drives nice; seats and ergonomics suck), and I sat in every car at the dealer from 2 to 7 series and all of the seats are far less comfortable than those in my V60. I also have a lot of concern about their long-term reliability since I try to keep my cars to 200k+ miles. I also considered the VW Golf wagon, but it wasn't as quiet on the freeway as I would like. I tried and bought a new 2015.5 V60 T5 Drive-E with sport seats and suspension and have enjoyed it every day since I bought it. It's now nearly 3 years old and already has 70k miles and has not had any reliability problems. I recently replaced the tires with the same Pirellis that came with car. It is quiet and smooth at highway speeds and corners tightly and confidently. Front seats are very comfortable and need a little time to break in. Front visibility is great with no glare. I like the control layout and enjoy listening to satellite radio every day. Bluetooth connection to my phone is reliable and telephone sound quality is excellent. My only complaint was the stock acceleration was not quite as strong feeling as I enjoyed with my Saab. However that was fixed and the car transformed when I recently bought the Polestar Performance Optimization software for the car. It can be easily downloaded and installed at any Volvo dealer. With the new software, it now passes very quickly on the freeway while also improving the throttle and transmission behavior. Highway gas mileage in unchanged. This is now one hell of a European car! To me the V60 T5 Drive-E with Polestar software is the best currently available balance of comfort, safety, driving experience, fuel economy, and storage capacity. Highly recommended!",5
890, on 04/20/16 16:43 PM (PDT),Seth Harriff ,2015 Volvo V60 Wagon T5 4dr Wagon AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6A),Really Nice Used Car Value," I looked at small SUVs and wagons with high safety ratings and good reliability. Performance of this model is decent - I have the AWD with the older 2.5 T5 and the 5sp auto. I like the known reliability of the older engine, although the performance and fuel economy of the newer one was appealing, it wasn't an option in this model year, and I was looking for a lightly used vehicle. 2015.5 for electronics is key - better nav, better 'infotainment' with an upgraded Sensus setup. The car has a built-in wifi hotspot (it's ATT service, and free until Volvo figures out how to pass thru charges) in addition to OnCall (Volvo's version of OnStar) and Sirius traffic is free for 4 years from original sale date.Seats are very comfy - I don't have the sport package, which has larger bolstered seats, but I do have the Climate package, so everything that should be heated or cooled is done automatically. Storage is smallish for a wagon, but still useful.Styling of both outside and inside is nice - very Swedish still, which is good - I was glad to see that Geely didn't distract from that or the safety of Volvo when they purchased the company. Safety features are great - backup cam and sensors include a cross-traffic warning, and the City Safety function hasn't been used by me, but it's nice to know it's there.",5

Our dealer only had AWD in stock, but wanted FWD with the new Turbocharged Drive-E 4cyl engine/8-speed transmission. What a great combo of power/torque and gas economy. Easy 30+ mpg highway. Two options ordered were the Blind Spot Information System (BLIS) and heated fabric seats (all)…one of the few cars you can buy heated seats without leather. Base model also lacks the roof rails, also my preference for a cleaner look. And base model dashboard I prefer over the upgrade electronic dashboard.Best Features:  engine/trans combination, classic Volvo seating perfect for my 6’ size, 36,000 miles of maintenance included, and Euro styling.Worst Feature:  1) Excessively aggressive start/stop. Learned to use the paddle-shifter Left to disable in traffic and in anticipation of signal light change and turns. I doubt the feature really saves very much. Just one unplanned repair of this feature in the life of the car will more than negate any fuel saving.2) No Oil Dipstick in the Drive-E Engine…ugh!Also considered the Audi A3 but arrogance of dealer turned me off, and would have also considered a Saab had they not gone broke.Wife has the XC60, and I prefer the V60 as a driver’s car.Tip:  Free 6 months of Sirius has expiration date, so activate your free period promptly.

The only nit I would pick are the comments about the controls of the Sensus electronics system. The review mentions that the control via a dial on the central instrument panel is less than optimal.  I would agree if this was the only way to control the various systems such as media, navigation, internet, etc.  However, all of these systems can alternatively be controlled via the curled knob and a couple of pads located on the right hand of the steering wheel with your right hand thumb.  Personally, I hardly ever use the dial on the center instrument cluster and use the steering wheel controls for entering radio, sirius, internet, navigation and phone inputs which I feel is at least as convenient as a central console mouse type control because you can leave both hands on the steering wheel while controlling these systems.After 18 months and 22,000 miles of ownership the car is still performing as new.  Gas mileage is averaging about 30 mpg which is exceeding my expectations considering its performance and comfort. The only maintenance has been two Dealer 10K oil changes and checkups at no cost to me. The only changes to the car I would recommend are faster than 3G internet and the cars rather wide turning radius makes parking in tight spots a little challenging. The driver and passenger front seats are very comfortable on all day drives. I have now driven my V60 38,000 miles with no problems.  Only routine 10K service and absolutely no repairs or issues with the car.  I use it primarily for road trips and average over 30 mpg.  The seats are really comfortable on all day drives and the leather looks new but I clean and treat the leather upholstery about twice a year so I'm sure that helps.  I replaced the OEM Continental tires after only 25K miles because they became very noisy. The Pirelli P7 tires on the car now are much quieter and seem to be wearing well.Now I have 43,500 miles with no problems.  Only regular 10K service and no repairs.  The 40K service (the first I had to pay for) seemed a bit expensive but I choose to have the brake fluid changed because I live in the humid southeast which added to the cost. I continue to get 30+mpg in mostly highway driving.",5

Or line up for your favorite pseudo-sporty crossover.   But if you're dying for an immensely likeable and practical wagon, the V60 really checks all the boxes.   Seriously folks... the V60 is a Volvo at heart (incredible seats, up-to-date and seamless safety features) with enough spunk and sport to make things interesting.   I went with the FWD version, and am consistently getting mid 20's gas mileage around town, and mid 30's on the highway.  Huge plus -- the 4-cylinder turbo is a VAST improvement over the 5-cylinder turbo I had on my older S60.  Lag is minimal, and the whoosh is maximal.    The ride is Euro firm yet comfortable -- and until I export the car (and my career) to some village in the Swiss Alps, the handling has plenty of bite for everyday driving.  Other positives -- the Sensus system is pretty intuitive, and if you are carting around younger children (roughly 4 to 8 years old) do yourself a HUGE favor and find a V60 with the integrated booster seats.   Incredible option -- almost worth the price of admission for any parent.   No matter how capable the V60 is -- my hunch is that it will get lost in the compact wagon and SUV shuffle.   No screaming BMW badge... no butch plastic on the outside to make you think you're ready to scale Everest.  But consider it your gain.  I got a pretty aggressive deal from my local dealer since these aren't exactly flying off the showroom floor.   And while the rear seat is plenty roomy for kids and teens -- I don't think a 6-footer would want to hang out in the backseat for an extended trip.",5

First was a 2013 S60 T5 (5-cylinder) and because I liked it so much I got a 2016 V60 T5 wagon (4-cylinder). Having always been an ""Audi"" guy (I still think they’re great), I find the Volvo S & V60 out-performs the Audi for city and highway driving (that’s where I drive 80% + of the time) because of its less harsh/ comfortable suspension and its great/ fantastic seats. Also, I find the V60's engine performance is essentially perfect for the real roads of life here in southern California (that coming from a heavy foot), along with its wonderful 8 speed transmission, which has a sport mode that’s great for quicker shifting - performance, driving in the canyons, around town and particularly in bumper to bumper traffic, where it seems to intuitively know when to stay in gear/ not shift.Also, what I like about Volvo’s in general, is there low key great, kind of timeless good looks that project a different, less in your face, “if you will” presence than Audi, BMW, Mercedes. In addition, they are less expensive as well.In conclusion, “If” I wanted my 2016 Volvo V60 T5 to handle closer/ more similar on twisty roads to my previous Audi’s (they are “GREAT/ better” in that area), then all I need to do is get some 18”/ 19” rims that are a bit wider, higher performance tires, also a Polestar chip would not be bad as well.

We were unfortunate members of the VW Dieselgate scandal, and decided to sell our car back to VW and upgrade. While I do miss the sportier handling of my VW, this car is amazing and feels so professional. Also, a week after we bought this car, an Uber driver bashed into my passenger side; without the heavy profile of this car (1-3 tons), I would have been knocked into the next lane and probably been in two accidents. The BLIS safety system helped me prove my case to the insurance company that the other driver was at fault because I saw the BLIS light up as he veered into my lane and was able to share this with my insurance company. Because of all of the safety features of this car, our insurance actually went down from where it had been with my VW. This car will haul you-know-what onto the freeway and turns itself off when you are sitting in traffic, which in LA is a lot. I am not in love with the slow charging USB port, but nothing is perfect. Very grateful to be in a safe and beautiful Volvo, which I have wanted since I was 16. The back also nicely holds our Boxer and German Shepherd dogs and they love to go for rides; they jump right in when I lift the hatch. If my dogs love it, it's a winner! :)",5

917, on 03/31/16 17:15 PM (PDT),Vicki ,2016 Volvo V60 Wagon T5 Drive-E Premier 4dr Wagon (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Immediately Knew It Was My Car," I have spent the last year and a half researching vehicles on line and test driving cars that looked promising.  My focus was on a crossover SUV, with the top three eventually being (in no particular order) the Volvo XC60, Acura RDX and Toyota RAV4 Hybrid.  I test drove all three cars more than once and still couldn't determine a clear favorite.  One evening, I read Edmunds review of the Volvo V60 wagon, which I hadn't researched, but was very interested in the car after reading the review.  I test drove the car a few days later and liked it, and the following weekend, took my spouse to the dealership to try the car, not intending to get one that day.  We were both really impressed with the handling, the zippy drive, and the way it felt on the freeway and on the city streets.  We decided to try the XC60 again while we were there for an immediate comparison, but I got behind the wheel of the V60 one more time and knew it wasn't necessary to drive another car; this one was it, and we drove it home that evening.  Basically, the V60 is very similar to the XC60, just doesn't have the SUV height.  The seats are so comfortable, the dash and instrumentation clear and easy to read, and the best feature for me is the blind spot monitor which is built into the post rather than the side mirror, which I much prefer.  This is a solid vehicle, with excellent pick-up and acceleration and a very smooth ride and very good gas mileage.  I wanted the new safety features available on today's cars which was the reason for the new car, and they are totally worth it.  Backed out of the driveway the other day, and the cross traffic alert let me know that a car was speeding down our street.  Very clear picture in the back-up camera and navigation screen.  All the bells and whistles are easy to program.  V60 scored well on all the safety tests, which was a must for me.  Very happy with the decision, and I am looking for reasons to get in the car and drive it!6-Month Update:  Still love this car.  Seat comfort is outstanding.  We have driven it on a couple of road trips, and the ride is smooth and comfortable.  Air conditioning is spot on, and the sound system is fine, even though we didn't get an upgraded system.  Gas mileage has been good, too, especially on the highway on the trips we have taken.  Two things I particularly love:  the blind spot monitor and the rear view through the back window.  Re the blind spot: the amber light is positioned perfectly on the interior of the car rather than on the outside mirrors as it is on other vehicles.  It is not intrusive at all and is a useful tool when planning to change lanes.  I also really like the view out the back window looking through the rear view mirror.  When the backseat headrests are reclined, it is like looking through a picture window!  Even when the headrests are in the up position, it is still a clear, big view out the back window.  And, the car is fun to drive.  Zippy and responsive.  No complaints or remorse after six months; I really like this car.  My husband enjoyed driving this car so much that he got an Inscription S60, which is proving to be just as satisfactory to him.",5

There are only 4 or 5 fan speeds available, also -- unlike the older system with buttons/dials, where you could control the fan speed much better.  They have also removed the ability to turn off auto-door-locking when the car starts to move, as well as the ability to turn off auto-start/stop and the ability to start in individual mode when the car starts up.  I can't get the radio/audio to not turn on when I turn on the engine.  The driving mode dial is in a horrible location and it's very finicky -- very poor design (this should be on the steering wheel, not in the center console near the cupholders).  The transmission is horrendous -- widely noted in reviews online; it has troubles changing gears smoothly, and this is very annoying to the driver.  The engine is just too small (2-liter, 4-cylinder) for a big, heavy car; having both superchargers and turbochargers seem like big problems waiting to happen down the road, and I wouldn't want this car out of warranty.  There's no option for a CD player in this car.  The gas tank is too small.  Read the Swedespeed.com owners forum to see all the problems owners have with this car.  It does have great potential, and there are a lot of plusses about this car (good visibility, good ground clearance, unique looking, etc.).",3

I just took a 150 mile road trip and enjoyed every mile.  The technology packed into this car is amazing.  Most of the features are intuitive but some  require referring to the manual.  By the  waY the owners manual is over 500 pages.  The manual is stored on the cars computer and is read on the large screen in the center of the dashboard.  Of course the car has to be stopped.   A rather strange sensation occurs while driving on a highway.  When drifting to the painted lane lines, the cars steering nudges back into the center and you feel the tug on the steering wheel.",5
923, on 01/28/17 08:44 AM (PST),christopher jahn ,2008 Volvo S80 Sedan T6 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),A leather trimmed Tank," The turbo of course takes premium gas.  She's a pig for it at a staggering average of 17 miles to a gallon.  So if you've got an aversion to 60 or 70 dollar fill ups his isn't the Volvo for you.  Additionally she takes synthetic for the first 78k miles and then a blend to 120 making oil change pretty costly for the first few years.  I've had this girl since she was new and I'm trading in for an S90.  It's got 91000 miles and all it ever needed was motor mounts (400.00 bucks) and brakes (600.00 bucks). She's does eat up rear brakes a bit but not at an alarming rate like say an Audi does.  I believe this wear is related to the small pad size and the overall weight of the car. It's a heavy car, probably make mostly of rocks.  Tires will set you back a cool 800.00 bucks because you'll need a low profile extra wide bus tire to take the weight.  The seats are great, better than an S class Mercedes or any Lexus in my opinion. The interior is laid out in an elegant simplicity that is very Swedish and logical giving you a much more relaxed driving experience.  If you like your car to have enough buttons all over the place that it looks like a space ship, get a German car, they dig that look.  Overall this is a good car.  It was reliable beyond anything else, including my old S70, and it has enough power to let you move about with confidence.  My primary gripe would be turning radius.  This car by far has the worst turning radius of any car I've ever owned.  You'll need to take a wide shot to get in and out of spots so it's not for the faint of heart when it comes to parking this big girl.  Additionally the sat radio antenna is weak.  I small stand of trees or a bush easily disrupt the signal. In the end it's a Volvo, they pretty much go forever and I'd recommend even an old one like this as a great used car at a good value.",4

Fabulous experience, seamless and excellent handling by Volvo from A-Z. Now NINE YEARS LATER - my S80 AWD V8 - looks and drives like a new car..  Volvo service has been incredible and I've had very few issues. I get an occasional check engine light that is difficult to diagnose. Resetting solves the issue. The radio broke. Volvo replaced it out of warranty no charge parts and labor. What don't I like? The rear seat room is a little tight, though the front is awesome. Very supportive seats for long hauls. The car uses premium; but in a vehicle of this size the transverse mounted V-8 makes the car a rocket ship (when needed). The pearl white metallic tri coat paint is an industry best.

I haven't bought a new vehicle in 18 years (drove a 1998 Mitsubishi Montero for that entire time) and I was expecting the offerings to have changed substantially in that time. Instead what I found was pretty looking vehicles with terrible visibility, cheap interiors, frustratingly anemic CVT's and lackluster fuel economy. If I'm going to drive an unresponsive brick I expect it to get close to 30 MPG overall, not 21 city 28 highway. My massive, old clunker of an SUV got 18 city 25 highway and was fast to boot.So I was pretty disillusioned and decided to go have a look at some used vehicles. Our family has had many Volvos and apart from replacing turbo seals (an issue they have apparently resolved since 2001) never had any issues with them at all (and I'm talking not a single one of them has ever failed to start or had a single mechanical failure over about 40 years of combined driving, 5 cars over 8 years each).So I started looking and was quickly interested in the AWD S80's particularly the turbo inline 6 or T6. I test drove a 2008 with 64000 miles and was elated. The car is solid as a tank, looks new, smells new, feels glued to the road and is a ROCKET! I bought the car as soon as we got back to the dealership.The vehicle is a little slow getting through the first 3 gears unless you give it a little more gas but once it's going and especially on the highway, the car is untouchable. By far the fastest most responsive vehicle I've ever driven or ridden in with the exception of a standard BMW M5. The ride is really smooth with almost no body roll even in tight turns and you feel glued to the pavement. The AWD is definitely noticeable versus front and rear wheel drive mostly as a reluctance of the car to deviate from the line it's on until you turn the steering wheel.Like I said in the title, every aspect of this 2008 S80 is nicer than any new 2016 car I test drove and that includes safety features. You'd be a fool to pass on this car if you have a chance to get a low mileage one.",5

It is one of the safest cars on the road. Yes it's ride is so comfortable and disconnects you from the road but that is nice sometimes, especially on long trips. I own a Mini Cooper so I get my road jollys with that. People complain about the inadequate performance of the base engine. I find that to be a ridiculous statement. It's not a sports car, it's a luxury sedan that handles any road situation under normal circumstances. This is my second Volvo, my first bought new in 2003 and still have it at 235,000 mile. Volvos are known for longevity. Yes maintenance and some problems will arise but it's not as expensive as a BMW or Mercedes and will probably outlast both of them. This is a practical luxury car. It's not for people that care about what others think or how fast you can go from 0-60. I got Volvo's 2008 flagship with 48,000 miles on it for $12,500. Not bad for a car that should be around at 235,000 miles.Update: after adding 25,000 miles to it, there have been no problems. Drives great.",5

My previous vehicle was a Mercedes ML 320, it had many problems and was worth less than $5,000 when I bought my S80 and I still got more comments from people about the vehicle that I drove. The S80 has a subtle presence while still offering most of the power and luxuries that come with owning a BMW or Mercedes.

If the long term reliability is as good as consumer reports rates the 2008, then I can see myself buying Volvo's for a long time.    Performance is outstanding. The 280hp T6 is very fast, especially if you use the tip-tronic shifting.

Although critized I find the ride quite smooth and as pleasant as my wife's Mercedes. The car feels like it floats, and such is not as engaging as BMW, infiniti or alike. The car rides like a cruiser. The car has great passing power, but feels a little slow off the line. The interior is all soft to touch and feels like reserved luxury. You can tell all controls were put in place with safety in mind. The Navi is placed on top of the dash and is operated via steering wheel controls to minimize driver distraction. All audio/car settings can only be adjusted when the car is stopped.",5

1046, on 09/15/15 19:00 PM (PDT),Kevin NC ,2015 Volvo S80 Sedan T5 Drive-E 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Awesome car - Technology needs improvement," Joel H's review was spot on. The 2015.5 Platinum Drive-E is awesome. The gas mileage is impressive - I got as much as 38.5 mpg on the highway. City mileage generally is not near the EPA estimate of 25 - more like 19.  It is a very understated car - most people do not realize what an exceptional car it is - great ride and comfort. The folding rear seats give you additional room when you need to move something. The headlights are absolutely awesome! - They are very bright and turn as you turn the vehicle. I can attest to the fact that it is a safe car. I was in a major accident and my S80 was totaled (not my fault - another guy ran a red light). It did exactly what it was supposed to do - side curtain airbags deployed but the front ones did not (since by then my speed was reduced when I hit a pole). I am glad the front air bags did not go off when they did not have to - my head never hit the steering wheel. Even though the front-end of the car sustained substantial damage, the air bags did not go off when they didn't need to. My only major complaint about the car was the Volvo On Call App. It was one of the main reasons I bought the car - ability to remote start, send destinations from smart phone to GPS, etc. But the connectivity and Volvo support was not very good. Even though reliability was only around 60-70%, I needed it for the remote start. Prior to the accident I renewed my Volvo On Call for 54 months. I paid $600 for 54 months. After the accident, I realized I had 48 months left on the service that I would not be able to use. I called Volvo to get a refund of the remaining time since I obviously would not be able to use the service since the car was totaled. Volvo said too bad - we have your $600 and are going to keep it even though we know we can't provide you the service.  So as a word of CAUTION, it may be tempting to renew for a longer period of time because $11.11 per month (for 54 months) is more reasonable than $16.67 per month (1 year renewal). However, if anything happens to your car, you could be out a lot of money. It basically cost me $100 per month for the service (used 6 of the 54 months). Not worth $16.67 per month for the service and absolutely not worth $100 per month!! Also, as I understand it, if you sell the car, it is not transferable and the new owner will have to buy the same service again. So not good if you think you might sell the car. Just something to consider should you decide to renew. I was extremely disappointed in Volvo's response to my request for a refund. I will never ever make that mistake again! I have another car (different manufacturer) with a similar app and it is substantially more reliable and substantially less expensive. So I know there are manufacturers out there that have Apps that work well.",4
1047, on 07/09/15 08:16 AM (PDT),Joel H ,2015 Volvo S80 Sedan T5 Drive-E 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Wasn't sure about this car at first...," .., but I LOVE it & so does everyone else.  The S80 e-Drive Platinum 2015.5 is under-marketed and you likely aren't chomping at the bit to buy one.  Do not make the mistake of believing what is said about the performance of the professional reviewer even if you are an aggressive driver.   I wanted a car that met the following criteria:  going to be around for 10 years, protect me from the bad drivers on the road today, deliver zippy performance,  provide efficient gas mileage and be comfortable and fun to drive.  I am so glad i got in the S80 at the dealer.  I almost got the S60 but decided the 80 was larger and a better fit for me since i'm 6'2 and over 200.  My son is already 6' at age 14 so space would have been tight for the family in the S60.  I looked at lots of cars and realized i'm not the guy for those that look pompous.  I wanted understated, classy, strong value and safe.   I've got 10k on this now and not one thing has caused me an issue other than figuring out how to setup my Volvo connection account.  Their customer service solved the problem very quickly.   Everyone that rides in it is amazed and says things like ""well, I never"" and ""beautiful"" and ""what kind of car is this again?"".    The technology is significantly advanced over the 2015.   I would purchase it again in a heartbeat.   Two complaints.  First, there is no defined place for sunglasses and they go into a compartment behind the radio or the central bin between the seats.  The compartment behind the radio is most convenient but they fly out when you swing around a sharp corner fast.  I do that a lot.  Second, the cup holders for the front seat are too close together.  As a result, my venti iced latte and my wife's drink like to pop the lid off one another.  Take one for a nice long drive and see if you can return it to the lot.  I could not and look forward to handing this off to my oldest when she graduates college in 7 years.",5

1049, on 04/09/17 12:04 PM (PDT),Clayton Barnes ,2007 Volvo S80 Sedan 3.2 4dr Sedan (3.2L 6cyl 6A),Sweet Ride," I purchased my S80 from the local dealer, it was traded in on a S90.  9 years old, 39000 miles, near as I can tell it never spent a night outside.  The butter soft leather seats are heated, the cab is library quiet.  A handy pass through from the trunk makes the car practical for the occasional trip to the hardware store or more frequent trip to the ski hill.  I've enjoyed one winter, a winter where my hometown of Billings ranked #4 in the nation for snowfall.  The car never faltered, even plowing through seemingly endless series of rutted city streets and making it through the graveled country roads I often travel to see clients.  Now, this 2007 model does not have the now ubiqtuous center stack of video screens and endlessly distracting electronic gew gaws.  The six disk cd changer, superb audio system, and the ability to tie in a ipod or other gadget is wonderful, it is also set up for satellite radio, but I haven't activated it.  Being a child of the 70's and 80's, I enjoy everything from ZZ Top to Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, all of which are perfectly enjoyable either in the car or, cranked, two blocks away.  With no distortion whatsoever.  The dash is clean, laid out very well for the driver, the materials, fit and finish are excellent.  The interior lines are best described as understated elegance.   Roadmanners are superb, the twin turbo, 300 hp straight six is a delight to drive.  One arrives at 100 in no time at all, I have no idea what the top speed is.  I do know it is awful fun to pass those long trucks on two lane roads, far more than it was in the Ford Freestyle this car replaced.  Long drives melt away at a delightful clip, 80 is legal in Montana on most Interstates, 85 in good weather doesn't even get you a blink from the local Highway Patrol.  The sunroof is a welcome option.  In short, this is by far the nicest vehicle I've ever owned, and the purchase price of a mere $14k (Volvo's suffer from undeserved depreciation) was the icing on the cake.  I only drive around 15k or so miles per year, so this car should last me, assuming I don't manage to merge with a wayward deer, many years to come.  If you are fortunate to come across such a vehicle, drive it.  Have it checked out.  Assuming it checks out well,  treat yourself to a super sweet ride.",5

No problems after 135k. Rock solid car.Originally bought it for the seats because of a bad back. Reliability has been superb and fuel economy better than EPA ratings. Seats and leather are world class, and the ergonomic interior is nice. I've come to love the fuselage-like look and design of the floating center stack console.There are trade offs with everything, though. The ride is stiff. If you like the ride of a Honda Accord or the BMW 5 series, you'll like the S80. I'm in my car an average of four to five hours a day, and those aren't pleasant rides for road warriors. That said, I'd buy it all over again. The comfy seats make up for the poor ride quality and the factory Dynaudio premium sound system is amazing.

I didn't really consider any other semi-luxury vehicle, as I was a valet at a major casino in the past and really got to experience everything under the sun. However, be prepared to constantly be addressing small issues, this car is very finicky. Premium fuel is a must to avoid ""mis-fires"" cauing the check engine light to come on. The TPMS system requires at least 38lbs or it will activate. Rear-view mirror was recalled by Volvo and the new one seems just as bad (won't stay put).

I've never felt as safe and secure driving through snow as I do in the  S-80. Added two 9 inch DVD screens to the headrests so we can use it instead of the Minivan in bad weather.

The seats are very comfortable, and fuel economy is reasonable for this class of car.  For some odd reason you have to pull twice on the door handle to get the door to open.  The first pull to unlock, and the second to actually open the door.  Adaptive cruise control is my favorite tech feature, although if you come to a complete stop it disengages after a couple of seconds.  Being a tech nut, my experience with the infotainment system, including navigation, has been a huge let down.  Few road labels on moving map.  Inputs not intuitive.  No touch screen, so controls are clunky.  Menus for settings etc, were hard even for the sales reps and service people to figure out.  Voice commands are slow and plodding.  After fresh navigation update the new database installed still had incorrect information on road accessibility.  Even major freeway intersections were incorrectly configured on the map.  Now get this, navigation updates have to be done with car running, and at a stop, and it takes several hours to do it, seriously.  Also, if you turn off your engine and want to listen to music the car’s infotainment system will turn off after a few minutes, even though the energy required to listen to music is relatively small.  Smart phone connectivity is unreliable.  So for a car that claims to be tech savvy by those that represent it, I was very disappointed to find out how backward the infotainment system actually is.  Which is a shame seeing as how the rest of the car is pretty good.",3

Over the years the quality of the materials has deteriorated.  In my opinion the best of the S80 cars was the 2004 2.5t AWD.   After a few years the SIMULATED metal and wood on the shifting console has started to come off and bubble.  On uneven surfaces the  car is difficult to maintain a straight line.  The steering also pulses when making turns.  Overall I like the ride an comfort but if this is what the future holds for Volvo it will be my last one.,4

First the interior started to fall apart and that wasn't any fun because the prices for parts are ridiculous. Eventually my entire motor blew because Volvo decided that A plastic radiator hose was appropriate for a $55,000 vehicle and it broke off and blew the entire engine.

I get 21 mpg city and 25 highway. Short or long distance driving experience is nothing short of superb. The turbo is awesome, but I also own a 2000 Volvo S80 nonturbo, which is just as great (owned for 6 years and NO bad experience, just routine maintenance). I love my 2000 S80s.

Then a year later the left side collapsed-the same amount. I heard there was a factory recall on U joints and I suspect that I was not the only one to have this problem.

It is a teriffic touring car, with a combination of smooth acceleration with power to get you into or out of the flow of traffic at will, and the comfort to drive for hours without fatigue. Navigation system is first rate. Backup radar has paid for itself several times, preventing rear end damage backing up in tight quarters.

I have had the throttle control valve replaced for about $1,000, after dumping $600 on same problem and cleaning of the injectors.  You will know when the throttle control valve gets dirty when the idle RPMs go up and down and the computer automatically shuts off the cruise while going down the highway because the RPMs are not steady enough.  If yours gets dirty DO NOT bother having it cleaned once to avoid the cost of replacement.  Replacement can be delayed but not avoided.  Just get it replaced and save some $$.",4.5

I have owned Chevrolet, Acura, BMW, VW, Ford, Honda, Toyota, and Lexus vehicles over the past 20 years and have used all in the course of my business. I was attracted to the 2016 Volvo S80 due to its extensive safety features, however, I can honestly say that it is the best highway car I have ever owned. Specifically, it tracks down the road like it is on rails, it has the most comfortable front seat I have ever sat in (still comfortable after a all day 8-hour drive), and it gets good gas mileage (about 35 to 37 miles per gallon when traveling on the interstate at 65 to 75 mph).  The adaptive cruise control and blind spot warning systems are also extremely useful highway features for me. The adaptive dual xenon headlights are the best I have every experienced for nighttime driving.

Although I thought I would really miss not having the T6 AWD engine, I feel the T5 is actually quicker with the turbo.  In addition to the inscription I also have the technology package which is incredible.   I was able to get one of the last 2016 models my dealer had and since the S90's were out was able to get it for below the Edmunds TMV.  There is nothing I dislike about this car.

Almost the same engine as the XC60 (except no supercharger - just the turbocharger) - but the S80 seems lighter and faster.  I really enjoy the quiet cabin and the way the controls are laid out.   There is a smallish-7 inch screen in the center of the dash for Navigation which is good - not distracting, just helpful.   The Bluetooth works great - the stereo sounds wonderful.  Nice, smooth drive and although others have said this is a 'boring car' - I find it just a pleasure to drive.   No drama - just a well thought out, luxury car.  And - at least 10-15K less expensive than a comparable BMW or MBZ.   The best 5 star crash safety ratings too! The only 'minor' issue is that I know these cars lose value quickly - which makes them an absolute STEAL of a used car.

I was surprised that when my friend told me that the transmission was a General Motors product. The problem was the 3rd gear went out. The mechanic told me this was common in this type transmission weither it was in a Volvo or a GM product. The clutches in this type transmission are not as tight meaning the shift will be smoother, but this leaves weaknest in the shifting process but smooth. So if you have tranny problems it will problem be the 3rd gear clutches. But the good news is it will probably be a good old GM transmission. ",4.125

It has all the comforts of home with all the bells and whistles and the safety that Volvo is known for.  The car looks good, has a smooth ride, it turns heads, and even has a kickin' audio system, but my wallet take a punch to the face when I sit in the waiting room of the service department.  Among the thousands I spent in repairs, last week I spent $150 for a simple battery (without the labor cost).  When I disconnected the old battery to purchase a new one, my airbag sensor got disabled, and that cost me $85 just to have the technician connect a computer in the dash and press a button to reset it.

The BMW's are way too high for maintenance, not nearly as fun to drive, and nowhere near as reliable.  I really regret selling the T6.  I bought a new Lexus and although it is a nice car, it's just not exciting like my T6 was.  I never should have changed to the Lexus.  I miss my T6!",5

I've done regular maintenance (very low cost) but I just don't remember having any repairs performed. I can't speak for anyone else, but I would have to say this car is extremely reliable. The only complaint I can find (and really not that bad) is the range on the transmitters. They're really not too bad but I owned a Lexus and it had a little better range.

Common problems: cracked headlight covers, front brakes wear out quickly, timing belt needs replaced every 60,000 miles, front suspension parts wear out and have replaced the same suspension parts more than once.

1455, on 08/16/18 18:40 PM (PDT),Kelly ,2019 Volvo XC40 SUV T5 Momentum 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Perfect Small SUV," We love this car.  It's our first Volvo.  Really like the adaptive cruise control, auto high beam headlights that move with the steering wheel, heated steering wheel, the panoramic sunroof that has a self-closing shade when the car gets too hot.  I find the layout of the controls to be very intuitive.  Love the touch screen with simple home button just like a tablet.  It's small with a tight turning radius that makes it easy to maneuver.  The back storage is brilliant with easy ability to subdivide to keep things from rolling around.  It remembers the side mirrors position along with the seat position for each driver.  Didn't think I'd care about it, but like the different driving modes; regularly change it between Comfort, Dynamic and Eco.  I get better than the EPA gas mileage. Oh, and it has a built in trash can.  Seriously, why doesn't every car have that?",5
1456, on 07/18/18 09:35 AM (PDT),Rebecca Caldwell ,2019 Volvo XC40 SUV T5 R-Design 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),"Brilliant small SUV, perfect if a few tweaks"," I have owned Toyotas, Hondas, Fords, Subarus and Chevy's (this is my first Volvo but my 19th vehicle). This is BY FAR my favorite. Let me qualify my review by saying I have no kids and rarely take passengers other than a couple large dogs so wanted an AWD SUV that was compact but did not lack any of the larger SUV perks and got good gas mileage while still having get-up-and-go. This is the only SUV I found that gives you the same options as the larger SUVs (I'm a gadget snob) while still giving you a decent size engine to get you there as quick as you want with good gas mileage (for an SUV). This does every bit of what I was looking for and does it in still. It is truly a fun car to drive and am so happy I got it. The pros FAR FAR FAR FAR outweigh any of the petty first-world issues I have come across, most of which are to be expected on a first-model year vehicle. The only issues I can find are as follows: CELL PHONE CHARGING: 1) The wireless charger is pretty useless as there is no ventilation in the compartment so it overheats within minutes, 2) with a larger phone (I have a Note 8) you cannot wirelessly charge the phone and use Android Auto (which requires you to use a cable) as there isn't enough physical space, 3) the port to use Android Auto is not fast charging so if you cannot use the wireless charger while using Android Auto, you essentially cannot charge your phone, 4) the only fast charging port in the vehicle is the USB-C facing the rear seats in the center console; LANE KEEP: 1) I find myself ""fighting"" the lane keep assistant as it picks up cracks in the road and is a bit hyper-sensitive at times, even set on the lowest/mildest setting; PANORAMIC MOONROOF: 1) uses a multi-function button that can be overly sensitive and opens things you didn't intend, 2) the screen doesn't always close completely, which may be in part due to the multi-function button trying to open the vent end of the moonroof; DRIVING MODE SETTINGS: 1) The XC40 allows you to set and save individual driving settings (everything from seats to display appearances and driving preferences) and recognizes the driver by the key fob used but, even with this, you still have to change the driving mode setting every time you get in the car (eco mode, performance, etc) - you would think you could make that a default setting with the others; and, finally A/C: 1) other manufacturers have vehicles that do not start air blowing from vents until the air coming out is cool (for A/C) or warm (for heat) but Volvo does not do this so went you turn on the A/C you get outside temp air until the system blows it through and gets to the cool/warm air. OVERALL IMPRESSION: I love this SUV and with a few minor tweaks think it could be the perfect car. I look forward to seeing the coming model years and the perfection that is sure to come.",5

1458, on 04/06/18 07:56 AM (PDT),Anna ,2019 Volvo XC40 SUV T5 R-Design 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Incredible sporty SUV," Volvo really thought of everything for this car. Ladies -- sick of your purse flying around on the passenger's side while you drive? No worries, there's a hook for that, and more shopping bag hooks in the cargo area to keep bags from rolling around with their contents. The car is nearly silent on your average road. Just the slight hum of acceleration, but there is remarkably little wind or road noise, even on the bumpiest, loudest roads. In fact, people I talk to on the phone joke that they know exactly when I'm maneuvering the car because they can hear things that are normally hidden by the white noise of the engine and road. We found the infotainment system to be very logically designed. It functions very similarly to a smartphone. In fact, the settings quick access buttons on the touchscreen feel very reminiscent of the android pull-down settings menu. After a week, using it feels very natural. My one gripe is that I wish the 360 camera were easier to access quickly. It will appear automatically when it senses I'm parking between two cars, but when I'm pulling into my very tight garage or straight into a parking spot, I have to manually pull it up. Not a big deal -- just takes 2 seconds, but hopefully there will be a shortcut option on future iterations. Auto-park is wonderfully helpful for tight spaces. The upgraded sound system is excellent -- coming from an audiophile. The self-driving features are wonderful for the highway and really serve to reduce fatigue by keeping you in the lane and following the car in front of you at a given distance. We really enjoy the highly customizable driver profiles that can both be programmed to a specific key and overridden through the settings menu. One thing that I found slightly annoying in city traffic was that by default, the auto parking brake enabled at every full stop. This results in a bit of a ""jerking"" when you press the gas pedal, as the brake un-engages and the engine re-starts. I disabled the feature and it doesn't bother me anymore. However, I can certainly see how this feature would be useful for hilly areas where you don't want to roll forward or backwards if you lighten up on the brakes. The back seat has more room than any other car in this class that we test drove. It feels more like a mid-sized SUV in terms of space and seat elevation. After reading a ton of reviews online, I have to say that most reviewers' gripes about this car are really non-issues in the long-run. We specifically looked out for all of the things that were identified as possible cons and haven't actually been able to identify many of them as real cons since we've been driving the car regularly. Bottom line: It's a really solid, well-designed car that's a lot of fun to drive and handle.",5

Car was bought ant rebuilt beautifully. I have had it 6 years and I loved it until the transmission went at 95,929 miles. The problem is that cooling fluid leaked into the trans mission fluid. The glycol has no viscosity and the fluid burned and parts started to crumble. The radiator had to be replaced as well. My fist mechanics diagnosed the problem and offered a rebuilt tranny for $2,700 and a 1 year warranty. He could not say what caused the fluid to overheat. I took it to a dealer who confirmed the burned fluid and  crumbled parts. (It was still shifting but slipping ) the dealer is replacing with new factory parts with lifetime warranty for $6,700. Wow, big hit for what I would say is a bad design. The link between the tranny and cooling system is plastic and not particularly glycol friendly. I plan to keep the car so the lifetime warranty is important and is having both parts of the problem replaced. But yow, the price is awful. Hey Volvo, you charge too much for parts.",4

Having other Volvo's I appreciate the new design: smaller exterior size but larger interior space. Rear leg room is fine as long as the 6-plus footers can compromise a little. Mileage has improved to 23 hywy at 73mph. Performance is great in the high rpm range: paddle shifting works great when passing. We drive to ski county each weekend and frequently encounter snow and slop which the XC handles effortlessly, but I see it could be easy to become overconfident.

But, after developing a network of those to depend upon in case of problems, I understood that in the 55,000 miles that I've owned this car, it hasn't let me down ONCE!!  I had to have the front axles replaced by a private mechanic, a wear and tear item and a radiator, again a wear and tear item.

It handles superbly and securely!  It actually inspires confidence!  It's our 'road trip' vehicle because of the confidence that it inspires!  I am totally happy with my 2006 XC70, but I tend to shy away from the dealership because of their excessive repair costs.  Volvo should outlaw their dealership repair network because they are not consumer friendly AT ALL price-wise! That’s probably why these vehicles have such poor resale value.  I am disappointed in this vehicle's resale value, but that behooves me with buying my next Volvo!  As I learned from an old Army buddy of mine, “take care of your equipment and it'll take care of you!”  Can't say enough good about my XC!!

One is a 2004 with approximately 192,000 miles. I write approximately because the ABS module went on the car and the odometer stopped working. The brakes work fine and the abs actually works but the abs and brake lights warnings are constantly on. Charlotte Volvo quoted me $1700 to replace the ABS module. The control arm bushings were worn after nine years and dealer estimated repair at $761. Similiarly spring seats and strut bearing also worn and dealer estimated repair at $523. I declined repair and its been 4 years and the wheels have not fallen off. If you buy this model expect to be continually replacing the light bulbs. I have had the same problem with the 2007 so the cars seem to be plagued with electrical problems. Positives about the car- the engine is great, the turbo works well and the car is very comfortable. The 2007 has  also had electrical problems. The radio died and Volvo wanted $700 to replace. I purchased an aftermarket. Two years after the radio was installed I had problems with the electrical system and with the on- board computer. On sporadic occasions I would start car, the radio would come on but climate controls would not work, dash would not illuminate and power locks and windows would not work. I would shut car off and re-started and everything would turn back on. After Volvo replaced two on-board computers, Volvo tech told me that the after market radio was causing the on board computer to fail. Even though all wiring was correct Volvo tech recommended disconnecting after market radio. Volvo claims aftermarket radio will not work in Volvo's.Other problems. The cataletic converter sense went after three years ownership. I have been told this is a very common problem with Volvo's. Another $600 service.

Yet I lived for three years where it got to 40 degrees below zero. The paint... Looks like new. Other than a few dings and scratches it looks great. The interior looks great except for the driver seat. I tried to take care of it with regular cleaning and conditioning but the leather cracked and now has holes in it.

It handles like a dream on bad roads and gets amazing fuel mileage for this type of vehicle. I recently took it on a road trip and got 31 mpg with the a/c on and driving 75 mph.

Therefore, we decided to get another Volvo and don't regret it.  Performance is more than adequate.

It's an excellent long- distance cruiser. Front seats are exceptionally comfortable for a long- legged driver like me.  Auto AC works great, year-round.

The turbocharged engine gives a kick when you need it.  It has nice clearance for hopping curbs or going offroad.

I purchased a 2015 XC70 T6 Polestar. It is my third Volvo, currently has 20,000 miles. No problems. Lots of room for hauling. I like the XC70 because the rear seats fold flat, so you have over 5 feet length of flat area. I hauled a Stickley collector bookshelf over 1200 miles, for example. Also great for hauling dogs, and their crates. In my opinion this is the best road trip car -- ever. Super fast and hugs the road. Rain and snow are no problem for this gem. Traded in my 2009 S60 with 55,000 miles. I still miss that car, never a problem. My 2000 S70 sold to mom and dad, has over 120,000 miles, no problems. My experience with Volvo has been outstanding. The service from Volvo dealers has also been more than excellent. Sadly, I traded in my Volvo XC70 for a Porsche Macan S, that I like very much, partly because it is rear wheel drive based.

1601, on 09/24/15 20:36 PM (PDT),Mitch Johns ,2015 Volvo XC70 Wagon 3.2 4dr Wagon AWD (3.2L 6cyl 6A),My first impressions after 700 miles," We purchased an XC 70 platinum T6 3 liter that had an EPA mpg at 17/24 mpg. We chose this car after purchasing two BMW X1s in 2014 and 2015. I was a bit worried about the mpg and that I would be consuming more gas and hurting the environment. Well after our first major road trip of 430 miles in CA from N. Ca, through Sacramento to Palo Alto, I was impressed. You have to know that this road trip is primarily major state and federal highways, on roads that are very bumpy, can be stressful, and very heavy with traffic. We obtained an overall round-trip gas mileage of 25.6 mpg with cruising speeds of 70-80 mph, and considerable stop and go on these interstates. Frankly consider this route to be one of the worst traveling itinerary  that you could ever drive and put a car through. The best attribute of this car is the Volvo front car seats that are likely the most comfortable in a car. We purchased the car mostly for the front car seats as my wife has spinal issues that causes her great pain and discomfort about the third hour of a road trip. The seat comfort was the best of what could be expected given my wife's chronic aliments. I cannot say this for the back car seats as they are average, and the designers could have engineered more leg room for the rear passengers. Don't get the wrong impression, it is still better than the X1s that we have experienced.The auto runs smooth, plenty of acceleration, low road noise, and takes the highway bumps with little lingering memory. What I might be critical of is the steering as it is a bit light and you don't have intuitive feeling you get out of a performance car such as a BMW X1. The handling around curves is slightly above average, but you should slow down a bit if it is a tight curve as there is a slight body lean and response for you to take it more slower than a performance car.I have only 700 miles on the car and as you know, nothing is broken in yet, the engine especially. I will look forward to more (pleasurable) road trips and I anticipate that I will find the car much more superior and also expect to obtain slightly higher mpg on long road trips. There are no available safety ratings for this model, but it is a Volvo. The exterior body is very solid and the finish is excellent. We have learned much after purchasing three new cars in the last 24 months and anyone purchasing should do their homework in regards to invoice price, reviews of the car handling, etc.",4

I leased new XC70 2015 T6 AWD in and I have 15k miles on it. It is great car to some extend regardless of the price tag. It has unique combination of performance, luxury and utility and is well built. So what's the problem?Soon after I leased the car local dealership was closed and I learned that according to ""Volvo's policies"" I have to drive 200 miles distance to the next dealership to get scheduled maintenance. Is this reasonable? I tried working though Volvo customer service, but have been politely stonewalled, the company has no method of filing customer complaints. They all come back to the same person. March 2016 updateThe car behaves perfectly, after putting 20k miles on it, I like it more than right after the purchase. No mechanical issues or any issues. This car is really well built even comparing to previous Volvos that I had., Mileage 19 mpg in mixed city/freeway driving using premium gasoline. I changed oil three times and did tires balancing at about 17k miles.  Further impressions - this is not performance ""drivers car"".  But it got enough power to leave many ""drivers cars"" behind.  You just use this power not for driving fun but for driving comfort. That's probably a good definition for this car - very comfortable. I decided to keep the car for a bit longer and bought out the lease. As for Volvo fixing customer service issues - there is no visible progress, they dropped all their customers after closing some dealerships.March 2017 updateThe car still is as good as new and I am liking it more with every month passing by.

I also prefer more ground clearance than sedans+ as pot holes and high/steep curves have ruined my day in lower sitting cars.

Since then, I've put over 31,000 miles on it in just a year.  While my fuel economy has not been impressive, especially coming from a 2011 Outback, I have been impressed with what the XC70 has to offer.  Mid-way through the first year I was hit with some high repair costs, as a rear wheel bearing, front ball joint and a tie rod needed to be replaced.  I was initially upset, but once I got the car back all of the things that annoyed me driving it had been fixed!  Sometimes ignorance is not bliss.  Who knew?  This past summer I was living/working in Montana, and took this thing on countless miles of forest service backroads.  It handled things I honestly thought it wouldn't be able too, including an accidental trip on a 4WD only road.  If you're looking at this year range for an Outback or XC70, I would recommend the Volvo.  You can get a lot more for your money in terms of packaging, material quality and comfort.  However, be ready to spend more time as the gas station using premium and the potential for higher maintenance costs.  That being said, I have had no real issues in a year and a lot of the maintenance is easy enough to do on your own and save tons of money.Two year update: Somehow this car has gotten better with age. Now with 150K on the odometer, it honestly drives better than the day I got it. I had to replace the rear suspension at the beginning of the summer but with the car being 10 years old and me constantly overloading it, I wasn't surprised. I would 100% buy this car again and am putting off getting a new outback because I love it so much. Go for it!",5

All prior model year problems (e.g. transmission) seem to have been fixed on the 2005-2007 model years and '07 was the last year before Ford made Volvo cost reduce the vehicle and substitute the problematic Mitsubishi OEM T6 engine for Volvo's bulletproof 2.5T.  I now have almost 180k miles on this car and my only significant unscheduled repair have been to replace the steering wheel position sensor ""clock spring"" at 148K, fuel rail pressure sensor at around 160K, and the front oxygen sensor at 170K.  At this point (180K miles) I've recently replaced all front suspension bits including front struts, rear shocks, lower front control arms and ball joints and completed a tune up with new plugs and coil packs.  Now, at 180K miles, the car starts, runs, and drives down the road as new   Seats still look practically new.  The chassis is tight and free of rattles.  All in all, a very solid and well built vehicle - very comfortable, big storage in back, and tight if not razor sharp European style handling.  I particularly admire the 2.5T engine.  Torque peak at 1,900 rpm is right at 55mph where you need it for passing.  Light boost turbo maintains power at altitude, yet runs nicely on US regular 87 octane gas - unlike Mercedes, Audi, etc.Good sound system, comfortable seats, intuitive controls, great visibility, sure handling, and higher ride height that makes for easier in/out for us older guys plus eliminates annoying scrapes in front while parking (and you don't plow snow with the front bumper unless it's well over six inches.My only niggle with this vehicle is road noise which can be an issue with most aggressive tread patterns.  Pirelli's P7 AS plus and, just recently, Bridgestone's Turanza Serenity - both Tirerack's highly rated Grand Touring tires - are as quiet as they come with crisp handling and commendable grip in all conditions.  However, I was disappointed in the durability of the Pirelli, the quieter of the two, so recently switched to the Bridgestones.I've considered a newer xc70, but found that about one in 25 of the 3.2 six motors experiences excessive oil burn, leading to ring & piston replacement (no cyl wall scoring) or total engine replacement.  Volvo dealers might tell you that Volvo offers a 4yr/48K mile extended powertrain warranty if you buy a used unit from a dealer; otherwise, good luck.Another age related repair was to replace the upstream oxygen sensor at 170K and, subsequently, the catalytic converter.Finally, if you read the owner blogs Dealers are often referred to as ""the Stealership"".

The XC-70 is a wonderful machine with an incredibly smooth ride for a wagon. I feel very safe in this vehicle and the weight of the XC-70 surrounding me evokes a secure feeling. The XC-70 handles well in inclement weather and is easily maneuvered when quick action is required. For comfort and safety, I would recommend this model to any couple who loves to travel by auto. Would not recommend it if back seat passengers are often along -- too cramped.For safety and reliability, I would say it is second to none.   ",4.625

I thought there was not comparison between the Volvo and the Outback....I know the Outback has a good reputation, but the XC70 has blown me away (imagine moving from a 1993 4-runner to a 2007 XC70).  It is such a joy to drive, and although I can't compare it to other cars in its class, I think it handles and rides incredibly.

The swedes know how to build a car - the leather on the seats is very thick, very little plastic is used, and metal covers the exterior of the car. As much as I loved the car, I did have some issues with it. 1st, the siren went out and caused the sunroof to stop working (if you don't believe me, google it), and the check engine light came on once because the gas cap needed to be replaced. Neither of these issues cost very much money to fix, however.  The car did have a little over 100,000 miles, so a few repairs are acceptable since Volvo cars will outlast any others if you take care of them. The other thing that I didn't like about the car was its fuel economy. I was averaging 21 MPG - might as well get an XC90. This car is really for those of us who don't buy into the SUV craze, but still need a light off-road vehicle with plenty of cargo space. The thing that really won me over on Volvo was safety.

I'd been considering the XC-70 and the Subaru Outback for the past several years.  However, having made the purchase, I'm really glad that I went with the Volvo.  Having test drove the Outback I can say that it doesn't come close to the ride my XC-70 provides.  Also, the seats in the XC-70 are simply amazing.  They're the most comfortable car seats I've ever experienced.  Some reviewers complain that the car is sluggish or doesn't handle well, but that's not been my experience.

This is the last, don't let it get away.  My 5th Volvo and the best yet.  7K miles on it so far.  For a huge wagon, the steering is responsive with good feedback.  Breaks are awesome.  They have finally eliminated the torque steer, totally, which was present on my 1998 V70XC and worse on my 2007 XC70.  the 2007 had terrible wet braking, the 2016 has great wet road brakes.  Very quiet, very comfortable, good electronics.  Better than 27mpg in mostly highway driving.  Next year's 2017 cross country costs 18 thousand dollars more and may not be as good.  The 2017 has a hatchback, cutting cargo room, and a 4cyl engine which may not be as smooth, at least, not yet.  This 2016 has the tried and true 5 banger.  The only downside is that the 6 speed auto is a little reluctant to downshift, you have to mash the throttle a little or shift manually.  Oh, and the active safety already prevented a collision for me, accelerating onto a highway, checking the left mirror, did not notice the stopped traffic ahead until the Volvo applied the brakes for me.

Before buying also considered a Subaru Forester and Subaru Crosstrek.  What sold me on the Volvo was the longer warranty period - 4 years/50,000 miles; 12 year rust protection - I live in Western Massachusetts where they salt and sand profusely in the winter; and the alloy wheels.  The interior is so luxurious to me and the people at Gengras Volvo in East Hartford gave me the best deal compared to 2 other Volvo dealers.  I won't really know how the AWD does in winter because I just got the car - so far the handling is stable; and because the wheelbase and size are larger than my old V40 I am adjusting to how it handles with parking and taking the curves - still breaking it in with only 302 miles so far.  The other thing that sold me was the cargo design and layout - my goal is to get to some National Parks to camp in the future - and the 250 horsepower and ability to tow were also part of my decision.  And I love the turbo - my V40 has such great pep - and I have loved that capacity.  The XC70 does weigh more - so haven't tested the pep of the turbo yet - still being cautious as I adjust to the new height - but love being able to just get in the car - rather than have to lower my body as I did in my V40.  And I just get out - so getting in and out is pretty neutral.  Love the proximity package and can see that when my hands are full it will be a blessing; the tailgate with auto up and down - fantastic! And the flat trunk - great for tailgating and picnics.  All the new technology - navigation; phone; etc. - I am still learning how to use this - so can't really make a call on this yet - plus this stuff didn't exist on my 2001 V40. And have to get the new garage door opener programmed yet - that's how new it is to me.One year later - and I still LOVE my new XC 70!!  Currently, I have over 18,000 miles! The XC70 was a real champion in the winter - I was on a small hill and the lead car at the stop light was spinning and going no where - there was one car in between - I backed up my XC70 and with my AWD went around both cars up the same hill and went on my way!! Then I drove through a blowing snow storm down to New Jersey and again, the XC 70 made the trip - it is wonderful and the AWD is fantastic!  Before buying I had checked out the difference in the Haldex versus symmetrical drive - and I am convinced that the Haldex is the way to go.  Over the summer I was also able to test out the turbo when passing on some two lane roads in North Carolina, Virginia, and Ohio and it has pep to get around when needed - on two lane roads I don't take time to pass - so the turbo punch does an amazing job and does it well considering the size and weight.  Still leaning to adjust to the new features, but the back up camera is one that has helped so much - it is a great feature and the hands free telephone is wonderful.  Other features that have come in handy - the remote start and the ability to lock the car from afar or to be sure it's locked - especially after parking at the airport.  Still adjusting to the higher center of gravity - especially as I was driving through West Virginia on some very long up and down curves - but it performed beautifully.  The car has been to Northern Michigan, across part of Canada and New York state!  When going across Canada - I was trying to figure out how to get the odometer to switch to kilometers per hour - still have to look that one up - so I turned to the fuel consumption feature where I based my best guess when it indicated I was consuming 100 kmh to estimate the speed I should be going.  Compared to my old low road hugging V40 - it takes time to learn how to steer a car with a higher center of gravity and higher ground clearance - which I need for the snow - but as I am learning - the car is performing beautifully.  And I am so happy with the service department at the Gengras Volvo dealer in East Hartford.   One year later - and know I made the right decision to buy the XC70!!  I can't believe they still don't make this car!Okay, my odometer now reads 28,921 - I have been racking up the miles. Still love my XC70 and it has taken everywhere I need to go up and down the East coast - summer, winter, fall and spring. And amazingly it still cranked this winter when the temperatures hung in the -10 to -18 range for three weeks in the morning. The folks at Geneva’s Volvo are still doing a great job for all me service and I couldn’t be happier with my “new” Volvo.",5

You see, a couple of years ago I had to bite the bullet and trade in my 08 XC90 for a Chrysler Town and Country minivan because of the kids. As minivans go, it's great, but... it's a minivan. So for my 40th, my wife said that we could trade in her '15 Subaru Forester for the new XC90! I test drove the 90 and it was great - really nice, but just a little too fancy. See, I'm an avid fly fisherman and I was having trouble picturing this very fancy SUV with muddy boots and waders in the back and mud all over the sides. Besides, I think the new '90 lost a lot of its ""Volvoness"". The XC70 on the other hand - beautiful classic Volvo. Just as comfortable on the side of a river as it is going out to dinner and a show in the city. So I test drove it and fell in love. The whole experience made it feel like the car was made for me. So we traded in the Forester, which I never quite fit into comfortably (I'm 6', 280lbs, but I carry it well ;) ), and leased the XC70. I picked up the car on New Year's Eve, 2015 and have been loving every bit of it for about a month now. The built in booster seats are awesome for the kids, the fold down passenger seat means I don't have to break down my fly rods to get them in the car, the iPhone app is ridiculously useful, I drove it in the Blizzard of '16 and it handled it like the ""blizzard"" of '15, I was a little worried about the lack of touch screen but having gotten used to the controls on the steering wheel I found them to be so much easier - especially with the rhino hooves that I have for hands! Every time - Every single time - I get into it, I smile. I smile, and I take the long way everywhere I go. Hey, with these gas prices, what's stoppin' me?",5

Decided to lease the car in case I missed the sporty feel of a sedan.  However, after a few weeks I really like the convenience of the wagon, more room for the dog, golf clubs and hitch on the back for the bikes.  Electronics are simple and intuitive.  I really like the wifi hot spot feature in this 2016 model.  Comfort is excellent compared to the beamer.  The only thing I don't like is the low gas mileage but I knew this would be the trade-off with the four wheel drive.  With gas prices low and living in NJ, I was willing to give up gas efficiency to feel safer especially when it snows.  So far, I'm very happy with this car.",4

Although an older design, the XC70 was just more comfortable, more practical and less flashy. It is powerful, quiet, extremely comfortable and handles reasonably well. The technology package is state-of-the-art and the IPhone App is just great.With just under 1000 miles in the past month, I am quite delighted.I was worried that ""trading down"" from the A8 would be painful, but am really quite pleased.The fuel economy isn't too good, but with current gas prices, it doesn't hurt too much.I would strongly recommend this car.",5

Having had only Volvo wagons since 1980, I have to say that this 2011 seems more solid and heavy (in a good way) than any of my previous models or later models I have driven as loaners. Generally reliability has been good--with a few exceptions: At 85,000 miles, the engine started to use a lot of oil. Volvo examined it and replaced the entire engine. They told me that it was a bad batch of piston rings that was responsible, so this wasn't really a ""bad"" feature of the car. Volvo has never been able to properly balance the wheels, so I have learned to live with a slight steering wheel vibration at around 60 mph. They said the rims were distorted and sent them for repair; but that didn't help. Tire Rack replaced all 4 tires TWICE, with no improvement. The design of the rims is such that mud stays put and makes the balance problem markedly worse. I have never been totally happy with the brakes, but a recent full brake replacement has fixed this problem. There is a really stupid feature of the software: when the fog lights are on, they go out when high beams are selected, but don't come back on when you return to low beams. Interestingly, the second identical model I just purchased doesn't do this! Finally, I am singularly unimpressed with the headlights, specially the high beams. I've replaced the low-beam bulbs with high intensity ""silver tip"" bulbs, but see hardly any difference. There are no high intensity replacements for the high-beam bulbs, so when I drive at night plplllI envy the bright headlights of much cheaper cars.LlLL2nd Review 9/1/16:L having now owned my 2nd 2011 XC70 T6 for about 6 months, I can add a little to this review. The 2nd XC70 seems just as well built as my first one. I do, however, miss the folding rear-view mirrors and the front seats don'r seem to be quite as comfortable; but since the car has less than 30,000 miles, it could just be a break-in phenomenon. The headlights are markedly superior to those on the first car (see above review), even with standard bulbs, and there are no problems with wheel balance or braking (see above review). The silly fog-light phenomenon I described for the first car is also absent.  In summary, the 2nd car is just as good as the first, and just as robust and ""heavy"" in a good way. I'd like to replace the first car with another 2011 (it has 130,000 miles); but I don't think I could find a low-mileage 2011 again.Since the first review (see above), the first car has had the following major repairs (all covered by an extended warranty policy): New A/C compressor, new motor for driver's side mirror (motor failed).",5

The 3.2 is slow, buzzy/noisy and it gets lousy mpg (worst of all worlds).You're always aware of the engine working at the limits of its capacity to move this heavy vehicle.

Every component is top-notch. It's great for a long trip because of the comfort and the FABULOUS sound system. Where it disappoints is in driving dynamics; it's not really fun to drive; it's safe and predictable and road-holding but not exciting.""Now that over 3 years and 43,000 miles have gone by, I have the same opinion.  I think this is a very under-recognized car. It is top-notch quality in all the materials. Nothing significant has gone wrong with the car (the battery wore out a bit early because too many components can be running on it when the engine is off). We love it for long trips and for its super-secure handling.

The controls are intuitive and everything is within reach and easy to use. The ride is quiet and the car is sure footed in bad weather. Attention to detail is excellent.

I would love another just like it but with fewer expensive repair bills.  The standard bill is around $700 and have had a couple of $1200 ones.  The A/C bit me for $1200.  Struts are a weakpoint in this car.  Cooling system was a source of a lot of repairs.  Still, even with 153k+ miles on it, I hate to give it up.

Just regular things like CV boots ($55 for the entire axle), lower ball joint boots (still did not replace them), ABS module ($100 to rebuild it), alternator ($90 or so), odometer ($8 for the gear). I know that the evaporator core for A/C will go bad at some point, it is really common. The main thing is that I feel really good about my wife driving it with the kids, I know they are safe in it.

My S40 is the 5spd manual non-T5 yet I LOVE the responsiveness and handling of the car in all types of weather - and the good mileage! (way better than auto-trans).  I got the winter mats (a must for a New England winter) and had the dealer install - those little buttons that hold the mats in place REALLY should be fastened better.  The other nag is that I get intermittent wind noise/whistle from somewhere in back.

Even with how many miles my car has on it, it still tighter and better performing than some new cars. However, this is granted if one pays for the enormous maintenance costs, especially at higher mileage. This car doesn't ever break... it just reaches times when parts naturally wear out and need replaced as per the routine maintenance schedule. But these parts are all very expensive, and all break at once. I cannot complain about the drivetrain, as it has been fantastic. I mean this: I have had no repairs on the engine and transmission the entire time I've owned it. The majority of my extreme maintenance costs have been suspension related. All of the control arms and wheel bearings broke at the same time, as did the shocks and struts. Close to 5 grand in repairs. If you wish to run this car correctly, it takes only synthetic oil, and only premium gas. The nose-bleed expenses aside, this car is a true gem to drive and has never let me down on the road. Always has loads of grip. Has driven through its fair share of blizzards, torrential downpours and sunny days. Is always just as fun and comfortable as the day I bought it.

I have done everything with this car from fun corners and ""quick"" driving to driving through blizzards. This car unfortunately was only held back by the exorbitant maintenance costs and its relatively small size. I am 6' 8"" and purchased the car because I was sick of driving big cars but have recently dealt with back pain from the seating position, all my friends find it incredibly comfortable but I am simply to tall for it. The maintenance is an unfortunate story. After having purchased the car in brand new condition (53,000 miles) I have put about 20,000 miles on it in the last year and spent close to $8,000 in repairs. The most painful of which was the dual mass flywheel and clutch which cost $3200 alone to replace from the dealer. The clutch paired with new suspension, new brakes, new front struts, new tires, and a steering wheel lock incident have created the most expensive (car maintenance) year off my life. So alas I must let the poor thing go, but I have to say if you get lucky, or don't mind spending the money on maintenance, the car is excellent fun and will get you through anything, from driving through 6inch deep snow without chains or studs, to the pounding rain of Oregon winters.

The driver's side visor is falling out of its socket when you turn it to shield your face from the sun coming in from the driver's side window.  Not something I would expect to find on a brand new entry-level luxury car.  Still, the car is great and the 170 hp on the base engine is plenty.  Features are well thought out and functional and ride is secure and supple. There could still be more/larger storage bins, which I hear they are taking care of with the 2008 models.  Other craftmanship appears good to great.  Hopefully the visor will be the only issue in a long, carefree life of the car",4.375

I tried to trade in and was only offered $2500 for it (the AC finally went out and it was way too much to fix it). Literally in the shop once a month.

The Check Engine light only comes on if I gun the engine while it is still cold, but then the light usually goes back off before the day is over. I had to replace the turbo when I first purchased the car, but I'm sure that's why it was for sale in the first place. Turbo cars have special needs.

What a disaster of a car.  To be fair, I think that Volvo just has no idea how to make a small car.  The 'performance' is a joke.  The handling is ponderous and, at highway speeds, can be a little scary.  When passing at high speeds, the car wobbles -- literally.  The braking is AWFUL.

2212, on 11/24/15 11:32 AM (PST),Dylan ,2005 Volvo S40 Sedan T5 AWD 4dr Sedan (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Great Alternative Sports Sedan!," For the past year I have been pulling my hairs out trying to determine what my next car would be. I am a car enthusiast so naturally I have a lot of favorites pulling at my heartstrings which made choosing a vehicle to replace my dependable 2005 Civic would be very difficult! I laid out the criteria I wanted: powerful engine, AWD drivetrain, compact, reliable daily driver. Sure there are some great cars that meet these like the Subaru WRX, Mitsubishi EVO, or entry-level Audis, but the truth is I wanted to own something more unique because I like to stand out. The aforementioned competitors are a lot more common are starting to feel oversaturated in the world of car culture. Not many AWD compact sedans exist, so naturally the Volvo S40 appeared to be my only option. I went for it on a whim and ended up with a beautiful 2010 R-Design with the ever-exciting T5 engine of course! So far, I am not really disappointed. The car does everything I wanted it too and even a bit more. I'm not 100% satisfied with the way it looks as it is a dated (2004, 08 refresh) design. I don't understand why Volvo dramatically updated the C30 and C70 styling but left the S40 kind of bland for its last 3 years... However, it is still a nice looking vehicle with cute yet aggressive proportions. Interior looks amazing though! A lot of people harken it to IKEA as a joke, but they aren't too far off. The interior is sleek, modern, and beautifully simple. The materials are wonderfully rich and well put together. It feels like you're in a much more expensive car with all the great driver amenities and the excellent climate control and booming stereo system. Trunk space is a little small compared to my last car (especially the opening) but it is sufficient for hauling most things. I will say the rear seats can be kind of cramped with the front seats extended backward. The car is awesome to drive. Not quite as fast as a WRX or EVO, but has potential to run with them with a few easy modifications. The T5 engine is noisy, but in the good sort of way that it gurgles in the low RPMs to remind you how sporty it wants to be. The S40 AWD handles really good and flat and so far has proven to have some great traction on slick surfaces. The brakes feel a little bit grabby and fade under hard braking, but do the job. The seats work well to keep you comfortable, even though the car's great handling comes at a cost of being very stiff and it likes to jar itself over small bumps in the road. Overall a very impressive car so far! I have not had any issues except for the oil cooler which the previous owner damaged on a curb. It was only a $120 fix locally and I am no longer dripping oil from it.2016 Update: Since purchasing the car a little over the year ago it has had a plethora of maintenance issues and expensive repairs. when the car hit 94,000 miles, my PCV oil box failed (a common issue on these cars, but Volvo only extended the warranty on < 2008 models so my 2010 was not covered) The repair was costly and as a result of changing oil pressures, it cause my leaky cam seals to finally burst and now the car has a critical oil leak. The cam seal repair requires removal of the timing belt and water pump so prepare to do all of those replacements at once for a quoted dealer cost over $2000. I'm not sure all S40s would have this problem... but if your PCV box fails, it is likely you will experience similar issues with oil pressure drops and leaks. Also, the car randomly started having stalling issues when you shift too quickly into drive. Kind of an annoying problem that I have not found a fix for yet and left the volvo dealership puzzled... All in all, it has been an extremely costly car to own. I recommend the s40/c30/v50 only for the dedicated Volvo owners. Find one with less than 75,000 miles on it and you'll be okay. But I can't quite call the car ""unreliable"" because it starts up 100% of the time and despite all of these issues, it drives like nothing is wrong! The car doesn't seem to be bothered! I think a lot of people confuse ""reliability"" with ""durability"" when talking about Volvos. They are the latter.",5

The EPA ratings say 22 city/ 30 highway.  City driving we get 16 and highway 21.  This is so far off the mark, I feel ripped off.  The dealership just says there are variations. Other than using the AC, I drive as fuel efficiently as possible.  I have no problems with our other cars.  I bought this to help save money opn gas but I guess I'll have to drive my 7 passenger Toyota SUV , 8 cylinder,that gets gas mileage just shy of these numbers.   Why is it some auto makers test their vehicles more accurately than others???    ",3.125

Chose FWD to improve MPG and reliabilty. Only service is for fuel pump gasket that causes the check engine light and they always try to blame on improper gas cap application. Pending service for weak Homelink transmitter and broken lens on light below ext mirror. The computer for radio and all the program functions needs to be rebooted occasionally. The OS must be MS product! It is just the right size for my wife(short),very responsive, unique, easy to park. It is costly and MPG is disappointing.",4.625

The turbocharged engine is very powerful and will easily break the front tires loose. I have the sport package w/ dynamic sport suspension and it makes for a great handling car with little body lean. Geartronic automatic transmission is very smooth and fun manual control, it will actually allow you to take off in first, second, or third gear!

I work from home, so I do mostly short trips with an occasional 30 mile highway drive. That said, I love my S40. Great pickup on the highway when I need it (80 without even trying), OK gas mileage around town. I have the premium sound and moonroof. Loved the moonroof before we hit rainy season here in Miami, and the sound system is like being in a concert hall. Not many S40s on the road here, so it's nice having a somehwat unique car.

My back is still permanently damaged. Worst seats I have ever sat in. Apparently Mitsubishi made volvos interior for this car, this year. Center console armrest, all cup holders, and many random plastic peices broke while in normal use, just came off in my hand. Thousands and thousands of dollars in random various repairs later(note I only drove the car for 20,000 miles while it was young) I sold the car for a fraction of what I bought it for. Okay gas mileage, okay performance, seems to be a reliable car when the whole thing isn't falling apart",3

I bought it for about $3,800. I have nothing but problems from day one. I've had the engine rebuilt (blown head gasket), which was the most expensive. Had a massive oil leak, which took my mechanic boyfriend countless hours and dollars trying to fix. That was fixed... then on to the rest of the problems. Now, my favorite issue is that it revs when in drive, park, or neutral. It accelerates and decelerates all by it self if my foot isn't on the gas pedal. How fun! I don't have enough room to go over all of the problems I've had but I've been so sad about it. The car is so cute and I love the turbo but just awful.",2.25

So i decided to go back to Volvo i am soooo glad i did, now when i see a Honda on the road i cant help but laugh, because they are trouble on wheels! If you want to complain about a Volvo go get a Honda if they dont rust to peaces then they will break into peaces, yes parts are expensive for Volvo, but they dont seem to break my 1969 Volvo after 6 years the only problem i had was getting someone to set the twin SU carbs.

I bought it and did some work too it (400 dollars) and it lasted me a 4k round trip with no problems. I do know about all of the claims to infamy on here, like the battery not starting on the third day, you needed to reset the computer. The rough idle is either motor mounts (problem on all volvos) or ignition coils. The cup holder had to be put there because there was nowhere else to put it, if it was under the arm rest then the arm rest couldn't come down all the way. So there you have it, it is a good car and if you take care of it and know how to take care of the Swedish/Japanese beauty she will take care of you.",4

Firstly, I bought it with 18k so I had time to put some mileage on it. I currently have over 200k and have done 5 brake Jobs so the brakes have been fine for me. My headlights burnt out frequently until I fixed the ground. I have replaced my struts with konis and would highly recommend them. I have replaced my motor mounts, cv axle, and turbo seals once. So I don't know why everyone is complaining about these cars, if you maintain them they last awhile. Oil change at 3k not 7500. ",4.625

I purchased it new at the very end of '99 & have been driving it since 1-00.  I really don't get the negative comments.   Maybe, as one person mentioned, mine hasn't had the same issues because I ordered it before they came out & it was delivered from overseas??   But, it is NOT the first year for the car; they had been out in Europe for a couple of years.  I've replaced a few things, but for a car with 100,000 miles, that's typical.  The headlights did seem to go out too quickly at first, but doesn't seem to be an issue now.  They're about $12 at PepBoys & they'll put them in for free, or for $5 if they're not feeling generous.

The problems that crop up are minor but sometimes annoying. Let me first disagree with some: the armrest is fine, paint is amazing and I don't know what glare they're talking about. That being said, I believe the manual seats could be redesigned, and the cup holder is atrocious. Rear locks do stick. A lot of little nothings. However, it's a blast to drive at speed. It also handles reasonably well and I like the stiff feel. It's also very safe speaking from fender-bender experience. I recommend it as a great college car (when I bought it, anyway).  ",3.5

Even Volvo repaired it and only 500 miles later it was on again.  Volvo uses the cheapest plastic and it breaks just by touching it.

The dash design is poor--the cup holder hangs in front of CD player so you can't change disks without risking a major spill. As another reviewer noted, the cup holder is a junky design, and the hardware doesn't work properly. Same goes for rear holder.

I agree that my driver seat tips forward when you brake and back when you step on the gas. It's minor, but it is a unique feeling.  I am a bit concerned about the quality given that my door latch on the exterior rear passenger door no longer works and the locking fuel door sometime has to manually unlatched from inside the trunk.

Throw that thing in a Honda Civic & it performs quite well. But you buy a Volvo for the solid build & safety ratings & it could afford a slightly more powerful base engine [~ 190hp?]... it shouldn't affect the fuel efficiency that much. The T5 isn't that much worse on the MPG's.  Otherwise, I agree with most of the reviews & the main reason I bought this car is because I bought a loaner vehicle from a dealership for a third off the MSRP. And that's a 2009 with 10k miles.

Interior comfort and quality were great (unlike some other's experience). Not a firm, sporty drive (like BMW and Audi A4) but a fine GT cruiser. Avg 23 mpg in mixed driving, 28 on highway. Extended warranty if you're buying used may be required w/reference to other's mech problems. I would stay away if you live in a city with rough roads. If you can find one used at low-mid 20's it should still be worth 15K in 3 more years. Good fun for not much coin!",4.75

I agree with a review I read, that it has a tendency to torque steer when you REALLY rip on it, but you quickly learn to accomodate. The UP side is that when you shower down, it responds admirably. I traded to it from a BMW Roadster and even though my C-70 isn't quite as much fun, it's a superior road car. My husband says, it offers a very civilized convertible experience especially with the optional wind screen.  Internal noise is minimal with the top up or down allowing you to enjoy the awesome optional stereo system. 17"" allow wheels and low profile tires are sleek, but the soft wheels damage easily and the trunk is small.",4.75

Upgraded the turbo 5  with the dealer-installed Polestar software. HP jumped to 272. Really helped on the torque and acceleration on the Interstate.This car I thought I'd fall in love with; unfortunately not the case. The biggest issue was driver ergonomics. With the cruise control engaged, and time to spread out/relax....there was no where to go. Right leg hits the handbrake in the center console. Left leg hits hard aluminum on the interior door pull. Left forearm rests on hard plastic. Even had some cushions custom made which helped bit. But in the end just plain poor design. Another thing, pulling out in traffic. Front wheel drive, you had to pull out, turn, THEN accelerate. If you turned and accelerated, the car would chatter across the pavement. A bit disconcerting. Couple plusses. The front seats are GREAT. So are the brakes,This is NOT a sports car. The cornering is poor, noticeable rollover. No nav system. Stereo surprisingly good.

2620, on 08/18/15 18:40 PM (PDT),Joda ,2012 Volvo C70 Convertible T5 2dr Convertible (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),Overpriced garbage!," This car is a horrible waste of time. I bought it because my other half fell in love with it and at the time I couldn't say no. Boy was I fool for that. This is the most boring car i've ever owned!!! I bought the car as a certified pre-owned and it had all the options, which was great, but all that didn't matter once I started having to drive it on a regular basis. The ride is somewhat smooth but you definitely don't feel like you are connected to the road when driving it. I got rid of my E46 BMW 325Ci w/sport package and OMG how I regret it!I am now driving the C70 as my daily driver and I absolutely HATE this car! It handles like runny dog crap! Way too much body roll and clumsy handling, it does not corner well at all, and good luck if you need to do a u-turn. The turning radius is TERRIBLE, don't expect to do a quick U-turn in this car, instead be prepared to do a three point turn every single time, which is absolutely PATHETIC! I have started calling this the Volvo Town Car because it handles like a granny-mobile even though it is a small car.The acceleration is sad and even with the Dealer optimized Polestar upgrade, which costs $1k dollars, it still lacks any real oomph other than making the tires chirp a little if you take off abruptly.The transmission is garbage and does not change gears appropriately for the situation at hand. It upshifts way too quickly even when you are trying to accelerate and get into freeway traffic. I tried using the manual mode a few times and found it utterly useless and very backwards compared to any other european automobile I have driven. At steady cruising speeds on the highway it gets craptastic fuel economy, averaging about 22MPG and even worse with inner city driving (16mpg at best). The suspension is vile, you end up feeling every single damn bump in the road as if you were driving a go-kart. Also the car rattles like crazy when you hit a bump, which is a sure sign of crappy build quality, my 10 year old BMW never suffered such rattles. Visibility is total s*** due to the horrible placement of the rearview mirror and the door panels which come up to my shoulder. I'm 6'3"" if I move the seat up from the lowest position my head rubs the roof, which also leads to my next complaint. When putting the top up in this car I have had my head smashed twice. If you are a taller person you have to move your head slightly to the right, otherwise the roof line pillar in the top will come down on your head relatively hard when closing.The only positive about this car is the upgraded factory sound system and the front seats are super comfy. The dials are pretty simple and the menu interface is great, but that is the only thing I will say that is nice about this horrible handling beast. The repair costs and amount of things that have gone wrong on this car are unforgivable and expensive to repair. The car has stalled out on me numerous times and when it is brought into the dealership they can't diagnose or duplicate the problem, the top has failed to close properly about 5 times now and even with adjustments it sometimes fails to latch properly. Water has been leaking in where the tops meets the windshield, even when it IS completely latched, and we can't seem to locate where it is coming in. I cannot wait to trade this POS in for a new BMW convertible. I've never had the lack of confidence and fear of a car breaking down as I have with this heap of trash and I have owned Jaguars, BMWs, and even an 05 Ford Mustang. Avoid this car at all costs!",2

Have taken the car to the Oklahoma City Volvo Dealership repeatedly as I had to replace tires every 10,000 to 15,000 miles.  They told me this is the way the car is designed and there isn't anything that can be done to correct it.  I have had enough.  Besides burning through 4 tires in less than 25,000 miles, another problem is the car is now discontinued, no longer in production and considered an orphan with a considerable hit to resale value.

A few days ago we took delivery at the factory in Sweden and put 800+ miles on the car in two days. We commented that at the end of each day we were not tired or stiff like in our previous cars. Yes the controls for the Nav, phone and temp take a little to get used to, but after the first day they were intuitive. We like the smooth power and shifting this car has. Back roads or Autobahn were equally smooth and enjoyable. We bought the U.S. model and will take it back to the states when we go. The navigation system is great. It notified us of trouble and detoured us well before the slow down. ",4.5

The kids fit in the back. The top is whisper quiet.  The sound system sounds great... the CD player is early nineties garbage and skips constantly... but it sounds great.  It is powerful enough and performs well.  Don't let the whiny reviews deter you from owning this fabulous car. There are no models of cars that are over 15 years old that don't have some that were treated poorly and require maintenance.  It's silly to think that these experiences inform the common experience.  Look for a good one.  Put the top up and down a few times.  Drive it a few miles.  Take it to a mechanic.  When you find the right one this will be some of the best money you ever spent.,5

There is no indicator on the dash showing what gear you or in - just a small silly orange arrow pointing up if you are not in top gear.  The parking light assembly simply fell out.

Mustang reliability is much better.  And we are a long time Volvo family !     What a shock to get this one and it is the last one for us.     I bought this car for my children and grandchildren to be safe, but it is difficult to know whether it is safe because I cannot keep it running.... It seems that if the car is not driven daily, the battery runs down.  The dealer insists that nothing is wrong with the battery.    The tires wore out early , apparently because of an alignment problem that caused front and rear tires to wear on the inside.  Although the car was taken in for regular maintenance, this was not discovered until the tires were non-viable.    Little parts were regularly found lying in the car ( they matched the car interior) and appear to be covers for something, but the dealer has no idea what.  The piece in front of the passenger feet keeps falling down and must be repositioned.  It has been replaced by the dealer without improvement.     There Is a side hatch on  the driver's side that will not stay closed. It has been replaced without benefit.  There are more gnawing problems.  I just had to get a coil replaced. we were out of town for 2 weeks and my dayghter had to get people with much older vehicles to provide transportation because no one could keep the car cranked due to presumably the battery ( hard to know .  The car will not crank.  But cannot open car without emergency key and lights do not come on).    I am attempting to charge the battery with heavy duty charger, unsuccessfully.  I can get the lights to come on sometimes.  When I complained again at the dealer while waiting to get the battery checked last time, the salesman tried to sell me another car!!! This one is not paid for....it cost $10,000 more than a mustang, but would be safe and dependable for the family.In April of 2017, I was able to trade the Volvo in for a Kia.As we were about to trade, the head liner fell down.  On an internet search, we found that others have had this same problem.You may also want to make sure that the trunk latch is working.You will need to test doors and trunk while keys are out of range, as they automatically unlock doors and trunk as you approach.The 66,617 mileage is the mileage just prior to trade in at 5.5 years.

It looks ""great"" they tell me....   bring it back in at 67K,  out of warranty....   repair bill 4K - I asked, all this happened in the last 7k miles?   yep they say, nothing covered, shocks, struts, motor mounts etc....   Oh - and by the way, the AC blows hot again! - 1400 to repair,  I threw a fit - wrote a letter to volvo, they sent me back a check for 1200....   since then, replaced another motor mount,  transmission mount, some oil sensor and housing that was leaking, cv boots and joints, front axles   all in all, 7400$ ALL SINCE THAT 60 K CHECKUP (I now have 90k miles on it)  replaced the headlamps twice, and now the driver side doesn't work at all - even after replacing the bulbs....    too bad, I love the look of the car, but no more volvos for me....

I traded our '11 on one of the very last '13s in the area in Dec '13 and got an excellent price.  It's lacking a couple of things our earlier models had, namely Nav and super-duper audio(whatever the latest was called in '13...DynAudio no longer in use).  It's still(and again) a great cruiser, capable in-town vehicle and a blast to drive with the top down.  Yes, the suspension is more comfy than racy; but this is no track car.  The hardtop, while not silent, is solid and confidence-inspiring...with excellent visibility for a drop-top.  Gas mileage for us has been a solid 25mpg average on 87 octane fuel(Top Tier almost exclusively ).  Road trips are much closer to 30mpg.  I wouldn't mind eliminating some of the wheel-spin under acceleration and cornering; but it IS a FWD after all.  The back seat is for the pup, so humans don't regularly ride in ours, although there's enough room for non-giant folks on trips of shorter duration.  IF Volvo still made the C70, I reckon we would start looking about now(57k miles); but, alas, it may(will?) be a few more years before Volvo gets into the drop -top business again.  IF the next gen is anything like the current C70; we'll be in line for one!!!",4

At 60,000 miles, have dealer replace both rubber axle booth - under dealer warranty.  At 70,000 miles, have dealer replaced the leaky coolant reservoir - under dealer warranty.  Other than these, no issue with the car for past 4 years.  C70 is very stylish and many people compliment the car.  One time I was approached by a lady on a red light - thought I was being carjacked, but she wanted to know what car I was driving.  Seats are very comfy and I feel like sitting in comfy sofa at Ikea store.  C70 came with one of the best stereo I ever witnessed. My previous Infiniti Q45 Bose system is sub-par to C70's.   The stereo sound great even with top down.  Bluetooth, however, need improvement.  Bluetooth phone Volume is very low (I have Samsung Note 4).   It has no A2DP option (for 2009 model) and when I asked around online, Bluetooth audio option is not available.   I use small thumb drive to play all my music.  It even taking 128gb thumb drive- thousands of songs!   Or you have option to plug in 3.5 jack via Aux.     There is no way you can install custom radio (not that I need one) since factory stereo also works as climate control display.    It's so much fund to drive during the California winter with top down (heated seat).  Top down during hot summer really make you enjoy the sun, but when I was driving Mojave and Las Vegas under 114 degree hot sun, I thought I was going to be roasted alive...        When top is up, I can hear some squeaky noise time to time, but if you don't pay attention, you can hardly hear them.  As with all front drive car, it has torque steering, but I have not experienced any under/over steering when cornering.    Break is bit soft compared to my wife's Toyota Sienna, but never failed the stopping distance as of now (I commute 60 miles on S. Calif 405 everyday, and I see accidents at least 4x a week).  Great cruising car with enough horses, but don't expect to hit 60 in 3.5 secs.  If I want performance super fast car, I would probably look for non convertible car.                          Good: Stereo, trunk space, 2 car in 1, hard top, turbo                         Bad: Wind deflector extra (bought mine from Ebay used $250, Bluetooth, No real spare tire for my C70 (has repair kit), heavy due to hard top.",5

I live in new England and this is the first car I have owned with this many miles with NO RUST.

Other than regular maintenance, the car has performed great. It's sporty, holds bikes and snowboards on top, enough room for moderate luggage load in the rear - if not a bit tight in the rear seats, though. Comfortable ride, but not the best on long trips. Austere interior is perfect - I prefer minimal and simple interior gadgets/knobs. Misses would include black bumper trim pieces fading and the replacement of the fascia cup holder which I completed myself. I've also replaced the front strut mounts 3 times due to potholes and rough roads. The turbo is quick and a great asset for both city and motorway take-overs.",4.75

Very responsive, very quick, very nice. As noted on these, the brakes will need replacing after about 20K, but it still stops well (they were new at purchase). Overall, this is a great vehicle. Yakima box onto the rails and I can fit all I need to camp with my wife and two small children. Once they get a little older, the back seat will be too small; it's tight back there!",4.25

While it doesn't excel in any one category (except for safety and comfort, Volvo's trademarks), the V40 does everything pretty darn well!

I couldn't pass it up. So far I've have the check engine light come on once, and I think the ignition timing may have been off a bit.

My dealer told me today that he was recently driving through a scary part of Washington, DC in a similar S40 sedan when the Mitsubishi-built transmission simply failed completely at a stoplight, something he had never experienced with even the oldest Volvos.

Quick, comfortable, and stylish and only minor problems. Many of the issues that others have reported suggest to me that they never opened the owner's manual. Example: ""headlights burn out annually"". The cars come from the factory with Daytime Running Lights (DRL) activated. Naturally the headlights are going to burn out more often when they're on day and night. Solution: read the owner's manual and it tells you how to turn DRL off in 2 easy steps. Some other problems may have been caused by not following Volvo's recommended service intervals.

This isn’t our first Volvo as we have had 240’s, 740’s and S70’s through the years. Along with Volvos we have owned everything from Mini Vans to Mercedes, approximately 55 vehicles in all.I was attracted to the V70 because of styling, performance and the need for cargo space. All of which have been fulfilled with this car. We found this previously owned with 48,000 gentle one owner mi. and all service records up to date. We have taken several road trips thus far and use as a commuter during the week. Absolutely no disappointments at all and I enjoy driving a vehicle that doesn’t  look like the majority of vehicles on the road. Other reviewers have a tendency to compare this to vehicles that out perform and out handle the V70 but they miss the essence entirely. This wagon has plenty of power provided by the 3.2 Litre ( same motor in the LR1 Land Rover) and delivers well when called upon. The comfort is second to none and the fit and finish throughout the vehicle is way above the standard run of the mill cars for the masses.Our V70 is the silver metallic sans the luggage rack with 6 spoke 16” wheels. It’s amazing how many people compliment on the looks and the younger gen love it! Kinda cool for a station wagon huh ?I will be adding Bilstein HD Struts and Shocks along with rear stabilizer bar soon for ride and sound improvements but that’s it. We continue to service at all intervals and to this point have absolutely no complaints. Go find a well kept V70 and stand out!20K addl. mile update:Still the one!

There is plenty of space for both passengers and cargo in a relatively compact package.  The power train is generally refined.  The transmission is very smooth but the engine growls a tad too loud for an almost 40,000 car.  There is way too much shudder and noise when going over bumps but otherwise it feels solid. The highway ride is quiet and serene.  We purchased for 25 grand as a rental return. I believe the MSRP was about 38 grand, which is a little spendy.  We're getting 22-34 mpg in mixed driving.

The brakes are normally quite good, but the V70R brakes stop on half a dime.  It feels like it has a lot more than the rated 300 HP.  My Boss's S6 wagon just doesn't match it.  We have the orange leather interior, which pushes it over the edge to PHAT.  Or at least as phat as a Volvo can ever be.

I'm a Volvo enthusiast, so my opinion is slightly biased. I got this wagon for a really good deal because it needed some body work. I performed the necessary repairs and have put 40000 miles on it in 26 months. Parts are relatively inexpensive if you shop online. Places like FCPEuro and EEuroParts have mostly everything in stock and have fair pricing. RockAuto has a lot of stuff, too. There are several dedicated Volvo forums that cover just about every repair possible. I will continue to drive it and upkeep it until the wheels fall off.

Plain looking on the outside but not dower.  Inside the materials all look pretty good after 12 years and 188k miles.  Acceleration is a strong point while handling is capable but the bumps from the road transmit jolts and noise to passengers inside - not a luxury ride.  In fact its bumpier and noisier inside than most non-luxury cars.  That said its not terrible just not a smooth ride.  Seats are well crafted and very comfortable.  The rear leg room is limited for a family car.  My kids are now in their teens and we will need a car with a bigger back seat - not fair to sentence anyone over 5'6"" to a long car ride in the rear of this vehicle.  We can get another 5"" of rear seat leg room in a Toyota Highlander.  Storage is ample and the cargo capacity is excellent for a car.  We can still pack for a 2 week vacation without a roof rack.  Reliability has been pretty good for a car this age.  We did have a radiator failure that leaked coolant into the transmission (and transmission fluid into the radiator) - that could have been catastrophic if we had not caught it immediately (e.g. driven it for more than a few miles in that condition).  Otherwise its been struts, engine mounts, 02 sensors, brakes etc - all normal wear and tear over 12  yrs 188k mi.",4

Since then the V70 has 19,000 miles on it - low mileage. The door locks have gone crazy opening and closing at random and that was fixed.

Cost- almost $1000. After complaining to main office NJ, they agreed to cover the rotors but not the pads (all 4 wheels). Ridiculous. That's still $450. I have never had this problem in 47 years.

So I think that sums it up.  No one will touch this piece of junk and the most bizarre problems occur.  Car has repeatedly been in the shop throughout my ownership, has almost gotten me into many, many accidents due to severe transmission problems, stalling and overheating.  I think I have replaced every part on the car including the engine and transmission and most sensors and they fail again and again.  Now the electrical system and information system is totally messed up.  At this point I could have bought 3 brand new Chevrolets and I'm cutting my losses.  This is also the worst driving car I have ever driven.  It will give someone whiplash with the transmission jerking and lurching.  Not even worth the recycling.  I wouldn't want to curse the other items they might make out of the scrap.  Never buy another Volvo period.  When I see someone driving one, I can't help but pity them.  AND, my model was made in Sweden.  Every repair shop tells me VOLVO is JUNK and the worst nightmares to work on. No wonder only Doctors or Lawyers can own them.  They're the only ones who can afford the upkeep.I do have to say that regardless of how bad it has performed and how costly it has been, in spite of all it's problems and stranding me, it always manages to get me home.

Such a sad car to own especially after years of having great Volvos (1965 122s, 1978 240 wagon) The throttle body is a huge issue that costs about $2500 and caused it to intermittently stall.The heater core leaked due to being a mix of aluminum and plastic. $900Front suspension was weak, had to replace both A armsThe worst flaw was the transmission. Went out just over 100K and was almost $7000 to repair. At the cost of this I opted to send it to the scrap yard. Car looked great but the repair was more than it was worth. 2001 was known for transmission trouble, this was a lemon year.",1

3233, on 09/18/15 12:24 PM (PDT),edanstrekal@live.com ,2000 Volvo V70 Wagon 4dr Wagon,Best money I ever spent on a used car--still!," I've owned quite a few used cars.  I was always attracted to unique or freaky cars--old Volkswagens, Cadillacs, 1980s Audis, and more recently Saabs.  I always wanted a Volvo wagon because I thought they looked cool and I'd heard good things about reliability of the 2.4L five cylinder engine.  I was a little hesitant about the electrical system as it seems all European vehicles have electrical issues, some more so than others.  With that being said, this is by far one of the finest vehicles I have ever owned (and I only paid $2500)!  I bought it from the second owner with around 178K miles on it.  The former owner provided me with all the maintenance records from the time it was new.  In the last couple of years, he himself had addressed many of the preventative maintenance issues including timing belt, brakes, shocks, and radiator.  The only issues were the lock on the tailgate doesn't work with the central locking system and there is a bulb burned out behind the odometer.  Since I've owned it, I've just kept the oil changed, tires rotated, and replaced the plugs and air filter when necessary.  I've had a few issues with the check engine light coming on now and then, but I've just cleaned the MAF and throttle body thoroughly and that seems to have fixed it now for over  a year and a half!  It passes smog with flying colors.  Update: I did recently replace the upper o2 sensor on account of the CEL not turning off.  I unfortunately broke a few vacuum lines in the process, but everything is okay!  CEL went off and the car is again running like a top.The wagon is very utilitarian.  I can carry all kinds of things in the back, bikes, dressers, tables, almost anything within reason.  More recently I've been using the car to haul stuff for the events business my wife works for.  I haul all kinds of flowers, chairs, linens, etc up to Lake Tahoe without problems.  The heating and cooling are much better than expected (the A/C is great actually), and the acceleration for being a non-turbo isn't half bad.  It's not a hot rod, but it has the power to go up and down over the Sierra Nevada mountains, which I often do on my way to Sacramento.  The seats are some of the most comfortable I've ever experienced (I just wish mine had the heated leather).  It is always nice returning to my Volvo after having a rental car.  As far as gas mileage is concerned I average about 23.3 around town, and on long trips I can usually manage over 30.  That's not half bad for a car this size and weight.  Although it rattles, and it isn't the smoothest ride, it handles well, always starts up, and just keeps on going at even with 201,000 miles.  It doesn't burn any oil and everything functions as it should, sans the tailgate lock.  A great bang for your buck, and since it's old I really don't care what happens to it.  I think this car has sold me on buying another Volvo in the future.Update:I parted ways with my V70 last weekend.  I bought a slightly newer S60 with AWD.  I am really hoping for the same reliability as the old wagon, but only time will tell.  It had about 204,000 with no signs of slowing down anytime soon.  The new owner was hard-pressed to find any real issues with the thing.  I sold it to him for $1000, and I think it was a great deal.  One thing is for sure, I'll never forget the joy and piece of mind this car brought me during ownership.",5

Probably the best handling wagon I've driven. Gets the same gas mileage as my old 4 cylinder Honda Accord. EXCEPTIONAL power (0-60 under 9 seconds) for a 2.5 litre, non turbo car with automatic. Better yet, it has been TOTALLY reliable in my 30,000 miles of ownership (YES, I drive a LOT :)) My only REAL complaint is the front cupholder that appears to be a toy out of a McDonald's Happy Meal. Also, I will probably go with a Turbo next time around since I do a fair amount of high altitude mountain driving.

Rear hatch panel broke off cost $170 to fix a month later it came detached again. GET THIS, THEY TOLD ME I'M SLAMMING IT TOO HARD!

Back seat has little leg room - no a biggie for hauling kids, but seating and seatbelt spacing in middle position is narrow making it just about impossible to fit a 3rd carseat in back seat.

Granted, a car this old will have some Turbo Lag for sure, but a 1983 Porsche 911 Turbo also spools up a bit slowly. Mileage isn't outstanding around town or highway compared to new cars. Thing is, it's comfortable and can haul your stuff. I love this low roofed 2 box design. The different front Fascia w/ fog lights, wheels, rear air deflector etc make it the best looking Volvo wagon. I added the factory twin or dual exhaust which the 1999 didn't come with. I tinted the windows, dark in the back, legal on front windows. I also added IPD super headlights, which work better and look real cool. The mids, tweets and subs add up to the best, most balanced stereo I've had. Some things aren't ideal...costs a lot to service...I was spending $1000/yr average for service when driving a lot. Now I'm retired. Mine is different than some I've ridden in...it is quiet w/o creaks, groans and rattles (which drive me crazy). The interior is in good shape w/o tears etc. The defroster could work better. Uses about a quart (one of 6 quarts/oil change) every 3000 miles which is more than acceptable. I have used full synthetic oil since I bought it 50,000 miles ago, changing it every 3-5000 miles. I don't want to change my car. Not to mention, as a Volvo Wagon...it's invisible to the general population. I have no children and am divorced, I've just always found the boxy design to be functional.",4

3343, on 06/08/18 16:44 PM (PDT),Chris ,1999 Volvo V70 Wagon 4dr Wagon,An excellent used car buy," I bought my '99 V70 Base Wagon with about 160,000 miles on it, including all the maintenance and repair receipts since it was new. It now has about 214,000 miles. It still has the original muffler and exhaust system, starter, alternator, radiator and clutch. The A/C works great and has never been recharged. Most cars would have had all of those replaced by now. The engine and transmission have been rock solid. (The manual transmissions will last forever - the automatics, not so much.) The engine holds 5 quarts, instead of 4 like most smaller engines. It's never used more than a quart in 5000 miles. Mileage has been between 20 and 25 around town, and about 30 on long trips. The 5-banger has plenty of power - any more, and I'd be getting speeding tickets. I have used the V70 to tow numerous cars on a dolly, including other V70s! The seats are the most comfortable I've ever sat in, and the visibility is terrific. Maintenance, while I have had it: The wiring harness to the back hatch - it flexes when it's opened and closed, and had several broken wires when I bought the car. The brake pads are finally getting down, after 50K or more miles. The driver's seat vinyl is finally starting to crack. Not bad for 19 years old.  The oil filter will pour oil on your hand when you take it off, every time. Use a disposable glove. The radiator shroud is made of fiberglass, and it gives me an itchy rash if I ever rest my arm on it. The biggest complaint that I have is the squeaking dash, which is worse when it's cold. There is one mounting point that tends to break after a few years. It's a common characteristic of this model. It can be repaired (if you are a bit daring and handy) by a bolt through the firewall. This is a great used car, especially if you like to fix the little things (like light bulbs and brake pads) every now and then. Those little characteristics just give it character and personality. I've had lots of cars over the last 34 years, and the V70 is certainly one of my favorites. It's very dependable, roomy without being oversized, is almost as useful as a pickup, had decent economy, is fun to drive and is a classic, instead of trying to be trendy. It finds the middle ground between luxury, economy and practicality without giving up anything for safety. I would expect it to last well beyond 300K, unless it gets hit by a semi.",4

Driving through the Appalachians demonstrated that hills are too much for her now. The dealer sold her to me with the praise,""It gets out of its own way"". This has been true, but in the mountains of western Maryland, she wasn't easily getting out of the way of more powerful cars behind us. Even at 17 years old, her exterior looks like new.

I got it VERY cheap, and all I had to do was put new tires on it and about $700 worth of suspension work. Other than that the car has been pretty much trouble free. No break downs. Check engine light pops up about once a week. But usually goes away. Drivers door window pack isn't working right. A/C works when it wants to. One door doesn't lock and the car seems to think one door is open always. So just removed dinger and light fuses. Tailgate panel still makes noise even with new clips. A couple creaks and rattles. Gas mileage is pretty bad for a wagon. About 14 city 25 highway. But it has been a decent car for the price.",3.75

There is no such thing as a simple oil and filter change; always some aggravating expensive repair. I feel like I'm rebuilding this car as I go along, and I've taken good care of it.

I drove it from Florida to New York, loaded with everything I own, and the trip went really well, but it stopped starting a day or two after I got home.  Apparently the problem lies with spark plugs, and I have no idea how old they are, so really nothing is wrong.  My handling wasn't too great on the trip but I attribute that to carrying about 700 pounds of cargo in the back.  It's usually great.  It runs great, and it's very comfortable.

Dealer would have wanted close to $800 to fix - robbers. Shortly thereafter, it was stalling intermittently. Lo and behold, I needed to replace the ETM module (which was a Volvo defect) but it was done for free, however needed to replace the pedal assembly since it was continuing to stall ($235).

Well worth it, though, factory sound is awesome.",4.75

I drive all the time and this in car is  the most comfortable I have ever had. The AWD is great in the Snowbelt where I live. just make sure you keep ALL 4 TIRE's with 2\32 of each other.

3400, on 03/31/06 14:16 PM (PST),Ed ,1998 Volvo V70 R R Turbo 4dr Wagon AWD,Seven Years Now, I have had this car since new. There were two initial issues. Both were addressed. The car has had some performance modifications by IPD so it is faster than the average V70R. Other than above I have not had any major issues with the car. It has been a pain to pass DEQ not because it has high emmissions but because the computer has a long drive time to re-register data after a battery change.  For me it was nice to carry items but think you are in a pretty fast sedan otherwise. Gas mileage is not great.  I should also mention that I was T boned once by a car doing and estimated 40 MPH and drove it home. Granted the steering was way out of true.  After 7 years I am tired on it though.,3.875

The engine light is on has been for quite some time, has a small leak in one of the vacuum hoses, needs to be put on a smoke machine to find the leak.  Does not effect how it runs, as it is a great running car, I use premium fuel and synthetic oil, gas mileage is not very good.  Drive it less than 5000 miles per year, so it is exempt concerning emissions, just replaced emergency brake cable.  These cars are built like a truck, safety is there main concern, great for a new driver or if there are children. If you see one pay the extra money to have it check by a mechanic, if they are not taken care of it will cost you big time. If the seller has a problem with you taking the Volvo to a mechanic, walk away.",4
3408, on 09/02/17 10:34 AM (PDT),Katherine Rose ,1998 Volvo V70 Wagon 4dr Wagon,Bought a Used 1998 Volvo V70 Wagon FWD," I have always liked the design of the 1998 Volvo wagon.  My husband had a 940 T wagon and it was awesome.  So we bought this wagon used in 2009.  It has been a great car up until 2016.   It started off with a code P4099 which we could not find.   Then the handle on the gear shifter when you depress it, it stays depressed which makes it easy to pop out of gear and then when you put it in park, you cant get your key out of the ignition until you get the shift handle to un-depress.   Have to use the shift override button every time I take it out of park.   Most annoying.   To the left of the shifter is the readout for what gear your in, the plastic piece that fits in that area keeps moving and I cant tell what gear I am in.  Had my brakes replaced and new rotors and they still squeal when depressed especially when going in reverse.  Every so often the car shudders and acts like it is going to die.  In fact this year 2017 just this week it died on me in traffic at a red light and I had a hard time getting it started. The car doesn't rev high when first started, but to me it idles high,  the engine sounds loud unless I put it in neutral.   4 years ago the outside clear coat started peeling off.  Looks terrible.   Overall I have been very pleased with the car I have to say.    The sound system is really nice.  Great visibility.  All the electronics works.   Love the sunroof/moon roof.   The interior is in really good shape.   The seats are leather but they are a very hard leather, not sure why that is.   Black exterior, graphite interior.   I believe once I can put some money into fixing the current problems it will last me several more years.   The gas mileage I am not happy about.   Around town, driving some freeway and some inner streets I get 19 mpg.   If I go on a long drive, I can get up to 22-26 mpg not great.    I did have the windows tinted and it looks sharp.",4

The dealer had all the maintenance records, which showed a trip to the dealership every 5,000 miles. The interior and exterior looked brand new--the back seat looked like it had never been ridden in. Obviously garaged and pampered by the prior owner. I had to fix a broken motor mount, and the rear hatch struts were weak, which I replaced. About $450 for both. It now has a 121,000 miles on it and has been trouble-free. My independent Volvo mechanic is jealous. He says the 1998 and earlier volvos are tougher than the current ones.

Boy was I WRONG!! In the first week the check engine light came on.  took the car to many mechanics, even volvo, costing me hundreds in diagnostics fees and still not fixing it.  heater went out, that would cost 700 to fix.

One area that I ran into now at 201,000 miles is the rear struts. On my car the cost to replace them is $550.00 per side..( will not replace) so I'll live with the bumps or pot holes, but its really not bad. I am known to keep my cars until the engine goes, most of my other volvo's have gone 370,000 miles, so still have 3-4yrs left on this one. One key factor on volvo's, they never need a  tune-up. same plugs etc and the car is 13 years old.

Some problems couldn't be resolved because every service station (including the dealership) diagnosed it differently. And when the diagnosis was a recalled throttle, Volvo disagreed! Too much money into this car. We justified each repair by reminding ourselves it was a Volvo but no more because they are not what they used to be. The name no longer means anything.

Regarding the safety factor, I feel like I'm driving a vault down the road.

My wife and I both have lower back pain and the R-Design front seats are the best we've tried.

The R-Design is a great package so we only added the convenience package (heated seats) and the keyless ignition.

Quiet. Reasonably-priced luxury. Beats my old SUV in every way. Getting 21 mpg city so far. As for models I didn't buy: Audi A4 Avant was gorgeous but had terrible rear-seat legroom and bit of road noise. Passat wagon had lots of road noise. V70 won out on those counts and others. Also, it has 5yrs/60K full maintenance. My only beef: It was scarce in my area, so I didn't have many color choices. Scarce because Volvo would rather sell you an XC70 or 60 (for way more money); also most V70s are a factory buy, apparently. But V70's mileage is better than the XCs. V70 is sleek, solid, luxurious ... the quintessential Volvo.",4.875

Way better gas mileage that the XC90s I test drove the XC 70, but did not like the external sheaths of plastic on the car, nor the raised ground clearance and the rougher ride. I do wish they made the v70 in AWD, but front wheel will be fine in snow with winter tires. The interior of the car is beautiful. better than BMW and rivaling Audi.

It has been outstanding in terms of reliability- with one exception, the A/C compressor had to be replaced - around $700; otherwise, great - engine transmission, electronics etc, all solid.  The front seats are very comfortable for a smaller wagon.  Mine is not leather - wish it was - the cloth seats show stains too easily (mine are a light grey color).  I added a bluetooth unit which works great (but that was an aftermarket addition).  Love the cargo in the back with the seats down- excellent space.  The ride is very comfortable and relatively quiet for an inexpensive Volvo wagon.  I wish I had a bigger wagon by Volvo bc i'm sure it would be even more comfortable and have an even better ride.  Handling is just okay-but it's a wagon, not a sports car anyway.  Acceleration is adequate even in the non-turbo 2.4 - again, it's not a sports car but it has enough power to motor past grandma if needbe.  fuel economy is not great for a wagon that's not AWD.  It is FWD just in case you didn't know - some torque steer but it's tolerable to me.  And I don't need AWD here in southern CA.  Can't recall what i paid or date of purchase",4

It has all the electronic and computer gadgets of my 1999 328i, although its acceleration and handling are not as good. I have always driven a manual transmission so I was a bit skeptical about the Geartronics.  It turns out to be quite acceptable. I can use it to slow down the car.

I like an upscale car, Volvo is one of the top-tier brands, and I was drawn to it for something with more utility than my sedan.

It's my first new car, and I am quite happy with my decision. So far, no problems; but then again, I've only got 2000 miles on the car.

3646, on 06/19/16 05:40 AM (PDT),Stephen Kish ,2015 Volvo V60 Cross Country Wagon T5 4dr Wagon AWD (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6A),Cute little wagon for 2 adults," Wagon suits my wife perfectly. Smaller than our Outback was (more like our 2008 than our 2012 in rear seating) and also uses regular gas for it's 5 cylinder turbo engine. It drives okay for me in sports mode ONLY. Otherwise programmed to be slow and be more fuel efficient. Great seats. Better than my Audi S5's premium leather seats. Bought it Certified pre-owned (demo) with 7K miles. Over 3 years left on original warranty plus Volvo adds a 3 year certification. BMW, Audi, etc. add 2 years for CPO & Mercedes only 1.  I like the styling much more than the former Volvo wagons that looked like refrigerators on wheels.  This is a sleek modern looking vehicle. Like a maxi version on the former cute little C70 which I liked as much as Mini's if not more. Like most al wheel drive cars the mileage isn't great in the city. He just enough pep, but no faster than our former Outback 3.6R. However the Outback had no sport mode to add pep when passing or accelerating. It's smaller than the Outback which I like for city parking. Rear space is small for a wagon, but with rear seats folded down there is plenty of room. It held five tires easily when I changes tires from all the Scorpion all-seasons. I run summer and winter tires always. The brakes are a weak point. Much longer stopping distance than a car at this price should require. Being bought for safety it's disappointing and needs a fix. The better tires help a bit. I like the keyless entry and the auto folding side mirrors which fold when you lock the car for parking. The rear windows inhibit viability, but that's the design. Our other option to the Outback was the Audi Cross Country. The option was too expensive and not a faster car. The Volvo parts are outrageous! I wanted a set of wheels for winter snow tires, but they were $500/each. If one of the OEM wheels has to be replaced that's the cost. The Tire Rack doesn't have this cars fitment yet so until they get one to spec out I can't buy winter tires. I suspect that this is not a big a seller as the FWD V60 which is less expensive and lower. We needed the Cross Country for it's height for snow clearance. We get too much! I blast our wagons out of the long driveway rather than shovel. My Audi S5 doesn't have much clearance though AWD. I prefer not to use it in heavy snow though I run high performance winter tires (Dunlap winter sports) in one size down from the OEM 19s. I plan to buy W80s or Xice3's for the Volvo once I find reasonably priced wheels. No way I'm buying Volvo wheels at their pricing.I bought W80s for snow and ice. Haven't had any bad weather to try them out. Rides well on these tires. Found really nice wheels from the tire rack. The electronics are limited to use with an AT&T mobile device (only) which is ridiculous. I use Verizon, so I can't use many features. Very sore point. On the positive side I stumbled onto a power mode feature that the dealership was not even aware of on this wagon. Rather than being part of the features you choose on the center console, it is on the turn signal! You choose power mode (1 of 3 choices) and put the shifter in sport mode and the car changes character from a slug to a car with zip. Now it stays in power mode!! I never use sport mode until the car warms up. Better safe than sorry. Overall I still think this car was a good choice. With Buick bringing the Opel wagon over from Europe where it is very popular, I may change my mind. I'll wait to see the Opel with the Buick badging.Mileage on this car is disappointing. in spite of my sporty driving habits.",4

Quiet at speed, relaxing to drive but also fun and willing when pushed a bit.

It was a 2017 T5, 2.0 four cylinder turbo, black on Black. The steering feel could be adjusted to three levels of “heaviness”, which is a fun feature. The car feels very tightly put together, seats are bolstered although the big bottomed individuals may feel they are sitting on the ridge of the seat. Acceleration was fast, nimble handling (at The heaviest steering setting though, the turning radius seems to be reduced as it’s more for Autobahn driving). Suspension is firm but goes over bumps nicely, good isolation unlike what other say. Drives in slimes snow days like a champ, thanks to the Volvo unique AWD. Sound system is amazing at base trim. It’s a perfect little off-road wagon to replace the Crosstrek, X1 or any little SUV. Best for a college guy or girl with active lifestyle. It’s just such a nice car.

My 2013 Outback is great but I gave it to my daughter and it left me wanting a little better handling. The cargo area is practical but not huge. The cabin area is not huge but it fits me well. The car has roof rails for a roof rack and the roof height is practical for loading. I really like the way the car rides and drives but it's not a sports car. The thing feels solid and the whole package inspires confidence. AWD, slightly elevated ride height, wagon utility and drives like a premium car. Frosting on the cake: runs on regular unleaded gas.",5
3653, on 04/19/17 16:19 PM (PDT),first477 ,2000 Volvo S70 Sedan 4dr Sedan,Last of great Volvos," Overall this is a great car. I have the non turbo 5 speed automatic and I bought it used with 120,xxx miles. It now has 124,xxx. When I bought the car, I thought I was getting a stupid good deal, but as I owned it longer I realized why it was so dirt cheap. This is the kind of car you definitely to take good care of or else it will not take care of you. You really have to stay on top of the timing belt, oil changes, trans fluid, thermostat, etc, or else you have nightmares down the line. If you buy a turbo model, you definitely need to pay attention to how you drive the car to keep the turbo well maintained (drive it slow when its cold, let it run 30-60 seconds before and after shutoff/startup, etc). There are a number of things that can go wrong with the car that you have to be aware of. First is the heater core. If it fails, you're gonna lose of lot of coolant, fast, so watch your temp gauge and if it starts getting too hot, pull over and get it fixed so you don't blow your head gasket. Next is the Positive Crankcase Ventilation System. With age and mileage, it gets clogged up and it needs to be serviced. It's gonna set you back at least $300 if you do it yourself and you have all the tools you need, but it's upwards of $600-700 if you get an independent shop to do it. If you opt not to do it, and it needed to be done, you risk blowing either a crankshaft seal or a rear main seal, either of which means your car is basically totaled. If you change the oil often enough, you should be able to go a good long while before it needs to be serviced. If you find a car and you can't get documentation of recent repairs for the PCV system, timing belt, or heater core, you will need to have those serviced otherwise you'll be losing a lot of money when your car breaks. Also of importance, these transmissions are claimed to use a lifetime fluid, which is definitely not true. The fluid needs to be changed at least every 70,000 miles. The 2000 models without the turbo have an extremely sensitive Aisin Warner 5 speed automatic, and it definitely needs the fluid changed often. Its pretty easy to do to. The 4 speed automatics on the turbo models are a lot less sensitive but you still need to change the fluid often enough. Also, the suspensions in these cars wear out, so expect repairs around the 150-200 thousand mile mark. A very major problem with these cars that most people notice and are turned off right away is the squeaky dashboard. Yes, it squeaks like no other car I've ever been in. It's very unsettling, but it doesn't effect the drivability of the car and frankly I got used it in one week of driving it. There are fixes for it, but they're personally not worth the effort. Other little things are probably going to break on the car too. The overall build quality is not that good to be honest. If taken care of, it will serve as a wonderful, stylish point A to B car. /// How does the car drive? It's very comfortable and relaxing to drive. The seats are classic Volvo, very comfortable. The brake pedal has a good feel and it stops well. The gas pedal is touchy in the first 5-10% of the travel, but other than that, its a very good gas pedal. The steering is excellent overall. The weight is good, not terribly light but not heavy. It tries to turn all the way to one side when turned far, but it tracks straight well at smaller turn angles. As an added bonus, the turn radius is actually pretty tight. Handling is a little on the soft side, and you can tell it doesn't like to be driven fast in twists or corners. Acceleration is pretty average for a car of this size. The 5 cylinder engine sounds fantastic. Just go on youtube and watch some acceleration videos of s70s, 850s, etc, you'll see what I mean. Cruising rpm is a little high for my taste. Multiply the speed by 35 and that's the rpm in 5th gear. I personally think it could be lower. It's pretty quiet on the highway except for the squeaking. I drive very conservatively and I get about 24-26 mpg average. That's about 20% highway 80% city. I really like the styling of the car too. Inside and out looks gorgeous. I get complements from friends and family about how nice it looks.",4
3654, on 04/12/17 10:49 AM (PDT),volvolover ,2000 Volvo S70 Sedan SE 4dr Sedan,Still rocking at 216k!," I don't believe in buying new cars, so I bought this baby used in 2007.  Since many of the reviews here are several years old, I thought I'd offer my two cents for anyone who is considering buying one of these OBGs (oldies but goodies).  This v70 SE had about 85k miles on it when I purchased it.  Today (10 years later), it has 216k.  I love, love, love this car!  If you can find one in decent condition, buy it!!  It has been a wonderful vehicle.  Very reliable, safe, comfortable.  Plenty of room in both the front and back seats, and generous trunk space.  (It may not seem like enough to you if you're used to a wagon or SUV, but it is a great-sized trunk for a sedan.)  Have taken several looong roadtrips (3k+ mi.) with this car, and can say that it's been fabulous!  Smooth, great acceleration whenever needed/wanted, and after 8-10 hours in the car during a long leg of the trip, you can emerge unscathed.  Super comfortable seating.  Even after 17 years, I average 25.5 mpg, comprised mostly of in-town driving and some highway.  Great steering, suspension.  The idea of having to part with it at some point down the road makes me sad.  I spend approx. $1k/year on repairs and maintenance (normal service, tires, repairs, everything).  That amount would make me bleed from the eyes if the car was new, but this vehicle is mature, and some amount of replacement must be expected.  When I divide that number by 12, I still know that I'm doing much better than flushing a ton of money down the toilet on a new car!",5

While changing oil and filters -- it needs special internal filter and needs special wrench. It forces you to go to a dealer for oil changes. No dip stick for checking transmission fluid. Ease of maintenance always increases a car's reliabilty. Engine hot light comes on occasionally while the temp gauge reads normal and with full antifreeze. The light goes off only after an overnight cooling. The electronic throttle light comes on and the engine stalls. Volvo has not been able to explain the problem. The dealer will clean the throttle butterfly but it might or might not fix the problem. Volvo refuses to issue a recall.",3.75

However, it has severe blind spots making it tough to change lanes.  And forget the outside rearview mirrors - no help with the blind spots.

We had the non-turbo car which is supposed to be bulletproof.  I have no doubt that the basic engine and body structure would have survived a million miles, a missile attack, and the next ice age, but the sensors, switches, A/C, brake discs, engine mounts, CV boots, etc. are what nickles and dimes you to death.  Oh, and the drivers' seat and center armrest vinyl started to slough off in thin layers like a moderate sunburn at around 100,000 miles.  It's not like we as a family beat on our cars - they are garage-kept and I do take care of them.  Maybe we got a bad one, but overall, considering all the hype I was not impressed.

It was absolutely perfect until about 170,000 when the Electronic Throttle Module failed.  Before buying any used Volvo from this time period I would thoroughly research the ETM and the problems it's caused.  It's a very expensive part, and the replacement is just as likely to fail as the original.  And since replacing mine, I've had several other problems with it and related parts.  I've completely lost confidence in the car.  Having said that, it was a great car for 10 years.",4.5

Today it went into limp mode and the dealer told us it was out of warranty now (over 10 years by 6 months). and it was going to cost $1000 to fix and replace the throttle body and reflash the computer. Volvo has known about this problem for years and I think it harable to allow customers to bear the brunt of this cost. It only has 113,000 miles for god sake.  To sell it in running order would be about $3,000. So why would I dump $1000. BAD",3.125

It is the base model without the turbo, so that could be part of the reason. The car feels very solid and is very fun to drive. My other car is an 80's Porsche and I enjoy this car just as much. It is comfortable after a long day at work, and I don't mind driving it in rain or snow. Aside from normal oil changes, I am replacing my original struts that have 134,000 miles on them. Everything else seems find and I plan to drive this car for a very long time. If I were to sell it, it would be for a T5 S70. The best fuel economy I received was 32mpg.

Overall experience is okay. The 162 hp engine is too small for the car. For 172 hp, one needs to add turbo($2000 extra). At high speed with A/C running, it has no power left to pass. Interior noise and engine whinning at low speed are annoying. Suspension is too stiff and you feel all bumps. It has been pretty much trouble free and dependable so far. Good looking and excellent paint job and A/C. Master brake failed at 55000 mile. Repair is very expensive. Depreciation of all Volvos are abominable for European automobile. As bad as Jaguar.

I believe this car got lost in the confusion over Ford sale. Agree with many of the past reviews, but the turbo really does give impressive performance to what is a somewhat heavy car. Handling is sure no sports car but not bad either. I bought the car new, then transferred to my mom, who still has it, so we have a good perspective, and the car runs well at 80k miles. On the other hand, the car is noisier than it should be at highway speeds and engine vibration is noticible.",3.75

These cars cost over $30,000 new and are bargains now. Front and side air bags, Heats seats, head light wipers, cd and tape player, quality leather, dual zone climate, and other luxuries are what made me pick this over a used Honda Accord.

The major problems I have had with the car came around 90k miles when the ETC and ABS had to be replaced. The ETC is a recalled defect and the ABS happened to go with it in my case. The car is easy to maintain and has plenty of room to work in the engine compartment. Lights are easy to change; I don't even scratch my hands doing it. Maintenance procedures are easy to perform on this car which is more than I can say for many other cars. Parts are also sold at reasonable prices and readily available from vendors online.

Bought a year and a half ago, at 125000+ miles she is still going strong mechanically and electronically, and still looks like she just left the dealership. I have had offers to trade/sell for a new Volvo because the demand for used S70s is high (great car to pass to the kids). The only issues have been the oil system, which needed repair once one month after purchase because of insufficient oil flow to the cams, and replacement of the coolant resivoir.

Fuel economy is impressive - better than the published figures (my driving is about 50% city and 50% highway). Trunk space is more than adequate.

We have 185,000 miles now and the car still performs great.  I taught 3 sons how to drive in it and it took it all in stride.  Fit and finish are still first class-- my friends have wondered at the lack of squeaks and rattles with this many miles.

The volvo rides really well, and brings a strong sense of safety while inside.  The S70 has surprising jump and performance for a 5cyl.  The car handles great in snow and rain (firestone affinity tires), hugs tight corners well, and driving the S70 leaves me daydreaming of rally car racing! -no joke- Only a few minor quirks but overall this car is flying under the radar as an awesome sedan - and this is comparing to the bmw 3series and vw passat",4.75

It performs extremely well, the suspension is very fun, and the brakes are great. You can really tell that it is very high quality car.  It's not without the quirks you usually find in European cars and it is more expensive to maintain. Service lights come on fairly often, but you soon learn that life has not stopped if check engine comes on. It's just how the car works.

Multiple sensor malfunctions - ABS, TRACs, BRAKE light, Check Engine, Transmission, ETS (accompanied with revving engine @ idle).

Volvo has this same issue in 1997 and 1998 models and will not do anything about it.  Volvo told me that if it happened within the manufacturer warranty (4yrs) they would have covered it.  Extended warranty does not cover it because it is a structural defect.  I purchased a Volvo for safety and for the long term.  They don't make them like they used to.,3.75

But being on the road five days a week and driving approximately 2000 miles a month, I think I can fairly assess everything else.  Performance wise, the spunky little 2.4 5L has plenty of pep (no,not as performance based as an Audi or VW) and handles corners cleanly. Ergonomically, in some regards Volvo needs to be more intuitive with small things like better front cupholders.

Very comfy, roomy, plush, reliable, and fast. I wouldn't buy one without any service records though. It help's tremendously to have them. Repairs can be costly if you dont know the cars history. My glt is definitely my favorite of all the car's Ive owned. Also the styling on these S70's were way ahead of their time. Most people think my 98 is a much newer car. I do almost all of my own maintenance on it which keeps the cost of ownership down considerably. I'm not a certified mechanic so that should tell you they are pretty easy to work on. Plus the online Volvo community are always very helpful when I run into something I'm not familiar with during repairs. I would recommend buying a 98 model if you want a true swedish made Volvo. In 99 Ford took over Volvo and made changes to the engine management system's. They also changed them over to a wireless throttle system and a five speed auto transmission. Both were ridden with problem's making the cars unreliable. I hope this is helpful. To sum it up the 1998 S70 is a great automobile!!",5

Honda is the Sherman tank of cars beat it to death and it just laughs at you. My S70 should be paid off but the repairs have prevented that. Do yourself a favor stay away from this car.  ",3.25

Some major repairs (ABS computer, wheel hub replacement), but I am pleased with the purchase. Great turbo performance, no lag time. Body integrity very good. No complaints. This is my fourth Volvo, the previous three - except for the 1997 S80 - all have performed well.",4

This time I bought the T5 and it is the same great car with a few more options and faster.  No one can believe I purchased another 98 Volvo until they see my new S70 T5.  The seats are the most comfortable of any car I have ever owned and the car got 28.4 MPG on a trip home which I drove 70-75 MPH.  Front wheel drive for the winter and the heated seats make a great combination with a moonroof and cool A/C in the summer.  The car has a distinctive look unlike many other boring new sedans.  ,5

I gave it a full stage zero (full maintenance) and was rewarded with a very quick, reliable, handsome sweedish hotrod.  In 98, a stock T5 would outrun a mustang GT and with a few mods, would run with the cobra.  I've got a boost controller, exhaust, coilover suspension and new intercooler and this puppy FLIES. Outran an 05 mustang GT at the track. 13.71 1/4 mile.  Aside from the usual 100K repairs like tbelt, water pump, iginition and a motor mount, zero problems and avg 25 mpg. Can't beat that.  Oh and only use 91~93 octane if you have a GLT or T5.  Manual transmission is nearly indestructible.",4.625

Never had an opinion one way or the other about this brand but any 10 year old car that still gets mistaken for new is ok in my book. Very good on long trips. Like knowing that the reserve power is there when I need it. Feels solid and handles well. Dumb not to have a light in the trunk.  Gas mileage is the worst feature. Like everything about this car. I am going to keep it in good condition as I cannot think of another car that I would want to trade for.       ,4.375

Some people don't like it because they take it to a dealer to get it fixed which is a big mistake. Over the years I have learned to fix things on it and overall it's a pretty mechanic friendly car. One of the easiest oil changes I have ever done since the oil filter is forward of the pan. I am at 155,000 mi and going strong. I'm going to keep this car with me for decades more since it is safe and has a fairly timeless design. Staying ahead of maintenance is the best defense to problems. Get it checked out unless you know what to look for and you won't be suprised with killer repairs. (70k change the timing belt). They are fairly inexpensive used. Buy one!",4.125

If you're looking for a fun car to drive that you can put your kids in, this is it. It's got loads of pin you in your seat power. The down side is fuel economy (16 city/22-24 hwy). Also a very stiff ride. But I didn't buy it for a ""soft"" ride. I would and will buy more Volvos.",4.75

My car is always in the shop and has multiple electrical and computer problems (there are 7 computers in it, none of them very reliable). The engine is fairly reliable. Domestic and Japanese cars have better records. I paid about $30,000 for this car and have put in about $25,000 in repairs. So basically, my car has become a $55,000 car over 9 years. I probably should have tried another brand, but with past experience of Volvo's reputation of safety and reliability, I thought this would be good. It was a mistake. Avoid this car if you can. Or buy it cheap since it doesn't really hold value anyway.",3

This is approx. $650/year which is phenomenal.  The car has about 95K miles now and the car still runs like it is new.  I absolutely love this car and will probably keep it for another 7 years.

The joy of owning the car is constantly diminished by its time either in the shop or with something expensive wrong with it.  No wait - everything is expensive from little lights to big lights.  Surprisingly low quality leather means that a car that is 8 years old has tacky tearing on its seats.  I can't wait to get rid of this thing.

However, as soon as I floored the gas I discovered it had a misfire problem.  I tried fixing the problem myself.  I replaced all its Bosch ""super"" sparkplugs with Denso Iridium, the misfire would not go away.  I replaced the rotor and distributor cap, misfire still would not go away.  The cursed intermittent misfire in cylinder 5 occurs only when I give it the beans, otherwise it rides very well.  The leather seems to be pretty sub-par quality as do the brakes.  Be ready to give your S70 some maintenance.  Oh and my rear taillight goes out a candle in the wind.",3.75

Looks like a family sedan to the outside world but step  hard on the gas pedal and you are in for the ride of you life. Did not know Volvos were so fast.  I am surprised to find that with all the quality built in the car is missing some basic items. There is no light in the trunk. Also there is only one speed on the interval wipers, very annoying. And the cup holders are an afterthought and very flimsy. Otherwise I am very pleased with this car and do not know of any other car I would consider buying.

It is a very understated car.  It will pull away from just about any average car at a light and it does not attract attention from police being a Volvo.  It has plenty of storage room, very comfortable seats and ample room for 4 to 5 passengers.  Common issues some suspension squeaks and rattles (spring seats, swaybar links and steering stops). Possible ac performance problems due to leaking evaporator cores.   Over all the car has 140K + Miles on it and it drives very well.

I bought it 4 years ago with 80k miles on it and it just turned 160k last week.  I drive about 70 hwy miles/day.  No major repairs so far.  Incredibly reliable car.  Left it at the airport during a recent ice storm.  When I returned, it had been coated with about 4 - 6 inches of ice for a couple of days.  When I finally got into the car it started up immediately!  The bulbs were a nuisance at first, but I now just keep a few extra in my trunk (pretty cheap).  Only takes a minute to replace.  I probably change a bulb every 4 or 5 months.  Hope to get another couple years out of it, but even if I don't it has served me well.",4.5
3821, on 12/20/06 19:17 PM (PST),Dave ,1998 Volvo S70 Sedan T5 Turbo 4dr Sedan,T5 Power," I bought this car as my first car. It has 174K on the odometer. Performance- wise, once the turbo gets spooled up, you'd better hold on to something. It has the rare 5 speed manual and this car really moves. Buried the speedometer in 5th gear just after shifting from 4th and she still had more to go. The stock sport suspension is harder than the GLT, GT, or Base, and is beautiful around tight corners, but is treacherous for leisure driving. Very bumpy. The cars seats are absolutely amazing. The leather seats in my dads 04 Passat feel like hard plastic chairs compared to mine. Gas mileage could be a little better. Definitely a good car once its broken in.",4.625

My Volvo S70 is comfortable, VERY comfy to ride in and very comfortable to drive.  It is plagued with electrical problems, engine problems as well as interior quality issues such as poor quality leather that just cracks and fades like no other.

Power steering harness, ABS module, Struts, Shocks, Power radio antenna, power door locks, Power seat does not work properly. To this point the engine and transmission have been solid.

In the 8 yrs I've owned it, I've replaced the battery 4x, alternator 2x, headlights 2x, latch for hood, entire air conditioning system, front axels, shocks, power steering component, ABS sensor...all replaced.

The car served us well for the first 50k miles or so before serious reliability and fit/finish problems arose. The car's ride is solid but choppy over rough pavement.  The placement of the center console makes the driving position cramped and uncomfortable for taller drivers.  I appreciate the fact that it is a safe car but these days there are a multitude of cars on the market that are just as safe, yet less expensive and more reliable and comfortable.

Have had some problems with bulbs comming loose but not burning out. AC compressor went out right after warantee but with research through All- Data I found a recall and Volvo picked up the tab. Gets 30 MPG on highway at 70 MPH. My WEAK Lancer only gets 32. The car needs a tune up and I still blew away a Lexus on the way home tonight. Incredible power for a 5 cylinder turbo. Have heard alot about leather and bubble problems with door panels????? I dont have these problems, Maybe its the legal 35 window tint keeping some of the damaging rays out.

Service at dealership is extremly expensive. This is my last VOLVO.

The car is rugged. After 10 years, not a speck of rust.  The interior is still gorgeous and the stereo terrific. The newer models (we just bought a new XC 90) are even better and obviously more up-to-date. They pack more performance in terms of engine power, handling etc., commensurate with the competition. I still think they give you the biggest bang for the buck (not to mention any German competition by name).",5

The AWD keeps it on the road all the time and it doesn't flip/ flop turning corners as much as other SUV's. But it does a bit the tendency to go straight when turning corners, probably based on it being a primairily FWD based car. The 3.2 is a nice engine, with enough power to handle the car and a full load of passengers and luggage.

They have all been excellent cars. The gas mileage of the first three has been acceptable. I was not prepared for the disastrous mileage of my xc90. It has a T-5 engine (five cylinder). My average mileage is 12.5 miles per gallon. It is obvious to me that I cannot keep this car. The comfort, style, and performance are outstanding, but I can't afford the mileage. I have done everything to put the car in tip-top shape, even the sparkplugs which cost $25 each. The motor performs well, and is extremely smooth. My only hope is that the software can be updated to give me better mileage. And this is more of a wish than a hope. No, I didn't do 'due diligence' when I bought this car, because of the great experience of my prior Volvos.  I know I'll lose money trading, but I'll lose more money keeping this particular car. My wife and I are up in the years, and this was to be our last car; but it will be, I hope, our next to lat car. I can't wait to trade. I can get a luxury car with better mileage.

New rack and pinion, new exhaust, new struts, new springs, new tie rod ends, new radiator, new pulleys and new tires every 15K. This thing cant keep tires or brakes! The gas mileage is great, the power wonderful but everything else failed. The stereo is substandard and no one will touch it for aftermarket because of Volvos proprietary computers. The mirror trim has fallen off, the light dimmer/turn signal indicator fell off, windows get stuck. In short, this has left my wife stranded more then any vehicle she's owned.

3899, on 12/15/13 21:02 PM (PST),cjbluedevil06 ,2006 Volvo XC90 SUV 2.5T 4dr SUV (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 5A),Excellent Used Car Value ," I purchased my XC90 2.5T in March of 2013 with 74K miles. It is the third Volvo that I have owned and is by far my favorite. I traded in my 2004 S60 to buy the XC90. Many people say that the 2.5T engine is underpowered, but I feel that its 208hp feels peppy and is perfectly matched to the transmission. The handling feels confident and the seats are very comfortable. As far as cargo spaces is concerned, I am pleased.Fuel economy is decent for a vehicle of its size. I average about 17 in town and 23-24 on the highway. The cabin is quiet and the interior is composed of high quality materials. My vehicle has the optional navigation system, which is nice, but inputting information can be an annoyance.Update** It is now three years later and I will say that buying a used XC90 was a great decision.  I now have 111K miles on my XC90 and I have been impressed with the reliability of the vehicle.  I recently visited the Volvo dealership for regular scheduled maintenance (replacement of the timing belt and drive belt) and spent about $750 for that service.  When the dealership completed the maintenance inspection during the visit, they were unable to find anything that needed to be replaced or repaired. They key to buying a used Volvo is to ensure you buy it from a Volvo dealer and research the maintenance history of the vehicle. Aside from buying tires and having oil changes, the most I have spent on the vehicle has been for the timing and drive belt service. I have not had a single issue. It is my hope that I am able to put 200,000 miles on my XC90.  Once I am done with this one, I do plan on buying another XC90 or an XC60. When it comes to safety, reliability, and quality, I find it hard to beat. It is an excellent road trip vehicle and is the perfect size to accommodate passengers and cargo. I do wish the fuel economy was a little better, but I do have to keep in mind that for a 2006, it falls in the more fuel efficient range of most SUV's for that time.  As a final note, if you are looking for a used XC90 for whatever reason, it is best to stay away from the T6 (2.9 liter I-6 cylinder turbo engine) variants made from 2003-2005 and the V8 engines.  The 2.5T's (I-5 cylinder turbo engines) were discontinued in 2006 and did not suffer from the transmission issues of the T6 and V8 engines. The years 2007+ models with the 3.2 I-6 cylinder engines are also very reliable. I mentioned this in my review a three years ago, but it bears repeating since I can't stress it enough :-)",5

Each time the vehicle has been in my garage and when I went to start it, nothing.  I love this car but am so disappointed in the reliability.  I also think for a beautiful SUV such as this is, and not a big mammoth SUV, it should get much better gas mileage.  Our local dealership has been great but it has been extremely inconvenient to have our brand new Volvo die.  I love the way it drives, handles, its comfort, but if I have another problem, I'm inclined to ask Volvo Int. to take the car back.  ",4.375

Also, the T6 was a five passenger, the V8 a 7.  The V8 rides much smoother because of the self leveling rear. All in all a world class vehicle with a top IIHS safety rating. You can spend a lot more money on an SUV and I don't think you can buy a much better vehicle.  Dollar for dollar an excellent investment.  ",4.875

It's the best vehicle I've ever owned but has some small drawbacks that I can overlook. The driver seat is already starting to feel as if it is wearing on the outer bolster.  Overall it handles great for its size and does better than great on the autobahn in Germany at speed.  The 6-speed tip-tronic changes are somewhat slushy during gear changes.  I still compare it to the Touareg and LR3 that my co-workers have and I find it to be a better vehicle than theirs.  Some of the options could come down in price.  Over $3k for navigation is too much.  I bought an aftermarket system for less than $600.  But you pay quality money for a quality SUV.,4.875

I had never owned a preowned vehicle before, I always bought/leased new cars before. But when I stumbled upon this car I fell in love and was willing to take a chance.  Nine years on I am still in love with this car.  It has not been without the odd issue:- when I first had it, the driver side headlight would randomly go out. I took it to a few garages and they didn't have a clue.  I found an independent garage opened by a Volvo Certified Master Tech and he sorted it out right away (nearest Volvo dealership is over 2 hours from me)- the radio died in 2011 (it was 7 years old) but I was able to replace it with one found from a salvaged xc90 in 2012 and saved a lot of money by waiting for a salvaged radio vs. a new replacement ($80 + installation)- In 2014 (at 10 years old) we knew that there were some significant bits that needed to be replaced simply due to wear and tear - belts, water pump, blower fan was starting to go and the starter needed replacing. Thought about selling it but we had a rash of bad luck with BMWs and even a Porshe Cayman.  My XC90 was still running great and the estimate to get all of the worn out pieces replaced was far far cheaper than getting another car. We even bought some new floor mats - no one believes this car is 11 years old. It rides and looks like a much newer car. So here I am, 9 years after I bought it and still love it.  The driver's seat is getting a bit worn but the rest of the car is still in amazing shape. The fabric on the roof has a bit of a droop in a place behind the backseat light and the weatherstripping is a bit worse for wear but these are all cosmetic. Mechanically it drives as beautifully as the day I bought it.  Next year I'm probably going to look at getting a pre-owned XC60 or maybe another XC90 but I'm keeping this 2004 for my daughter.   She doesn't start driving for another few years but I have full faith that this car has many more years left. And I'll feel a lot safer with her in the XC90.*Update:Edmunds asked me to update my review; I've now owned the car ten years and I'm still happy.  All is well apart from the 6 disk CD changer; it's gone on the fritz and will only play disks inserted into slot 3.  But meh...it was an $80 replacement from a salvaged XC90. We have a Volvo iPod adapter and rarely use the CD player anyway.   I know in my old review I stated I would probably replace this car this year with a newer model but it's just not on my agenda at the moment. Maybe next year... ;)",5

Now at 133k the car is going strong with the exception of major service.  The transmission irregularities previously mentioned, while not severe, were increasing in frequency and ultimately diagnosed as a faulty speed sensor.  One of four was failing causing the issues that would eventually kill the tranny.  Correcting this, along with a number of other more minor leaks was a $5k service.  I ultimately decided to proceed despite the cost being roughly equal to the cars value because the rest of the car was in good working order.  With 3 young kids, we're tough an our cars and I was not interested in buying a new one only to have it beaten and battered by kids, crumbs and crayons.  The procedure was a total success and I'm very please to have spent the money.  I'm now expecting to drive this for another 2 -3 years and should reasonably expect to get close to 200k miles without issue.  This car is a work horse and, if treated properly performs very well.  The finishes don't withstand the test of time like other european luxury cars but it's a really just a fancy Ford after all.  Great family car.  If buying a high milage XC90 you should expect to put some money into it over the years but I think that's true of most.  I still recommend the early model XC90's from 2007 - 2010.  (Avoid 2006 - many issues).    -----------------------------This is a really great SUV.  Classic Styling, spacious and well appointed interior and just the right amount of prestige.  And then you look more closely.  I just got done telling my wife that it's been a good car for us.  10 years and 122,000 miles without any real problems.  I mean, the transmission has done mildly sporadic shifting a couple dozen time throughout owning the car but we're one of the lucky few who's transmission hasn't failed them (do lots of research on the transmissions around 2004-2007).  We've been diligent about regular scheduled service (which is not inexpensive at all) but have not had any major surprises or mechanical issues.  Still, It looks great, has a ton of conveniences and is very comfortable.In the end, it's a small taste of luxury but upon closer look it's built with lower quality parts that scratch, break or rattle more than they should.  It drives as though it's twice the size and twice the [already heavy] weight.  Pot holes are jarring and it eats through tires (AWD) and brakes faster than my 5 yr. old crushes a juice box.  Also expect bushings to go faster than smaller/lighter cars.  Still, 10 years later, my car's a little rough around the edges with dings, scratches and small tears in the leather even but it's 10 years old and has reliably seen me through a puppy and two children.  The third row is still best in class and the cargo space incredible.  I just did the 120k service which ended up costing north of $2k because I also needed brakes and tires.  I expect to put an average of $1k a year into maintenance and expect to get another 60k miles without issue.  My neighborhood is crawling with high-milage xc90s and when treated well, they still look and drive wonderfully.  Would I buy this car again?  Absolutely.  Would I expect it to age as gracefully as a Mercedes?  No.",3

The truck has been OK , but not what I expected from a $45,000 car. It has good seat comfort and driving position but it also feels a lot bigger than it actually is. The car has decent acceleration, but nothing to write home about. The best thing about the car is the brakes witch stop you on a dime! The 3.2 our car has is a little bit thirsty and doesn't give as much power as I would like. Our average mpg (mostly city driving) is around 16.5 (on road trips we've gotten up to 22).

Sure, they need to improve few things like voice command, and some applications like the AC should be easier to access without the need to touch the screen. The ride is on the stiff side but that is how I like, this is not bad or good, is just the way some people like, true can get bumpy in some particular roads, but guess what, the Audi Q7 does too (less but does).

The app includes a function that allows you to unlock the car doors remotely.  The problem is that when you get to the car you are required to open the tailgate before the doors will unlock.  This is a huge hassle if I want to send my kids out to get in the car or am carrying an armload of stuff to toss in the backseat.  Unlocking the doors using the fob isn't much better as the doors will re-lock within 2 minutes if not opened promptly.  This morning I wanted to grab my sunglasses out the car before my walk but I missed the magic 2 minute window.  So I had to go back up to my place to unlock the car again.  When I unlock my car I expect the the car to be unlocked.  I don't need Volvo to worry about my security or second guess my choices for me.   A lot is expected from a vehicle at this price point.

I contacted Volvo USA and opened a case.  It's been 3 weeks, and still nothing has happened.  I have called and emailed numerous customer service reps and managers about the issue.  They are extremely difficult to get a hold of and do not respond in a timely manner.  Their attitude is also in NO WAY customer-centric.  All I keep hearing is that everyone is very busy, that there is only 1 Field Tech in the region who can inspect the vehicle and basically I just need to wait until they are free.  I talked to 2 managers about the issue, one was more responsive but also not easy to get a hold of, and the 2nd manager's attitude was that that how it is and nothing else can be done.  He took no accountability for the poor service provided so far either.In short, if for any reason you have a warranty issue that needs to go through Volvo USA, be prepared to have a horrible customer service experience.  It has been so bad, I won't ever get a Volvo again, even though the car itself is quite nice.  Shockingly bad service for a luxury car brand.  Would give 0 stars if possible.",1

Not sure why the mileage is so bad- I even drive in economy mode often, and the car's motor shuts off every time I come to a stop light.

To be honest after have other great brands, this is by far the worst SUV I ever had, all the technology involved (for which I purchased) is really hard to take advance of it, I mean the safety features might be great but inside the car the way they felt is another history. Control Panel: Zero intuitive, very difficult to use them. With 2nd largest display in the market (after Tesla)  you really really expect to work just fine.  I consider my self a tech person and I use all the features and they are definitely not friendly, you can only use one at the time, cant mix audio with air condition for example, because there is all integrated.Voice navigation:  is by far the worst on the market, better not to have at all, 5 or 5 times is unresponsive and failed, after 2 system upgrades directly from Volvo is definitely something with the way it was designed, the only way I found to make it work is to send the address directly from the Volvo on-call app to the car directly, which never let you ask for an address directly.  FYI (I updated maps from Florida in full).Seating: Front row seating are another failure by far the hard as a rock,  and impossible to set up, basic lumbar features for a 55K SUV.Climate: Very poor in terms of vent power, and again difficult to get to the controls directly.  (Included in screen panel only)Volvo on call: This system allowed you to start your car from the phone, service is included in the 39 lease term, but you can only use 2 times per day (???)Gas Consumption: In terms of engine seems to be powerful (mine a 2.0 turbo, 4 cylinders) but consumption is very high for a small engine like that , in my case city commuter , less than 18 per gallon.Service on Dealer:  Service people very diligent and pro costumer service, I can not say the same from General Sales Manager, Carlos Sacasas (Volvo Carsf North Miami), that will treat you in the worst way, like you are not worth it as a client for them STAY AWAY!!I already have it for 200 miles enough to know that this car won’t last in my hands for the full lease term (already searching for options to change)",2
4118, on 01/09/18 09:07 AM (PST),Paul ,2018 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Inscription 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),XC90 Beats the competitors," Continued review after 10 months of ownership:   All initial comments still hold true.  Not mentioned earlier was the standard stereo system with 300 watts.  I found the system to be excellent and personally, if your not an audiophile, buying the B&W system to me would be a waste of money.  While the ride on the 21"" wheels is excellent I would opt for the air suspension system for an even more comfortable ride. 2 months ago I opted to install the Polestar ECU upgrade.  What a positive change in performance and it also seems to help with even better and smoother transmission shifts.  It was a little expensive paying $50.00 per 1 horsepower gained  (30 horsepower total) but I really enjoy the performance difference.  I don't know if it is the Polestar upgrade or breaking in of the engine but I have gained about 1 mpg on average. My next XC90 will most certainly be a T8.  I do quite a bit of driving in town and probably would never exceed the 19-20 mile electric capability and I suspect in the upcoming 2021-2022 make over Volvo will increase the KwH capacity providing for more miles between charges.I, like many other owners of Volvo's have owned other premium vehicles and most certainly cross shopped for the best value, durability and drive-ability before purchasing a Volvo.  Having owned MB, Lexus and other vehicles I have always had a Volvo in the garage.  This is my 13th and can honestly say that for all but 1 have earned my appreciation for durable vehicles.  I have driven this XC90 for 6,000 miles both in good weather and bad and an equal amount of time in town driving and on the interstate.  The following are my thoughts and pros and cons: PROS - 1) excellent drive-line (don't worry about this SUV only having a supercharged/turbocharged 4 cylinder motor.  It is equal to or better than competitors 4 cylinder and some V6 motors ).  Very strong engine with plenty of on ramp and passing power.  Fairly quite even under hard acceleration. Shifts are smooth and it is hard to tell when the transmission is shifting.  I found the car to be very well damped and smooth even though I have the optional 21 inch wheels.  2) MPG is as advertised so their were no surprises there. 3) ergonomics are in a class by themselves as Volvo has always been known for their comfortable seating and the XC 90 does not disappoint.  Anyone owning German autos will know what I'm talking about because seats in MBs and BMWs are like sitting on concrete and become uncomfortable after a couple of hours.  Audi seats are a little more forgiving but not by much.  The closest comfortable seat to a Volvo is Lexus.   All controls fall easily to hand in the XC90.  Second row seating is comfortable with the seat backs ability to recline, plenty of knee room and the foot-wells are large enough for folks wearing bulky shoes or boots.  Third row seating is easily accessed but not much room for adults.  4) Infotainment - I found the SENSUS system to be intuitive and easy to use.  Take the time to spend a couple of hours learning the system and you won't be disappointed in what is offered in the way of information, audio, wi-fi, climate control (all three sections) navi, forward and backup camera's etc.  4) Lighting -  I really enjoy the LED headlights (swiveling) and fog lights angles.  The fog lights illuminate to each side of the vehicle extremely well.  The interior lighting is fantastic and I like the ability to change the colors as well as the strength of the lights.  Back up lighting is superb. 5) Maintenance - It is great to have service covered vs paying huge maintenance fees.  I have had the car back to the service dept one time for a software upgrade but other than that the SUV has been bullet proof.  No rattles, squeaks or groans in the cabin. No problems with SENSUS.   I call the cabin the ""cone of silence"".  CONS - 1) SENSUS -  sometimes can be slow to process upon initial start up.  It can take up to 10 seconds for the software to wake up and all applications to activate.  I wish the backup camera was not part of the infotainment system.  Volvo would be wise to separate the camera from the rest of SENSUS.  A minor irritant, but one nevertheless.  2)  We like that there is wi-fi connectivity but set up through AT&T was not an easy on-line process.  I ended up spending an hour or more via phone with a AT&T representative to get connected. Not much more to report at this time.  Sounds like I'm writing an ad for Volvo with so few CONs but truly for me this SUV is a delight to drive with no bad surprises.  Most certainly the best built Volvo I have owned.  PS: Friendship Volvo, Bristol, TN is one of the best Volvo dealers I have ever dealt with both stateside and while I lived in Germany.  Matthew Ratcliffe, sales associate, is fantastic to work with and the service department is exceptional (they have serviced 4 of my other Volvos)",5

First, about the vehicle itself, one of the best 7-seater SUVs on the market.  In its class, the only competitor is Audi Q7. And to configure the Audi Q7 with similar equipment including full digital dashboard, semi-autonomous pilot assist feature, upgraded interior and sound systems, heads up display and others, the Q7 will run at least $5-8K more.  So in terms of value alone, XC90 is a more sensible selection.  I realize that even with the XC90 and in the R-Design trim that I have, it costs more than $71K out-the-door, so to some shoppers the value isn't the most important aspect of the decision making process. Then let's take a look at the various tangible advantages that XC90 offers aside from pricing.  First and foremost, the interior of the XC90 is in a class of its own.  The upgraded contour seats are just amazing.  It truly provides the best comfort in any car money can buy. Next, the center console design is fantastic with the large touchscreen interface. The only thing that can compare to it is the even larger and better panel in the Tesla Model X.  Some reviewers on youtube still prefer the button and joystick controls in the Q7 or X5, but I think it is just the matter of accepting a change.  After using the XC90 touchscreen interface for about a week, I found it very intuitive and it responds very quickly.  I don't understand some of the comments which claim that using touchscreen during driving is more distracting. The fact is, no matter which systems you use, the driver still has to scroll through numerous menus either with a mouse pad (ie: Lexus) or a i-drive type joystick (ie: Audi/BMW), and they are all distracting. I found that the touchscreen on the XC90 at least offers huge icon for most features and all you need to do is to swipe left and right between two large menus.  To me, it really cannot get any simpler after one week of getting familiarizing of the system. By contrast, I found the concept of a retractable infotainment screen in the Q7 is very out of date. A retractable screen like that has been a thing in the past since the late-2000 Cadillac CTS.   The final point about XC90 interior is the fit and finish. Every single piece of the interior materials is top notch and the simplistic Scandinavian design is great.  However, the cabin is not the most quiet for a car in this price range. It is definitely not as tranquil as the cabin of a Mercedes.   Now, the second part of the review is about the OSD program. I did it when I placed the order with Volvo. With the OSD, there is no negotiation on prices, everything is ordered per the price list. The listed prices for the car and options are only slightly, if any, lower than MSRP.  The kicker is that OSD waives the destination charge, which saves $995 automatically.  In addition to that, Volvo provides 2 round trip tickets from any where in the USA to Gothenborg, Sweden and a night of hotel for you to travel to the factory and pick up your own car.  You may drive your own car through Europe up to 6 months and Volvo even covers the cost of your insurance up for 15 days.  And when you're done with the self-driving tour, you return the car to one of the designated locations and they will ship the car to your local dealership in the USA with no additional shipping charge.  So buying a car and getting a free trip to Sweden, why not?  I particular like this shopping experience because there is no haggling. I know what I am going to order and how much I'm going to pay exactly.  I get to tour the Volvo factory and drive my own car to see a part of Europe where I don't visit very often.  Such a great way to buy a car.",5

On the way, the bike rack fell and I pulled over to find that the body panel had RIPPED! (Yes, ripped). Turns out it is plastic - not metal. I looked at the manual to see if it tells you that you cannot use a trunk mount bike rack. Not only does it not say that you can't use a bike rack, it actually warns you that a trunk mount bike rack may interfere with the rear view back-up camera. Volvo has flatly refused to do anything about the damage and the dealer has given me the name of a bodyshop who apparently does a lot of work on Volvos.  I have also noticed that the quality of the paint or gelcoat is very poor. The electronics are constantly malfunctioning. They replaced my entire ""module"" (electronic dash panel?) within 5000 miles. I had to take it back again for more malfunctioning electronics. My friend has the same car and the same electronics problems. The rear seats stick and sometimes the kids cant move it to access the third row.",3

Very happy with purchase after 2,200 miles and 8 weeks. Wrestled with decision - final competitor was the Q-7. Volvo won my business based upon the features offered, safety rating, outstanding active bending LED high beam headlights and PRICE! Q-7 was/is a fantastic vehicle - but feature for feature the Q-7 is just more expensive and I couldn't justify the additional cost of $3,000 to $5,000. On top of this good pricing we got an additional $3,000 Conquest Award due to owning a Mercedes Benz! I liked that the Volvo has a spare tire in it vs. run flats on the Q-7. The park assist on the Volvo (parallel & perpendicular) is something that Audi didn't offer. Huge sunroof in the Volvo came in the Momentum but was an upcharge in the Q-7. Styling (inside and out) of the XC90 is very striking (in a positive way). Decent base sound system. Seats - very comfortable ... and I like the seating position as well ... good visibility. 2nd row seating is generous and comfortable with plenty of room for big feet. The 3rd row is handy - certainly not something for full-size adults for anything longer than a local trip - but reasonably comfortable for smaller adults and the younger generation. Good overall cargo capacity. Comes with roof rack too. The trailer hitch is cleverly concealed to give the rear of the vehicle a nice finished look. We have the 21"" wheels with Pirelli tires - and while the ride is no doubt a little stiffer - I don't find it objectionable - I like the looks of the larger wheel.   The 4 cylinder definitely has 6 cylinder performance - and inside the vehicle it also sounds like a 6 to me - not sure if Volvo has intervened to make the engine sound more robust when inside the cabin. Outside it sounds like a 4. My wife was able to lock her key in the car - something that shouldn't be able to occur. You'll need to devote some time to read the manual to learn all features of the electronics and safely features - but it's well worth the time spent. Needs more USB ports. Could use a sunglass holder in the overhead area. Only time will tell regarding quality.  Overall both my wife and I are pleased with the XC90. I never thought I'd consider a Volvo - but trying to be objective I drove 8 to 10 different mid-sized SUV's including the XC90 - and I was impressed. MPG has been slowly improving.",5
4126, on 09/02/17 13:48 PM (PDT),Dave ,2018 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Momentum 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),First time Volvo owner.," Full disclosure, I've only owned my 2018 XC90 Denim Blue Momentum for less than a week, so I can not speak to long term durability issues. So far so good, but fingers crossed. My initial reaction as a former diehard Grand Cherokee owner (5 in a row) is that a I am very happy with my purchase. The looks of the XC90 really caught my eye, but the interior quality sealed the deal for me. I had reservations about the 4 cylinder, but a test drive alleviated my concerns that it would b sufficient for th size. While it is by no means going to be mistaken for an 8 cylinder, I am impressed by the 316hp output especially at highway speeds and would describe the output as a solid v6 caliber. My Summer daily driver is a Z06 Corvette so, the road noise, and ride comfort are fine for my tastes. I sincerely wrestled with the idea of owning a Volvo, but the exterior looks and interior quality rival other luxury SUVs going for 10's of thousands more. I wanted a car with better fit and finish, more 2nd row legroom, roof rack and the third row was a bonus. I looked at the Cayenne and Q7. Performance wise, the XC90 is subpar, but for the money I could not beat everything this had to offer. The dash tech is fantastic and I'm just starting to get to know the lane assist, adaptive cruise, and pilot assist features, and they are impressive. While the 316hp output is impressive, the 4 cylinder is a bit ""tinny"" sounding...with an almost Diesel engine exhaust note. The base suspension is a tad rough, and the cockpit is not what I would call quiet. Road and engine noise does come through. Again, with all that I'm very pleased in large part to the deal I got. I had the benefit of getting $2500 Volvo ""conquest"" cash and $750 from Costco, on top of an insanely good trade in value on my Jeep (month end, slow night). I parted with a v8, adjustable ride height, quieter cockpit and I'd argue smoother ride, but gained increased driver / passenger space, better interior quality, stunning exterior, smooth tech interface, 4 years of VolvoOncall (Onstar like), increased safety features and amenities. I'm looking forward to a road trip to get to know it a little better. The only complaints I have trouble justifying at this price point is no cooled seats and no where to put your sunglasses...other than in the armrest. But far from deal breakers.",4

Mileage around town hovers around 78 MPG with electric gas combined. On long freeway trips this drops to 35. Incredible for a vehicle of this size. The electric only range is about 18 miles. I would like to see this increased in future models. The interior is very comfortable and the exterior is gorgeous. I had one significant reliability problem with the car battery draining after two weeks of no use. Eventually the dealer found the current leak which fixed the problem. I really like the safety features such as the lane control and the automatic break activation system.This car is expensive but worth it.,5
4128, on 06/08/18 08:26 AM (PDT),HLynn ,2018 Volvo XC90 Hybrid T8 Inscription Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger gas/electric hybrid 8A),Not reliable for the price tag," I purchased the 2018 XC90 T8 Inscription in August 2017 with most of the bells and whistles minus the upgraded sound system.  I chose the hybrid mainly because of the added acceleration and the ride of the car with the air suspension package. I get on average 27mpg but have gotten as high as 40mpg in town. It would probably average in the 30mpg range if I remembered to plug it in every night. We don't travel in this vehicle and I normally put less than 10,000 miles a year on my cars.  I have been pleased with the interior.  It is luxurious and I find the seats to be very comfortable.  I like the simple and elegant design without all of the buttons and dials. My biggest disappointment with this vehicle has been the reliability.  My first incident occurred within a few months of purchase.  I got a Reduced Engine Power light as I was backing out of the garage to take my son to the Dr. which was less than a mile from my house.  As I did not need to accelerate over 35mph I decided to risk driving it which was, admittedly, a mistake.  As I was pulling out to cross 2 lanes of traffic the car just stopped and went into what is known as ""limp mode"".  Google this and read what other people have experienced.  It is very distressing to me that a car can just lose power and stop while you are driving because of what I was later told was a software issue.  I had to have it towed on a flatbed and the dealer kept it for about 4 days.  They updated the software and told me the issue should be resolved.  My next issue occurred last Friday. I was out to dinner and when I got in the car to drive home I got a light that said Hybrid System Failure-Service Required with an engine light on.  My husband chose to drive the car home but, once again, I had to have it towed to the dealership on a flatbed the next morning.  The car has just under 7,000 miles.  It was in the shop M-Th.  The dealership again reloaded some software which fixes the issue 60% of the time ""per Volvo"".  Volvo requires the dealership to try this first. If I continue to have problems in the future they will probably have to replace the IGM module.  As a side note, in both instances the dealership was unable to offer me a loaner and both times they had my vehicle for 4 week days.  The irony hit me as both times the car was being driven away on a flatbed my husband said to me, ""That sure is a beautiful car.""  I thought to myself, ""Yes, it is beautiful when it runs."".  For $75,000+, there are other beautiful and more reliable cars.",3

It was glued to a piece of metal. The sound system speakers rattle. The dealers do not honor the warranty. I sent emails to corporate in NJ. No one answers back. I am a disabled Veteran who needs a stable suspension. My xc90 hybrid has air suspension. I do not think it works half the time. The transmission slips. When I cut the auto off the motor fan makes a loud sound as if I was pushing on the gas in neutral. I hate I had to spend so much money through military sales to buy the auto. A lot of the components are plastic. The dealer replaced a plastic vent cover. Looks like something you get from Walmart.

What is under the hood is another story.  It is riddled with repair issues.  I have already owned two of them because Volvo bought back my first one. My 2016 R-Design version had the check engine light on when I purchased it.  This recurred several more times and it took several more visits to the service shop to repair.  Then, my sun roof had a major leak, which I discovered after my free shower from the Costco car wash.  I had multiple issues with my temperature control systems and some repair on the fuel system, all requiring repairs.  Each repair, always took a minimum of 2 days (and those were rare). Most repairs took 5 business days, so I didn't have use of my car for well over 30 days. It only had 15,000 miles when they bought it back.  There were two issues they couldn't figure.  The seats would squeak when going over a small bump in the road (it sounded like nails on a chalkboard).  I had major issues pumping gas.  At certain gas stations, the pump would keep clicking off, so I couldn't tell how much gas was in the car.  One time, it wouldn't allow me to pump gas at all. It just kept clicking off.  I really liked the features of the car, so after Volvo bought back the 2016 I purchased two model years later, the 2018 XC90 T8 Inscription (also a plug-in hybrid).  I have owned it several months and at 3,400 miles my check engine light came on.  It has BEEN IN THE SHOP ONE WEEK SO FAR!  The thermostat needs replacing (please note the temperature control system issues on my 2016; shame on Volvo for not fixing this huge engine design flaw!).  The only trouble is the part is back-ordered!!!  The estimate for the part being available for purchase it another week and then about 8 days after that they should have it in the shop.  This REPAIR ESTIMATE ON MY BRAND NEW VEHICLE IS A MINIMUM OF 2 WEEKS, MORE LIKE 3 WEEKS IF I'M LUCKY.   As for the gas pumping issue...  It seems to have improved some with the newer XC90, but it IS STILL AN ISSUE VOLVO!  Furthermore, my seats are starting to squeak too! IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BETA TEST A LUXURY SUV AND PAY FULL PRICE, THEN THIS IS THE SUV FOR YOU.  If you have a life and don't have time to spend bringing your vehicle to the dealership, then I suggest buying from a different brand.",2
4131, on 01/08/18 08:42 AM (PST),Ryan Taylor ,2018 Volvo XC90 Hybrid T8 Inscription Twin Engine Plug-In Hybrid 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger gas/electric hybrid 8A),Unexpectedly Exceptional," The luxury options on this vehicle place it among the top auto manufacturers. The interior design, and every element, has been so thoughtfully crafted around the driver, it is hard to believe that more people have not discovered Volvo. They really have stepped up to win with this one. The quality of materials would be on par with Bentley! I love the mix of leather, wood (with a matte finish), chrome dressings, all highlited with LED accents. Although the shiny black plastic area tend to collect fingerprints easily, which is why they supply a cleaning cloth (which you will use often). The seats are incredibly comfortable, with heat, cooling and a massage option that you will wonder how you ever lived without! Even the second row seats recline and are super comfy. The built-in child booster seat is convenient for when you have family or guests. The $3200 Bowers & Wilkins audio system is like being in a live concert, where, when you turn up the volume, you hear every detail in crisp clarity without it hurting your ears. If you love music, this could alone be reason enough to buy this SUV. I chose the hybrid option, which when you lease, you save the $5k California Rebate off the purchase price (as opposed to getting a tax credit when you purchase). I love that I can plug it in and get 15-18 miles of gas-free driving. It adds extra power that makes this 6600lb car move very fast. I also love that it drives completely silent on the Pure or hybrid mode. To me, this was worth the additional price. The instrument display is great and the main 9” Sensus central display is so easy to use and again, really thought through. It is so sensible and user friendly, I am very impressed. Apple CarPlay works great, as does the Bluetooth option. The XM radio is amazing and it has a Spotify app that uses the AT&T modem, if you sign up for data service. I’m using the trial and have had a few issues with it buffering, as there is no option to download a playlist, like you can on a phone. I think that I will probably just use my iPhone with Spotify instead of paying for another device ($10/20 per mo). One last note, the safety features are the best available. I love the auto steering that helps you stay in your lane during normal everyday driving. It watches the road lines and applies corrective steering automatically if you start to drift. The heads up display is great too. It gives you a warning if you are driving too close, or if it senses a forward collision (which It sometimes falsely does on curvy roads). It displays the current speed limit and warns you if you drive faster (you can adjust the warning speed too). These features help you to be a better driver. Overall I’m so impressed and happy with my purchase. I sold my Porsche 911s to buy this vehicle and I would never go back! I also, love that there are not tons of these cars on the road and when friends hear I bought a Volvo, they don’t have any idea how amazing it is. Everyone already knows that Volvos are the safest cars in the world, they just don’t expect them to be this exceptional.",5

We selected this car to be our family friendly car when we have visitors and when we go on a road trip. We replaced our Mercedes R530 with tis car. The R530 has a fantastic 3rd row seat that can fit adults (yes adults) in the 3rd row comfortably. So we wanted another SUV with third row that could eat adults. The Volvo XC90 came closest in this regard. The third row can seat adults not as comfortably as R530 but is not as tight as any other SUV with the 3rd row.  I have always owned BMW and Mercedes cars and I am very impressed with interior quality of this car. So I am not sure what the other reviewer is talking about a bad interior quality. We got the Denim Blue with Brown interior and we already got so many complement that how sharp everything looks. Also, regarding the instrument panel and center touch screen controls, I find it very intuitive for me and well organized. I do not have any issue with safety in using it because I have already configured all the settings and do not need to fiddle with them while driving. All the users complaining about the screen is because they try to fiddle with it while driving. So I attribute it to bad driver behavior.  So far, I love the car and it has meet all of my intial expectations.  I will try to update this review after few more months.",4

Wonderful interior, nice exterior styling. The electronics and safety are impressive. But... whoever designed and engineered the drive train was misguided. The 14 mile all-electric range is a joke. 8 miles at best. The gasoline powered range is laughable. 13 gallons fuel capacity. The T8 is really a front wheel drive vehicle with an electric rear wheel drive assist. I cannot imagine what the range would be if you were towing a boat or had something mounted on the roof. It is probably well suited for someone who lives in the city, drives the kids to school and goes to the market. With the short electric range, you will find the gas engine is virtually always needed and thus you are just hauling around an extra 500 lbs. of spent batteries. But with a full charge, this vehicle is fast from a standstill. Only two negatives about the rest of the car: The front armrests are too short for tall drivers and the ride with the optional wheels and tires is a bit rough, even with the air suspension. Positives are many, but this is a very expensive vehicle once you start adding options. Many dealers are selling them at or below invoice. The extra $5002 in tax credit would be appreciated, but the T6 is a much better value. BTW. I am probably getting another X5 diesel.",3

I live in Kansas and drive mostly on highways so after learning to use them I really enjoy all the safety features. I have driven it for 8-10 hours at a time and can relax and am not tired at the end of the day. It’s a cruise vehicle. I can carry my children and grandchildren in the car and feel safe and comfortable. I average 23 mpg. My only complaint is the fuel system which does not have a cap thus have had problems with vapor leaks causing check engine lights (I blame government EPA regs). If you want a performance machine it’s probably not for you but if you want a safe cruiser and learn to use the systems it’s great. ",4

It’s now only 6 mo old. Yes, I’m writing a negative review because of my experience with this suv. But buyer should beware: this suv is not assembled and designed to the standards of the other luxury car I own (BMW X5 50i). Even our 2015 highlander was better put together. Yes, this is a beautiful car. And at first glance the inside is also nice. Here are the problems I’ve had 1) leather seats separate from the foam and crease 2) rattling from base from the stereo 3) second row seat siding mechanism broke with routine use!!! 4) infotainment system is slow and frankly it sucks not having jobs or buttons for quick functions 5) headliner was loose upon purchase and made an annoying chirping sound.  how about what’s not broken? 4 cylinder is loud, annoyingly loud. Ride is firm without the air suspension (only option I don’t have). Steering is great, better than my BMW and it feels good in the corners. It drivers like a European car. Safety is obviously Volvo’s strong point. Automatic breaking already saved me once. Fortunately I can’t vouch for all the features working in the background. This is an amazing looking car. The inside looks nice till you look up close.  It’s a great car to LOOK at but for the cost (north of $65,000 with the option I have) it just doesn’t stack up to my BMW in build quality. I’m really considering taking a loss and selling this thing. Afraid to see what happens at 1 year.",3
4136, on 04/11/18 11:26 AM (PDT),Anthony ,2017 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Momentum 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),A Worthy SUV," I will start off by saying that I am a huge Volvo fan.  So when it came time to buy my new XC90 (T6 Momentum Plus), there wasn't much that was going to keep me from getting it.  Although, when I saw some of the reviews on here about software issues along with other ""nightmares"" resulting from new technology and bugs that weren't worked out.. I was a little apprehensive.  I decided to put my concerns to the side and take advantage of the year end close out deals and buy one.  I've been in the car for about 6 months now and have taken it all over Colorado and have been able to try it out in pretty much every driving scenario: traffic jams, countryside driving, mountain driving, rain, snow, icy conditions, etc.  After all of that I do have to say this car has been pretty much perfect.  My personal opinion is that other reviews about ""nightmares"" are not only exaggerated, but blown completely out of proportion.  This car's technology centers around safety, so if you're going to weave all over the road, drive it like a sports car, follow people too closely, or in other words drive like a moron.. this car is going to fight you (unless you disable the various safety systems) every step of the way.  I have slightly modified my driving style and find that all the technologies work as promised without any issues.  My first week of having the car I did have the auto brake engage when I was speeding up and getting too close to a car to change lanes but it didn't screech to a halt or anything like that.  It simply beeped at me and softly started to slow me down to avoid what it thought was an imminent crash.  It took me about a month to ""learn"" the car and adapt my driving accordingly.  Since that time everything has been smooth.  There are certain things that annoy me about the car that I do hope Volvo changes in the future, but they are minor issues.  For example, I love using the 360 degree camera as well as the parking features, but because I live in a busy city I don't have the time to stop in the middle of the road and swipe through 2-3 screens to select the feature i'm trying to use.  I wish they would add some shortcut buttons on the dash so I can quickly turn my 360 camera on/off or select a specific feature without having to swipe through a couple of menus first.  That part definitely gets old, but my overall enjoyment of the car as a whole outweighs those frustrations immensely.  It is extremely comfortable to drive, ride in, and it's a real head-turner to look at.  The gas mileage isn't bad, but I pretty much always keep the car in ECO mode unless i'm driving up into the mountains in which case I use Dynamic mode, and that makes the drive a real thrill.  I average between 19.5 and 21 MPG on a tank, and that is a mix of both city and highway driving.  When i'm going long distance on the interstate I average 23-26 MPG.  I do wish the fuel tank was a little larger, only getting 300 miles out of a tank before the gas light comes on means I have to get gas every single week.  Some of the other competing SUV's can get 400-600 miles out of a tank.",4

My wife does not drive it very much as she uses a vanpool to get to work. We did not spend much time exploring this cars features. We did realize after nine months that the car actually had a coin holder :( and that the door to the coin holder was stuck. Took it to the dealer Momentum Jaguar Volvo in Houston where I bought it from and explained the issue. They kept the car for a day and said they had to order a part to fix it and told me it will be a warranty repair. Next day they call me to tell me that it won't be covered by warranty because the door was stuck because of a spill. I explained it to them that we had not used the car very much and that's the way the coin holder was until we realized it was a coin holder. If they left it at that I would have gladly taken the car back. They took out the center console and wanted $400 install it back. When I looked at the disassembled center console I did see some spill on to the sides of the console but nothing actually in the coin holder door mechanism. It looked like the dealer wanted to just charge me $690 to replace the coin holder because volvo does not reimburse them that much if it was done under warranty. They even called volvo customer care and made sure I cannot preemptively talk to them and have it replaced under warranty. I even purchased an extended warranty through volvo for this car. And all volvo and the dealer wanted to do was cut corners by claiming the damage was caused by the spill when actually there was no water damage to the coin holder itself. They won't admit that it was defective to start with. All this for replacing a $90 coin holder. I would recommend people looking into buying this car to make sure what kind of service the dealer will provide after the purchase. Reade reviews about the dealer service department before purchasing, because most of the headache with volvo cars is dealing with dishonest dealers service department. Your warranty is as good as nothing because it is the service advisors discretion in deciding if they want to do it under warranty. They will cook up some reason to not repair even warrantable items because they can charge the customer more than what Volvo would reimburse them.",2

Unfortunately, the Chinese influence has taken over. Too much cost cutting in poor quality materials. In the past the quality of steel used in Volvo's were second to none. Today, can not say the same. Ride is comfortable, yet quality better in other equivalents. Hopefully, once they begin assemble in Charleston SC, overall quality will improve to compete against BMW. Not yet there. However, in this case looks are deceiving. As for performance, a gas guzzler for the size and type. Do not waste your money or patiently wait.",1

After owning the huge Mercedes GL, we decided on something a wee bit smaller but just as practical.  The two contenders ended up being the new Volvo XC90 and the Audi Q7. We had an Audi Allroad which we loved to drive, but the back seat was becoming far two cramped for our nearly teenage son. We found the same to be true about the Audi Q7, as big as the car was, there wasn't a lot of leg room in the backseats.  The Volvo XC90 had far more leg room in the backseats and was more comfortable to drive in for long distances. (SF to SD is 10 long hours.) And the third row was much more comfortable, according to our preteen. My hubby calls is it the perfect mom car, he drives an BMW X5 for reference, compared to his car I love the smooth comfortable ride and acceleration.  The seats are comfortable to be in for long hours of driving and I don't feel like I need to see the chiropractor after going over continuous speed bumps or bumpy surfaces.  He does find the find the contoured seats a bit confining at 6'4"" with a bit a girth on the sides and it did limit us to getting the R version which I really liked.  The only downfall is that our XC90 has spent a crazy amount of time in the shop. Not purely sure that is the cars fault though, as our garage gives a loaner, and sometimes I think it is just easier for them to get through the amount of work they need to get done on cars if they keep our Volvo a few more days. My husband does call me the Beta tester though. So far we have had our supercharger malfunction, which is always fun at toll booths that are slow down but please don't stop and accelerate like made when done.  Our battery went before a year, if your car starts doing really crazy things it might be time for a new battery. And our USB port stopped working, not good when you have preteens. But overall,  we have been really satisfied with the car. The only major complaint we have is that the back row is not electric, so it requires a bit of work to navigate the seats, including the middle row. We don't move the middle row around enough to remember exactly the sequence we need to work in to facilitate the seat doing exactly what we want.  It tends to get stuck in sometimes crazy positions. At the end of the day, I have been really happy with our Volvo XC90.",4

DO NOT buy a new model year Volvo XC90. Our first 2016 XC90 was in the shop more than we drove it. Volvo ended up buying it back from us. The problems are too many to list, but range from dashboard and info screens going dark (while driving), auto park feature wanting to engage when stopped at a stop light, exhaust noises during acceleration, AC not working properly from time to time, the $2,600 B&W sound system who's speaker grills rattle more than anyone should tolerate and driver profile settings not working/syncing with the key fobs, acceleration is jerky and anything but smooth (we have the Polestar performance chip installed) and various infotainment glitches.Now the kicker, Volvo wanted to keep us ""in the family"" and worked a deal to get us a new 2017. LOL, this one has the same issues and has been in the shop 5 more times, with one of those service appts lasting 4 weeks. Also, it gets terrible gas mileage (15 mpg city-20 mpg hwy) and the ride is so stiff it’s worse than driving my BMW with the sports suspension pkg. You feel EVERY bump and crack and not in a good way.  The whole driving experience is like a twitchy, nervous gazelle before a lion feeding frenzy.Don’t believe all the reviews that paint a glorious picture after driving this SUV for a few hours. The designers, engineers and Volvo management should be ashamed of the car they approved and builtI wish we would have walked away after the first one was returned.  Now I see why the original Volvo company went bankrupt.Never Again",1

You know how some cars are better than the sum of its individual parts (VW GTI, for instance)?  This car has all the right parts, but, the vehicle made me feel like a beta tester - the computer which controls everything is too slooooooow - a trip for service had the software updated, but the computer got slower, not faster.  Too much intervention with touch screen required to perform the simplest functions, and it is slow to react.  The sensors go off randomly which flabbergasted me with trying to get them to just shut up!  The rear seat belts constantly rattle against hard plastic, which drove me crazy, too.  The dealership experience is not up to the standards of its peers, either.  The design of the car is beautiful, but it just needs more refinement to be competitive.  It is my fault I did not pay enough attention to the suspension during my test drive - my other car is a Ford Mustang, which has a much smoother ride experience.  Either pay for the upgraded suspension, or know it will try to beat you to death with the standard suspension.  I had such high hopes and am disappointed the car failed to meet my expectations.",2
4147, on 08/07/17 13:54 PM (PDT),bigmountain ,2017 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Momentum 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),Reserved Judgement," We bought this car in February after multiple generations of 4 different luxury SUV's my wife and I were tired of 'feeding the pig' at the gas pump. We travel probably 18 weekends a year so gas mileage is important to us, but so is capability for off-road and snow performance. We researched this purchase at length. This car is beyond innovative. The interior and exterior design feels like a $100,000 car, not a 60k car.  Where this car shines: fuel economy, handling, long trips (the pilot assist feature is addicting), interior functionality, comfort, the Dynamic and Off Road driving modes are incredibly helpful when called upon. Where this car isnt great: ride, the ride is very busy and a little harsh which exposes some 'typical European car rattles' and will expose every Lego stuffed in a cupholder. This is a trade off to consider if you like the confidence of the handling on a backroad. The technology can be a little invasive at times when you are just out running errands, so you have to be willing to learn about it and use it properly or it will drive you mad. The only major complaint that I have with the car is the auto-stop-start feature which is way too overzealous to cut the engine off when you are at a quick 4-way stop or pausing to let someone pull out of a parking space. I am optimistic the software engineers will release a patch for this soon (hint-hint).",5

The collision avoidance system is defective and brakes the car for no reason. Every time it happened I was driving on a highway and it's a miracle that I didn't get rear ended. Volvo was completely unhelpful in figuring out what was wrong. My car was in the service department for 60 out of the first 100 days that I owned it. Volvo kept telling me that they couldn't recreate the problem so there was nothing they could do. The service department at Volvo of White Plains was beyond unhelpful. They were flat out rude and dismissive of my concerns.  After several months of this problem, I went on the NHTSA website and found that several other people have reported the same problem. I then had to file the vehicle as a lemon under my state lemon laws. Volvo eventually repurchased the vehicle. This was the worst experience that I've ever had with a manufacturer. They never once took me seriously even though the car had a major safety problem and several other people have had the same complaint. I bought this car because I thought Volvo made the safest cars. I made a big mistake. Think twice before you buy this car.",1

I really expected it to be all I wanted in a SUV, stylish, comfortable, technologically advanced, with a semi-auto pilot function and reliable. All my expectations were and still not fulfilled. The car manifested noise level higher than normal since the beginning. Noise from the outside plus a cabin not soundproofed like competitors. The electronics promised wonders but delivered nightmares. The car main and driver screens continuously black out and takes forever to reboot. Once you start the car it takes longer than usual for the system to load, you cannot even engage the reverse right away and expect to see the camera: you have to waaiiiiiit. And the service says that is normal. Absurd. the semi autonomous driving is no better than the rest of the car. If and when it engages you might expect it to stop working without any warning. The handling and engine are up to par with the rest of the car: rubbish! I do not want this to get too long, so I will just conclude saying that the customer service is useless as the car itself.

Our old XC 90 (2013) was totaled while parked and we jumped into the new model expecting more if what we had loved about Volvo for the last 20 years- We were wrong!

I looked at the Audi Q7, Jag F Pace, and Jeep Grand Cherokee. Lexus don't like the look. BWM, Range Rover, and Benz are not client friendly. I have had 2 X5's and a Super Charged Range Rover (the big boy) so I have driven them extensively. Volvo really out did themselves with the XC 90. The car is super quiet, has a nice ride, the 4 cylinder engine is surprisingly good, and the XC is loaded with technology. Mine has the stock sound system, which frankly is excellent, I wouldn't blow the $2,600 on the upgrade unless you really are a hardcore audiophile. The HUD option, which I would not have ordered, was in the stock vehicle they had, it is okay, but you can't see it with polarized sunglasses! So that seems stupid to me. The self drive mode cool, but likely won't use much, the lane departure nudging constantly is a bit of an annoyance, but I will give it time to get used to. Headlights are insanely bright. The Ipadish controls are a nice clean look, easy to use, and overall seems like a nice option compared to say the Audi's control system and their ridicules pop up screen.

I have been searching for a replacement for my Honda Odyssey for a while. I have compared Acura MDX, Audi Q7, Mercedes  GLE, and BMW X5. Eventually, I decided to have the XC90 and have to say that it has exceeded my expectation so far. Initially, I was thinking to buy a MDX given I have had a Honda before and for the value. However, I think the interior of the MDX is not as luxurious as one would expect and with all the options, it is not that ""value"" anymore, so to speak. Sometimes, people may have experienced ""buyer's remorse"" wishing you have bought a different car. It never occurred to me. As I said earlier, my kids love riding in this car and I feel good driving the car. The security features are excellent and are one of the main reasons I chose this car. The technology is super and the touch screen central display is very good, simple, clean, and works. One may need take time to learn how it works, just like using ipad or iphone. My car also comes with the ""red"" key which is nice if you have younger ones driving the car (additional safety features like limiting the driving speed). The only thing it took a little bit more time to make it work is the ""Homelink"" button for garage door opener. The instruction comes with the car doesn't help much. I went to the ""Homelink"" website and downloaded the instruction for this specific car. It worked on my first try. I wish it had come with the car a separate sheet/instruction on how to program the ""Homelink"" button given this would probably the first thing people would do once they drive the car home.

It requires eyes off road to scroll through the dozens of options; the driver mode default selection does not work, it always starts in Comfort even if you choose Eco or Dynamic (I saw this complaint in a review from 2016 model) and in order to switch between the modes you have to find the roller ball by the gear shift and turn it just right; should have a button or voice command to switch 'cause when you're getting on a highway and need Dynamic the last thing you want to do is fish for it.  Finally learned that you can control climate with voice commands so that's really cool and helpful b/c again eyes off road to change fan setting or temp.  A few times I turned fan up at start and it didn't catch, wondering what that's about.  Totally don't understand the auto climate feature.  And the navigation is terrible.  My former XC70's nav was amazing but this one asks for Street Number, Street and City in one command and then can't understand what you say and gives a crazy place back.   Should ask for each one individually like the XC70 did.   I am hoping all the technical stuff in the car lasts and no glitches develop with software.

They list functions in the manual that just flat out are not there nor are available.  Seems somewhat dishonest to me.  For example, Volvo lists how to use the egress / ingress function for getting out of the SUV and into the SUV.  However, when I contacted Volvo, they said this function is not available, never has been and maybe under development as a future software upgrade.  Not sure how they can put the option in print when they don't even have it developed.  Second example is the manual shows a 110v outlet in the center console for passengers in the 2nd row to plug in devices.   However, that was only available in their 2016 model, again, according to the email I got from Volvo.  However, the manual is titled ""2017 XC90"".  I have found two other functions that are not available in the XC90 US model but available in Canada.   One would think they would have defined that better up front.  Thus, owners beware, Volvo isn't totally honest in what is / is not available in the 2017 T6 in the US.  As for the car itself.  I didn't get the 4 corner suspension (I ordered it but for some reason (either dealer or Volvo error) it didn't come with it.  However, the ride is comfortable and about the same as in our 2011 Chrysler Town and Country.   Gas mileage is ok, I'm averaging around 22 mostly in town.  Best gas mileage is in cursing mode.  It really sucks the gas when taking off and probably is where it falls short a little.  Does have some great safety features but also falls short.  For example, the lane assist where it is to alert you if you drift to far left or right, is not reliable.  There are times when it should have alerted but easily let me cross the center line either having no notification or late in notifying me.  Hence a head-on-collision would have already taken place.  My 2014 GMC 1500 truck has the same feature and works perfectly all the time.  Not sure why a $75,000 vehicle doesn't have the same accuracy.  Pilot assist works as designed. As long as the lane markings can be identified, it does auto steer the car up to 80 mph.  You do have to interact with the steering wheel every 30 -45 secs however or it will auto disengage.  The scary part is that there are times when the system, apparently, looses the ability to see the lane markings and just disengages without any warning to the driver.  I would think, again, for this high end vehicle, it should alarm if the system is disengaging.    Thank goodness I have not had to test the auto braking if a car turns in front or to avoid a rear end collision.  I'm assuming it will work when required.  The active cruise adapter works well and you can set the distance (actually set the secs) within which you want the car to adjust the speed based on the car in front.  The seats are very comfortable but getting in and out of the vehicle is difficult unless you retract and lower the seat.  I'm 5' 10"" and if I don't lower the seat all the way done, I will hit my head getting out.  Climate controls work well as do the ventilated / heated seats.  2nd row seating is about as comfortable as in other vehicles.  3rd row quite frankly is limited to children.  Very difficult for adults to get in and out of the back.  Not adult friendly.  As with reviews of the 2016 model the lack of USB ports is a glaring deficiency in a high vehicle in this price group.  Overall, I'm happy with the vehicle but would I buy it again, I don't know.  I would look closer at the new 2017 Mercedes I think.",4

It looks, rides and performs (when it works) beautifully.   However, mine has been wrought with electrical/computer problems from the get/go.   It routinely spits out warning lights on various systems from ESC, engine, 12 volt system.   It has been in for repair (i.e not routine mtce) in one year more than my 2006 Mazda has been in its lifetime.   I am in my 60's and have owned many vehicles and this one has generated more warning lights in its short life than ALL my other vehicles combined.  Half the time software update is used by the dealer as the solution to my problems.   They almost never know what the update is supposed to solve.   My navigation system broke down on a cross country trip and required the dealer to reboot it.   Even my Tom Tom can be rebooted manually by me.   Finally replaced the module for the electric motor that drives the rear wheels claiming it was dragging down my 12 volt system and causing all these spurious computer generated warning lights.   The car worked fine for a couple of months and then one day it was completely dead (12 Volt) wouldn't even unlock the car.   Dealer claimed my less one year old 12 volt battery was faulty.   It was replaced.   So today 3 months later a  new warning light ""12 volt system service required"" has illuminated.   My issues electrically/computer are clearly still unresolved.   I cannot recommend this vehicle for its poor reliability.Update August 2018.Recently my car has performed well.   The issues with the 12 volt system while not resolved are now manageable.   I have multiple vehicles and I am retired.   I have discovered that this vehicle cannot sit for extended periods of time (a week?), or the 12 volt battery will drain.   The car will either be completely dead or the 12 volt system drained to the point of bringing in computer generated erroneous fault alarms.   This drain is due to the continuous high drain from the on board computer even when  the car is not running.   I can prevent this by ensuring the car is taken for a run every few days.   I have also purchased a jump starter just in case.",4

But this isn’t for those who don’t like technology or struggle to stay centered in the lane - this is made for those who love technology, like safety and design and are proud to drive something a little different.  The infotainment system does have a delay when it starts - it takes about 10 seconds.  The ride isn’t as plush as a 60’s Cadillac - I wouldn’t recommend springing for the 22” wheels - the 20’s will ride better (but don’t look as snazzy).  The 2.0 liter engine has almost 44 bars of pressurized air from the turbo and supercharger (that is a lot of boost) and per liter is more powerful than the Audi RS7 - in a family SUV.  With all that boost the engine has plenty of power - but isn’t as smooth as your regular non boosted v6 engine that dominates this segment of SUVs.  No, this is an SUV made for someone who enjoys driving, having an experience and can understand that some character is what makes a Volvo unique.  If you want a Toyota Highlander or Ford Explorer - go get one.  If you want a cool German SUV - get one of those.  If your values of safety, technology, being friendly to our planet and having a fun and unique driving experience matter - get the Volvo.  Plus - when that other driver runs a red light and moments before the impact are you going to wish you were in an XC90, the safest SUV made?  With a zero percent fatality rate according to the IIHS, the results speak for themselves.",5

They seem to have little to no wiggle room when it comes to leases.  While the Volvo Corp website listed lease deals for the hybrid no one I contacted was interested in getting the car for me.  It was what they had on their lot.  I was really surprised at their kind of caviler attitude.  The car is definitely interesting but not an inexpensive lease.  Again I asked several times at more than 5 dealers if they would get me the car that Corporate was advertising and the answer was we would have to search.  I would never hear back.....

German Shepherd fits nicely in either rear bucket seat with thigh extender out. Seats are extremely comfortable and include awesome massaging. Auto park and brake set or release is great feature. Safety technologies all included and really like active lane keeping as well as adaptive cruise. More than enough room in back for shopping and luggage even with having an Fpace spare space saver tire in case of flat laying on cargo floor (nearly exact diameter vs Volvo’s spare is 4” smaller). About 31 mpg in 6300 miles which is incredible for a 5300 lb SUV with 400 hp. Charges in two hours at 240V so do it several times a day. Remote climate start is perfect for dog on hot days. A lost car glitch on nav map was easily fixed by resetting Sensus system per screen option. Air suspension lowers car automatically. The list of great features goes on and on. Highly recommended plus Volvo included maintenance for 30000 miles or 3 years. An incredible vehicle and highly recommended!,5

It took two days to resolve originally and then it recurred several more times, which required a visit to Volvo each time. I have a love/hate relationship with this vehicle.  I love, love, love the interior design and features.  There is great mood lighting, an excellent sound system, comfortable seats, classy styling, touch screen, AUTO PILOT (the best thing ever in Southern California traffic - I'll never buy a car without this feature again), parallel parking assist, second row seat adjustment for larger/smaller passenger leg room and much more.  Twice my car auto braked and likely saved me from accident, so thank you Volvo, but many other times as I am driving in a residential street it dings loudly with an orange bar code.  It falsely alerts me and sometimes even breaks slightly, that I am going to hit a parked car that I am no where near.  It scares me each time it does this.  My moon roof poured water in the second row of my car when I took it to the Costco car wash.  This fix (replacing the moonroof and making adjustments) took about a week.  I have had multiple issues with temperature control systems, both requiring extended visits (about a week each time) at the service shop, while they ordered parts and made repairs.  My seat belts, seats or whatever squeaks as I am driving down the road.  It's like nails on a chalkboard.  I've been in several times for this and now I just give him.  My quiet Volvo riding experiencing now has me twitching at the sounds.  I have continuous issues pumping gas (they made a repair for a check engine light on a fuel related issue, just not this issue) where the pump clicks off and I cannot tell if my tank is full.  I'm scared to keep pumping as gas will spill out, so I stop and fill up at another gas station or another occasion.  Volvo offered to buy my car back and it has been a very smooth process, so much so, that I will be purchasing a 2018 XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.  I am hoping they have worked out some of the glitches.  Fingers-crossed...Update, 1/8/18!!!  I have been in my new 2018 Volvo XC90 Plug-in Hybrid Inscription for several months and I reached 3,400 miles before my check engine light came on.  What a huge disappointment! As luck would have it, my thermostat needs replacing (a 3-5 day repair estimate).  This is EXACTLY the same issue as on my 2016 XC90 Plug-in Hybrid.  You can’t make this stuff up!  Buyer beware of the mechanic/computer problems on this car.  They are real!  My service advisor told me that they haven’t seen this issue on other 2018 models yet (I am one of the first buyers in my location of this model year).  Update:  June 2018, 2018 XC90 - Suspension needed work at about 10,000 miles. Update:  7/11/18 2018 S90 Plug-in Hybrid - Our family also purchased a new 2018 S90 Plug-In Hybrid a few months ago. At approximately 4000 miles the check engine light came on causing a fix to the you guessed it!!!  The temperature control system...  The car died again after the repair, literally, requiring it to be towed to the local dealership.  It took several weeks for all of these repairs while the very nice local service shop waited for return calls and updates from Sweden.  With the time change, this is an extremely inefficient business model resulting in multiple day repairs (often weeks with the plug-in hybrids).  We have now owned three of them, so all three have had problems with the temperature control systems.",4

If the car sits long enough ( usually 7 to 8 days)  the car goes into  a sleep mode to protect the batteries. The result is the car is dead with no power available. The car must be entered using the manual key and the only way to start the car is to get a jump start. I am an international commercial pilot and go on long trips all the time. When I return I must get my airline's maintenance to give me a jump to start. Needless to say I am the joke of the airline and having to to this at 4am during blizzards in Chicago is a nightmare. I have a 1995 snow plow I can start after sitting 6 months but a new 84,000 Volvo XC-90 cannot sit 2 weeks how sad.The dealer has been great but Volvo has not provided any hopes for a fix.

Mercedes GLS is too big, BMW X5 3rd row is unusable. It boils down to XC90 and Audi Q7. Me and my wife both loved the exterior/interior of XC90. Eventually we ended up buying XC90 T8 Inscription with all possible options (MSRP was 85K, but we got good deal). Car is very quite and drives really nice and my wife swears for its handling. However I feel driving is boring. Acceleration is no where close to my Mercedes E350. May be I should not expect that but I want to let you know that don't get foll by 400hp rating. It is big/heavy car and you will notice it. It has about 15 miles electric only range and my wife loves electric only mode due to quietness (I feel it is sluggish in electric mode). in last 4 months I had to visit dealer twice. Once engine light came up and second because there is some rattling noise in center console. Dealer fixed engine light thing, but noise issue has not gone fully (it comes back only at certain speed). I feel it is due to air suspension and I have to live with it. I don't expect such thing in 85K car. If I have to buy again, I would buy T6, since it is 400lb lighter so will have better handling. T6 will be 15K cheaper too.Now it has been one year since I have this vehicle. It has made two trips to dealer for various issues. One for temp sensor gone bad and another for battery cooling pump gone bad. It was also making creaking sound at center console which dealership fixed by putting some extra insulation. Now I hope everything is sorted out and just regular servicing will be needed in future. I have grown used to its driving characteristics. Driving experience is best at Sports mode. Everyone gives compliment for its looks.",4

It has been reliable with no mechanical issues. Using battery power for regular work commuting and hybrid mode for everything else I’m getting about 40 mpg.

Every time we have something fixed, a new problem emerges within 500 miles of driving.

Again, we took it in 3 times - were accused of parking it outside! and even dumping a bucket of water in it.  We paid over $1500 dollars to clean up the mess and Volvo refused to cover it under warranty.  Our car was either dead or in the shop for 42 days out of the past 2 months.

We bought it knowing the the 3rd row seat would not fold down. Other than that it looked great. We averaged about 16-17 mpg combined. The car itself is very comfortable but after a year of owning it, the electrical system began to fail. The dashboard would turn off while driving, the radio broke, and the windows wouldn't stay up. When we took it into the volvo dealership, they kept it for almost two weeks and finally (rudely) told us they could not figure out what the problem was. They also told us the 3rd row seat may cost up to $1000 to repair. A year later, we had problems with the almost brand new brakes. We had to have them replaced as well as all four of the $200 tires because of uneven wear. Recently, after a routine visit to the mechanic, we found out the the power steering needed to be replaced as well as the heavily fogged over headlight lamps which would cost us $2000. That was the breaking point for us and we decided to trade it in. On the way to the dealership the brakes gave out. They hesitated to give us $1000 trade in. This vehicle has been a money trap. Although the car is a comfortable ride and has an attractive interior, it is not worth the investment. Stay away. There is a reason these xc90's don't hold their value.",2

Overall, I am happy with it, but also frustrated w/the number of the same problems over and over.  Love 3rd row seats & integrated child booster.  Hate that I have had to replace my tires 2x in the past 4.5 yrs.  I have had continuing issues with the ball joints and tie rods that actually caused me to fail inspection.  They have been replaced at least 2x & I am hearing the same noises again.  There is not a ton of power or pick up with this vehicle.

We didn't need the 3rd row seating and since they add  considerable weight and reduce 2nd row leg space, we had our dealer search for a 5 passenger model for us.  I'm glad we did, because the 2.5T engine is just adequate, given the vehicle weight.  We have averaged exactly in the 17-22 EPA mileage range - not bad for such a spacious SUV.  The XC90 has attractive, timeless styling, is appointed excellently on the interior and has a smooth, secure, stable ride. The 2.5T won't win any drag races, but is fine for our every day normal driving.  The XC90 corners pretty well for an SUV too.",4.375

The factory Pirellis lasted 12,000 miles and the replacements are going bald with about 18,000 on them.  That's expensive; especially when you add a brake job at 20,000 miles which the warranty fails to cover.  Other annoyances are a totally inadequate A/C, a stereo that picks up 1/2 the local stations and seats that don't fold up/down dependably.  When compared to the Lexus and Acura automobiles we have owned, the Volvo is equal in price, but NOT EVEN CLOSE in quality.

The third row seat has not been an issue and won't be unless you have a large teen or an adult in back. Even that is OK for a short ride.  However not all is good with this SUV. The AC is nothing short of terrible. The Pirelli tires that came standard didn't make it to 25K.  The plastic housing on the driver side craked.

I have two young kids, wanted them to learn to drive in city traffic in this so they are safe.  Four year in and to date, this vehicle has performed it's job protecting my children.  Even when I purchased this vehicle back years ago, the dashboard and functionality was outdated, but my focus was safety.  I told the salesman that my only two criteria for an XC90 was that the car is white and that it has to have a navigation system.  Today, I am burdened with a vehicle that works well mechanically, but the navigation system does not work consistently.  Yes, I have an iPhone.  No, I do not want to use it for navigation.   In February, 2015, I contacted the dealer who sold me the vehicle and told them of my navigation/backup camera issue (the backup camera comes on, then the screen goes black and the window stays up, and the navigation system is completely disabled).  I took the vehicle into the dealer for software updates SIX times in one year.  The fix has never been installed because it does not exist.  Volvo has given up on fixing the software, they have thrown up their hands and advised me they are never going to fix it.They have offered to ""allow"" me to trade in this vehicle for a new one; they were generous and offered me incentives being offered to everyone right now.  The dealer will not give more, they will lose money.  It's the Volvo manufacturing company that has turned their head and is not supporting their product.They can fix it, they have to hire a software engineer to find the bug and fix it.  They have chosen not to.  Therefore, they are refusing to repair a vehicle they manufactured.   Clearly printed in their documentation, ""From Design, Engineering, and Manufacturing to support activities in Parts, Service, and Sales, high standards have been set to help insure your satisfaction and pride as an owner of a Volvo.”     I am neither satisfied nor proud.  I could have purchased any SUV for my family with a third row seat.  I chose this one, my very first Volvo, because of the company reputation and the research that I did indicating they were a solid company that stood behind their products.  Boy, was I fooled.  Could of bought a Mercedes.  Could of bought an Audi.  Could have bought a Lexus.    I have owned a vehicle from each of those manufacturers in the past and never run into a problem with maintenance or repair.   Now I will suffer the price when I trade in this vehicle and take a lesser amount for the manufacturer's defect.   So, I guess I'm paying for the navigation system twice!   Is the vehicle a complete loss?  No, the vehicle itself has worked fine mechanically.  It is truly unfortunate that the only upgrade option that I requested is the one thing that failed.  What strikes me the hardest is the lack of support from the manufacturer.  I will never buy another Volvo again.",3

The screen, controls, the safety features and even the gas mileage was great.  We had it for 5 months and then the entire computer system went NUTS.  Left me stranded in a parking lot without being able to start the car because the computer applied the parking brake and would not let go.  Then the car only started the first try 70% of the time.  It took some button pushing and resetting with the door locks the other 30% (NO IDEA WHY) Then the noises started.  The dealer ended up replacing the entire front end and still noises persisted.  It ended up being faulty transmission and engine mounts.  To reiterate what another reviewer said, the dealer had to learn from Volvo Cars of America technicians how to work on the car.  Our XC90 was in the shop for more than 2 months that we had it.  We are now giving the car back to Volvo but if we were to keep it, it needs a software upgrade and the windows screech all the way down and up.  I love the styling and honestly love the SUV, but it seems they need to work through many items to make this Car of the Year worthy.",2

Main issues were the faulty control panel and the brakes. The vehicle would auto brake in the middle of the freeway for no reason almost causing multiple accidents. Also we had the break pads changed 5 different times for constant squeaking. Eventually Volvo Corporate bought the vehicle back as we filed a lemon law complaint.,2
4323, on 10/08/17 21:33 PM (PDT),Matt H. ,2016 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Inscription 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),Long Term Review," We bought our 2016 XC90 T6 Inscription in December of 2015 with only 3 miles on it straight from the factory. It had every available package, except air suspension. We also had the 21"" upgraded wheels, and later added the towing package when the parts became available a couple weeks later. Ours also came with Apple pay at no additional cost before Apple decided to start making the car companies make their dealers (and subsequently buyers) pay for it. Since then, we've also paid for some software upgrades. Just recently we paid to have the Auto Pilot upgraded to Auto Pilot Assist 2 for 2017. This was well worth the money to upgrade since it gives our older model semi-autonomous features. So far we've loved it. We also renewed our Volvo on Call service through the rest of the life our vehicle loan because we like the remote start feature since we live in Colorado where we get snow during the winter. Now onto my actual review. We've had the vehicle almost two full years now with minimal issues. I've noticed several reviews that gave bad ratings due to software issues. I can understand that for factory delivered vehicles. They were brand new and they shipped with bugs already in the systems, Volvo pushes several software updates to the dealers every month, and so the vehicle is in a constant state of repair basically because the car is so loaded with technology. We've never had any issues with software but only once when the OS would randomly reboot itself. That ended up getting fixed with a software update. Mechanically we've only had 3 issues, one being the rear brakes were heavily squealing. They gave us the upgraded rotors due to that being a known issue on early 2016 models which was covered under warranty. Our second mechanical issue came when the blinkers would fail to work and it popped an error. We brought it into service, and they replaced the entire assembly, new controls, wiring, and software which fixed the issue, they had the car for two days but they've always given us a loaner vehicle, even when brought in for a regular interval service. Everything was covered under warranty. We also recently had a fuel sensor go out, which was also under warranty. We've gotten a few recalls since we've had the vehicle, but none were ever issues that would jeopardize safety and all were fixed promptly at the dealership, about 95% of them were all software recalls. That has been the extent of any trouble we've seen, which to us has been pretty minimal. We had a brand new 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee before we bought our XC90 and it had 14 recalls in the first year we purchased it, most of them were life threatening major mechanical issues, and we were extremely unhappy with both the vehicle, and our quality of service with Jeep, and will most likely never go back. Volvo's service department near us has been absolutely wonderful, and some of the best service we've gotten from any industry. They go out of their way to make us 100% happy when we step out that door and we've been extremely happy with customer service. Now for nitpicks we didn't like after owning it for this amount of time. There needs to be more USB ports. The 2016 model only has one in the entire vehicle, and I believe the 18' models now has 3. In all honesty, it needs at least 4. 2 in the front and 2 in the back for passengers. The 18' XC40 has wireless phone charging, which I would also like to see in the XC90 range at some point. We noticed a significant difference between the lower end models and our model with road comfort, and that's due to the upgraded 21"" rims. With less tire on the road, there's less cushion for a smoother ride, so while you feel more bumps, it's still extremely quiet. It has some of the best seats in the industry and has been great for long car rides. In the future however, we'll be not doing the upgraded wheels since we learned that makes a large difference in ride comfort. That doesn't effect our review negatively since that was a choice that we made when purchasing, but just something to keep in mind for future buyers. Gas mileage has been less than advertised, but it's worth it to note that both me and my wife are heavy on the foot at stops. We do keep the start/stop feature on, but forget to turn on echo mode on the highway which makes a difference. We also mostly do city driving which also makes a difference in gas mileage overall. When we're on road trips or actively trying to conserve gas we get an average of about 24, which is closer to the actual estimated. I feel that letting you know how we drive the vehicle makes a difference in why our combined MPG is the number it is and not something higher, which it could definitely get. Other than that, we've been extremely happy with our XC90 and can't wait to get our next Volvo in the future.",5

It is a beautiful car with a comfortable interior and nice ride.  That's where it ends.  Since day 1, the voice navigation system has not worked.  The back-up camera doesn't always come on when you put the car in reverse.  The car stopped accelerating while I was driving and had to be towed to the dealership.  The foot-activated tailgate sensor doesn't work.  The climate control goes from barely there to hurricane force.  The touch screen has gone blank on multiple occasions.  The gas gauge doesn't provide an accurate reading of miles left in the tank.  I actually ran out of gas - I've been driving 30+ years and have never run out of gas - even as a poor teenager!  On multiple occasions the accident avoidance feature engaged - when there wasn't a car around me.  The a/c stopped working.  It has been in and out of the dealership multiple times - each time with the hope that the latest software update would solve the problems.  This last fix was supposed to solve the navigation issue.  The technician sat in the car with me and we tried to use the navigation and it switched me to the Music.  That was the last straw.

The test drive was good. The 360 view, the dashboard were fantastic looking and I was blown over. Post purchase, I began to uncover lots of common sense things that the car simply refused to do. Unlike the Infiniti, the 360 view is not attainable unless you go through several clicks and swipes on the very cool tablet/ipad like dashboard controls. The purpose of the 360 view is lost totally. The rear view can be replaced with the 360 view but then you lose the range of vision of the road behind you. Radio settings are made unnecessary complicated. Another example, the simple and easy windshield wipers. You would think they would have these automated down pat but no. Unlike the Lexus, you actually have to tell it that it is raining only after which it does some level of automated speed up and slow down of the wipers.The service was ""ugh"" and ""aargh"" always - condescending disposition of the people and poor time estimation at the top of the problems. A supposed 45 minute wait became ""a few more minutes"", ""half hour more"", ""15 more minutes"" to three hours! There was one time when the service person told me that car pick up for maintenance will happen only if I was disabled in some manner which was an outright cooked up story. The service people behave as if they are high and mighty and want to show that they control who gets picked up and who doesn't. A simple reason such as, ""We don't have drivers or cars to pick up at that time"" would have been totally understandable for inability to pick up. Lexus service was soooo much better! These are registered complaints and I received apologies. I was okay the first time but some issue or the other came up which did not have to come up.The router and the wifi is not of great strength as advertised for sure.The Lane Assist detected white dashed lines only. The double yellow line and the solid white line were totally ignored.To top all of this, the car self-braked many times for the wrong scenarios such as a car coming on the opposite lane, a parked car in a turn and didn't stop for a stopped vehicle causing a head-on collision and was totaled after 6 months of usage.In conclusion, it comes with a few cool bells and whistles but it is not a well thought through car for overall execution. Service gets the lowest score. Truly disappointing.",2

Glitches in the software caused the entire dashboard and ipad system to go down when I was on the highway doing 70, then it locks up and wont go more than 30 miles and hour about getting me killed, has to towed in, takes 3 three days to get back and there only answer is we fixed it by updating the software??

Many of the problems were an inconvenience, but several of them actually made the car dangerous to drive. Volvo should be ashamed of themselves for releasing this model before all the bugs were worked out. The collision mitigation system was erroneously triggered on several occasions, which means that the car braked itself to a full stop while I was driving at speed and there was no accident imminent, the belt pulled me back into the driver seat and alarm bells went off, as well as the HUD flashed red lights.

However, it has had one electronic glitch after another-each computer reboot leads to a new issue that can't seemed to be resolved at the dealer (Volvo of Louisville).  The touch pad has gone completely blank, the temperature gauge can have wild swings, the apps don't work well- the latest is that when I start the car or first back it up in the morning, the radio changes from sirius XM to a Christian FM channel.  I have the beige Napa leather seats but the drivers seat has worn thru the finish and I await a new seat cover for a car that is 11 months old.  Unless you have much time to spend  at the dealer, I would not recommend this vehicle.  I tried to trade it in, at the dealer where it was purchased,  and was told I would have to pay $52000 in addition to turning in this vehicle to get an similar XC90 ($32000 is owed).  Shocking, right? but Kelly the manager said this was her best offer.  Do the math, my car is worth about $23000 according to this manager.  I would consider this extremely poor resale or an extremely poor manager.  Anyhow I'm stuck with an untrustworthy and overpriced vehicle for now.UPDATE (March 2018):  Most glitches have been worked out except now my phone won’t pair with the car.  I opted not to pay for Volvo on Call ($10/month) so most apps don’t work.  Drivers seat cover was replaced but still stains badly and never looks good. It was deemed that the passenger seat was not worn enough to warrant replacement but it just doesn’t look good for a luxury car.  Would not buy this car again despite it’s great ride.UPDATE: Sept 2018: The electronic glitches seemed to have been corrected.  Same issues with the seats- they stain very easily. I did take out the seat warranty but doubt it will cover.  The dent warranty didn’t cover a fist sized dent when I accidentally backed into an ornamental tree. Yes, the back up sensor was beeping but I was trying to avoid the basketball goal and didn’t see the tree! It’s still a great ride and I do enjoy driving the vehicle along with the satellite radio.",2
4332, on 03/02/17 16:32 PM (PST),CN ,2016 Volvo XC90 SUV T6 Inscription 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Twincharger 8A),Mixed feeling after nearly a year of ownership," My wife and I purchased the car last year after narrowing down the choices to this and an MB GL350 diesel.  I preferred the Benz, but this car was for my wife and she liked it better.  Between the two it is the better overall value option.  Ours has every major option except the trailer hitch and HUD.  Overall, it's been a good car, but there are some nagging design faults that really detract from it.  First up is the HUD.  I'm 6' 2"", and it was not possible to adjust the system to permit me to see it clearly; the top edge was always cut off, hence one of the reasons we didn't get that option.  Next are the seats.  They are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever had to suffer through.  After nearly a year of driving it I still can't adjust them to a comfortable position.  The seat bottoms literally pinch my butt on the driver's side.  On the passenger side my tail bone sits directly on the seam for the extendable thigh support.  The lumbar support in the seat back can't be set in a position that works for me for long periods.  The seats in our car are the 'contour' models (I think); maybe the 'comfort' seats don't have these issues.  For me, the 2nd row seats are far more comfortable.  My wife is 5' 3"" and she doesn't have any issues with the seats.  My recollection is the Swedes are pretty tall, so why can't they make a seat that fits a tall person?  The next item is the cruise control.  The controls are backwards in that a single button press adjust the speed up (or down) by 5 mph, while press and hold adjusts by 1 mph.  These actions should be reversed.  The infotainment/electronic systems occasionally glitch, though software updates seem to have generally improved their operation.  The most serious glitch, experienced by me and my wife separately, has been the emergency braking warning going off for no reason, accompanied by the automatic emergency braking.  This occurred to each of us on the highway.  Fortunately, traffic was light during both instances, and the action was momentary.  Fuel economy is, frankly, lousy considering the engine size.  We're averaging around 21-22 mpg in mixed driving.  The best we've managed was about 25 mpg on a 450-miles trip.  Our Odyssey's engine is nearly twice the size and that car gets nearly 30 mpg on the highway.  And, it's a larger car (and weighs the same).  Compounding the low fuel economy is the ridiculously small fuel tank.  18.5 gallons?  Seriously? It should be at least 20, preferably more given the lousy economy.  Volvo really missed an opportunity by not offering a V6, or bringing the diesel to the U.S.  On the plus side, the infotainment system is easy to use.  The ride with the air suspension is sublime.  It feels like a tank.  Fit and finish, and materials are first rate and every bit on par (or better) than the Germans.  The biggest plus in my book, though, is that my wife absolutely loves the car, so it's a keeper.",3

Not the most technically savvy individual though still managed to work out the majority of the screen based functionality within a couple of hours. Bottom line is that this is well built, stylish SUV that provides an amazing level of comfort combined with a strong sense of safety due to the numerous features that you would expect from a Volvo.

It was one of the first models, fresh off  the assembly line. It is a beautiful car. But don't let it's looks fool you. The first 6 months were great. Then things started to go downhill. The first thing that happened was the hood flew open while we were driving. Luckily we were on a city street and were only driving 30 miles per hour; this could have been a disaster. We had the car towed to the dealer. They identified a faulty hood release and fixed the body work free of charge. Next we started to notice that the safety system is too sensitive. We had 2 instances of the car stopping itself (braking) for no apparent reason while in city traffic. Again, disaster was averted due to low speed and traffic. The car also has electronic and braking issues. Out of the blue the brakes started squealing and grinding to the point that it was undrivable  (at 11k miles). Had it towed to the dealer where the front and rear brakes and rotors had to be replaced. While there, I asked that the software be updated (the dealer couldn't manage to figure it out when I was last there). They had problems with it. My car was out of service for 2 weeks due to an inability to update the software that controls many features of the car. A week after I picked it up I took it back because the brake light would not go off and all of the tire sensors were on. It's been there for the last 2 weeks and they can't figure out how to fix the issues.

I have a parking aid, the sensor doesn't work 9 out of 10!! I paid for it but don't use it!! The app has a starter that 9out 10 doesnt work and never starts the car!! totally unreliable!! Last thing, the trunk controls buttons (front and back) are extremely slow responders (it takes sometimes 3-5 seconds before they respond, which led to an accident, backed the car while the trunk was open thinking it was closed!!

It has not been fixed. Every time the dealer charged up the battery and it worked for a day or two.  Volvo simply just looked at the check code and concluded there was nothing wrong. After many frustrations, I just gave up as I do not particularly like the start/stop feature. Bought the car because of Volvo's safety and reliability reputation. Nice looking car and drives great. But still I would say Do Not Buy. Owned XC90 for about 9 months. It went to shop for three times due to unknown battery draining issues commonly seen by many XC90 owners. So far the issue seems have been fixed but I heard many other owners still have the problem. Stop/start almost never worked. Dealer said nothing can be found regarding to this. Received three safety recalls on the car in 6 months. All small but annoying issues. Volvo made a bold redesign on XC90 but this one failed.",1

Thankfully, the car is under warranty but the hassle and the lack of confidence that this vehicle will keep our family safe is zero.  --We've had starting issues, navigation issues, issues with the transmission slipping and the latest incident where only the driver side door would unlock, meaning no one could get in or out of the vehicle unless we crawled through the driver side window.

Save yourself the hassle and wait until they get the kinks out of this car.  UPDATE:  The car ended up being in the shop a total of 8 times within months of our purchase. With all the issues with this vehicle and discussions with lawyers, we finally went through a process with Volvo and the dealership to return this lemon of a car and get a new one (a long story that was a nightmare in and of itself) but we now drive a 2017 version and it is running fine (knock on wood).",1

Beautiful inside and out, lots of great safety features, and a pleasure to drive. However, there have been severe software issues and most recently battery draining for no apparent reason when it sits.  Each trip to shop has been 2 - 3 days, because their technicians are not fully up to speed and/or the software is too screwed up. They generally have to do a remote consult with Volvo engineers..  As I write this I am about to jump start it to take it back to the shop again, just a month after the last battery episode (they did a battery reset and then installed a new battery last time, but never did find the cause).  Do a Google search and you will find dozens of other people with the same problem.  Another issue is quirky navigation system.  Usually reliable, but occasionally totally screws up destination city.

Not to mention it's much larger and much peppier engine.  My wife and myself also looked at the BMW X5 and mb gle and Audi Q7.  We found x5 to be very expensive and the BMW dealer by us has a horrible service department, but the SUV drove nicely and interior was nice but very similar to the Volvo but 8,700 more for comperable equipment.  The gle was a bit small and no third row, transmission was a bit rough when passing.  The q7 was very out dated, no technology features, no safety features, worst fuel economy, we have no idea how it was rated so highly, it felt like it was a decade behind the others.  We also looked at the Range Rover sport, this was a very nice SUV but over budget about 24,000 more than the Volvo.  When looking at the Volvo make sure you drive both regular motors we found the base t5 to be under powered and noisy.  But for a few grand more the t6 engine is very quick and the transmission reacts much smoother than my Mercedes Benz e350.  The fuel economy has been surprisingly good for a larger SUV about 24 mpg.   I definitely recommend the active cruise control and cornering head lights both are great options and the kids love the very large sunroof.  The iPad interface takes some time to get used to, but everything is voice command also and the dash board also cam be customized to view whatever you want.  If you send some time with it everthing including changing its colors are customizable, maybe a bit too much.  I wish the auto on off would stay on the last setting used like most European cars instead of turning back on each time you turn the car on and you need to flip to a second screen to turn it, just not ideal.  The seats are very nice and designed to mold very well to your body, much more comfortable than my Benz or wife's old x3.  Overall I have been very impressed and would consider the up coming 90 sedan over replacing the E class with another E class if the features and ride are the same for less like the xc90 is.We paid very little and upgraded to full autopilot up to 80mph, which is a nice option to have when caught in traffic.  No issues so far, only regular oil changes and some computer updates.",5

That said, I have owned 5 new Volvos in 12 years and the new XC90 is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors. Stylish, comfortable, roomy, user friendly and full of amazing tech, it's a great addition to the lineup and it truly is something special.

It has way too many moving parts with a turbo and supercharger and just very loud and disconcerting from the drivers seat. There is never a case where you will be able to accelerated without downshifting. On paper it says it has acceleration and horsepower but unless you like racing the engine around town you will be wholly underwhelmed. Get a real car with a 6 cylinder.,3

I did all the research  online and the dealership was busy with everyone wanting to drive the XC90. Our first test drive was the T6 Momentum. It was AWFUL! There was a horrible burning smell and a wicked vibration that made my husband feel carsick in the back seat. I changed with him and I started to feel carsick in the back too. The shifting was really rough, the acceleration was poor, the seats were not comfortable at all. The salesman ask if we would be willing to try another. I wanted to like this car so we agreed. We drove the R design. What a different experience, the contour seats are very comfortable, we drove it in dynamic mode which made a difference in acceleration, there was not a vibration. But we were still woozy from the first one so we have to drive it again. The biggest con for us is that there is no strap on the back of the 3rd row. It seems petty, but if you are going to have a car that can almost drive itself, why don't you put a strap on that back of the 3rd row so a shorter person can pull the 3rd row up and not have to climb in the back to push it up?",2

To make it comparable to a BMW, Audi, or Mercedes, you need to step up to the Inscription trim and I would highly recommend it with the optional air suspension.  Without the air suspension the ride quality is average; with it, the ride is outstanding.  I had no intention of buying a Volvo, but was very surprised.  I drove all the competition extensively and bought an XC90 First Edition so it has every feature available.  The interior is amazing, the safety tech is unparalleled, and infotainment is great.  As for criticisms, the navigation system is not the best on the market, the car only has one USB port, and local mpg have been poorer than advertised.  However, on a recent trip from Phoenix to LA, we averaged almost 28 mpg.  I quickly got used to the touch tablet style interface and enjoy the ease of use.  I personally love the seats (heated/ventilated), Apple Car Play, heads up display, and the Bowers and Wilkens stereo will blow you away.  Again, safety features are amazing.  As for the competition, the X5 from the driver’s seat is a great vehicle, but it is smaller inside and the Volvo kills it in 2nd and 3rd row functionality and utility, which is what we needed.  The Lexus GX (keep in mind I really like Lexus and owned an RX for over a decade) feels heavy and sluggish compared to the Volvo.  The new Audi Q7 was not available when I bought and the older version was surprisingly tight inside.  The Merc GL is a bigger vehicle but when I optioned it out to match my Volvo First Edition from a feature standpoint it was over $90k.  The Volvo truly feels like a smaller vehicle than it is while driving and eats up highway miles.  My wife and I fight over who takes it each day.  I hope the long term reliability is above average.  This new XC90 is a giant step forward for Volvo!",5

When we decided to get rid of our Acura MDX, we tested several luxury SUVs.  Both my wife and I really favored the Volvo.  That is, until we drove it.  We wanted to love it so much that we returned for 3 test drives but in the end it was just underwhelming.  The engine is underpowered and the driving experience was nonexistent, but we might have lived with that.  What really disappointed us was the interior.  Volvo was proud to tells us that their seats were designed by a medical doctor and took 6 years to complete.  Well, they really aren't that comfortable.  The interior felt like an empty box....Spartan appointments for a vehicle over 50k. The infotainment console is too far away from the driver and the system was unneccessarily complicated.   The positioning of controls did not seem to have a logical or ergonomic design.  Overall, the xc90 felt cheap and hollow.

The second time we had enough gas to get it to the dealer fortunately. We also had issues with the ""Park Assist"" where it intermittently would shut off. Our dealer finally determined that one of the sensors was broken and they replaced it. Another time, my wife was driving it down the highway with the kids in the car when it suddenly lost all power. Thankfully she was able to get it to the curb safely. She called the dealer who's advice was to ""turn the car off and then turn it back on"".

So far I have put about 1000miles on the SUV, about 75% mileage comes from local driving - commuting to/from work, driving kids to school and other places etc.  I have yet to take a long trip or push the car to its limits.  Therefore it can’t qualify as a complete ownership review.  But for whatever it worths, I share my $0.02 with current and will-be fellow Volvo owners.Maybe we start with some low lightsSensus Touch ScreenTechnologies are awesome, but also can be difficult to master. This is true in 2016 XC90.  Its central touch screen has 3 views to slide from left and right, plus a “car setting” view that is pulled from the top.  The screen navigation is complicated.  After two weeks, I still have trouble remembering how to get to certain settings. I tend to consider myself a techie and quite adept at picking up new things, Volvo central control proved that I am not as smart as I thought I was.Key fabIt’s a classy design with leather wrapped around bulk of surface area.  It carries touch of a fine watch.   Function buttons are located on the either side, and that is where the trouble comes.  The buttons are small, difficult press and even more difficult to feel which is “lock” or “unlock”.  You will have to see it.  My key fab leather is blonde, matching the car’s interior.  However, Being in the pocket and rubbing against other stuff all the time isn’t the formula to keep key fab clean.  The key fab frame is aluminum.  My key has received a couple of small dents on the frame so far.  Volvo, if you are reading the post, please make the frame stainless steel.  The aluminum frame doesn’t match the leather wrap nor the $80K car price tag.Park assist, Camera - bird’s eye viewMy T8 comes with vision package, a great value and a must-have in my opinion. I especially love the synthesized bird eye view of the car.  I found it much more useful than park assist.  I, for one when equipped  with the overview camera, don’t have trouble maneuvering the car regardless parallel parking or back up parking.  Park assist, on the other hand, reacts slowly.  While I can see its usefulness for many, I only tested it for a couple of time before reverting to much faster manual parking.  BTW, park assist did work quite well when I used it. The bird’s eye view image becomes wonky when other tall objects are nearby.  This perhaps is the only knock on the vision package. I think it can be corrected via software algorithm.  I hope Volvo has a future software update for this.Voice recognition Works about 80-85% of time.  The number might seem high, but in day-to-day usage, it is not very dependable.  Volvo obviously has some catch-up to do with Google etc in the voice recognition domain.One USB port and no SD card slotDealer told me XC90 accepts micro SD card, but I am unable to insert the micro SD card to the slot next to the glove box release button.  No place in the manual refers to micro SD card either.  This interlude attests how much a dealer knows about this new vehicle.  And one USB port in this connected era spells major inconvenience for the owners.  I have to keep swapping between my phone, USB stick and passenger’s phones.Having said all of that, there is a lot to like, or may I say the word love, about XC90 T8.  First and foremost,Quite and SmoooooothThe twin engine combo has far exceeded my expectation.  The transition between the electric and gas engine is so seamless that I often fail to notice the switch taking place.   Thanks to the hybrid powertrain, the car starts with electric engine with zero noise and gas engine kicks in when more power is needed or cruising at high speed.  The result? no 4 cylinder whining at low gear.   the start/stop also works fabulously well in T8.  In many way, the car waltzes around with V8 like grace, smoothness and tranquility.  Not only twin engines augment each other well, regenerative braking and mechanical braking work in perfect harmony.  I don’t believe any non-racing driver would be able to tell which braking is at work unless he peeks at the dashboard.PowerI’ve not floored the gas pedal and rev the engine to the red line.  The car is still breaking in, I have to be easy on the throttle.  So I can’t verify the 5.3 sec from 0-60 mph, yet….  Even with that, XC90 T8 has plenty of juice at the low end, cruising around effortlessly with 5 people on board.  With a gentle push on on gas pedal, freeway overtaking comes with ease.  400 horse power brings about the reassuring feeling. While I won’t use it every time when taking the freeway on-ramp, I know all the ponies are there there to haul the heavy SUV when I need to.Touch SensusExcept Telsa which I haven’t used,  Volvo’s touch screen beats Mercedes, BMW, Audi and Lexus etc. in my opinion.  The screen is clear under the direct sunlight and responsive to inputs.  It may be prone to finger prints, but courtesy protective screen cover and mic",5

I have 3000 miles on my T8 Inscription and could not be happier.  I drove BMW, new Audi Q7, new MB and Porche; the T8 is the true winner.  If you are considering a T6 or T8, the first option I would recommend is the air suspension.  It is a gamer changer offering a smoother, quieter ride and improved handling.  Going for the Inscription package raises the interior seating and finishes to an extremely high level.  Then of course Intellisafe safety features are wonderful.  And finally, if you are into music, the BW sound system is uncompromising.  Wow.The T8 plug in hybrid's battery cost 50 cents to charge and it provides enough electric only miles for most of my city driving needs.  We charge between 1 and 5am using a timer to get the lowest electrical rate of 4 cents per kw (here in Arizona).  In the electric mode, the car it incredibly quiet.  Really magical.",5

Long journeys are now even more bearable!Had problems with the electric parking brake locking on, stranding my wife in the school parking lot. Volvo said the car needed to be towed to the dealer; I found this thread and someone mentioned pulling the parking brake fuse to reset the system (open hood, look inside fusebox cover to identify the fuse, pull, leave a minute, replace, done) - this fixed the issue totally for us. Going to get the dealer to check for a firmware update for that component at the next service.Update May 2017: Have had several firmware updates, and tried switching the head unit SIM from the supplied AT&T to T-Mobile (easy job) but still we can't get pandora streaming reliably within 5 minutes of starting to drive. The touchscreen is infuriatingly slow and buggy, and the connectivity (not sure if it's 3G or LTE) is ridiculously slow even when showing full signal.Update May 2018: The touchscreen is still awful compared to a Tesla. Apps are essentially useless, and the 3G connection is still awful.The hybrid system failed last week too, thought the car remains fully drivable on gas. Waiting for a service slot for this to be diagnosed.Update November 2017: Have had 3+ occasions where the car won't start (well, turn on). Foot on brake, turn the on/off control and ... nothing. We worked out that getting out of the car, locking it, waiting a couple of minutes and trying again usually gets it to start but wtf, this is just ridiculous. The dealer managed to replicate it, but not fix the problem....Update May 2018: Eventually, after many more service trips, the ""car won't start"" issue was found and addressed earlier this year. The car powers up both on hydraulic pressure (from pushing pedal) and also from a switch on the brake pedal... it turns out that, as the dealership traced the wires through, that the switch input to the ECU was not clicked into place. After this was fixed, we have not seen the issue again. Finally!",4

4401, on 03/03/18 12:41 PM (PST),Brian Loek ,2011 Volvo XC90 SUV 3.2 4dr SUV (3.2L 6cyl 6A),Safety YES but poor execution," My wife and I bought our Volvo XC90 while we were living in the UK but since we were returning to the U.S. within a year we had the vehicle built under U.S. specs. As far as the design of the vehicle when it comes to safety it is 100% safe during the first 36K miles. After that you are rolling the dice. My wife and I have had to have the driver side seatbelt replaced twice which tells me Volvo went cheap on things you can't see. I have never had to have a seatbelt replaced. I have had cars with 190K miles on them that had the original factory seatbelts in them that hadn't been replaced. Next, the AC system went out on my wife with no warning with less than 36K miles on it. Luckily, our vehicle has always been under warranty. Manual lumbar support; are you kidding me???? Even my 97 Ford Explorer had electric lumbar support. Do not buy this vehicle used. New with a warranty is your safest bet. Also, if you plan on keeping this vehicle long term make sure you maintain the warranty and have a maintenance package. You will regret it if you don't. The level of tech in this vehicle for a 2011 make car is weak. Volvo tried to make a huge jump with their new XC-90, which I have driven, and that was a tech blunder as far as the infotainment system goes. Overall, I think Volvo is trying to save money by making subtle changes/upgrades to current model vehicles but they are trying to make big leaps when they re-design their vehicles which introduces too many changes in one package which in my opinion creates too many potential problems. Also, support for Volvo along the Gulf Coast is very weak. There are only two dealerships in my area and they are both 30 more minutes away.

Recently, after purchasing a 2013 XC60 in 2014, after owning this car for 1 year (and enjoying the advanced electronic features), I happily 'traded-down' for a 2011 XC90 ! Comparatively the XC60's driving experience confirmed the car was driving me, momentum not balanced and did not hug the road in the manner to which I've become accustomed. My 2011 XC90 (2nd in the family, and my 6th Volvo) had much better visibility, truly hugged the road with confidence of an automatic all-wheel drive the way it should - with fierce grip yet a smooth driving experience. I do not believe the XC60 has 'matured' enough in engineering the actual driving experience (rather they concentrated on features) that the XC90 has claimed. It is not a speed-demon by any means, however it accelerates at higher speeds beautifully (turbo), and my driving confidence in any weather or road condition (having driven through Adirondack blizzards with other all-wheel cars crawling or stopping) knowing I and my loved ones are safe and comfortable.",4

We replaced a 2004 Ford Expedition in order to downsize and gain a little better fuel economy.  Pros:  The interior and exterior quality and styling of the vehicle is excellent. The leather seats are the best quality/most comfortable of any vehicle I have owned.  The vehicle is exceptionally quiet and drives very smoothly at cruising speeds. Cons:  The acceleration of the vehicle is a little jerky from start to about 30 mph.  It is very noticeable as the vehicle's automatic transmission shifts gears.  I think the 6 cyl standard engine is a little undersized for this vehicle.  Also the gas mileage is disappointing at average 20 MPG (17 MPG city).,4.625

I might have taken this safety stuff a little too seriously.  However, looking beyond just the readily available ratings (which, in my opinion, would incorrectly indicate that other SUVs are just as safe as the XC90) revealed that Volvo's safety reputation in this case is well deserved.

But, after test driving it, the interior felt kind of cheap.  We did a lot of research on the XC60 and just got ours a few weeks ago.  I was a little hesitant because our V50 had a lot of issues.  However, I really love the look and feel of the XC60.  I wanted a T6, but our local mechanic recommended the T5.  He thought the T5 has fewer issues.  So far, so good.  It’s a really great combination of luxury and safety features.  The leather seats have that nice “real leather” smell.  I absolutely love driving it.  I’ve been using the sport shift a lot, which is fun.  I miss my manual V5”, but this is such an amazing upgrade.  I have no complaints about the pickup.  I haven’t noticed a throttle lag.  Based on my research on reliability, we payed extra to get an extended warranty to 100k.  I’ve never done that before, but just don’t want to risk it.  Now were thinking about some accessories like a roof rack and possibly a toe hitch.  Fingers crossed about future ownership, but we are loving it so far.  Also love the Harmon Kardon sound.  Only complaint is that the Nav is really hard to figure out and the sensus system is a little clunky.",5

End 6/14 (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),My last Volvo," While this car drives well it's given me a ton of problems, generating a lot of repair costs and frustration.  While under warranty I had lots of little problems, and the check engine light came on so regularly I ended up having to buy a code checker to avoid constant trips to the dealership or somewhere like autozone to have it read.    One of the reasons it kept going off was the gas tank was visible machined poorly, so no matter how well I attached the cap the check engine light for emissions would come on.  It also burned through oil on a few occasions.  I took it to the dealership immediately, but they couldn't ever find anything wrong.  Other problems were generally small issues like sensors or spark plugs going bad.  These were an inconvenience, but they weren't major and were covered by the warranty so I didn't care too much at the time .  At about 55,000 miles the car suddenly started emitting a very high pitched squeal.  I made plans to take it to the dealership the next morning.  In the morning the check engine light was on, and it also started revving uncontrollably when stopped at stop lights.  Eventually they informed me the bearings in both cam shafts went bad, and the thermostat needed replaced.  This was about a $3000 repair cost, and they said it would take about a week because they had to order the parts.  It took the dealer 7 WEEKS to repair my car.   They seemed incapable of ordering the right parts or ordering all the parts they need.  They did not keep me informed at all, and I constantly had to call and check in.  Half the time they weren't able to provide me a time estimate at all, and they other half of the time they said it would only be another couple days.  I spoke to Volvo corporate, left messages for the manager, etc, all to no avail.  Finally they called and said it would be ready the next day, only for them to discover something else wrong with the car.  When they finally finished all the repairs I picked up the car, and immediately noticed how heavy the steering felt.  I thought it was just because I'd been driving a different loaner vehicle for the past 7 weeks  (Honestly it had been so long I kept reaching for the wrong controls in my car once I got it back).  However, after a couple more days it became clear something is now wrong with the power steering.  Now I have to decide whether to take it back to the same dealership and see if they will fix it for no/reduced cost since it was likely the result of something they did, or take it to a different dealership which might provide better service.  Either way this is definitely my last Volvo ever.  We were thinking about an XC90 for my wife, but now there is no way we'll even consider it.     About the only thing positive I have to say about the car is that it averaged about 28-30mpg for me, but the savings isn't worth the other costs and frustrations.",1

Absolutely love this vehicle!  I had narrowed my search to a Acura RDX or the Volvo XC60 and found the safety features, the nimble and quick handling, sleek exterior design and the straight-forward, understated but more than adequate interior won out in the Volvo.  The RDX had a dull feel to it compared to the energy and zip of the XC60 and the rear-end design of the RDX fell short.  My gas mileage has been phenomenal using the ECO feature and it has the same getup and go as a Acura Integra I once owned.   I have Blind Spot technology and the protection package, both features I find helpful.   The cargo area is just what I was looking for and like the idea the seats all lie flat.  Most of all it is fun to drive!

The SUV is overall very safe im sure but the accessibility of the backseat is ridiculous. I cannot tell you how many times ive hit my head trying to maneuver my sons car seat into the middle seat. The only way you can easily get a car seat in the backseat is if you move either the driver seat or the passenger seat forward almost completely. My husband is 6'1"" so if he is driving you may as well count the driver side of the car out in terms of being able to put a baby into the back.  For the amount of money we paid for the vehicle i assumed the backseat would be comfortable which it is not for an adult. I am only 5'4"" and am incredibly uncomfortable when i sit in the backseat with my son, to the point where you have to sit sideways because your legs have practically no room. I feel this is a HUGE design flaw on Volvo's part! If you only have 1 child and don't count on having any more then this is the car for you. However if you plan on having more kids good luck to them being comfortable in the back seat! I cannot wait until it is time to buy a new vehicle which is unfortunate because I heard such great things about Volvo's but probably will never buy another one again!",3

The interface for radio and ac and tech is somewhat simple, but the car has fantastic safety tech, and the simple interface is nice. You turn a dial to adjust the temperature, you don't scroll through your touch screen. Turning safety features on and off is simple, there are dedicated buttons, and the adjustments and customizing for those features is made using the screen when you're not driving.I actually bought this for my daughter. I had narrowed it down the Honda/Acura and the Subarus due to their great active safety features, but sprung for the Volvo since it's safer and just nicer in a lot of ways. Interestingly, you'll find the Subaru scores higher on active braking because it triggers auto braking earlier and stops you completely when approaching a car at 25mph. With this Volvo, you'd still hit the car, but at a slow speed.  What the IIHS testing doesn't tell you when it compares these systems, is that Volvo uses both radar and a camera. The Subaru uses a camera that can easily be blinded if you are driving into the sun. The Subaru does warn you the collision avoidance system can't ""see"", but the Volvo simply doesn't get blinded. I prefer that. It is also built a bit stronger, and seats you wonderfully. The honda and acura use ""radar"" too, and are very nice for the price.",5

After the first oil change it seemed to stop burning oil, a good thing.  Gas mileage has not increased.  It still averages about 27 on the highway and less in town, maybe a 24 mpg average,  less than we expected.The user interface still confuses my wife, it is not very intuitive.  The car does drive nice and has good performance, by far its best point.  Another issue is oil changes.  Volvo has told us due ""they"" need to put it on the computer to do an oil change,  Jiffy-lube or Firestone, etc should not do it.  I still have yet to verify that.We have found the Volvo dealer no better than the local Chevy dealer, we make appointments and they lose them or tell us when we bring it in its first come first serve.  My wife refuses to take the car in for service due to she is frustrated with the dealer.So the bottom line after two years would I recommend it, probably not.  I have a 2014 Chevy equinox AWD and a 2011 Honda CRV, the Volvo  is  nicer to drive, but  issues,  such as Volvo states they need to  do oil changes, MPG falls short, the blue-tooth/entertainment system is years behind the others.  I was afraid to buy Chevy but all five drivers in my family except for my wife like it the best.  So in my opinion for the price  the Equinox or CRV are a better buy.  First write up.First off I would say this is the best driving car we have ever had.  It handles very well, has better than average acceleration, stops well, steers well, etc.  The interior is nice, our only complaint is the “storage area” under the radio, you can’t really put anything in it or it falls out when you turn.  The seats are comfortable, and cargo space is adequate.  Our big complaint is gas mileage.  The T-5 Drive E engine should get 24 in town and about 30 on the highway.  We rarely average over 23 mpg. On our Honda CRV and Chevy Equinox we always meet or exceed the EPA estimated MPG, so I don’t think it our driving habits.  Either Volvo over estimated MPG or who knows.  The only other complaint is the information/blue tooth system is not very intuitive.  The local Volvo Dealer had to contact other dealers on how to check the oil level from the info system.  The car does not have a dip-stick.  The manual does not describe how to do it  My wife or daughter still can’t check the oil level using the information system.  Checking the oil is much like running  old DOS commands from function keys on your keyboard.  The engine does need oil added between the 10,000 mile interval oil changes.  Typically at 4000~5000 after an oil change it needs oil.  Volvo thought this would go away after the first oil change, but we had to add oil at the 13,000 mile mark.",3

The car is driven daily already has close to 13500 miles so I have definitely broken it in and spent lots of time in this vehicle.  I have to admit this car was not my first choice.  I wanted a Honda CRV.  I traded a 2004 Honda CRV with over 160K miles for this suv.  I never had any issues with that car or my Honda before that one.  One major complaint is the lack of an owner's manual.  The manual is in the car's infotainment system or you have to download it to a phone or other device.  This is really inconvenient, especially when experiencing a problem.  Twice I experienced turn signal and windshield wiper malfunctions.  Warnings were popping up in the center console and the infotainment system (and don't get me started on how cumbersome that is to operate).   Neither functions operated so makes vehicle unable to be operated in any precipitation.  Very scary to drive when you have 3 children in the car and losing functions.  Also received a battery failure warning on the first occasion.  1st time back to the dealership they had to wipe the computer clean and download all the software again.  Took hrs.  Was promised car fixed.  2nd time (yesterday) they replaced the turn signal and wiper module which was defective.  Took hrs.  Was promised was fixed.  We shall see. It is sad when you carry a towel in the car to wipe mist, etc off you windshield.  The dealer showed me pages of error codes that were downloaded from the car from malfunctions.   I think there is another problem with the computer because now it is taking a long time to load the instrument panel.  Also seem to be getting strange images showing up on screen.  Hard to describe.  The nav updates constantly and that was also fixed yesterday by re-downloading the software.  Dealer said it was stuck in a downloading loop.  The nav is terrible, we call it the crazy gps because it sends us all over the place.  I hook up the android auto and use google gps instead.  12V power outlet in front center console already blew a fuse.  Never had that happen in any vehicle I have ever owned.  Door trim on driver's side passenger door replaced due to manufacturing defect.  I have begun taking pictures and videos of malfunction warnings and irregularities have been experiencing.  So I have documentation of all issues.  So far everything covered under warranty but worried about future.  Had high hopes and expectations for this suv but I already want to get rid of the vehicle.",2

Didnt even bother testing the made in mexico Audi Q5.   Far & Away, the Volvo T6 hp, torque, and highway passing performance are all superior to the other base engine suvs I tested,  & at only a modest price premium for the very impressive T6 engine, which I average 24mpg here in Denver.I’m a tablet pc user, so I really enjoy the intuitive, in dash, touch screen on the volvo, and the Heads up Display for speed & nav.  Only the jag was similar.  The Porche Macan is a low tech, dated suv, & very disappointing as a result.  My 2nd choice was the Merc GLC which is a close 2nd to the XC60 performance wise, but it can’t match the high tech in the Volvo, and could not take a class 3 trailer hitch like the volvo can.My only knocks on the volvo are  minor, ie Boot time for the screen needs to be faster,  Bliss doesn’t work with my bike on the trailer rack, The engine stop/start can’t be turned off indefinitely, Wiper switches are overly sensitive to accidental activation, sun screen is too big & slow to operate, Handling wise the car is at least 200lbs too heavy & tends to plow into corners on twisting mtn roads, and the highway collision avoidance system is a bit over sensitive at high speeds of 75+ mph.This is my first volvo car, and overall I’ve found it to be a great suv with a lot of value due to it’s balance of doing so many things well vs the competition.

We now are almost 7 months and 6,000 miles into ownership. While the seats felt comfortable at first, one round trip of 4 hours each way left my wife aching all over. The headrest is fixed. For some it will throw the head forward and for others the gap between back seat and headrest causes upper shoulder and neck fatigue. The seat bottom bolsters also are pronounced and fairly stiff. These headrest and seat features have caused my wife such significant hip and neck pain that she is seeing a physical therapist and has required her to switch to driving my Audi A6. I now have been assigned to the XC60 which was not my choice of vehicles. Until just recently we had yet to get over 24 mpg on a trip, and the city mileage rarely exceeded 15 mpg. I got 28.9 on a recent 150 mile round trip by letting the cruise control etc essentially drive the car. Access to surround camera for parking is cumbersome, as it does not engage automatically even if the car is in reverse. (Audi has a split screen) In many circumstances we need to stop the vehicle, put it in neutral, slide the screen, find the camera icon and then touch the 360 icon. Setting destinations remains hit or miss, though the Bluetooth interface with our iPhones is very good. I am still wondering whether future info system updates will improve visual effects and function. No promises have been made by dealer. We have thought of selling the car to buy or trading for another brand with more comfortable seats. Those options are out of the question because we’d take too big a financial hit off the price paid for the XC60. Our experience is that the more comfortably riding SUVs or Crossovers either do not have some of the safety and convenience features we want, or truly are not comparable or have not been given very good owner ratings. So, my wife and I decided to keep the XC60 for at least a couple years, switch cars to break in the seats for a period the seats can be better broken in. ",2

The Audi seats hurt her back so we sold it back to the dealer with less than 2000 miles on it (OUCH!). Inscription has amazing seat adjustments, features and comfort. Terrible window glare off dash during daytime unless drive wears sun glasses. Visibility is good, though the BLIS could have been made more pronounced in the side mirror. No mfg compares to Audi on the BLIS system visibility. The infotainment computer, while billed as working like an iPhone with a home button, is cumbersome, slow and difficult to learn.It takes forever to download updates, and notices of them are very misleading.  Navigation graphics, operation and search results leave a lot to be desired ( I could use a crass word but won't) especially compared to the Q5. Its choices of routes are very poor. Shuttling between screens is distracting, and the screen does hold finger prints very easily. There should be some dash button to push for the most common features, e.g. cutting off Eco mode and 360 camera. Mileage so far is not ok and disappointing. Has yet to average 20 mpg much less the advertised mileage. Interior wood trim  (driftwood because Volvo ran out of other wood grain colors) and  leather colors are limited and a bit ugly compared to all competitors. The newer electric silver exterior color is very handsome and would be prettier if the interior leather options included a true beige with walnut trim. My wife really likes the car, but I can say I barely like it.That might change after we take it on a trip. Were it not for the dealer, with whom we have had a long, wonderful relationship and is excellent, I probably would like the 2018 XC60 Inscription T6 less.

Definitely Volvo has earned his position as luxury brand. I did test drive Audi Q5, MB GLC and BMW X3. I leaned towards the Volvo, for excellent design exterior and interior, although I have to admit it was a difficult choice, except for the MB GLC which was ruled out right away due to its outdated features and poor exterior design. The XC 60 is extremelly comfortable to drive, with the Inscription trim it looks awesome, modern and offering a sense of peace and quiet inside. I will focus my review on things that should be better (hence my 4 star rate instead of 5). Some of the materials in the lower part of the dashboard, doors and central console should be of better quality for a $ 54K vehicle. Performance is its weakest part, I got the T6 because compared to Audi Q5 or BMW X3 acceleration and quick shifting was subpar on the T5, with the T6 it gets better (in dynamic mode) but still it is not an Audi, so if you are looking for spirited performance go with the Q5 or the X3. Fuel consumption is poor, and definitely below what Volvo advertises. Noisy during acceleration, once you cruise it is quiet. On the Inscription trim premium sound should be standard (as it is in the Q5), so I decided to go with the regular audio system (definitely not great sound. Go with the Bowers & Wilkins premium sound if you can afford it. It is worthy). Suspension is on the harsh side. Don't get me wrong, overall is a fantastic car, interior feeling is luxurious and safety features and infotainment is last generation. Exterior and interior design is outstanding (Audi or BMW are not closer. Their interiors are boring ).",4

Looks-- this suv is one of the best looking on the market, the body lines, wheels, thor hammer DRL's, aggressive front fascia, and LED taillights. Sick.   Performance--- This SUV pulls. Select the Dynamic mode and this thing is out.  Really tunes motor to higher revs.  I would say this is more for highway driving. really can't use  mode for city driving it's to fast. I stay in comfort mode for that and that' the default setting any way.  Steering and handling are very good no sports car but can handle it's own.  Interior--- is very comfortable and cleanly designed..  Only issues I have like others do  is the HVAC controls are thru touch screen.  I love the IPAD feel but still would like knobs and buttons. THE biggest issue is the start and stop tech, my wife and I HATE IT.  it shuts suv off to fast... you have to manually shut it off everytime you get in car and that SUCKS.

Base engine/ 8 speed is more than adequate highway or stop and go. Base interior is significantly upscale to our 2011 XC60 T6. Ride is too although maybe not as playful/connected to the road as our 2014 X3 2.8. There are times when the 2.0 of the XC60 is less refined than that of the X3, say accelerating up a long hill, but the XC60 wins in overall comfort in my opinion. I liked the lane keeping feature at first but now find it annoying. If you change lanes without signaling the car will fight with you. Luckily it can be deactivated and left off. Unfortunately, the start/stop needs to be deactivated every time car is started, requiring a couple extra swipes of center screen that gets old. Leading edge of sun roof sun screen buzzes but can be addressed by rolling it back a cm or so.

I test drove the Mercedes Benz GLC 300, Audi Q5, Jaguar F-Pace, Mazda CX-9 (X3 2018 was not available to test drive) and at the end the Volvo was the winner. To me, the design of the Volvo is the most modern and elegant of the bunch. The engine on the T5 is on par with the Base models of the other brands. (@250HP and around the same torque) The cabin set up for convenience of the driver, the blend of technology and amenities on a simple yet elegant design made the XC60 the best. I was a little concerned with the performance and almost decided to go with the T6 but I honestly could not justify the extra money, the engine performs just fine for the type of driving I do. The noise levels at highway speeds are just right, not so quiet that you fall asleep but not so loud that you can't carry a conversation. The R-design specs are certainly  worth the extra cash, the fit and finish of the seats is impeccable. The steering wheel, shifting paddles, aluminum accents, and the overall environment are just way above the German and British competition. One characteristic that I have really liked is the suspension. My only test drive was on a XC90 T5 and on that occasion I noticed some plushness to the suspension, specially when compared t my old BMW 328i. On the R-design suspension that feeling has not been present, it is firm but not uncomfortable it just feels sporty to the point that you forget you are driving a 4000lbs+ SUV. I have never owned a Volvo so the question of reliability and quality long term are still out there. Without a doubt my initial impression to this point has been 100% positive.",5

First, the power lock on the driver side door decided not to function one day, but hasn't repeated yet.  During a heavy rain, the auto folding mirrors would not fold back out after turning the car on and off several times. It later reset after being parked for an hour and I was told by the dealer to push the left and right mirror command buttons at the same time which should cause the mirrors to fold out if they are stuck. Best of all, I believe the parking break malfunctioned, triggering the check engine light to come on and the car to be undriveable. After I safely rolled into a parking lot and turned the care off and on it appears to be fixed for the time being.

There are some good things: Acceleration is great for a 4 cylinder and size of the car; Tons of cargo space + panoramic sun roof made for some luxury car camping; Very comfortable (and great gas mileage at about 30 mpg) on a 8 hour road trip; Bluetooth integration is fairly seamless (wishing the car had apple play) and the navigation system has a very nice feature where the next turn displays in the instrument panel so you don't have to keep looking back at the screen. There are many things I really love about this car, but the reliability issues have me feeling pretty disappointed. I'm glad I leased.",3

4509, on 09/23/17 04:16 AM (PDT),Dennis ,2012 Volvo XC60 SUV 3.2 4dr SUV (3.2L 6cyl 6A),Beware of Volvo!!!!!," Purchased this Volvo new and it came with a 5 yr/ 50000 mile promotional factory warranty that has just ended.  Aside from scheduled maintenance  volvo has either repaired or replaced under warranty the following: Battery twice ( car had to be towed in both times), plastic piece by rear seat headrest broke, plastic piece by rear seat fold down lever broke, AC condenser, gas gauge sending and receiving unit, rear back up camera, dash computer,rear hatch actuator,   Windshield was leaking water inside, has now developed a bad smell they believe is mildew caused by water getting under carpet from leaking windshield so they shampooed carpet, car still smells.  Based on repair history of first 5 yrs of ownership the time when the least repairs should occur it is obvious the car has issues. Now that warranty is up I contacted volvo explaining that I didn't think it fair that I find myself in a position that I pay $43000 for a car, maintain it well, has less than 50,000 miles and it appears I must sell it to avoid hefty future repairs. I asked them to  recognize that this is not their best manufactured vehicle and must be outside of what they believe is acceptable. I asked they either preferably  extend the warranty or if not provide a very good incentive to trade in on a newer volvo.  Their first response was to tell me that if any of the repairs made broke a second time they would ""consider"" at that time making the repair.  I asked to speak to the person making that decision so we could discuss and was told I cannot.  I wrote another letter to volvo a bit stronger and low and behold I received a call from the servicing dealer (Jaguar Land Rover Porsche Volvo of Greenville).   I went in and  met contact at dealer.  He looked at history and told me the following:  The car was out of service 28 days in the 5 yrs, it had been in 11 times for service in 5 yrs,  (This doesn't seem too bad however when something broke we lived with it until it was time for next scheduled service as we live about 40 min drive from dealer.)  Had I had to pay for those repairs it would have cost me approx $5000.  My feeling was that $5000 for repairs in the first 5 yrs was horrible this is when car should need to be repaired the least.  He then told me that bringing it in 11 times in 5 yrs was below average.  When I told him that Volvo cannot be proud of the repair history of this car and cannot think it is usual and customary he said that two of the repairs added to $2600 and if we separated out those two repairs the repairs history of $2400 was pretty good. While this is all going on they price my car for a trade in and give me a price of $11,000 that would be a 75% depreciation in 5 yrs  for a vehicle with no visible damage inside or out with less than 50,000 miles (kbb prices median trade in as $14,000). End result is volvo obviously feels and dealer rep has expressed to me that these repairs are normal and within acceptable limits I obviously disagree.  Also be aware that while volvo is responsive to emails you cannot speak directly with a decision maker they are shielded..Very frustrating..",1

This is our 4th Volvo since 1990. The other 3 were wagons (a 240 and 2 V70s).  The last one we bought now is about 12 years old with over 220K miles; until this past month it has required little more than routine maintenance but now it is starting to show its age.  Good price incentives in July encouraged me to buy new.  I chose the XC60 over another 70 series mostly for the styling and extra ground clearance in the XC60, and because cargo capacity isn't as big a priority for us anymore. The XC60 is a very comfortable car with supportive front seats and enough leg, shoulder and head room for my above average male body size. The drive-e engine delivers surprisingly good fuel economy for a car this heavy, yet acceleration also is more than adequate for my needs. The leather seats are beautiful, although I would have preferred the cloth upholstery that has held up so well in my old V70 for 12 years.  Another thing I miss is the fold-flat front passenger seat in the V70, which allowed me occasionally to carry long items such as lumber (but then, I wouldn't want to do that in a car this nice). The infotainment system keeps me entertained and informed with more choices than I really need. It's a little more complicated than I would have preferred and I'm afraid it will seem dated within a few years. The ""premier"" version is nicely equipped as-is, without adding expensive options.  If you're comparing alternatives, Subaru is another (less expensive) make I'd consider, especially if you want AWD.

Am coming from a 2009 X3 3.0si with stick shift.  This is the first automatic transmission I have owned in years and I am REALLY impressed with the engine/transmission combination.  Drove 200 miles on 2 lane roads the last couple of days  and did lots of passing.  Shift into sport mode and stomp on it and the acceleration is instant.  No hunting for gears at all and in sport mode the transmission really holds a gear.  Even in regular mode I've been impressed with the transmission.  Well worth the extra couple of grand for the Drive-E T6 engine.  Ride quality is very nice, better than the BMW.  Handling isn't quite as good as the X3 but is fine for the kind of driving I usually do.  I'm very happy with my choice, having looked at the X3 and Q5 too.  Much better value for the money than the X3 and wanted the extra room of the XC60 compared to the Q5.",4

The only option is the BLIS package.I drive 160 miles a day, mostly on interstate.  The XC60 is great on the highway: Smooth, fast enough, quiet, stable, and big enough to inspire confidence.  I get about 28 MPG on the highway using regular gas.  I generally cruise between 75 and 80 mph, and the XC60 is a fun, satisfying, soothing car to get home in.And while it’s not a sports car, the XC60 is also fun and comfortable on twisty back roads.  It’s small enough to feel nimble and pointable—not at all trucky.  I can’t compare it to an X3 or Q5, but it compares favorably to my previous Mazda3, especially given the Volvo’s different mission in life. Good steering feel, balance, grip, and braking.The seats are great once you get them right.  That took some doing but now I have a great position saved in memory.  The leather and other materials seem nice now, but a year-old used one I looked at had not held up well.  It had done time in New Mexico—I’m hoping the heat was a factor.The only feature I would change is the start-stop system.  It’s an interesting idea and sometimes works well, but more often is an annoyance.  It should be permanently defeatable, instead of having to be turned off every time.  I also think a back-up camera should be standard, especially from a company known for safety.  And it’s a little more rattly than the Japanese cars I’ve owned, but I kind of expected that.Overall this is a great car for me right now.  Comfortable, classy, fuel-efficient, satisfying to drive, and, as long as it’s reliable, I’m looking forward to my three daughters using up whatever’s left of it when I’m done.",4

4548, on 04/06/16 08:54 AM (PDT),alex peirce ,2016 Volvo XC60 SUV T6 R-Design 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 6A),Safety and comfort," Review for VolvoVolvo has been around for decades and have been setting the safety standard for years. Not only are volvos safe, but there also comfortable, stylish/perform well, dependable, and affordable. I am a very picky person when it comes to cars and it takes a lot for me to consider a car. When I look at buying a car I look at the overall styling of it, if it is comfortable or not, if it is dependable, but above all I look at how safe it is and in my opinion volvo blows all of these categories out of proportion.SAFETY- As I said before Volvo has been setting the safety standard for years; they have come out with everything from the three point seat belt or pedestrian detection with full auto brake to auto pilot system on cars. Volvo cares deeply about the safety of their buyers and unlike other car brands that put luxury first or convenience they put safety first. All Volvos come standard with a pre-collision system called city safety. In my opinion volvo cars are the safest cars on the road today.COMFORTABLE- Volvo also cares about how comfortable its passengers are. Volvo has gone as far to have special seats designed by orthopedic surgeons to make the ride of a volvo more comfortable. They use very nice soft to the touch materials in their cars that its passenger appreciate.STYLING AND PERFORMANCE- Volvo has sleek designs that set them apart from other auto maker from there Thor Hammer headlights to their distinctive long LED taillights. When you see a Volvo on the road (especially the new ones) you can tell it's a Volvo because of the sleek styling of it.I think that Volvo does a great job of making their cars head turners. For years Volvo did an ok job in the performance, but in the last decade they have really been improving the performance of their cars. All their cars come standard with turbocharge engines, but for those who want a little more of a driving experience like me, you can get a special line of Volvo called the R-Design. The R-designs come with special turbo engines tuned by the Swedish racing company Polestar (Polestar also tunes the suspension of the car). I own a Volvo XC60 R-Design which is a crossover and it feels like I’m driving a sports car like the Lexus IS or BMW 3 Series.Dependability- Volvos are very reliable I have never had a major issue with mine and neither have my family members who have one. There a little more expensive to work on but they’re worth it.AFFORDABILITY- Volvos have a long range of price tags, but for what they are there very reasonably priced. There prices range from lower $30,000-well over $90,000 in the U.S., but you can get a year old volvo in the 20's.",5

Not SUV like at all, as it has a nice suspension and very confident handling. Power is not bad at all with the 3.2L non-turbo engine as it likes to rev, can only imagine the turbo would be much more fun. I'm getting 21.5 mpg with all local driving and winter idling which was the most my V6 Mustang could make with mixed highway/city. The seats are very comfortable and the build is much better than the Ford I traded from. I'll keep you updated as I drive it. -well almost 2 years later and 20k miles on it. New tires, a few little scratches from the little guy and shopping carts and I still love it. So far only oil changes and a new battery is all it took.

""simply google Volvo oil consumption"", then you begin to learn...After complaining to Volvo, they offered to look at it.. after about $1500 in repairs, noting offering to change my oil trap (which i told them was already repaired and paid for), they said they did some necessary computer adjustments, and I must also purchase a new dipstick for the oil??? Didn't know why I would need a new dipstick??After getting my next oil change 5000 miles later (happily with no new warnings of low oil level), my mechanic informed me that the car now takes 8 quarts of oil, instead of 7, and the new dipstick won't trigger the computer to state low oil level.

The acceleration is excellent with the T6. The XC60's only driving quirk that bothers me is that it has a very peculiar tight turn radius.

The curbside appeal of the T6 easily competes with the Audi (in my opinion wins). The end result is this, I have friend that purchased a loaded Q5 and another that purchased half loaded X5.

4592, on 03/10/17 17:17 PM (PST),Happy owner ,2010 Volvo XC60 SUV 3.2 4dr SUV (3.2L 6cyl 6A),Love My XC90," First let me say up front that my Volvo is not 2010.  It was the youngest option and I chose it so I could share my experience owning my XC90.  I purchased my Volvo 2006 XC90 new from the dealer.  It was on the expensive side but having owned 2 used volvos prior I felt comfortable with this purchase.  So, the reason for my post is to let others interested in purchasing older XC90's would know a little about them.  I have had a wonderful experience owning mine.  It is currently 11 years old but it aged very well and looks as current as newer models.  I have 3 sons so comfort mattered.  The vehicle has adiquitly accommodated that must manyntimes on long trips.  Realibality was a absolute!  I got that also.  Not sure if my experience is unusual or not but I've noticed many other owners of the same have had not so go comments about owning theirs.  However, I only have a couple of issues to be noted.  First, I did have to replace the Turbo at about 80k.  This was the largest repair expense I've had as of yet.  Also, I learned that when this Volvo recommends the oil change frequency, it means it.  Had I paid attention to my oil changes, it would of saved my turbo and I most likely wouldn't of had to replace it.  Oil change as recommended a must!  Second:  at about 110k my Volvo started sputtering, acting hesitant at take off and it had even did on me a few times.  Problem solved very quickly and didn't cost that much.  It was my coils.  This is regular wear and replace.  Done.  Now for the features.  I have one complaint...  I do hate the headlight covers.  They are so fogged up and there is no way for them to be cleaned.  Hate them.  Volvo should have made these out of glass and not plastic.  Also, the seat adjusting systems.  Both of mine have broken and I've had to replace twice.  Just a bad designe.  Utility box in middle front seats slips from connection and lid busted at hinge.  Not so bad.  Front cup holders are not removeable so they stay dirty unless your willing to pry them out and break them.  Sirously though,  wonderful car for my family and I truly would recommend.  So sad to see that this auto didn't hold a higher value at resale.  It is really worth a lot more.  One happy Volvo owner!",5

I got it in 2010, and I got an awesome deal on it.  It was so safe, great ride...kinda heavy like a truck, but I didn't mind.  It's GREAT in the snow, I drove in horrible conditions when literally no one else was on the road because it was so awful out there, and I was 100% fine (granted I grew up driving in blizzards, so I know what I'm doing).  I've never felt safer in any other car.  The acceleration is good, the stereo is wonderful and has lots of ways to adjust it. If you are a bass person....the bass is very very good.  Now, the bad:   I swear Volvo programs/designs these cars to be fantastic until the warranty is over.  I started having so many problems when mine was done.  The batteries kept dying, I had to get three new batteries in three years, two in an 8 month period. The electronics started acting weird, and there was a mysterious leak in the windshield that I couldn't find, and the dealerships claimed they couldn't find it either, even tho every time it rained I had water dripping down my windshield. Notice that dealerships was plural? Yeah...I went to a ton of different Volvo dealerships for maintenance due to moving around a lot....and I had problems at ALL of them.  Constantly trying to rip me off, charge me for unnecessary things...they even went as far as telling me that I needed a new timing belt....when the car has a timing chain. There is no timing belt. Another thing that made me think that the car was programmed to break after the warranty was over was that every time the ""regular maintenance"" notification showed up, I noticed that if I didn't take it into the dealership fast enough, things would mysteriously start breaking.  Electronics, etc. That notification is on a timer per certain amount of miles driven. It will show up no matter whats going on with the car. It made no sense, and it never happened until the warranty was over. And I've heard the same complaint from multiple other Volvo owners.And the gas milage is terrible. I get 17 miles per gallon. Ugh.  I've heard they have improved that on the new ones tho.I now have about $8,000 worth of things to fix on the damn thing, including the rear differential, and so needless to say I'm looking for a new car.  I will miss the Volvo...she's been thru a lot with me.  But I can't swing how expensive her repairs have been, regardless of how safe she is and how well she drives in the snow.

The past year I have have had to spend over $6000 for repairs - rear differential broke, drive belt, power steering broke, brakes, electrics - it is as if the Volvo engineers designed it so that every major system would break as soon as the car was out of warranty.

You can feel the road much better compared to the non-R, but don't expect a Porsche.  This is still a cross over.  So why pay extra for the R?

For the passengers, they may find it a bit rigid off the highway, so if your passenger has influence over the purchase, bring them for the test drive.

You have to get your hands on TJ24643. It will describe the low oil level warning and how Volvo engineers fix (hide) the leak warning. Here is their thinking: Let's re-program the computer to alert at a lower oil level, then let's change out the dipstick with a longer one and move the Full/Low markings lower on the dipstick!! If the warning comes back after that, you have to haggle for a new engine.....So other than that, the car is a blast!!",5

The ride is stiff but controllable but I like sport like handling and emergency avoidance features this Volvo has as standard equipment. This is safe and only real issues is first: rear seats very tight for adults but not often used in my case. Second controls are very different from what I was used to and had a learning curve which you must study to really use them properly but having no navigation and knowing the system it is fine now. My insurance went down, the safety is great, performance great, mileage is what you expect (25 mpg highway, 17-20 city), seats very comfortable, and styling very sharp and usable space well designed. Volvo dealers are not common but close enough that it is not a problem and reliability has been good. In short I would buy this safe premium SUV again.",5

I love how fast the car drives however, I've owned the car for 6 months and its been in the shop 4x since. There was an issue with the alignment but that was resolved (I had to take it to the dealer because when I took it to firestone 2x in 2 different states the car still didn't drive straight). I then had a problem where the car would not read most of my audio files on my usb, and then if there was a whole folder that it couldn't read it would completely stop working and I needed to stop the car and turn it off and on, (sometimes that didn't resolve the issue) that issue came back 2 more times since. I've had to replace the rotors twice already. It's almost as if they make them out of plastic. I had replace them because they warped, it made the steering wheel shake violently when I went 45 mph or faster. The car is a very rough ride, so if you have back issues I would look at something else. I drove for 11 hours and by the time we got to our destination it felt like somebody took a baseball bat to my back. I was looking for a reliable AWD vehicle because I live where there is a ton of snow and ice, also the closest Volvo shop is 4 hours away so I can't exactly pop in if I have an issue. This car is not that! I don't hate everything about the car, I love how stable it is at high speeds. I live where the speed limits are 80 mph and with this car passing is no issue. When you put your foot to the floor, the car goes into cheetah mode and takes off. Its AWD system is not the best, with its 60(front)/40(back) split. My sister has an 2013 Outback and that cars AWD system is a lot better than the Volvo's, hands down. The BLIS package has some issues, it gives you false readings quiet often, that being said it saved me a few times. I have LED headlights that have the active bending feature which helps when driving at night through passes. I like this cars parking sensors, they've saved me countless times. I get 17-18 mpg around town, and 19-20 mpg on the highway however, I do have a heavy foot. I can deal with most of the issues this car has but, the rotors anger me every time I think about them. So the question is would I buy this car if I knew everything I know now? My answer most likely would be no. My reasoning is mainly that the rotors are expensive and putting down that much money so often is problematic. Not mentioning how much time this takes, last time it took the dealership 5 days to replace them. So if you are a fan of back pain, and you have money to waste, and you have all the time in the world this car is the perfect car for you! I think next time I would rather buy a V6 Subaru Outback!",3

I bought it with 52k miles at 5 yrs old and it was still eligible for the Volvo used car warranty. So far, no regrets.

The cars styling is so unique and the T5 engine smooth as can be (much smoother and more responsive than the 2.4i in the S40). It's a shame that the fuel efficiency isn't as good as what one might hope, but it is still acceptable considering the performance and overall package. Another negative for some might be the small and rather high opening of the hatch. The C30 is more of a looker hatch than one you would want to haul stuff around in. Just keep that in mind and you won't be disappointed. ",4.625

It could use some extra torque though, and you should do everything in your power to stay away from potholes (I cringe at the slam of my 18 inch wheels over concrete expansion joints), but luckily with its superb handling, you can avoid them without difficulty. The sound system is unreal, the car is just one huge menu system. Everything can be changed, adjusted, and tweaked to your exact specifications.

My previous car was a 2000 Buick LeSabre so I was looking for a vehicle that provided a similar ride but had a bit of fun factor to it. I also need a car that has good seats as I have a bad back. The car is also parked on a city street, so I wanted something smaller that could easily be parked and not get dented. I looked at a 2015 Mini Cooper S, a 2014VW GTI, and this car. The Mini was my favorite when it came to its quirky design but it ends there; the mechanics and overall comfort was pathetic for such an expensive vehicle. I also decided against it when I learned that the Hardtop failed a side impact safety test (which the dealership claimed they fixed by adding more interior padding). The next car I tried was the VW GTI. It was an okay vehicle but the ride was harsh, the seats were hard and not as supportive as older models, and the materials were just cheap (worse than the Mini and that's saying a lot). I then found my 2010 Volvo C30. The seats are impressive but I guess that's to be expected as they are the only ones in the market to be designed by orthopedic surgeons. I was greatly surprised to discover that the C30 has a softer ride than the Buick LeSabre. The car has great vision and safety, as it has large windows and is equipped with BLIS (though I have not turned it on yet). The vehicle also weighs over 4300 pounds, which is heavier by at least 1500 pounds compared to the Mini and VW. The Volvo C30 attracts a lot of attention wherever I go because of its unique design and its great engine note when starting or accelerating. The Volvo has also been very reliable with only oil changes needed. The only downside, but not really for a car this awesome, is the mileage. On premium, I can only get 22.8 mpg in mixed driving but highway mpg easily reaches 32 mpg.",5

Other than the wind noise coming from the side mirrors, the cockpit is quiet-isolating the road noise and allowing the driver to hear that throaty growl when the foot presses to the floor.  The automatic transmission is smooth- though I've only used the manual shift feature once.

I had test drove a Focus RT and a Veloster Turbo but just fell in love with the C30.  I found the build quality and ride to be so much better than the other two cars. Although mine is a barebones Model (does not even have cruise control), the prior owner had had all the work done on the car at the dealership. As such, it was very well taken care of.  Interior of the care is simple but effective. I am not a small person but find it very comfortable in the front seat. Although the back seats are supposed to be ""roomy"", I have long legs so there would be no leg room behind me. Besides, it is always a pain to get in and out of the back seat of a small coupe. As such, no one but my dog rides in the back seat. It did not take me very long to get used to the 'waterfall' control system and now find it very easy to use. Performace, the car is great. Yes, it does not get the best fuel economy but it is a performance car. If I wanted fuel economy I would have bought the Focus or the Veloster. The engine produced plenty of horse-power and I have yet to have an issue merging or passing. But what I really like is that the power and performance are matched to a great ride. I love taking this car to my parents hours (6 hours away). The looks of the car are what really drew me to it. It has a unique look that stands out in the sea of hatchbacks. However, that looks does come at a cost. The hatch itself smaller than the rest of the storage area so it does limit the size of objects you can carry in the back. Since I do not have people ride in the back seat, I can fold them down and have lots of room. Also, the large B-pillars do make it difficult to see, producing some large blind spots. The only issue I have had with this car in three years is a bad PCV. This  caused the engine to ""whistle"" as well as the check engine light to come on. It was not exactly a cheap fix (I had the dealer fix it) but it is all good now. If you have a Volvo with this engine and you hear the engine ""whine"" or ""whistle"" then get it to a repair shop quickly as delaying could cause my greater damage. (I was able to avoid that.) But given that this is a 7 year old used car, I guess that is not bad. I would recommend this to anyone wanted a fun hot hatch (either with no kids or small kids).",5

The 6 spd manual is fun to drive and it does carry a sleek look that is not too common. However I am missing the rear wheel drive fun of my last vehicle (mercedes c230). Really satisfied about the 5 yr bumper- to-bumper, 5 yr maint plus wear and tear I got with this purchase. ",4.375

It was similar to my SAAB-aru in handling and quickness but has a quieter ride and with more safety features. I was very impressed with everything about this car. I especially liked the six speed manual trans.,4.75

The C30 is all of these. This unique vehicle looks  and drives like a sports car; yet, there is still room for kids or pets. My car came loaded with features I really did not think I needed, but now I have discovered that the bluetooth is heaven; the moon roof lights up my ride; the heated seats are cool and the stereo  makes for a sweet commute.  I love my new C30!",4.875

Solid ride, nimble handling, low road noise, comfortable and ergonomic for driver, and styling is a standout from the rest of the crowd.  Interior, dash, & instrumentation is clean and utilitarian.

Nice balance between comfort and performance.  Will do the daily commute in style while still offering some great spirited driving when the whim strikes.  Can work as a family care for small families.  My kids love riding in it.  Cargo is small, but 3 Staples copy paper boxes fit in a single layer with the seats up.  Not huge space, but very usable.  Width will allow a McLaren folding stroller to just fit.  Great storage around the spare tire for all those things you should have like jumper cables and ice scrapers but don't need just floating around the car.  Basically a well thought out little luxury car.",4.75

Drove a truck.  Was perfect when I got it, but now I have wife, kids, dog, and commute.  I needed a practical car, but needed to carry the family on occasion, carry the dog, make dump runs, tow, and be comfortable day to day.  I'd also like something fun that had a little power, but not a huge engine.  I knew I wanted a small luxury type car, but they are almost absent in the USA.  Especially in a hatchback (for the dog).  But in looking at the Mazda 3, I found out about the Ford C1 platform and the fact that the Mazda, Volvo, and European Ford Focus are built on it.  This is the car I was looking for.  Nothing else fit",4.75
4844, on 01/14/09 04:53 AM (PST),wm ,2009 Volvo C30 Hatchback T5 R-Design 2dr Hatchback (2.5L 5cyl Turbo 6M),Fun Car," Caveat this review with the fact I've only owned the car for a week, and I'm still on a buzz from buying it. The manual is incredibly fun to drive, and very smooth. I highly recommend the R-design; it's well worth the money. Cosmic Wht w/ Brwn body kit looks phenom'l, but hard to find at a dealer. It is not a utilitarian vehicle, as the rear bumper is too high and big, and other cars offer more interior space, but it's a great little sports car. More hp/less weight/better mpg than a V6 Mustang. Comfort inside is top notch. Driver views are very good.  I did a 1300+ mile trip right after purchase and it holds 80mph easily at 2700rpm. It accelerates the same at 40mph as it does at 70. Fun.",4.875

Yes, there were cheaper cars I was considering, such as a VW Rabbit, but I am now beginning to appreciate the upscale craftsmanship that makes my Volvo a really fine car.  I am also beginning to appreciate that as a Volvo owner, I am now part of a demographic of more conservative and mature drivers.",4

Love the power even with the auto trans, especially the down-low torque, and all the electronic goodies (Dynamic audio, sat radio, iPod).  And oh, those Volvo seats! Incredibly comfortable on my 1-hr commute.  My wife and I both get lots of compliments on the car's appearance, especially the all-glass hatch. I hate driving cars that everyone else has, and to date I've only seen two other C30s on the road. Huge cache factor. Respectable gas mileage (23 mpg avg on a mix of city/hwy driving). And no need for premium! Get the R-design package, it really makes the car's appearance pop.",4.875
