This is much nicer and more comfortable that my old Azure or myFerrari 360 moddena. If you have the money buy nothing but the best the Rolls Royce. ",4.125

If you appreciate atttention to detail, you will admire all aspects of the automobile.  It is also very quitely responsive and powerful.  Everything you would hope for in a rolls.",4.875
2, on 04/21/06 00:43 AM (PDT),Bimmer Boy ,2006 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Luxury Can't Get Any Better," I love this car. I'm usually not into big cars, in fact I've never owned a car much bigger than a BMW 3-Series until this thing.  Driving it makes you feel so prestigious and good. For a big car, it turns pretty quickly and can turn pretty sharp.  It won't take the corners like a Porsche, but I've never driven anything this big that handles this well. Sit in the backseat an no one will know you're there.  There's a big piece of metal to hide your face.  Floor it all the way and you will realize that you can still have a conversation at normal volume.  There is hardly any noise in the cockpit and no vibrations at all. This car has no body roll ethier. The backseat is big enough to store a small car in.",4.75

I took it for a spin, came back, and paid cash.  I love the looks that I get when I ride through the Bay Area.",4.875

If given the opportunity, go drive this phenom at your nearist dealer.  Not only are you buying the car, you are buying the dealership.",4.875
5, on 12/18/05 20:00 PM (PST),Aqiureror ,2006 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),The Great Car," Upon test driving the Rolls Royce Phantom, I must say it has remarkably better handling than the Maybach 57. The car is nimble and responsive, although power is subdued for enhanced comfort. The greatest phenomenon upon my short drive is the remarkable handling of the car; the chassis mitigates its weight and bulk, providing the driver and the passengers with remarkable comfort and little body roll even in fast sharp corners. Upon intense acceleration and at high speeds, there is absolutely no noise in the cockpit and absolutely no vibration. The lack of vibration is thanks to a remarkable dual floor system, so the floor is not connected to the chassis. This is a great car.",3.5

7, on 02/24/14 08:04 AM (PST),bjmcal ,2004 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),worst car i have ever owned," I have spent appx $85000 on repairs on this car not to mention $16,000 while it was still under warranty, I only have 52,000 miles on it. I have replaced the floor mats once because they turned green and they are green again and ripped and torn. The rear view mirror is turning black and will have to be replaced soon. The leather seats look like I have put 200,000 miles on them and are all cracked and wrinkled. The hydraulics to hold the hood up are shot and most of the repairs have been electrical and oil leaks. I have had to replace the shocks 3 times and air bags. I rarely drive it over 40 miles per hour with an occasional trip on the freeway. Rolls Royce does nothing and customer service sucks.",1
8, on 04/11/07 19:04 PM (PDT),Carlos Marrero ,2004 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Just Awesome!," When I finally reached the point in my life last year that I could afford one of these monsters, I jumped at the chance. This is by far and away the finest sedan I have ever owned and I have had several(S600,750il,S55 to name a few)The Phantom is an order of magnitude better. The main thing that I still can't get over is the level of comfort that Rolls has achieved with this car. On a recent road trip to Miami, I practically fell asleep driving down 95s in the middle of the day. The leather is just remarkable,as is the woodwork. While not as fast as the V-12 Germans, the car weighs 1000lbs more than the S600 and 760li. This car really hustles regardless of the extra pounds. I love it!",4.625
9, on 07/11/06 02:26 AM (PDT),NPW ,2004 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Fabulous, Simply the very best automobile I have ever driven or owned.  The comfort and ease of driving is fabulous.,4.875

13, on 04/05/07 08:28 AM (PDT),The Man ,2007 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan EWB 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),The Ultimate in Luxurious Automobiles," While I have only owned this car less then one calendar year, I have truly gotten to know her. Her name in my mind is the ""Queen of Luxury"" (all my cars have names). I have a driver, which is important to note because driving a phantom, and being driven in a phantom are two completely different things! The car is very heavy, but for its immense mass, she handles quite well. Fuel economy is miserable, but when you can spend nearly 400,000 on a car, you can most likely afford the gas. The back seat, which is where I spend the majority of my time when I am in the car, is as comfortable as my house, if not a little more. I chose the cinema configuration, which I believe was the best choice.",4
14, on 05/04/05 13:07 PM (PDT),Wonderful Automobile ,2005 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Lap of Luxury," Having both driven and been a passenger in this car, the 2005 Rolls-Royce Phantom is perfect for anyone. You never feel like you are driving an automobile that weighs 6,000 lbs.  It provides passengers with tons of lucury.",4.75
15, on 04/21/05 21:33 PM (PDT),Donald Kress ,2005 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Phantom 2005, The 2005 Rolls-Royce Phantomis a joy to drive.  It handles like a much smaller car.  The turning radius is very good for a car of this size. the fit and finish are pure Rolls Royce.,4.5
16, on 02/17/05 19:34 PM (PST),Cam janowski ,2005 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan Base 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),The Phantom Review, My 2005 Rolls-Royce Phantom is better than the Maybach 62 which I also have and enjoy.  The Phantom is a great car.  I cannot wait for the 100ex to arrive.,4.875
17, on 02/11/10 15:20 PM (PST),Richard Smith ,2009 Rolls-Royce Phantom Sedan EWB 4dr Sedan (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Deep Regret," I deeply regret buying this junker. Complete waste of 300K. Even though it is superb in comfort and performance, it does not make up for the monstrous handling, the guzzling of fuel( Have to stop at nearly every single gas station, extremely annoying ) and most of all THE UGLY EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR!!! I still cant believe that I bought this hunk of Junk.",2.875
18, on 03/09/17 02:29 AM (PST),Duane ,2011 Rolls-Royce Ghost Sedan 4dr Sedan (6.6L 12cyl Turbo 8A),Rolls Royce Ghost - The Best Car In The World?," If you want ultimate luxury you can drive, then look no further.  Rolls Royce Ghost is in a class of its own! The fit and finish is like nothing you have ever seen. Drive one and you will see. Driving it is like floating on a magic carpet.",5
19, on 07/10/10 14:14 PM (PDT),Henry Smith ,2010 Rolls-Royce Ghost Sedan 4dr Sedan (6.6L 12cyl Turbo 8A),Fantastic," Overall I am very pleased with this car. Former owner of a regular Phantom, which handled horribly. If you are gonna be chauffeured the rear seat in the ghost is actually larger then the Phantoms, which just shows you what good a car this is.",5
20, on 07/10/10 11:13 AM (PDT),Dan Gregory ,2010 Rolls-Royce Ghost Sedan 4dr Sedan (6.6L 12cyl Turbo 8A),Absurd Handling," This car is good all around, but the handling is simply horrible. It is almost impossible to park without hitting something. More special light weight parts should be used to make it handle better",5
21, on 07/09/10 11:40 AM (PDT),Capuchi Fentini ,2010 Rolls-Royce Ghost Sedan 4dr Sedan (6.6L 12cyl Turbo 8A),Good Vehicle- For Summer," All in all, this vehicle is simply amazing. The ride is way better than my previous car a S65 AMG. I have yet to notice ANY wind or road noise at all. Only thing I miss is the handling, but what do you expect from such a Vehicle this large and heavy. Quality is what you would expect from such a nice car- top quality material throughout, the finest leather, the best grained wood, and everything else is of only the best quality. One major issue though, no AWD! I can only use this car during the warmer parts of the year. I have to use a second car (BMW 750i Xdrive) during winter. Even though that's a great vehicle, it or nothing else can come close the the Rolls.",5
22, on 06/03/10 13:02 PM (PDT),bob whalen ,2010 Rolls-Royce Ghost Sedan 4dr Sedan (6.6L 12cyl Turbo 8A),Good Car," This car completes my colecton of Rolls Royces. I own a phantom, drop head coupe, coupe, phantom extended wheel base, and now the ghost. This one is far the best. Much better then the rest in handling, looks, and interior design. A definite buy.",5
23, on 03/18/10 16:44 PM (PDT),jimbo ,2010 Rolls-Royce Ghost Sedan 4dr Sedan (6.6L 12cyl Turbo 8A),OMG," Ok - I've had 3 Bentleys and hold onto my GTC - but this is an amazing automobile.  All the good things from BMW parent - and the ""coach builder"" bits from venerable RR.  Terrific.",4.625
24, on 09/19/06 18:46 PM (PDT),nomind ,2001 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.4L 12cyl 5A),Best Value for the Money," I bought this beauty for $46,000 two months ago. It rides great and I love the hand-sewn hides and sheepskin / cashmere interior. Now all my Porsche driving buddies have something to think about when I drive up to the ballpark.",4.75

Even the Four Seasons prefers to keep it out front. The car is lovely to ride in, and reasonable to drive. A vast improvement from the previous versions (Silver Spur). The BMW engine is excellent. In fact, this is truly the better car when compared to the Bentley counterpart with its older technology engine.",4.25

Not only does it have the prestige attached to it, it's fun to drive as well. It's a bit large, but I like it much better than the Bentley I used to have. It handles well for a car its size, which pleasantly suprised me.",5
28, on 02/06/09 19:08 PM (PST),Mike ,2008 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe Convertible 2dr Convertible (6.7L 12cyl 6A),"Not a bad car, all considering"," I drive my drophead to work and back and in traffic it performs ok. I had some trouble getting the stereo right but the manual helped out--not as easy as you'd think! I'd recommend the car but definately think about getting the brushed hood--make a big difference.  Not decided however about the leather options.  Maybe eggshell would have been better but I'm pretty happy... LOL!  Don't bother going to the store with it, etc, since storage isn't all that for groceries and such. Suitcases, if you're travelling these days would be better since they don't go up so high.  The drink holder are excellent. Perfect for the big gulp to the frappacino.",3.5
29, on 02/06/09 12:01 PM (PST),shai-shai88 ,2008 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe Convertible 2dr Convertible (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Wow," I bought a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead coupe becauce I was tried of driving a Lexus. So I went to Clearwater to check out the Phantom, but the price was way high so I went there 5 months later and bought the Phantom coupe for 407,342 dollars and the Phantom drives so smooth it's like your driving on air. I love my rolls Royce!",4.75
30, on 10/01/08 20:31 PM (PDT),Matt ,2008 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe Convertible 2dr Convertible (6.7L 12cyl 6A),It could be WAY better," If you are a person that loves luxury features like a voice-activated navigation system, 12-disc CD/DVD changer, massaging seats, voice- activated 14-way seats, voice- activated heat / air conditioning in car, adaptive cruise control, universal cell phone reception, and remote start, you will love this Phantom Convertible, which contains all of the above, and then some. Even though it's 6,000 pounds, it gets to 60mph in 5.4 seconds, which is not terribly impressive, but it is ridiculously impressive for such a huge car. Fuel economy is that of a World War II battleship, and it's still overpriced by a good $100,000, but it's a decent (not anything special) car if you have the money.",2.875
31, on 08/29/10 14:36 PM (PDT),Wheelman4000 ,2010 Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe Convertible 2dr Convertible (6.7L 12cyl 6A),Skip the drophead coupe!," The drophead coupe is like it looks like in the pictures. A phantom ewb hardtop but a convertible. Do not buy a rolls convertible. 1, total waste of money. 2, it gets dirty easily because the interior is meant to be covered.  3, rarely any of the colors that you can choose for the exterior look good with the shape of the car (see if you go to Rolls Royce dealership.) And lastly, TERRIBLE gas mileage (as all rolls have.) The size of the vehicle makes the car worse. ",4
32, on 02/20/18 12:04 PM (PST),GJ ,2017 Rolls-Royce Wraith Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.6L 12cyl Turbo 8A),There is no question-this is the best car made, Expect people to stop you and ask about this car. You will be seen driving this car. It is not a daily driver for instance you will not drive this car to Wal Mart. It's performance and design is the best I have ever seen. It is hand made with technology that is superior to most. The warranty is superior to most. It is covered bumper to bumper. It includes all maintenance. When it is time for routine maintenance  the dealer comes with a covered trailer and trailers it to the dealership. All maintenance   is included for the first four  years. Sirius radio with every thing is included for the first four years. I have had the car for over one year and absolutely no problems with it.,5
