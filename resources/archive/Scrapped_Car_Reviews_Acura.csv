0, on 11/10/17 22:53 PM (PST),V MEL ,2014 Acura RLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Good car," This Acura RLX  has been a great vehicle for my family. The good part of the ownership experience is the size of this car. I am 6'-2"" and I am very happy with the legroom I have on both front and rears seats. The car is much more roomier  than appears on outside. I can complement on the quality of the interior materials; it is made very nice, the cabin is surrounded by by soft materials wrapped in the high quality leather; there are not many plastic parts around like in the similar class Lexus car. Very comfortable large seats, I like them better and think they are more comfortable than E-class Mercedes; nice large armrests. The control buttons and vents don't seem wear off like on most of European luxury cars.  This car has a very sensitive breaks; it will stop dead in a very short time. One of the best features I like is the headlights. The optics of the headlights  ""jewel eye"" look very attractive and deliver one of the best driving experiences at night; road signs reflections look  like LED TV screens.  Infotainment system is great and very easy to use. I found it much more convenient than E-class Mercedes. I like rolling volume control on the steering wheel instead of + -- volume bottoms. I like touch screen and how it gives vibrating feedback. I don't know why so many ""expert"" reviews are complaining about how confusing the infotainment system is. I found it very easy to use. I like the climate control in this car. The front seats heat up very fast and air fans are very quiet in a high mode, unlike Mercedes or BMW. The average gas mileage is 23 mph in mixed city/highway use which is very very good for this size car with 310 hp engine.  So far I don have any mechanical or electrical problem with this car.  Very, very reliable car 5+++.          Now about the negative experience: First, suspension, suspension, suspension. The car drives like an Amish buggy on a bumpy road. 19 inch wheels with low profile tires make it even worst. The rear suspension is so stiff it sends pain in my spine every time the car goes over a bump. It is far from a luxury riding experience. I wish they have sport and comfort suspension modes to switch. I think this stiff suspension helps to transmit road noise to the car's body even though Acura advertises its noise cancellation technology and hollow wheels which suppose to reduce the road noise. However, I cannot say there is much road noise, but I am sure Mercedes E an Cadillac CTS is more quiet.   Second is the gear shifting. It is also rough. When I try to accelerate fast, every time the gear shifts it rocks my body back and forth.  Third, is the gear ratios. The car quickly goes to very high RPM during even mild acceleration. It creates unnecessary engine noise and makes it hard to control the car on the road.  During ""normal"" driving mode the car acts like most of luxury cars would act in the ""Sport"" transmission mode. Forth, is the line departure alarm, blind spot and breaking warning alarms. I wish Acura change it from beeping sound warning alarm to vibration warning like it is done in Cadillac or Lexus cars. When I listen to music or radio, all these warnings become useless; I just cannot hear the beeping warning sound while music is playing. Fifth, the exterior assembly quality. The body parts are not lined as is suppose to be lined. Rear trunk lid does not line with rear fenders, I checked with dealer and it appears on all 2014 RLX models. Front hood/fender gaps are not consistent.  It gives an impression like this car has been in a car rack and having some frame damage.  After driving this car for 115K the P-AWS RTC actuators began to moan when making small turns. It is not critical, but I know I have to replace them soon. The bottom line is: I like this car and I think I will keep it for a couple more years. I would not recommend this car for a person who likes comfortable Cadillac-style ride. However, for a younger person who likes to drive fast alone, for aggressive  driving style it could be a good choice.",4

Car has low resale value as my experience does not appear to be unique.  So I have to chalk this up to a very expensive lesson.  While the car is disappointing the response of the dealership and Acura/Honda customer service was more  disappointing.  Acura buyer beware.  You are welcome to contact me and I can share the details of my experience and point you at my files and the videos of the problems I have had.Dave Pap Rocki, [contact info removed]",1

The only two gripes I have are (1) the low profile tires result in a ride that is busier than should be of a luxury car, and (2) at 6'1"", my head just barely misses hitting the headliner.",4
4, on 11/02/15 18:50 PM (PST),SS ,2014 Acura RLX Sedan Navigation 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),"Overall, great car but it does have some problems"," I'm very happy with the performance, handling, ergonomics and fuel efficiency. The only major complaint I have is with the battery going dead when the car sits for more than 2 days. I suspect it's a parasitic draw, possibly from the HFL module. Taking it back to the dealer and plan to leave it with them until they fix it. Apparently this is a problem with Acuras and I will not recommend buying this model, or any of the other ones, until they address it.",3
5, on 10/23/15 23:45 PM (PDT),Jacqueline Scott ,2014 Acura RLX Sedan Navigation 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),"Drives Great ""IF"" You Can Get it to Start!"," Purchased my 2014 RLX in May 2014.  Other than the fact that the engine was kind of loud, and the car did not come with a spare tire of any kind, I was in love with my RLX the first time I drove it.  My favorite feature is the All Wheel Steering; I love the way the car handles.  What I don't love is that something keeps draining the battery.  The first time my car failed to start was in Jan 2015, eight months after I purchased it.  This happened again in Sep 2015. The car was completely dead both times; wouldn't make a sound.  I had to call Acura roadside assistance to jumpstart the car each time.  The car was taken to the dealership after each incident and they could not find what was causing the battery to drain, or any other problem with the vehicle.  I have also had problems with the touch screen going blank, Forward  Collision Warning activating for no reason,  the Bluetooth/phone screen not responding, and voice activation not working properly.  The Navigation system doesn't work very well either, once you ""finally"" figure out how to use it.  I have had several problems trying to get the system to find addresses.  The search feature doesn't do a good job of keying in on your current area for requested searches, not to mention, maps are outdated.  As much as I like the Acura RLX, It is unreliable, so I would not recommend it to a friend or anyone else for that matter.",4
6, on 07/24/14 10:15 AM (PDT),billg8 ,2014 Acura RLX Sedan Navigation 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Really Good Car," This car is alot better than reviewed from my perspective. I think the issue is this:This DOES NOT compete with the BMW 5 series or MB E-Class (regardless of what Acura would like)...really more like Lexus, Infiitniti or Lincoln based on my experience.That said, based on actual purchase price-- strong discount to MSRP/Invoice so well below BWM/MB this is a high quality, nice driving (love teh AWS) vehicle. My personal feeling is, while not flashy, the car is also sophisticated looking. So far I'm very pleased with the overall package",4.75
7, on 05/07/14 16:15 PM (PDT),s_sc ,2014 Acura RLX Sedan Advance Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Bad design or bad quality?," I bought my RLX-ADV about 4 months ago and only put on about 1500 miles so far. I have already took it back three times for repair. There were iPhone 4S issue (automatic dial out and hang out), low battery and charging system warning sign(happened in less than first 50 miles), and camera too hot/LDW, LKAS shut down (90 degree outside) during driving. Dealer recharged the battery, but no action to other issues. Dealer and Acura insisted the shut down is the proper action by design. SF Bay Area is known for good climate. The LDW, LKAS shut-down happened multiple times in April. I really wonder what the car would do in Summer! Update on May 2016:Here are updates on the issues I reported. After two battery charging visits,, my dealer finally declared that it had a bad battery. I got a new battery in less than 12 months since owning the car. The charging issue was resolved. I do not have any phone issue now, either. It went away after I upgraded my phone to iPhone 6S. Honestly, this might be a problem of Apple, not Acura. However, the most important LDW & LKAS shut-down persists! It consistently shutting down these important safety features when outside temperature is around 90 degrees. I gave up fighting with Acura since they insisted this is a necessary precaution to protect the delicate electronic system. I am really disappointed. I spent extra money on this car since it was promised with these safety features. Acura sold me an ill-designed product that takes protection of car as priority over the driver!Update on May 2017:The LDW & LKAS shut-down is still a big problem! I have already experienced twice this year. Both times occurred when the temperature went up to low 90's. I am an unsatisfied customer of Acura!",3

Brought it to the dealership and they couldn't find anything wrong with it. Dealership reported service rep had the same problem but worse after 7k miles. After another 2k miles the rattles increased in frequency and loudness from all 4 wheels. Dealership replaced front struts which resolved a majority of the rattle but the rear rattle persisted. After another visit, the replaced the rear rattle. The rear is better but now the front is ever present over every bump. When I had a 2014RLX loaner the vehicle had the same issue as both mine and the service reps car. Cant believe engineering isn't all over this issue. Beware of RLX.",2.625

My wife got the '13 Lexus GS 350, which is very nice, but I needed more testosterone.I was very surprised when I test drove the RLX as most of the reviews by the 'experts' were average at best.. It is a perfect fit for me. Bigger inside than my TL and the Lexus 350. Lots of room in the back seat. The control panel is much more intuitive than my TL. The ride is plenty smooth, the transmission feels great shifting in all gears, A/C is perfect. I really enjoy driving it. I leased it and did not know until I was handed the keys it comes with a great Roadside Assistance Pkg. basically covers everything. ",4.25

And I Like It!," Acura plays by no one elses rules as far as I can tell.Every competitors car that Acura claims the Acura RLX competes with is either rear wheel drive or all wheel drive.The RLX is front wheel drive with Rear Wheel Precision Steer.Initial marketing reasons would conclude its silly for Acura to say they compete with those other cars, but the truth is when you drive the RLX and feel how wonderfully precise it is and how nice the drive is you have to ask yourself why would I want all wheel drive with more things to break and horrible fuel economy.I have had my RLX now for 1000+ miles and I love it.The more I drive it the more I love it.I have owned Lexus LS430, ES300h, BMW...

This car is a lot quieter, rides better/smoother, has better visibility, and interior materials. The BMW hype is just that! I love this Acura RLX Advanced.",5
16, on 04/18/17 14:36 PM (PDT),Acura host ,2017 Acura RLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Unfairly Overlooked and Ridiculously Underrated!," I test drove just about every luxury sedan in this price range--BMW, Audi, Lexus, Infinity, Porsche (suv), and some midlevel sedans as well, and I can honestly say this is the best one out there.  Why?  Well,....it depends on what you want.  I wanted Quality (I've always loved the way Acura's drive and last), Safety (NHTSA and IIS best ratings --with suite of safety features), Visibility (you can actually see out of the car and over your shoulder), Dependability (not one issue with it for over a year),  and Ease of Driving (the smoothest engine and most maneuverability I've come across), ---(btw, the steering IS very connected to the road and incredibly sporty for a large sedan).  Not to mention--- the roomy, rear seat, , the quiet cabin, the improved suspension, the way it climbs a hill and never downshifts, not to mention its' classic, elegant appearance.  The RLX is a fantastic vehicle and it's a shame that it doesn't get more love in the press.  Read reviews from actual owners!!  Test drive it yourself, and you'll be extremely surprised in the best possible way.  Pricing is high, but check around to get a good deal.  They are out there.  There is nothing sedate about this top notch sedan.  It is thee hidden jewel at Acura!",5

I wanted a car that had good performance, fuel economy, and semi-autonomous driving features.  I looked at BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac, and Acura.  I choose the Acura RLX Hybrid because of Traffic Jam Assist, good fuel economy, and fantastic acceleration.  I have had the car two months and have put on over 3,000 miles in that time.  So far, I average 30 mpg.  Occasionally, I put the car in Sport mode, but I usually leave it in the standard drive mode.  In both modes, the car has very good acceleration; however, if you want the best acceleration put it in Sport mode.  I use Traffic Jam Assist daily.  It works best if you get in a freeway lane that does not have a lot of cars trying to merge in.  The system sometimes is slow to respond to a car that darts in front of you.  I have used the TJA to drive all the way from south Austin to north San Antonio and had to take control only once or twice.  I highly recommend this car.  I recommend that you ensure you are ok with the infotainment system and that you are fine with the small trunk before you buy.",5

Same for navigation - not showy but it does the job. The driving aids (lane keeping etc.) and ride are outstanding, and it is fast when you want it to be. Excellent value but I bought it because I liked it better than the Audi S5 I was considering. Great car for mid-west mixed driving. Way under-rated model.",5

22, on 07/17/16 00:30 AM (PDT),Paul Kif ,2015 Acura RLX Sedan Advance Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Luxury Sedan for everyday use!," I got this car back in April 2015. I have 9k miles on it now. Car drives without any issues whatsoever. When driving around 70 miles on the freeway car gets about 34mpg, even though by the book it is 31mpg. Mixed driving I get 26-27mpg, which is great considering how big car is. Car is definitely not the softest on the planet, since I saw few people complain about it, which is true I agree with that, however car is luxury/sport and some sport cars are not the most soft cars out-there. I really like a lot of standard options such as LED Headlights, P-AWS rear wheel steering technology 19"" luxury wheels, acoustic windshield and front glass and etc., This car is definitely worth getting considering car cost a lot less than competition with similar options, less by about 15k. Also retail value always nice on Acuras and reliability is good if you think to keep car for longer than 5 years. In my opinion car looks much better than Lexus GS and boring looking Audi A6. Acura looks very beautiful, one of my favorite looking car in it's class.",5

24, on 11/24/15 10:09 AM (PST),TMW ,2015 Acura RLX Sedan Advance Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Great Car," Just to give a little backround, my last two cars were a Lexus GS and an Acura RL.  I did not like my Lexus at all and got rid of it after less than two years.  I had that Lexus in the shop 7 times in those two years for various problems.  Up until then, I had pretty much owned only Toyota or Lexus.  In 2008, I decided to get the Acura RL to replace the Lexus GS.  The Acura RL treated me very well for 6 years until I gave it to my daughter.  When it was time to get a new car, I considered many different luxury brands but kept coming back to Acura.  So far, I have 24,000 miles on the car.  I can honestly say, this is the best car I have ever owned.  I look forward to driving it everyday.  There were a couple of recalls which were easily taken care of...I was not having problems before the recalls.  If I had to do it again, I would not hesitate to get the RLX.  I would love to have the hybrid version but it was not available when I bought my car.  I had a deposit for one with the dealer but after waiting a year, they finally told me they weren't sure when they would available.  I guess that would be my one complaint with Acura...they had a predicted release date for the hybrid and it kept getting delayed and there was no information available as to if and when they were going to come out with the car.",5

I just ordered my second RLX after finishing a three-year lease. Initially, I was quite surprised at how much I liked this car.

This car is awesome," First, any ""Expert"" that is paid to write an article about a car should have to drive one of the cars for a month, then write their opinion. This clown who was an independent writer for Forbes, says the 2016 Acura RLX is one of the worst 10 cars to buy. Seriously? A 5 Star safety rating in every category, phenomenal company (Acura makes a lemon?) incredibly smooth, quiet, has great acceleration, is sexy, sleek, but doesn't have the perception as a racecar like a BMW ( had one, and it sucked, unless you LIKE being in the repair shop all the time), so it gets hammered before it is even proven?  This Acura RLX is  so fun to drive, whether a short jaunt or a multiple hour trip, it is outstanding in spite of what a non-owner tries to tell you. Expect to but it $10K under MSRP. The technology package is nice, the visibility is great, and I'd rather have a DEPENDABLE, SAFE car like this than a slightly faster BMW that will break down, or Mercedes (Turbo charged 4 cylinders are stupid if you want a car long-term) sedan unless you buy 500. Acura has a reputation as dependable and reliable, and this is still true.",5

We did wind up test driving basically every car at the Acura dealership as well as checked out comprable Lexus sedans as well as the Accord (our historical default choice).  Now that we've driven the car for about 5 weeks, our intial impression: its fantastic!  I deliberately left the ""value"" category blank as its certainly in a very different class than other cars we've purchased in the past. (Frankly we'd consider that the Accord is a great ""value"".)   Thus far, we've been thrilled with the RLX Hybrid.  Its comfortable for long and short rides, quite sporty and, when driven a bit aggressively/sport mode, will certainly demand the driver's attention to keep the shiny side up.  The safety features are amazing (CMBS,LKAS, etc).  The safety features as well as the tech features did require some a bit of study, but now I find it very intuitive.  Overall an outstanig car!",5

Currently at 14k miles.  No major glitches.  Controls are intuitive and easy to master.   However, Playing XM stations are glitchy and very slow to load, for scrolling;  as are obtaining music from your USB FlashDrive.  Push Button shifting, especially reverse, is slow to engage (1 sec) on press of accelerator.  Hybrid system is absolutely awesome, but comes with sacrifice of trunk space.  Engine is very quiet when switching between electric motors and engine running; transfers between each completely unnoticed except for the RPM needle moving, ......this hybrid is much different than those gas saving German models which ""die"" at a stop sign, then restart.  Very comfortable and rides well.  Power distribution lives up to the ""rides on rails""  marketing motto.  Would definitely buy again, and recommend.",5

First when i got my first tire rotation the stud broke it wasn't a big deal then water kept getting into my tail light and the dealer said it had a bad seal. After that the struts went bad. Then finally around 40,000 miles the motor had a catastrophic failure. A rod bent causing two 3"" holes in the block and basically they said it needed a new motor which would cost 10,000 dollars to install. And since the dealer could not find what caused it they said the warranty would not cover it. So i just simply let them have the car back bc i wasn't paying for a piece of junk car.",3

It's a 5 speed Tiptronic automatic with a 2.0 L4 Vtec engine.  The car also handles great and easy to make lane changes.  Since the car is pretty light, it doesn't need a huge displacement engine to make it go fast, although a turbo would be nice aftermarket upgrade for those who had the type-s model.  I don't usually like 4 cylinder engines, but this one is quite a bit larger than most (Most are 1.6 L).  It's also quite a bit torquey for one as well (can get it to squeal on brisk acceleration).  The '05/'06 Models have the upgraded lighting and wheels which give it more of a luxurious look then previous years.",4.125

Great condition and lots of fun to drive on my 8-mile commute on a bendy highway, but it lacks some pretty basic features like a remote hatch release.  I've owned Hondas exclusively since I turned 16 and each one, even my old '83 Accord SE, had a lever to pop the trunk from the driver's seat.  The plastic sun visors feel cheap, and there's not as much storage for odds and ends as I'd like.  Overall, I prefer the interior of my previous '98 Accord EX coupe for features but the leather seats offer great support and comfort in the turns.  Engine and performance in the RSX blow the Accord away.  Better mileage and acceleration? Well worth the price.",4.75

At top speed is pretty smooth and stable along with shifting the whole way, pretty good for a 5M base but there's always aftermarket for those days when you wanna get up and go.

As for the lights, my explorer had them, so why not this? As for the sound system, there is no stock system that could ever compare to a decent after market system; and as for the throttle response, if it were a huge issue I would have gotten a manual transmission.

The car lacks any insulation resulting in road noise.  You need a powerful stereo just to avoid hearing the road noise.  That said, the stereo lacks any sounds quality.   The ""leather"" seats are partially vinyl which crack very easily.  The ignition lock is placed in the lowest part of the steering column.  As a result, my legs hit the keys. The design of the door windows is really solid... not.  When you roll up the windows, the side of the door moves.

Be aware though that the RSX and from what I have learned the TSX have issues with the front struts.  The right front strut on my car began making noise at 500 miles, now at 7200 miles and no fix yet from the minds in Japan.

The warranties, customer service and quality of these cars are second to none.  I needed a daily driver that was sporty, reliable, held its value, and got great gas mileage at a good price. The RSX was all these things. I'm extremely happy with my purchase. I'm in Pa and averaging 31-32 mpg with a little spirited driving in that number.  The car gives all its power in the 5- 7k rpm range. It's quite a sound at that rpm. I wanted the S-Type but the insurance premiums made it unrealistic, not to mention having to use Premiums gas.

That said, it does have some negatives.  Mine came with red paint that after 4 years was severely faded. Had it repainted.  I'm 6' and of average build and weight and found the seats very uncomfortable. I'm also an upholsterer. I rebuilt and reupholstered the seats in a faux suede (were leather). They are now comfortable.  Like most Hondas, excessive road noise. I completely removed the interior and applied sound deadening materials. This insulated the cabin to outside noise, but road noise will still be transmitted into the cabin. The project goal: create a luxury sport coupe. Goal shortfall: road noise.  ",4.5

Lots of room for sports gear! - when I feel the need for speed, IVTEC gets me up to an illegal speed in short order, and the handling is superb - Fuel economy is pretty good even if you occasionally open it up. - the interior is well appointed and has an upscale feeling  Now the bad: - due to the sporty suspension, there is the occasional dash rattle",4.75

Water would leak into the rear taillights before update was performed. The sunroof is extremely loud and sends hurricane winds into the car when open since it opens outward and not into the body. Your rear passengers will hate that Special feature but its funny. Due to these cars stiff sport suspension they do rattle a lot since they are rough over bumps, small bumps are the worst.

Acura really hit the nail on the head with the exterior design. My only complaint is the 201 bhp. If it had around 260 bhp I would have been much happier so I could smoke those cheap SS cobalts and SRT- 4's you see all over the road. In all the car is great and I am sad to see it go.

Never had an issue with it through the 37k it has to date. Back seat it kinda tight so I don't recommend it for a family vehicle or if plan to have friends in and out.

Transmission is one of the best I've driven. Throws are quick and light. Great feel. Pedals are good for heel-toeing. Brakes are nice and strong. Seats are awful.

A lot of noise transfers to the cabin and the ride is harsh. This is due to the sport suspension. I had an '03 Type S before the '06 and do not remember the ride being as tight/harsh.  Asside from ride quality on less than perfect roads, this car is perfect - great gas mileage, a lot of fun to drive and it holds its value very well.

If you do push the engine up to 7k+ (no point buying a Type-S if you don't), you're in for a lot of fun. The ride is very stiff - if you need a comfortable ride, look elsewhere. Handling can be skittish when accelerating hard. Some quality issues: the shifter often didn't want to go into 3rd (mainly when the car was cold - solved by replacing the stock transmission fluid with a better quality one), lots of rattles (moonroof, dash, hatch), and the paint chips easily. The Bose audio system is awful (see below).",4.25

A huge upgrade from my previous car!  The firm but supple ride, well bolstered and supportive seats, responsive steering, sharp handling, rev-happy engine, and 6-speed gearbox just makes the car a blast to drive.  It is comfortable enough for me to commute 100 miles round trip to school twice a week and 15 miles round trip to work 5 days a week. The gas mileage is great too, even when in lots of spirited driving time I still manage over 22 mpg all city. If I stick to ho-hum commuting I get just under 30 mpg with a 60/40 city/highway mix of driving.  The only let down is that they discontinued production of this car for 2007 and beyond.",4.875

It's as solid as the day I bought it, no squeaks, no rattles, no engine or transmission problems. When I'm bored of the track, I take it to the canyons and fall in love with it all over again, hearing that engine sing to me at 8000+ rpms while snicking through that perfect gearbox is heaven.

Been looking for a sporty coupe with a stick since I sold my '94 Vette.  Yeah, I know, this ain't a Vette.  But it just might be even more fun to drive.  I'm not crazy about the exterior, but the interior is really nice.  I don't get the people who complain about the ride.  If that's so important why didn't they buy a luxury sedan.  The RSX is a more of a bare bone sports car, though it does have the Aucra luxury, and, more importantly, the Honda reliability.  Like I said, the exterior doesn't do much for me.

The 6 spd is great for the hwy mpg (city mpg is not 23 btw unless you drive real slow. figure about 18-20). Couple issues with the car is it can be a bumpy ride on non-smooth roads due to tight suspension. Also, engine gets loud at high rpms (redline starts at like 7500).

Honda has proven to be one of the best reliable cars for the money.  I drove the Prelude like I stole it on the regular.  Now that I have the RSX S, WOW!  This car is amazingly more fun to drive and revvs strong to redline. Most of my friends who own European cars love the high revvs to redline.  This car handles like a champ for daily driving and is light enough to toss around for some fun times.  The power to weight ratio is very close to the S2000 so it pulls very hard for a 4banger.

I had so many problems with that car so I decided to turn my back on VW.  This car offers a fun ride which will make you smile almost everytime you drive. It first really buttoned down in the corners and has loads of grip.  Even though the torque output is modest all you need to do is take this car up to redline once and you will be sold.  I mean this car (6.1) is quicker than a base porsche boxter(6.5)and for $20,000 less.  The engine is smooth and refined and the shifter is crisp and accurate.

Brakes last, tires last, amazing gas mileage. 5 spd manual is fun, 160 hp engine could be a bit beefier. Type S isn't that much faster and requires premium.

I will say while the engine loves to rev, the ride can be a bit tight and bouncy, but in this particular car, thats what gives it that race appeal. On the inside, Acura did an outstanding job on the leather seating, simple yet functional. The controls on the dash were again simple, but tied into the whole theme of the vehicle. I did think for this class of vehicle, Acura could have beefed up the audio system, which was not bad, but could be better.  All in all, this was a good buy.",4.375

It's the perfect combination of fun to drive and all around comfort for the daily commute.  At first I was skeptical because the good press has surrounded the Type S version.  However, if you need a fun to drive car that is comfortable for commuting (and every day life outside the track world), the standard RSX model is the way to go.  Opt for the leather to take the comfort level up a step further.  Also, the standard RSX model does not need premium fuel- the Type S does.  So at an average of 27 MPG (city), that's one more accolade the automotive media has missed on this little brother of the Type-S.",4.875

I would have like to get the Type-S instead with 210 horsepower, but unfortunately I didn't like the wheels OR the spoiler that comes factory installed on the Type-S.

The second gear was about to go in my car (but if you read the crsx forums, you'll find tonnes of owners have second gear grind. These things really begin to take a toll after some time and destroy the enjoyment of the drive. Otherwise, great built quality - clutch will last and last, and is also very light.",4.375

With the hp bumped up to 210, it performs very well. Turn-ratio & handling are great. For a high torque coupe, it still gets good mpg, but it does require premium unleaded. Like other owners say, the ride can be extremely stiff so watch bumps in the road very carefully, seriously. I like how Acura upgraded the wheels to 17s, but wish they kept the original headlights, since that's what initially caught my eye. Interior hasn't changed, still sleek. The fold-over rear seats are a huge plus, but rear seating is narrow. As long as required maintenance is done (which is HIGHLY recommended), it'll be faithful.

The RSX -- especially the Type-S -- is major bang for the buck.  Grab one before they're gone.  I owned a 2002 Type-S, which I loved, until the refinements of the 2005-06 were introduced... then I had to trade.  My 2005 is a noticeable improvement over the earlier varsion.  A very nice blend of luxury, economy, and performance for under $25K.  Several reviewers have complained about the rough ride.

I said for me, do you think I'm too old (55 at the time).  I love it.  It is by far the most fun car to drive I have ever had and the most sporty.  The sport does add a much stiffer suspension than some may like but for handling you can't beat it.  It loves the on ramps to the interstate and the faster you drive it the better it sticks.

236, on 08/06/15 13:33 PM (PDT),Steve ,2003 Acura RSX Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl 5A),Baby Acura for the Win!," I bought this car to replace a gas hog (Mustang GT) for college. My job is roughly an hour and a half away and I needed something decently efficient on gas that didn't have the price tag of a Prius, and could still do the work and school trips on one tank. I came across one of these on a local craigslist and haven't had any regrets. It's one of the only Acura's (to my knowledge) that doesn't require premium gas or spark knock if you put regular gas in it. It usually does in the mid 20's mpg in the city and high 20's if not low 30's mpg on the highway. As long as you don't stomp on the gas pedal this car will do amazing no matter where you drive it; which was one of the selling points for me. The only downsides to this car come when you have to either replace belts, headlight bulbs, headlights or taillights. Because the car is so small, space under the hood is in short supply; therefore things like belts typically mean removing the entire front bumper to replace. The headlight bulbs (usually for the passenger headlight) also require removal of the entire bumper, which means you'll need to schedule some time aside for certain ""simple"" projects. If you need to take an entire headlight or taillight out of the car, the bumpers need to be removed completely as well since the retaining bolts are underneath the headlights and taillights. Besides those downfalls, the car is amazing. If you can find a type-s (200+hp) and don't mind driving a stick, those are the way to go. If a manual transmission isn't your thing the base models still have a good amount of kick to them (150+hp), and parts for these cars are extremely easy to find and aren't a whole lot of money either.Update 2018: I've had this car for 5 years now, and I have only had to do normal maintenance (oil changes, spark plugs, tires, brakes, etc.). This car has never once broken down, or had any issues even in severe winters. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made, and completely explains why you still see so many of these cars on the road.",5

Keep in mind this is not really a racing car its a sporty look and feel but it's not going to take you from 0- 60 anytime quick, unless you step on it and suck all the gas out of your tank. Which bring me to the next point of gasoline. It doesn't have good gas mileage in the city but the highway it's great. ",4.625

I know the TypeS suspension is 'tighter' than the Integra, but there is no excuse for the terribly rough ride. Plus, the interior rattles and squeaks override any joy received from driving the sharp little fun car. I have had the struts replaced and three trips to the shop to quiet the rattles.

The steering is incredible and handles like a dream, the 2.0L 4 is incredibly peppy and high revving making it extremely fun. I feel like i've had the car for so long yet I cant wait for the next drive. The only cons I have for the car are the seats. The seats in this car are basically sitting on a rock, which I don't mind being young, but many of my passengers begin to be uncomfortable (also due to the sporty stock suspension) after awhile so seat pads may be something to invest in following the purchase of one of these .

That said, the Type S isn't as good on gas as I'd hoped and it's downright treacherous in the snow.  Snow tires are needed on this car. My only other real complaint is that it doesn't reach a decent speed until you rev the heck out of it, but that's the V-Tech way.  Oh ya, the V-tech chip fried a month after I bought it (I bought an 02 in 06).

The hi-revving twin-cam coupled to the slick shifting 6-speed makes you one with the car (I know this is an over-used cliche, but if you drive this car, you will know what it means). The interior begs you to drive fast. Clear gauges, leather wheel at just the right reach, and that precision shifter- always right at hand.

Six-speed manual is incrediblysmooth and quick. Negatives: Don?tbelieve the reviews about the stereo ?it isn?t that good. The big woofer inthe trunk is more gimmick than realsound.

I have had the radio replaced in the car 4 times since I have had it as well.  I loved my 92 Integra and decided to upgrade but after this 04 purchase I may have to stick with the 92 or change the make of what I purchase.

During my daily commute, when I cant play, the ELS stereo reproduces sound that is far superior to the Mark Levinson systems from the Lexus RX.  My only complaint is the mileage.  I expected to hover in the 18-19 mpg range, but so far its just over 16mpg.  Again, AMAZING barely describes it.",4.75

Have owned 4 Volvos, the RDX is much more compliant with impact harshness than any of my Volvos. Yeah, I hate the beak front end, but at least is does not look like the Nissan Joke, I mean Juke.

I traded in a two-year-old TSX, which I loved, to buy the RDX so we would have more rear leg room and cargo space. I like the simplicity of buying an Acura -- get it with or without bells and whistles, no nonsense. Good value for the money. All the goodies I wanted at the time, heated seats, XM radio, etc. While previous years had a turbocharged engine, this one does not which means pretty decent gas mileage. My daily commute is a combination of city/country road driving and I hit the mid 20's most tanks. There is a bit more road noise than I remember with my TSX. And make no mistake this is definitely a smaller car. Another kid or a large dog, and you might want to consider something larger. We fill up the cargo area pretty quickly! But I do still feel that the rear legroom is better than that of other cars in this size class, and installing the car seat with LATCH is a snap.

There are strange brake noises that the Service center said is ""standard.""  A strange clanging noise comes from the front of the vehicle when you cross over lane separators or bumps.   It is annoying and is standard in the RDX and I also heard it in the TL.  It sounds as if the front axle is loose.  Substandard paint/paint job on the RDX.  After 1 week, I already have chips.  After 12 months, many more chips and many scratches some as long as 12"".  These are not malicious or deliberate scratches; more likely someone's purse rubbed against my car as they walked by.   I had my Mercedes ML320 for 19 years and did not have this many chips and scratches.The placement of the air vents is baffling. The driver's vent is blocked by the steering wheel base and he signal and wipers levers.   I don't see how this design flaw was not noticed by Acura, I need the heat or the cool air directed toward my body not my steering wheel and hands   The heat control is very slow and substandard.  This car is 3 years old, but in 51 degree weather, it takes a good 10 minutes for the heater to work.  Heater set at 73-80 degrees and cool air comes out of the vents.   I think for a newer car, I had higher expectations of design and functionality of an Acura.There is a quirky issue with the acceleration.  Many times as I step on the gas pedal, I get a quick surge in acceleration that does not match my foot pressure on the pedal.  I have almost rear-ended vehicles in front of me when driving in the bumper to bumper traffic.  Acura does not see a problem or a reason why this is occurring. Wish I had paid more attention to the car's interior because my daily hour commute to work is bad enough, now I have these annoying irks to put up with.",2

MOST impressed with every one - with the exception of our RDX. We absolutely loved the car when we first saw it on the dealership lot. Never having had any major issues with the previous Honda vehicles we've owned(2 Accords and 3 CRV's), we thought we'd add a ""touch of class"" in vehicle ownership. We purchased our RDX about 2 and a half years ago, and now have doubts in our decision. MOST disappointed in that we have had one issue and then another. Our most serious complaints are that with the front end suspension!! As mentioned, in a little over 2 years, we just had our third front end strut replaced. And trust me, being a senior citizen and ex-police officer, we're NOT ones to abuse our vehicles in any way nor neglect what need be. As I say, other than that, it's a Honda. We love the handling, style, economy and performance. The last time we brought our RDX in for strut replacement, the dealership shared our views on our frustration and disappointment, but sadly, that's the way it goes sometimes. Therefore, now that we have our car back home and cleaned up, we'll be trading it in - for a Buick. No longer bothering with Honda. Again, it's too bad for us as we have thoroughly enjoyed MANY Honda cars and other Honda-made products(Honda Shadow motorcycle, boat motor and two 4-wheelers) but will no longer deal with the company. Calling customer satisfaction made NO difference - other than ""lending an ear"". Oh well, that's the way it goes sometimes.......",4

Doing comparisons with the CR-V, RAV4, and a Forester XT, RDX had the most bang for the buck as you'd have to load up the former cars in order to match the RDX, but with less power and ride quality. But it wasn't all paradise for me when I had 4 instances of transmission slippage during Jan. 2016. Long-story short, the transmission had to be replaced due to the problem actually happening to the mechanic when he test-drove the vehicle. Also, Reno Acura did their due diligence by also warranty-replacing the rear shocks due to thumping noise that comes from the rear. Now, I bought this car since I heard/read so many reviews of their reliability. As a working student, I need this car to get me through a 1.5-hour round-trip commute to the university, and was quite disappointed to learn of the defects. Repairs aside, I'm now questioning my decision to purchase this vehicle. I'm hoping that it'll get me through college before things really fall apart, and then trade it in promptly.

The tech package is designed to eliminate use, except by driver's voice, if the vehicle is in motion. This prevents use by the passenger/co-pilot unless the driver is told to ""say OK"", ""say two"", ""say next"", etc. and the voice recognition has difficulty with my voice.

New RDX looks sharper and feels roomier than its predecessor (my brother has the older model), handles corners nicely, quiet and luxurious interior, and new keyless ignition start is a plus that wasn't available in the 2011 MDX.

I liked the Acura's straight forward pricing. FWD or AWD with technology package or without it. BMW, Lexus and Audi starts at the similar base, but by the time you ad few essential option packages, the price skyrockets to 50k.

838, on 06/08/18 13:06 PM (PDT),John ,2017 Acura RDX SUV Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Great Daily Driver and Roadtrip Cuiser," I purchased a very low mileage (less than 1,000 miles!) CPO AWD RDX Advance, had it shipped from out of state due to wanting Fathom Blue Pearl and none were available locally and Advance trim was even more difficult to find.  Traded in an Infiniti G37x due to needing more space but not wanting to sacrifice too much performance and I love the RDX more than I thought I would.  Very comfortable as a daily commuter and navigating through rush or driving hours on end up to the cabin.  I thought I really wanted a BMW X3 or Audi Q5 but after looking at maintenance expenses and higher insurance costs ($20-30$ more/month for the German cars and RDX is same as my G37) plus long term Honda reliability and resale value, RDX was an easy choice.  I drove all three SUVs in heavy snow storms (I live in Minneapolis) before purchasing which I highly recommend doing and despite the less sophisticated AWD system in the RDX, it performed just as well on both slick roads and unplowed parking lots as the X3 and Q5.  For those who do not know, the AWD system in the RDX was updated for the 2016 refresh with a larger rear differential, thicker drive shaft, and larger rear axle drive shafts to handle a 60/40 front/rear power split as well as provide better dry road handling.  The 2013-15 RDX can only manage a 75/25 power split and in testing another family members '13 RDX, the updated AWD system handles foul weather significantly better and the rear differential does not overheat as it does in the earlier models.  The RDX rides much softer than the X3 and the V6 is incredibly smooth and quiet.  A recent 1,000 mile road trip yielded 30.5mpg round trip so no disappointment there.  I thought my Infiniti was quiet on the highway but wow is the RDX hushed when cruising at 75mph.  Other reviewers said this car was noisy inside but I highly disagree as do the professional auto publications.  In comparison, I was disappointed by how much road and wind noise the BMW let into the cabin at highway speeds.  The seats are extremely comfortable (I am 5'7""), ACC cruise control and lane keep assist work well, and the rear cross traffic alert is nice to have in busy parking lots.  ELS stereo has great sound quality and thump from the subwoofer and having both heated and cooled front seats is game changing.  I actually like the two screen setup and the NAV system will redirect you if there is a traffic incident.  I also like how it shows your next turn in the meter display along with the compass and other vehicle information.  My only gripe which I knew when buying this car is it a FWD platform with a transversely mounted motor and unequal length drive shafts so hard acceleration does bring just a slight, slight hint of torque steer but again, the updated AWD system does mitigate this compared to base FWD models and earlier production AWD RDX's.  Otherwise, I really enjoy this car for its looks, features, and all around handling/daily livability.",5

Yes, all cars break, some more than others, but for 40 years starting with Honda and then  Acura.  My last four Acuras never glitched once, same for my Hondas.  Moreover, you can judge a car company by how they handle recalls.  My last recall from Honda went perfect and was professionally fixed w/o a hassle.  For safety, reliability and style, I'll continue with Honda/Acura as long as their engineering and build remains excellent.  Lastly, resale is another consideration for owning a Honda product and to top it off, my RDX was made in the US.

Since then, two other family members have bought or leased new Acura SUVs based on our favorable experience.  We use the car quite a bit.  It will probably have around 23,000 miles by the end of our first yr of ownership.  We bought it certified pre-owned with about 3,000 miles already on it.  I still very strongly believe we bought the best and right car for us and our needs.  Haven't had any repair needs.  I regret having the tires & wheels rotated - the car now has a very, very slight pull to it, which didn't exist before the tire rotation.  With the car being 4WD, I should have been much less concerned about tire rotation.  Overall, though, this is just a great car.  Encourage you to read my further notes below, as I don't have any revisions to my earlier comments.  Thank you Acura!We are about six months into our ownership of a '17 Acura RDX AWD with the Technology package.  We also strongly considered a Volvo V70 Cross Country, RAV4 Hybrid, and a Chevrolet Impala.  V70 doesn't have near the rear seat leg room that the RDX has, which was important for us since we have taller teenagers.  Impala would have been a solid choice for us as well.  Also strongly considered a RAV4Hybrid; not sure you can tow anything behind it due to the hybrid drivetrain?  Definitely like the controls in the RDX - seem notably better than even those in the new MDX.  Upgraded stereo with HD radio was well worth it.  Very thankful for the generous cargo capacity behind the rear seats.  We had a hitch installed at the dealer.  Although the towing capacity is not high, it certainly expanded the usefulness of the vehicle.  This thing is truly a Sport Utility Vehicle in the best sense of the category.  The drivetrain is just awesome.  To get somewhere around 30 mpg on the highway with that amount of power available (and safety) is amazing.  Transmission shifts extremely smoothly.  If I could choose one upgrade for this car in the future, it would be for either an ""eco mode"" that shifts the transmission sooner, thus saving on gas, or an extra gear in the transmission for less consumption on the highway.  One other suggestion:  a buzzer should automatically sound immediately if the car is put into gear with the parking brake set.  There have been two instances where I put the car in reverse and started to back out of a parking space with the parking brake on.  I only got a few feet before the warning was sounded, but makes no sense why this warning wouldn't take place sooner.  Another important point:  this car is made in the USA!",5

I concluded the Audi Q5 and BMW 3 were not much better, seemed smaller, although specs don't back that up, and simply not worth the added cost. It came down to the Ford Edge Titanium with301 package with V6 in white and RDX with Advance Package. Liked the extra cargo space of the Edge and thought it was a very quiet comfortable ride. The bottom line negatives were poor Ford resale value versus the RDX, the lower gas mileage with the V6, the Sony sound system and ""slightly"" less interior quality. When Acura announced 2017 clearance prices last month, I was able to get one for the same price as the loaded Edge. I have driven now for 3 weeks and I am very satisfied with my decision.

There is a clear design defect that Acura dealers deny even knowing about. When driving the side view mirrors show a glare from  the air conditioning vents. This is because the vents contain a silver metal design and the sun shows the glare on the side view window. It is more than annoying and is a distraction. When we called the dealers, they claim not to know about it. We even spent money to tint windows, but this failed to help. In calling around to other dealers, we contacted one out of state who acknowledged it was an issue. This dealer said they were changing the vents by inserting a black rim in place of the silver one. Thus, you can now enjoy a far lower priced Honda instead of an Acura!!!  Calls to Acura customer service have not been returned as promised. Also, my wife's foot cramps when driving because the pedals are too high. Others have complained about it according to another dealer I spoke with. The Navigation is cumbersome, difficult and voice recognition is terrible. It is hit and miss unless you always want the date. Any other info? forget it.

866, on 02/26/17 20:58 PM (PST),Kleo77 ,2017 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Not flashy but drives great!," It's been a long road till I pulled a triggered and leased 2017 base model AWD RDX. I also looked at BMW x1 & x3 and infinity Qx30 & QX50. Acura was a winner due to the best deal and dealership experience. I traded in my 2011 3 series that I loved but the CPO warranty was about to expire and I refuse to pay for fixing cars so in order to prevent it I decided to get a new car. I wanted awd because we go often to the mountains. I did not want the technology package because I hate having too many buttons and features even though I'm very computer savvy. I just assume that simple solutions are always the best. My fiancee got x3, retail price 10k more- it was a demo so its fully loaded but my car drives almost as nice as his and mine gets better gas milage even though his is 4 cylinder turbo. I got 22 freeway and 20 combined which is exactly the same as my beemer and better than my 2011 AWD Nissan Rogue! I consider that very good and I hope it will stay at this level (BTW unlike most people I do manual gas milage calculation every time I go to the gas station and don't rely on the computer readings because they are hardly ever accurate- beemer was most accurate). My other car option was x1 since I've always liked but it would cost me still more than Acura and it is a much more smaller car. RDX is equivalent of x3 and is a perfect size for me. Base model had keyless entry, moonroof , heated seat and back up camera which is all nice to have. The drive quality is very good, X3 has a better suspension but is also a stiffer ride due to run flat tires and bigger rims. I was very dissapointed with how much my 3 series depreciate during my 3 years of ownership that I'm not longer their loyal customer. They also stopped offering free brakes in the first 4 years of ownership which was another bummer. ON top of everything I think their cars are kind of outdated looking so its time for major overhaul. I might consider the x3 in 3 years if they come up with the nice design. Not that my Acura is a hot looking car because its super bland but the deal i got justifies it. The lease on Acura and Infinity was much cheaper for a very simple reason - Japanese cars don't depreciate as much as German cars. Anyway RDX is great car and the only downside is there will be  anew model coming up soon thats why I opted to lease. Highly recommended, safe and efficient vehicle.",5
867, on 02/24/17 07:44 AM (PST),Carlos Guzman ,2017 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),A sensible choice," I just got this recently, so I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I think that I have a pretty good idea of what this car is. Likes: the power and the price. Those were the two main factors that made me pull the trigger. They had a great lease deal and I really wanted a V6 instead of a turbo 4. Other cars I considered were the new Lexus RX350 (which was at least $150 more a month), the BMW X3 and the 3-series GT (probably $200 more a month, and their down payments are considerably more) and the Lexus NX 200t (smaller and turbo engine). The build quality is great. I got the base model with the leatherette seats and they feel very nice, other than the strong plastic smell. No sweet leather smell here. I like that this is lower than most SUVs, so it handles so much better and if feel almost like, dare I say, a sporty sedan. I had a Toyota Highlander before, and I wanted to avoid the dynamics of a heavy and soft SUV. . . It was a pregnant cow on wheels. The RDX's engine sounds sweet and pulls great -- the transmission, on the other hand, is slow and outdated. Forget using the paddle shifters, they are slow and there's a jerk when downshifting. Better just use your foot and/or sport mode and leave the paddles alone. This engine with modern 8-speed transmission would kill. Comfort is okay. Some people have complained about RDXs having suspension problems. The car doesn't like bumps. You can feel and hear the suspension working and I do think it's a design flaw, but not a defect per se. I did have suspension problem on a 2011 Honda Odyssey, and after multiple trips to the dealership and opening a case with corporate, they were never able to fix it. It's just like every other manufacturer, they have known problems with their car and they jerk you around until you give up. I personally like the simple entertainment system in this base model. Acura's technology package is outdated. I do wish the stereo was a bit better, but I can live with it. Bluetooth always pairs without fail with my iPhone 6. All in all, this is a great small SUV if you want acceleration, a bit of luxury, decent cargo space, and a low price. I think that naturally aspirated V6s are a dying breed, and by the time this lease is up, I'd probably be faced with choosing a 4-cyl turbo, or some type of hybrid system -- which I guess wouldn't be that bad. So far I'm getting 18 mpg (90% city traffic), and that combined with a smallish fuel tank has me going to the pump more frequently than I'd prefer.",4
868, on 02/21/17 03:09 AM (PST),Gary ,2017 Acura RDX SUV Technology and AcuraWatch Plus Package 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Blows my former Lexus NXt200 Away," I owned a Lexus NXt200 for the last two years and have been a Lexus guy for 20 years. Still love their cars. However, I have been driving the  the RDX for the last two months and can definitively say it is far and away a better car than the NXt for my money. In short: the RDX interior feels more luxurious; acceleration is much smoother; car is quieter; and the technology such as adaptive cruise control, lane departure and blind spot monitoring make long trips much less stressful. You almost feel like you are a pilot monitoring a plane on auto pilot versus constantly turning cruise control on and off and fighting your way through traffic. It's more like you glide your way through traffic on the interstate. Of course, no car is perfect and there is still room for tweaks and improvements. For example, if you are on the interstate in the left lane and going around a long curve the car senses the the car ahead of you in the right lane is actually in front of you and slows down unnecessarily. But this is a rare and minor annoyance, especially compared the the raft of positive attributes this car possesses. I highly recommend you check it out during your due diligence period when shopping for a mid-size SUV. I am extremely happy I did.",5

It is a solid SUV with nice features for a base model.  No squeaks or rattles.  Initial gas mileage was 25 mpg before the cold weather settled in, dropping it to a still respectable 23 mpg.  I like the variable cylinder management that shuts off 3 cylinders during low output conditions.  It is such a smooth process you don't know when it is happening.  The technology interfaces are kind of old fashioned for an upper end vehicle.  No touch screens or fancy graphics.  Buttons and knobs are nicely laid out, but I wish fan speed was controlled by a knob instead of buttons.  Radio does not stay on after car shuts off.  Seats are comfy, but leatherette surfaces are more like plastic than leather.  Heated seats warm up fast, but I miss a heated steering wheel.  Elevated rear seats are nice with plenty of legroom.  Great visibility out rear and side windows.  The 19.5 gallon gas tank could be larger.   The AWD version comes with a spare tire instead of a tire repair kit.  Headlights look and function great.   Overall, happy with the vehicle.  It doesn't necessarily have the feel of a luxury vehicle, but we don't feel we paid a luxury price for it either.",4

Basic maintenance and same comfort and performance. My only minor complaint is the passenger window occasionally goes down about a half inch on its own. I notice because it rattles. I don't know why it dies this- almost like road bumps rattle it loose. I switch between regular and premium gas and notice no difference in mpg. Car feels like it runs better on premium but not enough to justify the 70 cents + per gallon difference. Overall, I really enjoy this vehicle. I chose the base AWD because I did not like the stereo and navigation interface on the technology package and above. I also did not get Acura watch package because it's not perfected.  The only options I wish I had are blind spot monitor and rear cross traffic.  Get about 21 mpg overall so far and it is winter.  The past 3 days has been 32-40 degrees and I've been getting about 24 in mixed driving on regular.  Overall, the RDX has great acceleration and great value vs its main competitors.  Nothing else comparable with a luxury nameplate comes close. I only have 3 minor complaints. 1) use of cargo space could be better. My wife has a Mazda CX5 and her car holds way more and has nice little cubbies the RDX lacks. 2) handling. Again, comparing to the CX5 steering is vague and lacks feedback. 3) When using the Bluetooth it's really hard to hear. Voices very tinny and have to have volume on very high to hear the other line. It's a little odd because the stereo and speakers are otherwise fine. Overall, I definitely recommend. Bulletproof engine and transmission and again, it's hard to match at its price point.",4

Well, I just pulled the trigger on the RDX with all the bells and whistles, and I couldn't be happier.  It drives beautifully. It is quiet, responsive, and displays impressive handling.  Although the tech is probably of 2015 vintage (no apple car play or android auto), with ACC, LKAS, blind spot monitoring, collision mitigation, rear cross traffic alert, lane departure warning, and stability control, I reallyb don't feel that I am sacrificing anything. I have no problem with the double screen setup, and although there is a bit of a learning curve, I enjoy having the big map always being displayed on the upper screen.

The front doors close with a nice solid ""thunk"".  The rear doors seem very light and uninsulated.   The gas tank could be larger -- it's 16 gallons which, with an average 23 mpg around town, gets me through about 380-400 miles before needing a refill.  Seems to come up way more quickly than my former car (a Buick Lacrosse that had a much larger tank and got slightly fewer mpg's).

We test drove the RDX, Lexus RX 350, Nissan Murano, and a loaded out Honda CRV.  RDX was our first choice by a mile.  Super smooth power train and very quiet/smooth ride.  Easily best value in its class.  Back seat room is exceptional for two adults but three would definitely be a crowd.  Only downsides include cludgy technology/interfaces, smallish gas tank, and somewhat narrow driver and front passenger seating.",5
901, on 07/07/16 16:20 PM (PDT),Michael Marynowski ,2017 Acura RDX SUV Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Very Nice vehicle, This is a vehicle that compares to competing brands that are much more expensive. I bought this RDX while trading in my larger MDX. The biggest difference is this is the little brother to the MDX and does not have the 3rd row of seats and thus less cargo space as well. I didn't need the space and welcomed the smaller SUV with better gas mileage! If I have any complaint at all it is that the front driver seats appears to be much smaller than the one that was in my 2012 MDX. It has been taking me awhile to get used to it. The bigger MDX seemed to have more support particularly with a bigger seat body that went up to the back of my knees. Other than that the car is fantastic. First time having cooling ventilating front seats which is a joy during the hot days. Definitely go with the Advance Package. All the goodies that go with it are worth the price!,5
902, on 08/21/17 09:15 AM (PDT),Cone ,2008 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV AWD w/Technology Package (2.3L 4cyl Turbo 5A),Love it! Just can't afford it.," I bought this used 3 years ago, from a known and trusted private seller. At first I loved everything except the cost of fuel. It takes Premium, and gulps it at about 19-21 miles/gallon. I love the handling, energy, road feel, nav system, visibility... it is a great ride and I love driving it. Its great safety ratings made my insurance stay the same as the previous car, which was worth 10% of what the R cost me. Here's the problem. I just hit 90,000 miles, and stuff is starting to break. Notably, the A/C compressor... between $900-$1100 to replace. I had to do an inner tie rod. There is something wrong with a strut. There are things going weird with some of the technology, such as the backup sensor system and the driver memory and the map display. My guess about the strut and tie rod is that a road hazard strike a couple of years ago has come back to haunt me. My guess about the technology is that 2008 was an early year in the introduction of some of this stuff. Finally, sad to say, this was my first non-Japanese-made Acura, and its fit and finish are just not as good as the two Integras I had that were actually built in Japan.",4

Love the interior and leather seats as well. The only negative is the turbo requires hi octane and the gas mileage is a little disappointing. However, with a turbo you can't have your cake and eat it too.. Overall, I believe it's the best small SUV on the market..including the BMW..",5
906, on 08/06/15 14:27 PM (PDT),Drew Engstrom ,2008 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV AWD w/Technology Package (2.3L 4cyl Turbo 5A),Great if you can live with the compromises," The RDX is sports sedan masquerading as a luxury SUV. Cornering and acceleration? Great. Cushioned, quiet ride? Nope. I chose the RDX because there are many SUV and truck drivers where I live and I wanted to sit a little bit higher than I would in a sedan - and I am completely sold on Honda/Acura reliability and quality. Quality and reliability have been excellent and the driving position is comfortable with excellent visibility; my advice to prospective buyers would be to simply understand the trade-offs:1) The turbocharged 4 cylinder is very responsive and fun to drive - but, don't expect to get much more than 16 MPG when you're zipping around town, or about 23 MPG when cruising on the highway.2) The taut suspension makes for great handling - but, don't expect a plush, Toyota-ish ride quality; you will feel and hear road imperfections.3) The car is very nimble and comfortable for an SUV - but remember, this is a smaller SUV and it really isn't any roomier than a smaller sedan (think Acura TSX)Conclusion; if you like the Acura feel (tight suspension, cornering on rails) and you want something with some power, this is as good a combination of value and quality as you can get in a small SUV.",4
907, on 07/17/15 09:55 AM (PDT),mike ,2008 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV AWD w/Technology Package (2.3L 4cyl Turbo 5A),Overall We Love This Car," In the year 2015, had to replace our 2005 CRV which we loved, because of a hit and run that left our car trashed. We were looking at simply getting another CRV, but stumbled across a 2010 RDX at a dealer. We took it for a drive and fell in love. We didn't quite like the look of the 2010 model (fog lights are a little ""pronounced"" for our taste, so out of curiosity we looked and found a 2008 model with 59k miles that was a new arrival at a local dealer. Took it out for a drive, and loved it even more than the 2010 model we had driven earlier.  To be sure, we subsequently tried a few other CRVs (2005, 2010, 2012) but by that time I think we were just too smitten with the RDX and never looked back. We got the RDX for $15k and are sooooo happy about it. (cheaper than any CRVs we saw, including a 2005 model that would have essentially replaced the one we lost, but was more expensive than this 2008 RDX.  A couple things that any buyer should be aware of especially in 2015: (1) Mileage. We just took a road trip and got 23 mpg, which is about what it was advertised at (actually slightly better).  You have to be on top of RPMs, use of AC, buying gas at Costco, and other things if you want to keep your costs and gas use down - and those are all things we are good with doing. (2) We had a little rattling in the car when we got it. After a long search we found it wasn't mechanical, but rather the latch for back seat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OS7CgzsiRs&feature=youtu.be), which is now totally silent thanks to electrical tape!  That's pretty much it so far, and granted it's only been a month since we bought the car, but it is a 2008 model and no other red flags (just had it inspected too).So many good things for us. The cabin is like a dream after the CRV. Again we loved our CRV but didn't realize how much better it could be with a car like an RDX. Driving it feels like we got bumped from coach to first class. Don't know what rear passenger  seats feel like, but front are awesome with leather, memory seats, amazing stereo, storage, Dual climate setting. Dash is real easy to look at and find what you need. We don't have the Tech model but don't seem to be complaining either. And as much as cabin rocks, the engine is amazing. 240hp turbo, whoa. So fun to drive!! That might have been the kicker for us, I'm pretty sure it sealed the deal for my wife, I'll never forget her face when she turned her first corner - she was like ""oh yeah, I love this car."" Separate from that, good fold-down seats in back to make the entire rear a flat surface, and our model is black with tinted windows, so lord it is sexy!If you can keep on top of gas use and budgeting, I think this car is great. I realize it's early for us but coupled with our inspection by our trusted mechanic and plans to get regular maintenance checks, we hope to have many years of RDX fun to come...Update: After a few years of owning the car, if anything I would bump up the rating. The RDX has held up extremely well, especially considering it is a 2008 model, 10 years old! We are close to 100k miles, but it's still pretty much running the same as we bought it. We have been good about service appointments based on the warnings we get from cars, and aside from normal things for older cards - like replacing brake pads - it has been solid. We have taken countless road trips which this car is really the best for, but also use it for day-to-day use and it's been great all around. Realize the age might catch up to us soon, but for now we are happy to continue enjoying the ride!",4

Its a gas guzzler and you must buy premium gas. poor cargo room. My honda crv had double the cargo.  Nice pick up with the turbo acceleration.  But too much of a gas guzzler, can't wait to get rid of it.  Luxury vehicles are way over rated and not practical for the cost.  I suggest you shop around before buying a luxury car.

It was a dealership loaner with 17,000 miles on it.

Drove several other small SUVs (Rogue, CX-7, EX-35), and the RDX was the obvious choice. The EX-35 was great, but just not enough room. The others were not comfortable enough, both in seat comfort and ride quality. The RDX does seem too stiff on city streets (my '98 Accord was smoother). But it has a solid feel, very smooth on the freeway, great acceleration, plenty of upscale features - basically a blast to drive. My wife can have her cushy Lexus. I prefer the sporty Acura.",4.375

This turbocharged engine has its quirks, but drive it right and you'll be rewarded with decent mileage and good acceleration. About 21-22 if driven moderately. Is it noisy?  A slight growl when floored. How about road noise? Depends on the road.

The driver's door has an intermittent issue with some sort of flapping sound and an even more infrequent window glass rattle. The dashboard in front of the steering has an infrequent noise coming in.

In the beginning I was disappointed in the gas mileage (~16MPG) but now that I've learned how to drive less aggressively, I'm getting 24 to 27 MPG in a mix of city/highway. The trick is to stay out of boost and under 70MPH on the highway, sure it takes patience but I've gone from 260 miles per tank to just under 400... that's a savings of about $150 per month based on the 1800 miles per month I drive.",4.875

This car is worth every cent...luxury, yet it feels like driving a sports car. Navigation/AcuraLink is fabulous and the best one out there. Definitely check it out before saying ""I'll just buy a Garmin"". Its worth the upgrade in price. Only negative is the gas mileage, I have 500 miles on the car and average about 14.4 mpg. The good thing is that my commute is only 2 miles each way to work so its not too bad.

Aside from this which does not affect performance, the ride is both quick and sporty. Pick up is incredible with the turbo engine. I find that the cargo space is adequate for our needs and we can fit our child's stroller in the back easily. I can also get golf clubs in back without having to angle them.

None compared to the RDX for the money and the features.  It's so much fun to drive and is extremely comfortable.  Came from Infiniti M45 so I know comfort and this RDX is just as cushy.  Look forward to showing it off to my friends.  It was a long process to decide but I'm sure glad I took my time and chose the RDX.  It was the best choice for my money!

Not only will this car talk to you but it will let you know exactly whats going on performance-wise down to each wheel.  The rumors of turbo lag are true from stand-still acceleration.  However, when the turbo kicks in, it's like no feeling a V6 can offer.  You feel like you are being lifted off your seat then pushed back into it.  My wife has a Murano.  This car is much smoother, ride, acceleration, braking and even the seats are softer.

You just have to be mindful of your scheduled maintenance and not to abuse it's power otherwise with over 90k miles now we love our RDX no problem whatsoever.....with a small growing family moving to the burbs we sold our Lancer EVO and Subaru WRX for an RDX and an RX.... I would recommend the RDX to my family and friends....you get a lot of car for your money.   This is the ONLY Acura that the Shield front grill is actually functional as an air intake hood scoop for your top mount intercooler. If you are buying a used RDX make sure you check it's history,all original stock meaning no modification has been done,if buying from a private party it is worth to pay a 3rd party to inspect the mechanical condition of the car,if buying from a dealer make sure you can get an extended warranty.. Since the Turbo RDX is no longer in production and if you do not want a used vehicle the KIA Sportage SX (SX ONLY) would be a good car to consider .......  Thanks for reading... Happy Motoring!",4

Gas mileage is not as bad as some say. If I ease into the throttle, I can get about 25mpg highway with some city driving. Ride is firm, but you get lots of grip. Sport mode tranny is neat but not necessary. This is my first turbo engine and overall I like the power surge; surprising that a 2.3L can feel this strong in a 3,900lb vehicle. Turbo lag is not bad; spools up faster than the 2008 CX7 and 2009 Subaru Forester I drove. RDX felt more powerful than CX7 despite having less advertised hp and one fewer gear.

The ride may be a bit firm for some, but one feels noticably relaxed even after a long trip. The Tech package is worth every penny. The nav system and stereo are outstanding. The main drawback is gas mileage. I can't get much over 17 in the city and 21 on the highway.

This vehicle redefines for me the term sport ute.  The straight line performance, particularly while using the paddle shifters, is the equal of the more powerful V6 TL once you get used to the mild turbo lag on initial throttle tip in.

So, a few of my gripes are because of my specific likes and dislikes. For the first year and a half, the car ran like a dream. The turbo engine passed cars no problem. The interior stayed nice and clean and intact. The transmission shifted nicely. Very rarely was it in the shop for any reason other than A/C recharge or oil change. From May of 2014 until April of 2017, this car was the best decision I made.                                                             That was until April 2017. The first strange thing I noticed was that the car would randomly die. Drive it for a few days, leave it sit for 1, car would be dead. Had to get it towed to auto repair. Simple fix, just changed the battery and recharged. Few weeks later, same situation happened again: car would run fine for 2-3 days, then leave it sit for more than 24 hours, and it wouldn't start. Towed it again, auto service just recharged the battery. Funny story...IT DID IT A THIRD TIME! Took it back to auto service. From that point on, it was a trial and error scenario, seeing which functions and features on the car were constantly draining the battery. Tried that once or twice. Only to have the wrong options selected and towed back to auto service. (All-in-all, this process lead to 4 instances of towing a ""dead"" car and 5 instances of the battery dying.) After a month and a half of this problem continuing, finally found the solution: THE BLUETOOTH MODULE! Always connecting to a nearby device even when the car wasn't running, even when the device was not in range. Had the bluetooth module removed and never put back in again. Summer of 2017, the car is running fine...and actually running again. At 127000 miles, I figured something would start to go. The transmission began to slip, jerk, chug, pop, lock, and drop. Revving the engine up to 3-4 RPMs and it wouldn't move, it would actually decrease speed. On the highway was a worse problem: going 40 mph in a 60 CONSTRUCTION ZONE and it felt like the car was in neutral slipping down the hills as I floored the gas pedal. Braking began to pop when getting close to full stop (right before 10 mph and less) it would chug forward and then stop). At 136,000 miles, it has continued with the problems in the transmission, shifting, and braking and doesn't look to be improving. Dealers and auto mechanics swear there is nothing wrong with transmission or shifting. It feels like a chore to drive anymore. Will be getting a new car soon enough. But....loved the Turbo while it lasted.",3

I could hear everything and it drove me nuts! I am a luxury car owner. Before the RDX I owned a BMW, and in comparison I wanted my BMW back everyday.

Noise level between the two is about the same but the turbo growl on the RDX is really pleasant. I find the ride to be very comfortable, steering with good road feel and the interior clean and functional.We have a '11 Q5 2.0 and the RDX is much more fun to drive.

We moved to a new home that lies on a ridge at the top of a steep drive. After the first snow I realized we needed an AWD vehicle. I did not want to give up the precision, technology or the fun factor of my TLX but I knew that I needed something that had AWD and sat higher off the ground while still offering the precision, technology and the fun factor of my TLX. The RDX provides all of these qualities. The transmission is very smooth (more so than my TLX) and the 279 HP V6 is responsive and quick. The ride is quiet and comfortable, yet has responsive handling and steering. It has a sport mode with paddle shifters like my former TLX. The AWD system sends 50% of the torque to the rear wheels when needed. More than enough to navigate a snow covered steep drive. The voice controlled audio, navigation and climate control are top notch and the Siri hands free option works great. Cargo room is great for a five passenger SUV as is the fit and finish. Lane keep assistance and auto sensing speed cruise control make longer trips less tiring. Highly recommend this vehicle.",4

1152, on 02/28/18 12:35 PM (PST),jrasero ,2018 Acura RDX SUV Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Awesome SUV that is a bit long in the tooth," While the RDX 2nd gen has been around since 2013 the car has aged well and received a nice mid cycle refresh in 2016.  The car is basically unchanged for 2018 and with the 3rd gen 2019 RDX on its way this summer you probably can score a good deal on a current gen or get one if you refuse to adopt to a high speed transmission w/ a turbo engine.  One of the best parts of the 2nd gen RDX is the bullet proof 6 speed transmission paired to the 3.5L V6 engine, that has 279 hp and 252 lb-ft of toque, which means a healthy amount of instant power to the wheels.  The car emits a healthy growl and is equipped with VCM so even with a V6 the RDX's 19/27 MPG is very respectable since a Lexus NX 200t AWD w/ a 4 cylinder turbo gets 22/28 MPG.  Even though most luxury compact crossovers are oriented for utility and comfort it's sad that Acura omitted SH-AWD from the 2nd gen.  The basic AWD system is fine and probably more than enough in most situations, but Acura's SH-AWD system is almost equal to Audi's Quattro system and it could have helped in acceleration since the RDX does suffer from some wheel squeal.  I mostly cross shopped the RDX against the Lexus NX 200t AWD and while the Lexus just is more luxurious and offers more high end features it can costs thousands more than a RDX, it lacks the cargo/utility of an Acura, and noise wise it is louder, which is odd to say about a Lexus.  The top of the line Advance trim offers some nice features as nice rims, heated & ventilated seats, remote engine start, rain-sensing windshield wipers, fog lights, and front and rear parking sensors but still lacks Android/Apple compatibility, heated steering wheel, heated outboard seats, panoramic moon roof, high grain leather, thigh extenders, wireless charging, 360 cameras, plus the RDX lacks some of the materials associated with a luxury car.  If these aforementioned features aren't required than I think the RDX sits in between something like a loaded Honda CR-V and a Buick Envision, Infiniti QX50, Volvo XC60.  RDX's resale and reliability are top notch and compared to German cars Acura maintenance is considered normal to even cheap.  Acura recommends premium fuel but regular does just fine.  The trim I wouldn't recommend at minimum to get is the Tech package since it provides sports seats w/ perforated leather, 8 way front passenger seat, on demand multi use display, voice recognition for Nav and Climate, navigation, AcuraLink, Real Time Traffic, ELS audio system, Siri Eyes Free, Blind Spot Info, Rear Cross Traffic Monitor.  Overall the 2018 RDX is a very good car and really its biggest issue is that feature wise it falls behind the pack, but if you don't need the latest and greatest and want something that has a luxury caché and has a V6 engine with a smooth a quiet ride there aren't really many choices besides the RDX.",4

Test drove the 2018 X-3 and was disappointed in the BMW’s turbo 4 pot. Even though it had good acceleration it’s still displays an economy car feel, sound and characteristics. Visibility is super, comfort is excellent. Just finished a 650 mile road trip that I had taken many times in the X-3 and felt more comfortable and much less fatigued in the RDX.

And, you had to almost scream to hear or be heard from the back seat.

I've leased Audi vehicles for several years but decided to go with the Acura because the 2018 Audi Q5's lease quote was about $100/month higher for a similarly equipped vehicle. After driving the RDX for a couple of months, I can see why. The difference in interior materials, engineering, and overall luxury show that the Audi is far better. In particular, I'm disappointed in the assembly quality. Exterior panels have uneven gaps, bolts and screws are visible, and there are other areas that show that Honda took assembly and materials shortcuts which a ""luxury"" brand should not do. In addition, the dealership experience left a lot to be desired as the RDX was not prepped correctly, tires were over-inflated, the front license plate bracket was not attached, and (not to sound petty but this goes to the ""experience"" factor) I did not receive a full tank of gas. When I said something to the salesman, he brushed it off. Since then, I have not heard from the dealer or from Acura - even to see if I'm enjoying the vehicle. Overall, I'll keep the RDX but think I'll go back to Audi for my next vehicle.This is an update of the review I posted in October. Since then, my RDX developed squeaks, rattles, and buzzing that demonstrated the indifferent quality of assembly and the poor choice of materials. The voice recognition system got even worse and trying to work with it in traffic almost resulted in accidents on two occasions. While the navigation system could ultimately find the desired destination, it never chose the best or even safest route. The seats became more uncomfortable over time, to such an extent that my wife had to use a seat cushion to even sit in the vehicle for a drive longer than 30 minutes. Finally, at 7800 miles on the odometer I gave up, ""bit the financial bullet"", and got out of my lease. Acura may aspire to premium status but I know I'll never get another one. The materials, assembly, fit and finish, and technology are, at best, equal to Honda but at Lexus prices. My wife's Hyundai Elantra is a better vehicle than the Acura RDX.",2
1165, on 08/10/17 10:33 AM (PDT),Pat Houge ,2018 Acura RDX SUV Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),VISABILITY," I just purchased the 2018 RDX Advance Package. This package comes with exterior side mirrors with a film on them which really distorts the driver's vision. It is especially bad on the driver's side where the mirror is divided to see far & near objects which is not necessary.  This film only appears on the Advance Package vehicles.  Due to the distraction & very poor visibility caused by these mirrors, Acura should issue a ""recall"" on these vehicles. Additionally, the interior appointment of this vehicle could be improved with a nicer dash, steering wheel, floor mats, etc. Also, the driver's seat will not push back for enough for my legs to feel comfortable. Additionally, the ride is far too rigid & stiff taking bumps in the road too harshly. This car rides more like a sports car than a fully loaded SUV. For these reasons I will be selling this vehicle within the next 6 months.",3

Buy This Car.," This was a great ""bridge"" car and I always thought it would be a perfect 1st car for a teen or a young family because of the built-in safety and test results.  I bought a not-so-gently used low-mileage 2013 with 29k miles - but those were hard miles on this car and it took a lot of detailing to get it back to where I was happy with it. So I can tell you that the interior is VERY durable.  The base ""pleather"" seats are super comfortable and extremely durable - truly some of the most comfortable seats I've ever had.  They were punished with sand and spills and I got them back to almost new with the exception of one lipstick-like stain.  The interior carpet took a lot of punishment from the 1st owner but cleaned up almost like new.  Well done, Acura.  Smooth-shifting and quiet with the base technology that was an upgrade for me - I like being able to select ""talk to you later - I'm driving"" option as auto response to texts.  Sometimes couldn't understand my verbal requests. Acura's AC system isn't robust (a previous Acura had the same problem). More of what I loved and why I bought it: durable, good horsepower/weight ratio for quick acceleration, easy exit/entry and the back seats are HUGE for this segment and I needed this to tote my elderly parents around and put their walkers in the back.  Much better MPG than my trade-in so that was a plus.  But I traded it because I drive 200 highway miles (1-way) very quickly back/forth to see the parents and it has a C-pillar blind spot that you can't adjust the mirrors outwardly far enough to address.  And the FWD dynamics are annoying to me when turning and accelerating from a stop.  I prefer RWD but I've had a few FWD cars over the years that didn't annoy me like this one did so that combined with the blind spot AND the lack of climate control vents for the backseat passengers (really? in 2013 you can't put vents back there?) I traded it for a very nice gently-used RWD sedan. But hey, it's a great trustworthy car for particular needs and since the 2013-2018 (?) models are virtually unchanged - go buy yourself a nice USED RDX for the price you like since you won't notice much difference between the model years.",4

1185, on 04/13/14 11:25 AM (PDT),briansmi ,2013 Acura RDX SUV Technology Package 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),"Extremely Comfortable, Storage Could Improve"," I have owned my 2013 RDX for a year and a half and have 14,000 miles on it. This is the most comfortable car I have ever driven. On long trips I can be in the car for 4-5 hours and not be stiff.The gas millage is very good for the size of the vehicle. The VCE goes from 6 to 3 on the freeway allowing for good millage on longer hauls. If I went 60-65, I could pull 29 MPG on standard hauls (no major mountains). City/Highway combo I get 22-24.The biggest issue I have is the poor design of the storage space in the back. When you drop the rear seats they do not lie flat which greatly decreases your ability to load the back. It creates a slant upward which makes it difficult to stack items. Given the rest of how well the rest of the vehicle is laid out, I'm not sure why Acura engineers did such a bad job when considering how to get the most out of the back. I believe this vehicle is the smallest in square footage of storage and this is the primary reason why. *UPDATE I have had a problem with annoyingly squeaky brakes on this car in the past few months. Their is an Acura service bulletin telling dealers to replace the front pads to get rid of this. If you do a Google search you can find it. If you own one and your dealing with this take it to the dealer and have them replace the pads, should be free of charge.",4

The RDX has flaws that I can over look but the wind noise from the doors and b pillars is simply unforgivable in a vehicle in this range. The dealer has done what it can but they cannot redesign the vehicle. Acura must be aware of this issue and I believe is simply choosing to ignore it.

For about $5,000 - $7,000 more, you get better engine, aesthetics, reliability, build quality, luxury features such as keyless entry and brand cachet. ",5

There is just no excuse for this.I had a few accessories added which so far may not have been worth it. The roof rack has a very poor fit and finish, of course that could be to the way the dealer installed it.The cargo cover is just a bad design.

Having said that, after driving the car for six months, there are a number of short comings.The first is that the rear seat does not fold flat when turned down. This makes it more difficult to store stuffSecond, I would have preferred a heated steering wheel (OK, I want to be pampered)Third the gas mileage is a bit disappointing, particularly considering that premium fuel is requiredNext, the transmission down shifting as one slows down at a stop light is ragged and noticeable.The GPS system is a bit cumbersome, and cannot be used while driving. The phone system is also a fight to use while driving. I end up calling on my phone and letting the  system transfer it to the car's system. Translated the speak while driving system is a failure Parts of the technology are still difficult to use, and not quite intuitive. Voice recognition system is at best crummyThe seat is a bit uncomfortable. I have tried various cushions, and positions. For long distance driving, the most effectve method for me is to stop and stretch my legs. Drive is a bit more sporty than I would like. The MDX has a better system that lets you select 'sporty' or 'luxury'(The MDX costs $10,000 more, and is 10"" longer. To me again, a bit pricey)One of the reasons that I purchased the car is the dealer. Our local dealer is absolutely terrific, and makes up for some of what I perceive as the short commings of the vehicleI would have preferred more storage cubby holes.Ergonomics are average.  Every time I get in the car, I have to be careful not to hit my head on the top of the door frameAcceleration is excellent (obviously this is an offset for the mileage)Seats are marginally comfortable, particularly on long rides.Stereo is goodI enjoy the ride,again, the seat is a bit uncomfortable for long tripsEvery car is a compromise, and there are no perfect gradesDespite my negative comments, the car, overall, is pretty good.I have particularly good things to say about the reliability and dealerThe all wheel drive and convenient size is a very big draw for me; it seamlessly handles wet, icy and snowy conditions, and is easy to park in the cityThis is a very nice car, but is also a work in progressAfter a year, I can say I really enjoy the ride, except for the seat on long ridesThe only gripe I really have are the Takata air bags.

1257, on 12/16/15 14:39 PM (PST),Nick ,2015 Acura RDX SUV Technology Package 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Significantly Less Value Than Expected," First off; the technology package is a waste of money and a sad trick Acura has played on buyers. The NAV system is near worthless when programming at a standstill, it is completely worthless once you are moving down the road and the ""Technology Package"" takes you into voice mode.  The voice mode makes you spell out destinations one letter at a time and then, for each letter, goes through a long (10 second) dialog on how to choose the next letter (?). This is really a poor joke on the consumer. The voice recognition system operates with about a 50% accuracy and by the time you get the address entered, you have spent your entire trip arguing with the ""Technology Package"". Simple fix; purchase a $100 Garmin and put it in front of the useless NAV screen. The road noise, harshness, and vibration is horrible; the Honda CR-V has a much improved ride over the more expensive Acura. Handling; the body roll is annoying and feels downright unstable on twisty roads. Fuel economy, throttle response, and acceleration are dismal on the ""Multi-Point/Low Pressure Fuel Injection"" compared to ""Direct Injection"" engines found on other similar and lower priced vehicles of the same vintage and category. The controls and displays are awkward at best and are not at all intuitive. Compared to earlier model Acura vehicles, these ""technology"" systems have taken a huge step backward.  Oh, unlike the cheap Honda CR-V base model, this Acura does not include a rear cargo area floor mat.  Imagine that! What can I say about the car that I like... it looks good, the leather feels nice, everything works (albeit it's a new car).I've been a Honda customer over the past 10 years, Honda makes a solid no-frills, trouble free, turn key vehicle. This was my first Acura and this will be my last Acura unless Acura gets serious about building a car to help a driver get from one place to another efficiently, easily, and with minimal frustration.  Thank God I only took out a 3 year lease on this buggy; I'll be happy to hand the keys back and tell the dealer they can find another Acura customer. Make sure to test drive this vehicle thoroughly (like for several hours and over bumpy twisty roads) before signing on the dotted line.Update as of May 18th, 2016:  This vehicle has been recalled for a faulty SRS (air bag). We received a notification, the dealer told is not to drive the vehicle until parts arrive, which are expected late summer 2016. We have been provided rental vehicles by the dealer, not Acura vehicles mind you, but typical rental vehicles. Dealer told me that I should feel blessed that they are doing anything at all.

The reliability of the Audi and Volvo scared me away.  The twin turbo/supercharged engines will obviously have thier issues in time, so this feels like the right choice.However, the BMW, cruises on the open road a bit nicer.  This starts pushing the rpm's at about 80, while the bmw will cruise up to 100 without breaking  a sweat.  There are  minor advantages to each.  Overall, I went with the reliability of the Honda brand.  At 23K miles, it has been a great decision.Updating; at 30k miles, it is a great ride.  Perfect car for where we live and our needs.  Better car than the MDX which has better reviews,  the Lexus has no visibility and lame Toyota performance, and the Audi and Porsche will be in the shop another month before you can use them again.  Hyundai and Subaru are dangerously underpowered.  This is the easy winner.  Best car on the road imo.",5

You can get 30 mpg with all highway if you're light on the gas. I read some suspension complaints, and I understand why they're here. The back axle is pretty rigid and clunks over rough bumps. It's the only real problem with the car I've seen so far, but it's tolerable. The car handles great and has a smooth, linear power delivery with more than adequate acceleration. The  transmission also shifts smoothly. The steering is a bit loose at slow speeds, but picks up heft with speed.Overall, this is a great car for the money.",4

Bottom the rear suspension on the RDX is horrible.  Whenever you drive over the smallest bump on the road the rear suspension ""clunks"" and transmits the impact directly to the occupants. There's nothing wrong with the car (I had the dealer check) basically it's just poor suspension design. Unfortunately when I test drove the car it was on smooth recently paved roads - big mistake.  Search any of the Acura owner/community sites and you'll see plenty of similar comments about the 2013 to present RDX and the same issue with 2014 - present MDX and TLX. There are other quality issues/non-user friendly quirks with the RDX but the horrible suspension was a deal breaker (and ridiculous for a $36K ""luxury vehicle""). I've now sold the RDX - my first and last Honda/Acura product. Very happy with a German SUV now.",1

But there are some stupid things that should be in a car of this class.1) The front passenger seat does not go up causing discomfort for some people and makes them feel like they are sitting on the floor.2) There is no air conditioning vent in the rear. If it can be in smaller and less expensive cars, I see no reason why this can only have the cut out for it.3) There is no light in the luggage compartment. That is ridiculous.Aside from these ""small"" issues, I love the car but these little annoyances can and should be easily fixed.Update, I have had the car now 2 1/2 years and it has 36000 miles. The car ride and performs fantastic. The seats are extremely comfortable (except the passenger seat only goes forward and back and my wife needs to sit on a pillow). I did subsequently to the original writing of this review find a light in the rear tailgate but those other annoyances still exist and are still frustrating. However in the 2016 model each of them were fixed. The car comes off lease in 6 months and I honestly do not know what I am going to do. The 2017 model is essentially the same with a few updates and fixes to the annoyances and there is a piece of me that wants something different.

The voice command feature offers choices that often don't relate to what you need and the thing usually doesn't accurately capture what you say.  The maps are sloppy and haven't kept up with other gps providers, so you routinely find yourself getting a signal that you are ""not on a digitized road"" when your iphone or Garmin shows that very road clearly. Lazy engineering here.  Also, there are destination commands that the system won't accept (try to enter Indianapolis International Airport on Co. H. Weir Road-mine won't take it).  Also, on a ""luxury"" car, one would think they would allow updates to the maps on a detachable thumb drive that could be plugged into a computer port instead of the clumsy, expensive updates-at-the-dealer system.  My urgent suggestion is that Acura (Honda) get in touch with the folks at Garmin who are developing an OEM navigation system for Daimler that doesn't have these faults and which may cost less now that development is about done.",4

I test drove a Ford Explorer, Nissan Murano, Hyundai Santa Fe and I bought the RDX with the tech package.  The reliability reviews over the others was one of the main points but after owning it I really have come to appreciate its high points.  The ride is smooth, powerful and really quiet.  The sound canceling system (like Bose headphones) does a great job. Being a musician, I was impressed with the stereo and during my test drive we adjusted the base and subwoofer to full potential and I was blown away.  The sound quality with the ten speakers in neural mode (surround sound) is amazing. Some reviewers complained about having two screens.  I prefer it and it’s much more pleasing to be able to still see your audio screen while navigation is showing on a different screen.  Brilliant!  They recommend 91 octane which basically doesn’t exist anywhere so I need to use 93.  I’m not thrilled about that but at least gas is cheap now.  I drive both highway and city to get to work so it seems I’m averaging around 19 mpg. No long trips yet to really see highway mileage. I live in South Florida and I can say that the air really cranks.  Most of the time I only have the fan halfway even though the leather seats in summer can be hot.  The advanced package has ventilated seats but will cost you at least $3500 more on your out the door price.  I passed.  The shortcuts menu, speed dial options, voice prompts and other technology is a big plus.  I went from a stupid car (Honda Accord 2007) to this so it’s like walking onto the Enterprise!  I can’t imagine anyone buying this car and not liking it.  I paid $40,000 even out the door which seems to be a pretty decent price for a 2017 with the tech package. Updated11/3/2016. I can now confirm highway mileage on a long trip at 29 mpg which is as Acura estimated.  I like this car even more now as I've been using more of the bells and whistles.

About 1/3 of the time, my hands-free calls would fail to connect and leave the phone in ""private mode"" and utterly useless for 2-3 minutes.  Worse yet, the voice recognition was horrific.

When I pushed preset 1, the tuner would tune to 94.7, exactly as expected, but the label on the display was sometimes 138.9, sometimes all Cyrillic characters, sometimes all 1's and many other random values.  As long as I remembered what preset went with which stations, I was good to go.The navigation system works, but the traffic indicators are illegible.  It actually took me a couple of weeks to realize I actually had traffic indicators on the Nav because the colors are so muted and the lines so fine.Traction was abysmal in the rain and poor when it was dry.  While the RDX handles well (within traction limits), and ride quality was good, the traction was just such a liability.Interior build quality was revealed itself to be sub-par over the second half of my year of ownership.  I had squeaking, creaking rear suspension, rattling door panels and a squealing A/C fan.Under the hood, only one complaint.  I had a pulley that squealed as it spun down after engine shutdown.On the plus side, Fuel economy was quite good and when I sold it last week, I got $35,000 for trade-in after only paying $39,500.  Headlights and general visibility from the vehicle were first rate.  That's about it for positives.",2

Adaptive Cruise, lane change warning and other safety features are just awesome.  Brakes are terrific.  Compared to our Lucerne, road noise is much worse, but tolerable; interior is not par w/price.  Ride is pretty good for suv.  Acura cheaps out on some features that will annoy you every time you drive it.  For the RDX, only one of the two key remotes w/the applicable pkg will start the car.  With the MDX, both remotes will do it.  Guess Acura saved a couple bucks to hack off customers.   Bad design is driver seat position.  Our Buick had it right..seat went all the way back when ignition turned off, making getting out really easy, after getting in, push driver 1 or 2 and seat, outside mirror, and interior mirror repositioned.  With the RDX, using the driver 1 or 2 setting, the seat positioned PRIOR to getting in.  For us short people, that made getting in difficult.  The inside mirror also was not among the setting.  We had to disable the seat positioning setting.  A really bad design.  Door panels are sorta cheap also.  Overall, a nice car, fun to drive but some cheap outs.  Not worth the price..but close.",3

I got out of a BMW X5 for this one and the RDX is way better than my old bimmer.  The main thing I was looking for was a silky ride with a very quiet cabin.  I get both with this RDX.  The power train is exceptional with the standard v6.  The cabin is very quiet although some what less so than Edmunds reviews said.  Where Edmunds gave it an ""A"" - I would say it's probably a ""B"" or ""B+"".  It is quiet at low speeds but gets louder on highways.  As a plus, the ELS stereo on the Technology Package is an incredible system that makes the feint noise go away, replaced with beautiful music.  Navigation system is lame, use Google maps instead.  Edmunds says the screen controls for the tech is ""confusing"" but I disagree.  If this control panel confuses you, you probably shouldn't be buying something called a technology package.

She has been driving an 08 awd Acura RL and loved it. We put snow tires on it for the winter and it was a tank in the snow with the SH awd. So for us to trade it in was a big deal. I started doing some research on Edmund's and started to list the suv's we should consider. I test drove over 12 myself and reduced it down to 5 we should consider. We decided to stay in the mid size or smaller range since it is just the two of us. We picked one day to test drive all 5 for comparison. The Lexus NX and RX were the first she drove. Next she drove the Acura RDX then the Hyundai Tucson and Santa Fe. The RDX beat them all with the 6 cylinder engine, it was by far the most peppy of them all and drove more sporty than the RX. It seems like everyone has an RX these days so they are kinda of boring to us. The RDX is full of technology which has been greatly been improved upon since we had it in our RL. The biggest is the blind spot, auto braking, cross traffic and adaptive criuse control. I have using them and they help greatly with driving. We are happy with our decision and have found acura's hold their resale value as well as being reliable. By the way, the Hyundai Tucson was our second choice, which we may buy as a second car in the future. It is about $10000 less than the RDX and has alot of the same features.",5
1314, on 11/22/15 18:06 PM (PST),Ralph Smith ,2016 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Comfortable Ride with Tech Pkg to Make Geeks Happy," I bought this car because the ride is quiet, the acceleration is excellent, the ride is comfortable, it has a very good safety rating and safety technology is state of the art. I also liked the Acura's reputation for reliability. I enjoy a good sound system and the RDX with the Advance package is among the best I have heard in a car. We drive a lot of miles each year on long vacation driving trips. Since the car is also used around town, the smaller size of this SUV is convenient as it rides well on a trip but also easy to park in a city.  There have been a couple of surprises. While I knew the car had great safety features, I had not really experienced the changes introduced to my life by this car until taking it on a trip shortly after buying the car. The surprise is that it requires changing how to drive in many respects and requires a new driver for this car to adjust to the technology.Specifically, the ability of the car to adjust its speed with the traffic. Don't misinterpret: I like the changes but on a busy interstate, one needs to pay attention to adjust to the changes. Cars and trucks pull in front of a car unexpectedly. The first time this happened, the Acura RDX slowed dramatically and automatically. I did not have to apply the brakes. Several days into this driving trip, I had adjusted and found myself becoming almost lackadaisical about this feature as the car almost adjusts itself. Driving is more relaxing. On a busy highway, I disabled the system though as the distance between my car and the next vehicle was long, even with the lowest setting, and occasionally a large number of cars would continually pull in front and constantly slow down our pace of driving.I did not like the feature of adjusting the steering  when changing lanes or moving in traffic. I turned this feature off quickly. No doubt, I will try it again but doubt it will be useful or one that I will use with any regularity. I prefer to drive the car and change lanes as necessary without objection from the computer in the car.My biggest complaint in an otherwise excellent vehicle is the navigation system. I don't like it or how in integrates with the other system technology. The navigation systems in previous cars are much better. The Acura system is not intuitive or designed with the driver or consumer in mind. It works with the voice control but the list of possible commands is long and ignores some of the most common features available on other vehicles.I still do not know if I can send instructions to the car to follow a route I have created on the computer. The Acura site indicates I can do this. The salesman who sold us the car said he had never heard of that feature. A system like this works well on a Mercedes that I own. The manual is silent on on how to do it. The website offers no advice. I do not mind making a call with Acuralink to enter the destination but would prefer to map it out myself to select my own routes.The ability to use the smartphone with the Acura's system is an excellent innovation. I also like being able to stream a podcast or Pandora through the stereo system. Sirius XM generally works well with the Acura although the traffic and weather features do not integrate with the RDX. We used those features extensively with a 2012 Murano and this lack of integration is a significant failing of a luxury SUV. There is weather and traffic information on the RDX, it is not up to Sirius.Unfortunately, the navigation system operates in its own universe. The voice system giving directions cannot be heard clearly while sound is coming through these other systems. Instead, the systems yammers away incessantly with turns and directions while leaving the stereo system as a higher volume. Moreover, attempts to turn down the navigation system with the voice controls apparently cannot be done. At least I have not found a way to do this or to find in the documentation how it can be done.In my older Murano, I was able to know when the next rest area was coming up as well as when the next exit was coming up. Not so in the Acura. Asking for rest areas results in a list of rest areas, some of which may be behind on the route being traveled or may be many miles ahead. The information is useless. One friend who bought an Acura said he gave up and bought a Garmin navigation system to use instead of the built in system. I now know how he felt and I am inclined to agree. The nav system in the RDX is a major disappointment. As a person who uses a system like this extensively on trips, I have already found using Google maps or Waze on my IPhone to be much more useful and easier to use. With an MSRP of $45,000 for this luxury SUV, I expected much better. Moreover, the Acura salesman was not well versed in how to use the system so learning how to use it has been largely trial and error and stopping occasionally to check the manual to see if we missed something that would make it more useful.",3
1315, on 11/17/15 21:01 PM (PST),Bob ,2016 Acura RDX SUV AcuraWatch Plus Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Great overall value.  Nice luxury features.," Owned the 2016 RDX for 2 months.  Bought the FWD with technology package.  The RDX has the best overall engine for small SUV.  Same engine as the MDX, but much smaller car means better performance.  Great HP for its class.  Very good gas fuel economy and uses regular unleaded gas.  Other SUV's that had similar HP were turbo charged engines that required premium gas (i.e. more expensive to operate).  Transmission is 6 speed automatic that is very smooth and shift points are perfect.  Ride quality is a little stiff, but that helps with handling.  The car is very quite when windows are rolled up.  Seats are very comfortable.  Very nice dual displays (one of which is touch screen).  Premium stereo with XM and HD FM.  I like the HD FM sound quality.  It has a 15GB hard disc so you can save CD's or transfer songs from USB stick.  There are 2 key fobs that you can customize most of the car features for each.  Seating position, radio settings, navigation settings, are just a few of the items.  Car recognize which key is closer and those settings are active for that driver.  Very nice.  Only a few negatives:  Lots of wind noise when back windows are down more than about 1 inch.  The electronics take about 1 minute to boot up when you start the car.  Does not sound like much, but much slower than my Lexus that is 8 years older.  Navigation system works good, but a little funky to set.  Sound quality is good compared to standard quality systems, but less than other premium systems.** 2.5 years and 29K miles update.  Still very happy with the car.  No mechanical issues.  The stereo had some memory problem, but was under warranty so the dealer replaced it and solved the problem.  Really the only complaint is the slow electronics system.  Entering address in navigation system is cumbersome.  Usually just use Waze and skip the car nav system.  Other than that, the rest of the car runs perfectly.  Gas mileage still very good at 25MPG+ in mixes hwy/street driving.  Engine and transmission are strong.  No squeaks or rattles in the body.  The key fob memory is a really nice feature.  I like how seats adjust and my music stations are personalized for me when I am driving.",4

My first was a 2014, which I was happy with, despite a few minor irritations. The 2016 took care of my irritations with added technology, specifically the blind spot and rear traffic warning sensors and changes in the technology package. The RDX has two good blind spots so the new tech is fantastic and solves the issues - and works beautifully. The 2016 feels heavier and drives smoother than the 2014. The steering feels better and more substantial, as well.  It is also quieter with less wind noise and a smoother sunroof mechanism.   I did purchase a wind deflector this time though. I love the 3D navigation viewing option and the 10-speaker sound system is wonderful.  I've had Acuras since 2000 - three TLs (2000, 2003 and 2008), the 2014 RDX and now the 2016 RDX.  My 2000 TL had transmission issues, which were taken care of by the dealer even though the warranty had expired. I've always been treated well by the Dealer (in South Orange County in California).  I did not test drive competitors' vehicles, but did a lot of research on the Lexus RX, Lincoln MDX, Mercedes GL and GLK and some of the BMW and Audi SUVs, which would have fit into my budget. At the end of the day, I could not justify a higher cost for the competitors (when comparing the multitude of packages available with the competition), even though they may be more prestigious in name and perhaps more luxury interiors.  The value, quality and solid luxury of the Acura won out when I decided not to tie up more of my money and still have all the bells and whistles you get with the RDX.",5

However, the breaking system seems not responsive enough, I have to press harder in order to make it stop.  Within a month, I heard noise while I hit break this morning, within a month!  The noise was gone when I drive it during my lunch break, maybe it's the temperature, but still, it shouldn't do that because it's a new car. Also, the engine is so called ""smart V6"", it switches from 3 cylinders to 6 cylinders depends on the situation, I can actually feel it.  The car vibrate a lot while it's on 3 cylinders mode, solid and smooth while it's on 6 cylinders.  Not very good. While the exterior is superb, it's way better than the previous RDX models, but the interior looked outdated compare with its competitors. The Bluetooth is convenient, but it kept disconnected and connected, can't stay connected.  Also, only the contact that's input to the speed dial (in car system, not phone speed dial) can display the caller ID when there is an incoming call.  There are only 15 space speed dial for RDX.  I missed many phone calls because I do not pick up number that I can't recognize, then I found those were actually people that I know but the car didn't display the caller ID because they are not in the car speed dial system. It's pretty dumb and outdated design. Finally, there is a backup camera, but no backup sensor... Doesn't make any sense.  The sensor should be standard if the camera is standard. Therefore, I like this car, but I can't give it a 5 stars because of the flaws mentioned above.",4
1319, on 10/08/15 16:00 PM (PDT),Frank Runco ,2016 Acura RDX SUV Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Nice," This is our 3rd RDX and I must say the 2011 was best the best handling and most fun to drive although kinda choppy. I liked that, wife didn't. We got the advanced package and the tech is way much and rather complicated for her. It's her car and she likes it. Got the advanced because of parking sensors front and back and nicer rims. Biggest complaint was the lack of color selection (did away with silver-now slate silver BLUE) ugh. Bought the white. Almost went to BMW because of that. Interior selection also limited, parchment only with white, no black. They still insist on a 16 gallon tank, way too small considering mileage has been about 21. Always stopping to feel up. Took a small 200 mile trip and still about 22.5. We've never had an issue with an Acura product and love our dealer. Have a 12 TSX and 14 TL SHAWD as well. Love them all. In retrospect tech would have been fine at 3000 less. And yes she would buy again.UPDATE Have now had this vehicle 7 months and still not sure of the tech stuff and not liking most of it. Hard to see buttons and writing on them. Find myself searching all the time. Dual screen is foolish, makes no sense and is distracting while driving and hard to see in sun. Stupid that you cant operate phone book while driving. I guess designers think it's safer to pick up a phone and start searching. My 12 TSX and 14 TL both tech so much more user friendly.

1323, on 08/20/15 11:45 AM (PDT),Richard Fisher ,2016 Acura RDX SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Another disappointment," This is my second RDX.  I had a 2013 Base AWD drive model which was a very nice car but lacked the technology options.Now I have an 2016 Advanced AWD and the technology looks promising but disappoints again.  The Nav system has only level of directions; no verbose or minimal.  The instructions do not override the radio .  I would like to have the radio go silent so I can hear the instructions. Yes I can turn the instructions off which is nice.The speed limit is not shown (nicer would be if the speed would go red if I above it - either 1 mph or some amount I specify).  The nice folks at Acura could not help me move my addresses from my Garmin to the Acura Nav system.Wonder if Acura will ever truly think through the tech on their cars?After 2 years.  While the car is a pleasant to drive, I find it taking in a number of ways. -  Adaptive cruise control is very abrupt, especially when someone moves into my lane. - The rear area is too small.  My wife has an outback and her back area is about a foot longer.-  Fuel economy is the same (on paper) as the MDX though the MDX is significantly larger and weighs much more.After two years with the car, I am trading it in for more space on an Outback.  Not as fancy, not as plush, but at least I will not feel cheated.  Acura failed to deliver on (1) fuel economy, (2) technology, and (3) interior space.  I  believe all this was done to protect the more pricy and profitable MDX line.  Here is a message for Acura - if you don't eat your own lunch, someone else will do so.  In protecting the MDX from the dumbed-down RDX you have made the RDX vulnerable to competitors.  And I have succumbed to a better car, IMO, at a much lower price.After 2 years I decided to change to a Subaru Outback.  It has more space in the back and is a more honest car.  No dumbing down, WYSIWYG.",2
1324, on 08/19/15 14:04 PM (PDT),jrasero ,2016 Acura RDX SUV AcuraWatch Plus Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),35 more months to go!," Just leased a 2016 Acura RDX AWD Base.  Picked it up on July 31st and have put over 500 miles on it so far.  My purchase rational is comparing my parents Honda CRV EX-L Navigation versus a base RDX.  First and foremost the biggest difference between the CRV and RDX besides the Acura beak is the great 3.5 liter motor which has plenty of kick and power unlike the whiny CVT.  My father loves the great MPG on his CRV but hates the lack of power and secondly he hates the motor and wind noise.  The RDX has great pickup, the exhaust notes are smooth and crisp, and cabin noise is much better than a CRV and equal to my 2011 Lincoln MKZ.  The seats are comfy but the base comes with leatherette which is a little of a bummer, but the leatherette is still much better than the material used in an EX-L Honda.  The base is pretty bare bones and really to get the most bang for your buck the Acura Watch is the best option to choice.  Some standard features like blue ambient lighting,  turn signals, power lift gate, backup camera, keyless entry, push to start ignition, and sunroof are all notable.  The center stack and steering wheel still has way too many buttons. Visibility isn't great out of the back and getting Acura Watch w/ backup sensors would really help.  For a luxury car I would like to have seen backup sensors and blind spot warning standard.  Acura recommends premium fuel and on my first 2 tanks I have gotten 19 MPG average and 22 MPG average, hopefully after breaking in the motor and going for longer highway trips I will average 22-26 MPG.  Steering is good but numb and ride comfort is okay.  The RDX is firmer than I imagined and tends to bounce you around when going over bumps.

We don't use the Bluetooth (don't talk on the phone while driving), but all the electronics seem great.  Phenomenal stereo system - easily the best we've ever had in a car.  The only real shortcoming is wind noise.  We test drove the vehicle twice and both times it was raining.  Now that we've driven the car for 500 miles I can truly say the wind noise is nothing short of ridiculous.  Yes, I know there is a three layer seal in the doors, but that doesn't stop the wind noise.  I don't know that we've never owned a car with wind noise this bad.  It's totally unacceptable for most cars, but for a car with a sticker price of roughly $43k it is shameful.  Cranking up the stereo is the only way to avoid hearing it all.",4

Just enough to feel confident without suffering back pains. I put regular gas for 1k miles recently, and to my surprise, there was no loss in power.

That made the RDX a no-brainer. Yes, it has a firm ride - it's on the sport side of SUV. It's much better than a truck-based SUV (such as my PF), and by giving up a Caddy-like ride, you're rewarded with actual road feedback and sharp handling.

I just garaged my 600 hp track Vette, my Prius produced a distinct adrenaline deficiency.  Looked at Subaru WRX, WRX STI for fun factor in winter but too small for family.  The Acura is loaded with options, well built (solid), comfortable enough.  Make no mistake this mini-SUV is a BLAST to drive.  I am surprised they don't market this differently.  Turbo 4 banger, SH-AWD Michelin Pilot rubber - snow is good!  I can also fit kids, wife, dog, etc.  Very happy with performance, technology is overdone - voice recognition nav system rivals BMW iDrive as far as frustration level",4.375

Highway and street ride and performance is great.  Pickup is a little slow under 20 MPH but really winds up once the turbocharger is engaged.  On the highway with the cruise set you can get 22-24 MPG at 75-80 MPG.  Great pickup at high speeds for highway passing.  In the city MPG is closer to 18.  On the beach the all-wheel drive helps out and takes bumps and loose sand very well.  Dirt roads are the same.  I have not taken it on much worse than maintained dirt roads because of the somewhat low clearance and I bought it mostly as a highway vehicle.  Almost every feature you need is included.,4.875

No other car gives you the high-tech toys for such a reasonable price.  All the toys work and make this a great car to drive.  It is very quick and responsive and am getting 21 MPG. It is impossible for people to be getting 14 mpg unless they are goosing the car every chance they get. This is not a luxury sedan.

Don't ever turn the car off with the steering wheel in anything but the straight position, if wheels are not straight, you will have problems turning the key in the ignition.  Gas mileage is awful; acceleration certainly not 'peppy'; requires premium gas; oil changes require synthetic oil.  Bought this car outright (not leased).

There are just too many quirks in design that make this vehicle really annoying. The gas mileage has not improved with time, only getting 13 mpg. The audio constantly dimming ANYTIME you hit another button on the dash. The drive is similar to a BMW which is fine. The fact that you cannot import an address book with the handsfree is just stupid. Other Acura models have this feature, except RDX. For a few thousand dollars more get a BMW. Yes they nickel and dime you to death on options, but they make a great driving machine. Acura, in my book, has a long way to go. ",3

The ride is so harsh that on a mildly bumpy road your head bounces off the restraint.  On rough roads you had better hold the steering wheel very tight or you will get bounced off and lose control of the vehicle.  I got over the lack of simple luxury items like seats that fold onto themselves and no power rear gate but the ride is something else.  I am EXTREMELY sorry that I leased the '08 RDX.  Acura has no clue that this is an issue as the response ""well it is based on a truck"" so I don't expect future models to address the ride.",2.625

I absolutely love the way the car drives, the interior, and the outside. It drives smooth as a brand new car. The only thing that I have an issue with is the cup holders. They don't really do anything with a 20 oz water bottle or pop bottle, it more or less just topples front to back when driving. I'm a realtor by trade and the car is more than spacious enough.

An unbelievable 30.5 mpg over cross country trips with my foot into it a little bit. Better to verify all servicing is done before you buy used. Make sure the dealer or private party has all records. Timing belts, water pumps, etc only need replacing every 110K miles or so, but when they do they are spendy.

It drives as smooth and as quiet, and as much power and is as comfortable as when it was new, perhaps even more so. Well designed, perfect size and weight, plenty of power. I didn't get the nav system, but I hear the older ones aren't really that great anyway and they were overpriced. So today, it probably would be worthless.

I remember driving to Florida from DC - I glanced at the speedometer and realized I was at 95 mph and the car was still smoothly gliding down the road.  While the exterior is not as glamorous as other cars in its class, its conservative body is not an eyesore.

Have been disappointed in several things, the center console armrest leather ripped after only 4 years and no real wear and tear. Dealer wanted $350 to replace so I did it myself for about $50. The exterior chrome molding/gasket came loose on both sides and cost $400 to replace each. The passenger AC ducts became stuck in 1 position and had to pay another $400 to fix. There are 2 individual sides and now both sides have become stuck in 1 position again. Battery was replaced twice in 3 years, after it was no longer covered by warranty I went to Sam's Club and purchased their battery and haven't had a problem yet.

Better car to drive.," The 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD is a fantastic car to own.  A lot of ownership satisfaction in a car with Honda/Acura reliability, great looks inside and out, and great driving experience.  The SH-AWD provides an unparalleled driving experience in turns and makes the car an all-season, all-weather performance vehicle.  Love to drive in the snow while everyone else is stuck at home with their Camaros, Mustangs, and the list goes on.  The interior is fantastic.  Great seats and driving experience behind the wheel.  Love the nav system in this car.  The ""too many buttons"" complaint is just silly.  Drive it for a week and you will understand.    The only negatives are the following:  slalom driving is not this car's best function, trunk is a little small, back seats are more comfortable for two, need more cup holders throughout the car, some maintenance items can get pricey.",5

(for a car that's only five years old with 50,000 miles.)  Bad transmission, broken window control, airbag drivers side, broken radio, just out of warranty. (This is a common problem apparently.) In addition, the dealer has damaged the car twice.  One time they scratched the paint in 2 places through to the primer. Another time they ripped up the upholstery on the armrest .   They fixed it both times, but wasted a lot of my time, There is no excuse for damaging the vehicle.  Everything but the radio has been under warranty.

The car has minimal body roll, strong brakes, brisk acceleration. Passing cars is a breeze. You go from 65-85 in less than 2.5 seconds. Wheel has torque steer, be prepared for it, even when accelerating at highway speeds. Interior could be quieter. Wind and road noise is noticeable. Brake feel is great, doesn't dive when braking and the transmission shifts smoothly at all speeds making it a very comfortable commuter car on the jam packed 805 and 5. I wish the car had direct injection and valve shut off. Commute is 17 miles. 5 miles of which are torture, 12 of which are open, averaging only 21.3 mpg. Wish the car had 20-30 more hp. Paddle shifters work extremely well allowing you to downshift to slow down like a manual transmission increasing longevity of brakes.",4

1478, on 03/08/16 04:27 AM (PST),Cowboy911 ,2012 Acura TL Sedan SH-AWD 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Excellent value," The Acura TL Sh-AWD rides like it on rails. Cornering at speed is an awe inspiring experience with the SH-AWD driving you through the corners, never experienced anything like it. The seats are excellent, steering a little heavy for me but centers great, brakes are large and bring the car to a stop with no drama. I have the 19"" wheels, so the tires a low profile 45's, look great but the ride is very tight - like you would expect with high performance rubber. I personally love the ride and the suspension does a great job with such aggressive tires making the ride just soft enough. I bought the car used with 50k miles on it. Have driven it for 1 year and had the propeller shaft replaced under warranty.  No hassles from the Acura dealership who said they have a maintenance bulletin on the issue. I've owned 5 Acuras in the past and can say w/o reservation they have always been great values. Great ergonomics and quality with a reasonable price, especially when compare to the competition.Interior is perfection. I've read complaints about the business of the dash, but once you live with the car for a week you appreciate the convenience of having dedicated buttons for all the key functions at your finger tips. No need to navigate through screens to change the heating/AC settings, fan speed, rear defrost, etc - its all right there. The seats are so nice that traffic jams no longer bother me, I just settle into the ridiculously comfortable seats and relax - its done wonders for my blood pressure.I drive mostly highway and have been getting 27 mpg, higher than their advertise highway mpg. The 6 speed transmission has been great, always seems to have the right gear selection, downshifting on que to maximize performance of the 3.7 engine. Shifts have been smooth with regular driving, but stomp the gas pedal and the sifts become more aggressive - LOVE IT!Of all my Acura, this has been the most enjoyable to drive, although the original Integra was a riot for their day.",5

Traded in my truck and just needed something to get me from point A to B. Quite frankly, this car rocks!!! I took this car on the highway-- I-80 North..it took my breath away when it hits the corners. The AWD drive is just unbelievably impressive, even at high speeds. The seats hugs every inch of your body, keeping you sucked in as the car hits high speeds in twist and turns. Not muscle car status, BUT it delivers a wallop of a ride. Good job Acura.  The voice recognition and Bluetooth are very responsive, in fact the entire tech setup is ergonomically satisfying.Only objection: TOO COMFORTABLE.",5

Had trouble with the car since the day I purchased it. Navigation is awful, the directions are misleading, it doesn't take you on the most direct route and the POI has completely wrong address information and has taken me to places that didn't exist at least 5 times. I have not been able to use a device plugged into the USB port at all, it causes the screen to freeze or reset. I brought the car to Acura and they supposedly changed the unit itself, all wiring and the USB port and it still doesn't work. My worst complaint of all is the transmission. It's extremely jerky especially when shifting into 2nd gear and just isn't smooth at all. It really slows the engine down and now I know why the new Acuras have different transmissions. Otherwise the car handles very well, the seats are very comfortable I can drive all day, sound system very good. Not sure if these are common problems or I just got a lemon but wouldn't recommend.",3

I was looking for the new accord V6 Touring full loaded and after seating on the car and feeling how cheap the interior was. Everything is plastic, leather doesn't feel like real leather. I decided to take a look of the TL and decided rather to have a used TL than a brand new Honda Accord.

Good news- rock solid, better handling, excellent stereo, very comfortable. And, of course, the fact that it is a reliable Honda. But here's where they dropped the ball- too many buttons, incomprehensible logic in the controls, downgraded nav system (compared to the ease and logic of my 2000 version).

I drove the civic and it was NOTHING compared to the TL (Same for Nissan) So I just wanted to stop by an Acura dealer to check out the new TL, I looked and was shocked by the low price they put. So I went to a worker and wanted to test drive it. It was really comforting and you just take off from accelerating. So I bought the car for a really cheap price and took it home. My wife fell in love with the car, It was great for my family. I had the TL for 3 years so now and I had  NO problem. It never broke down no engine problems, it was like an angel. It's nothing compared to Audi, Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes. I recommend this car to people who like comfort, reliability, luxury and performance.",5

1593, on 07/21/15 10:22 AM (PDT),JackSafro ,2014 Acura TL Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6M),Practical Sports Sedan," As a lifelong car enthusiast with a baby and a frugal spouse, the TL fit the bill. The car is an underrated sleeper. It gives four-door, mid-sized, practicality, sporty driving dynamics, comfort, and tasteful style to my otherwise ""nose-to-the-grindstone"" life. My wife insisted I buy a Honda Accord. So I did! Only, I got the one with the big engine, super-handling all-wheel drive, and great stereo/technology. It was a good compromise between the mundane Honda sibling and a used BMW. My friend bought a very nice BMW 335 sedan when I bought my car. He is already talking about selling it because of the cost, poor BMW customer service, impractically small dimensions, and the many eat [dirt] looks he gets from other drivers. The TL's ""anonymity"" is a plus in my book. It is a nice looking car (I particularly like the interior) but not flashy.  What most people do not expect is that the car is FAST. It handles great too. Having strong pulling power on the highway is a huge plus, particularly when merging in metro-Atlanta traffic. However, my favorite thing about the car is the SH-AWD. When pulling out into traffic from a stop or speeding into a left turn to beat traffic, the AWD system provides supreme confidence. Wheel spin is (at most) a brief chirp. The car hooks up and pounces like a hungry cat. No drama, just direct, immediate, acceleration. This is immensely helpful in day-to-day driving (again... metro-Atlanta traffic...). The ride is smooth and relaxed in normal driving, but comes alive when pushed. The SH-AWD is like having a magic carpet under you. It begs for you to stay on the power to ""push"" the car through turns. It is addicting, and I find myself goosing the throttle all the time--much to the dismay of all the dead dinosaurs out there (more on that later). One thing to consider though is that, when taking turns off throttle, SH-AWD is not active and the car (front heavy as it is) under-steers. This means you need to plan a bit ahead to  take advantage of the torque vectoring, especially if your car has a manual transmission like mine. The car is smooth on the highway and appropriately taught around town. It is quiet (much quieter than my father's 2010 model) and an overall joy to drive. I find it to be very secure and reassuring in inclement weather. The clutch is typical Honda (consistent and relatively light) and the shifting is quite good. The only knock is that I think it has a clutch delay valve. This means lightning quick 1-2 shifts will result in grinding synchros (and a jarring blow to your sporting mood). Gas mileage is ok. I average about 18 mpg (premium recommended) in mixed driving. But a heavy right foot will drop my mileage as low as 15. This has happened a couple of times, but is rare. On the highway, I will get 25 or more mpg's. Easy driving will yield decent mpg and the car feels very relaxed and smooth if driven that way. It is just so difficult to refrain from experiencing the horsepower and SH-AWD.The interior is a very nice place to be. I find the seats pretty comfortable, though with maybe too much lumbar support. I personally prefer buttons and really like the layout of the center stack. The gauges are clear and sporty. The lights on the car are excellent, casting illumination bright and far. With the fog lights on, you can see pretty well into turns too--a nice plus in poorly lit neighborhood driving. The bluetooth, navigation, stereo, etc. are excellent. I would love better Pandora integration (thumbs up/down, etc), but it works fine. Did I mention the stereo is great!?I have had two minor intermittent rattles. The dealer poured over the car and found a couple of un-seated retaining clips. What I found remarkable was the high level of quality service and attention from my local dealer's service department (and I didn't even buy the car from them). They provided a (super nice) loaner and made sure to address my concerns. No BMW dealer offers such a high level of service. My buddy who bought the BMW went to pick it up after purchase. They were supposed to fix a paint chip and address several other issues. They had not completed most of the work. The BMW dealer handed my friend some touch-up paint and told him to do it himself (unbelievable! It was a $50,000 car). Don't get me wrong. BMW makes incredible cars. But I'll stick with good service and value.Overall, I LOVE my TL. It is nice without being too flashy, sporty yet comfortable, and very practical  (though the trunk could be a smidge bigger). As anyone who's ever driven a Honda product knows, it is all about quality and value. The TL is not the fanciest or the sportiest. But it is arguably the most practical mix of traits that a practical car-enthusiast could want. And with Honda/Acura reliability and high re-sale values, I am confident about my purchasing decision. So go ahead, pick up a used one and enjoy! No one will look at you like you drive a BMW--even if you drive it like one.",5

I love my new TL. It has good power, reasonable gas mileage, and good handling. The BMW may be slightly better in handling, but the TL is way better than the BMW in reliability (I was stranded 3 times and almost stranded twice during the 6 years I owned it, but thatÂs a different story for the BMW forum). We have had many Honda cars before and it has always been very reliable for us. I am hoping my new TL will be just reliable and fun to drive for many years to come. As someone said here, Acura is trying to clear out their 2014 TL inventories making room for the new 2015 TLX model. So, there are some excellent deals on the 2014 TL now.",4.875

You will not regret it. ***Update for April of 2017****I have had my TL for just over 3 years and I have had 0 problems with it. What are you waiting for? Get a new or used TL. I have seen some of the reviews that only gives the car 3 stars out of 5. Either the reviewers don't know what they are talking about or their magazines did not get enough advertising $$$s. So I guess you want to hear some complaints? Here are two minor complaints. The trunk door is narrow which makes it more difficult to fit larger items into the trunk. The leather on the driver's side seat is creased in some places. Other than that, buy, drive and enjoy !****Original Review****This is my second TL. My first TL was a 2003 Base model which I traded in for a 2014 Silver Moon TL base model. I have to say, I love Acura and I love my new TL. Even though I have a base model, it comes with all the features and options that I need. Granted, there is no camera or web interface but with all the changes to that technology, anything you buy today is soon outdated tomorrow. I would prefer to just buy the latest cell or table for web and navigation.The ride is superb and the quality and construction is what I have come to expect from Acura.Best of all, the TL is the absolute best value out there!

When I purchased it at 50K, its brakes were pulsing and the dealership included a full brake job before I closed. Its A/C control was replaced a year later when it went out.

As with a '91 Accord I previously owned, the overall reliability and build quality of this car have been impeccable.  Comfort and luxury with just enough of a sporting flavor thrown in.  Comfortable for long trips, yet definitely not a marshmallowy Toyota- or Lexus-like ride.  Steering feel is excellent.

I've replaced the battery once and the tires once and other than oil changes and tire rotations, that's all I've had to ""fix"" in seven years.  Acceleration from slow or stop is outstanding; merging in heavy traffic is much easier than what I have experienced in other vehicles.  It's only a four-speed so it really isn't very fuel-efficient.

Cost less than a comparable milage Accord.  What a value.  Rides and handles like a dream, nice power.  Never thought I would own a car like this.  A luxury car with Honda depenability and serviceability.  Check engine light came on after having it a month.  Acura took care of it under a warranty memo they had for the problem.

I have never had it in service for a mechanical problem. As a female driver, this is very important to me.  I use premium gas as recommended but with todays prices, I am going to try mid- grade again although I tried that once and noticed a negative difference.  My mileage in the city is about 20 and on the highway 27-28.

My total expense for maintenance(incl oil changes), tires, batteries and repairs is less than $1600, including a new starter at 142000 mi. It still runs and handles like new. (I dont follow scheduled maintenance). Never tuned up, but do change oil and filter every 7500 mi. I still have the original plugs. Gets 26- 31 mi/ga; I use only regular.

Interior is great, make sure you strip the paint off your shiftknob, it is chrome underneath you know (99 TL only).  Exterior is very sexy and elegant, I think it stands out when detailed properly.

Gas milage only so-so. Interior design is certainly above average. Nice car to sit in for the most part. Seats showing wear earlier than suspected. Tranny had to be replaced at about 50000mi. Left me stranded on a hwy. Now having trouble starting the car when it has been raining for afew days. Dealer can't seem to find the reason. Overall I am disappointed.

GPS navigation system works like a charm .... you can't get lost.  Speed shift gives the control and acceleration of manual shifting, without a clutch.  225 hp engine packs enough punch, and still gets 25-27 mpg highway, and 20+ mpg city.

Love the acceleration and handling. Sexy little growl from the engine, just audible enough to hear, but not interfere. Stereo is best I've ever had in a car. (Had to scratch my head over the cassette player in a 2008 though). And I love the exterior styling, especially the rear tail lights. Totally unique to the 04-08 TL. Awesome cruise control. I regularly get 32 MPG highway. Very comfortable. I drive 600+ miles one way on a bi-weekly basis, with no ill effects. Now for the other side of the story: Bluetooth has never worked. Had to unplug it to keep the car battery from draining. ""AC control"" is a misnomer. It is either off, or freezing you out. Dealer tech tells me it works great. Leather....oh the leather. Looked great at first, (and I do regular cleaning and conditioning), but the perforated seat surfaces ripped just like the pages out of a spiral bound notebook. And the dash has cracked. It now looks like a map of the Canadian Provinces. Started having mechanical issues around 100K. Coil pack on #3 cylinder melted in the tube, a royal PITA. Next trip the ECM fried, leaving me stranded between work and home. It seems the AC duct work condensed water and dripped onto the ECM. It was full of water and corrosion. It is probable that the ECM caused the coil pack issue. At the 105K mile service, found two broken motor mounts, a common problem I am told. And may as well get the lifetime alignment deal from your local tire store. You will use it three to four times a year. I have never had a car that went out of alignment so easily. So, while I love my TL, I will not buy another, as I can't afford a new one, and will not trust a used one again.",3

Purge value in the evap system, easy fix.  O-rings on the hydraulic steering system (loud sound on cold mornings that goes away as engine warms, an easy fix).  Hydraulic shocks/struts for the hood, easy fix.  O2 sensors, a bit trickier fix.  Check Youtube for demos on replacing these items and save big, big bucks over expensive Acura dealers.  The nav system is not intuitive and if it has the original DVD, you'll pay like $170 for an upgrade that is, unfortunately, probably worth it.  The upgrade has all U.S. major roads and city streets.  The original only had 72 cities and was filled with irrelevant stuff like reviews of restaurants.  Big diff.  Do not tint the rear window or the nav won't be accurate............as it isn't in mine.  Grrrr.   Car holds value well, it appears, and I think that is because it is one of the best looking of the TL series plus Honda's reliability record which is best with their 4 cylinder jobs, not six cylinders.

Go for the better tires.  I don't agree completely with the car being described as having sporty handling, especially as a front-driver, as it pushes through the turns.

It met all my expectations and the value is definitely there.  It's not the most exciting car, but it's very handsome, and it suits my driving style just fine.

I started looking around at smaller, more fuel efficient models like the Accord and Civic but finally gave in and decided that a little luxury and styling had to be worth something. I really like the handling but my one knock is that it seems to give the slightest vibration at around 60 but then over that it goes away.  I'll keep an eye on that but it might just be engine rattle at that rpm.  Corners seem to grab and hold like I am not used to and I find myself heading into curves with a bit more confidence.

When you compare this to a 3 series BMW you will find 40K plus to get close to the standard equipment on the TL, and that is with BMW's standard ""leatherette"" interior without upgrade.  Yes, for those who have not researched it, real leather is NOT standard on a 3 series, you pay about $1,500 to get it.

I have been experiencing 32-34 mpg on our long TX highways traveling between 70 and 80 mpg.  This was better than I expected and much appreciated in a car this size.  Also, I was not a audiophile until i bought this car.  Excellent CD/XM experience.   I recently compared TL to the BMW5, MBE, Lexus ES and VolvoS80.

Test drove both regular TL & type s. Thought TL handled better & quieter. Was not too crazy about the rims & taillight treatment on type s & 4 tailpipes (look like some cheap aftermarket replacments, disappointed for 38K+ car).

Other annoyances:  when It rains and you open the trunk, water jumps the gasket and pours into the trunk space - debris too. There is excess noise when the moonroof is closed and the ceiling partition open when I'm on the freeway.  I would like my 2005 TSX back.  This is our fourth Acura and probably our last.

I have yet to take it more that 450 consecutive miles on freeways so it may edge down a little but it held at the 30 mpg mark until I got back into Houston rush hour traffic.  I like so much about this car, but there are some small irritable things. Power outlets and MP3 jack are not conveniently located.  It is difficult to get anything in dash outlet when car is in park.  Fuel release is on floor right by door - on door or dash would be better.

Take it from a dealership parking lot to downtown and watch reflections of yourself. When you open the door, it whispers (not screams) luxury!  I love all the features: seat memory settings, hands-free link, navigation, dual climate, sound system.  Driving is very smooth and comfortable and, if you want, very sporty as well. Perfect balance. You can drive your mother in law in a limo and your friends in a sports car all in the same vehicle. Driving in the heavy rain, passing 18-wheelers, up the hill in curvy road, all of it is pure driving passion. MPG is OK, 28/23 so far.",5

Does not interface with new smartphones well for Bluetooth is my only real complaint. It is a fantastic car for the most part.

The TL was perfect in everything besides for the power (preference). So I bought the type-s. If you plan to commute this car gets 33 mpg on freeway at 70mph when I'm not driving it hard. When you want to have fun it will take on most cars on the road (auto). If I planned to constantly race I would have looked for a manual which has much better drag performance (6speed).

I really like the beautiful styling touches such as the character lines that run across the sides of the car. The 2008 TL styling is elegant and understated, unlike the new 2009 TL which I thought is too loud for my taste with the oversized grill in the front and chrome strip on the trunk.  However, the sleek styling does result in poor rearward visibility for the TL. Having driven a Acura Integra for the last 20 years, this is probably the biggest thing I have to adopt in my new TL.

Minor issues: fold down rear seat would be good, the trunk is so well finished there is no point to tie it down.  Rain rolls off the roof onto the driver's seat when  you open the door.  No good CD case holder in the car.  Passenger seat height adjustment would be nice.  As you can see my issues are minor.

I shopped the G35, Lexus IS350 and BMW 3 Series before buying the Acura.   The nice part about the car is the value for the money, this car comes loaded.  With Lexus, BMW and Infiniti the options are expensive and add up quickly.  An IS350 with the same equipment as this car stickered at over $45k, same with BMW.

About three months later, the car literally transformed: the transmission was silky smooth, the handling was snappy and nimble, and there wasn't any real torque steer or understeer to deal with.  It was still an auto, but that went well with the enormous number of luxury features.  I can cruise in comfort and in style, or I can rip through the woods and destroy a Mitsubishi Eclipse at a stoplight. Either way, I'm no longer disappointed.  ",4.875

I only have 1200 miles on the car but am getting 20 MPG around town and 29 on the highway (At 73 MPH).  My Honda got 20/30 so I am getting 86 HP for the cost of premium! The only slight negatives are the wide turning circle and the Brembos seem a bit ""grabby"" when applied. The audio system is almost worth the price alone.  I decide not to wait for the 09 as I did not want a bigger car nor a bigger engine.",5

Standard equipment, styling, performance, fuel efficiency for the power it has, I can go on.  However, not quite sure how long this car will last in the Minneapolis MN weather.  It is a disaster driving in snow, even with traction control it scares me how much it slides and fusses around.  Its quite the handful.

Glad I waited (dealer incentives sealed the deal). Strong pull from the engine in all gears. The TL gets a little aggressive when I Punch it around 40 mph, dropping down one gear too many I think. The last road trip I took saw the tl break the triple digit mph barrier with little trouble, very smooth at 100. Fuel efficency is pretty good for a big v6, it will get close to 30 mpg on the highway. Even though it is the most expensive car I have owned, it is worth money and makes the 45-60 minute commute not that bad.",4.875

My old car is a 1998 Maxima 5M and on my daily driving routine (of about 13 miles freeway and 10 miles side streets), I have been averaging 22 mpg. Possibly because I tend to accelerate hard and partly because I typically cruise at 77-80 mph on the interstate (depending on traffic). On my first tank with the TL-S (including 20 minutes idling at the dealer), I averaged about 24 MPG and so far on the second tank my average is between 25-26. That's pretty impressive considering that the TL is 450 lbs heavier and has a 100 hp over the Maxima, and not to mention just over 300 miles on the engine.  ",5

It feels very secure, but she likes to ""boogie""!! I test drove a lot of cars before leasing the TL-S and I have to say, I made the right choice. Fuel economy isn't bad, isn't great either. So far I am averaging 20mpg, but for a car that has 286HP and F-1 style paddle shifters, its not bad. :) The car has room for 4/5 adults and golf clubs, plus it MOVES down the road with a lot of autority. The exhaust note is seductive, NAV is awesome, paddle shifters are sweet, handling is secure and often feels neutral, very much a ""sleeper"" on the street and easy to blow the doors off a BMW/Lexus/MB and give you a grin ear to ear.

So far I have only 300 miles on my Type-S, but I LOVE IT!! My first, second and third test drives were all very fun. I was able to ""push"" the test cars very hard and every time I left the dealer, I had a huge smile. The Acuralink NAV is amazing, seriously. This car can do it all!

I drive about 500 miles a week and need a car that is safe and responsive.  The TL Type-S has got to be the best value of any car on the road today.  All the reviews compare it with cars that are much more expensive with the same equipment.  For me, the nav traffic and voice-activated everything is key since you can keep focused on the road and not the controls.  The Brembo brakes and tuned suspension gives you a level of confidence that keeps you sharp.  I drove the Moroccan Red as a demo and bought the same car a month later.  Great comments from everyone - the contrasting dark wheels and body accents put it in a class by itself.  One awesome ride!",4.875

The vehicle is an excellent blend of power, handling, and interior refinement. A comparable BMW would be significantly more expensive. The competitor vehicles, such as the G35 and the IS350 are good cars but lack the professional finish seen in Acura vehicles. After a week of ownership, there are no visible flaws.

The growl of the quad exhaust is hot. The car looks a bit demure but hit the gas and watch out! Everyone loves it. As most here, I also got the Carbon Bronze Pearl and think that color suits the darker rims very well. I'm very glad I decided to take a test drive that day.

When compared to its Infiniti G, BMW 3 Series, Lexus IS and Audi A4 counterparts, using such factors as build quality, performance, comfort/convenience and manufacturer's overall attention to detail - all weighed against price - the TL is far and away the best value. It may not be the quickest, most nimble or even the most fun, but it is far above average.  The TL is meant for a more utilitarian consumer: high-end without the flash (although still somewhat of a head-turner). Overall a very easy car to drive and the best front-drive you can buy.

I think acura's 25 year old 2009 vehicle designer needs some design school mentoring. Also the new ZDX not only has the ugly front but it also has an ""asteck"" type rear. 5 of my professional colleagues who now have Acura's will not come back to the new - gen. quirky styles.

Every surface has a pleasant texture, the switches and knobs operate perfectly with weighted balance. The Navi is a must, it transforms the experience in the car.

Unlike some competitors, the cup holders really work; The seats and driving position are magnificent for those of larger proportions; The stereo is phenomenal; Fuel economy is above average; the 'value' equation is substantial. The shortfalls, however, drive us insane. The 45-series tires seem to have temper tantrums with the suspension tuning.  The steering is incredibly vague and twitchy off-center.

The suspension and handling is impressive at the expense of a smooth ride and a very poor turning radius. The 07 automatic transmission is less responsive than what I would expect from a luxury car Trim and paint quality is no better than the paint used on Honda cars while paint on the Infiniti is better.

It does not handle like a race car, but it is not a race car.  For its purpose and market, handling is fun and responsive.  Mechanics and reliability after 22,000 miles is perfect.

No more minivans or SUVs - been doing that for years with kids.  Came down to the BMW 328xi and the Acura, ultimately we decided to go with a fully loaded Acura for less money vs. a very basic BMW with no leather, power/heated seats, etc.  We get lots of looks on the road - no Acura dealer for 100 miles, so it's also unique here.

Since I adore the reliability of the Honda engine and drive train, I decided to give the Acura a closer look. I am not disappointed. The car is quiet, gets great gas mileage (I average 30-32 on the highway), and has power to spare when needed. The inside is comfortable, the ride solid but not too stiff. I love it.

The 2007 is a little better overall.  Its suspension absorbs bumps better than before while still maintaining its sportiness and handling.  It's quieter on the highway and its seats are more comfortable (softer) - especially on longer rides.  From the front, the separate fog lights, chrome-like strip along the bottom and integrated blikers in the side mirrors, give the car a more elegant look. The sporty body style, sporty handling and very comfortable ride made it a good choice for me. Notes: No squeaks or rattles, the new transmission is now derived from the RL's tranny.",5

Rear deck was vibrating from the subwoofer. They took out the back seat and sprayed some foam back there. Problem solved! I researched for seven months prior to purchasing.

Gas mileage is a bit disappointing - I am avg around 20 MPG. But blazing acceleration! 286 HP baby! Car is a real headturner! Quad exhaust really sets it apart with the deep exhaust tone.

You almost want to turn down the stereo just so you can here the pindrop silence. The back up camera is all you need to reverse and the auto flip mirrors are just an added bonus.

I owned a 2004 TL and I just bought a 2007 TL Type-S and I love it. It looks good, aggresive even.  It drives aggresively as well.  When you own a sports sedan you should drive like it.  The F1 shift option is great.  With close to 300 ponies it flies.  The Brembo brakes are a plus.  The car turns on a dime and it's just a blast to drive.  It's a 9.5 out of 10 in my book.  Buy it and you will love it.  It has all the gagets inside: Navi, voice recognition, MP3 hook up, 5.1 Dolby sound, rear view camera, XM radio.

My wife drives this car as I wanted her to have a safe reliable vehicle.  We like the style, but the dependability and the driving security is far above most other cars.  It is definitely a great road car with the AWD, which does impact mileage a bit.   On most road trips, driving 70 mph on the highway, we get a bit over 24.0.    We live in a gate community in Arkansas which is very hilly and winding curves, so we get about 21.5   My wife loves her car and I enjoy driving it as well.  We visit relatives in Texas, Missouri,, Illinois, and Ohio and I never worry about the car performance.   I've owned a Honda product since 1977 and I've never been stranded in all those years.   I use to own Chev and Mercury, had problems with both within 3 years.  My drive around car is a 96 Honda hatchback with close to 200,000 miles and have never had a mechanical problem.

It has been a pleasant experience. It's a good value for the money and provides a very decent experience.  The car picks at a good pace if engine is raved up. The car could have a higher lower end torque, that will add to the driving pleasure. The car has very good audio system with subwoofer, however when you play some music with little high bass, it feels like the rear windshield is going to break. Overall car is a fun to drive but do not expect the thrill and driving experience of Infiniti G37 or BMW 3 or 5 series cars. ",4.375

Went to the dealer for a test- drive, and fell in love with the handling/power mix. The size and amenities are great, and the (polarizing) looks have been growing on me daily.

The SH-AWD is really fun once you figure out how to use it (when to accelerate during a turn, etc.). The car corners like it's on rails. It was too easy to chirp the tire in my '05 if I accelerated from a stop. Not this car. Can't wait to try it in the show.",4.5

Real leather, not synthetic, check the German rivals carefully, you might be surprised that for what they charge it is an option, Technology galore, drives rock solid, build quality is second to none. The hardest part was picking the color, due to Acura's lack of option based pricing the car comes loaded when you add the technology package.

This is like getting a steak at a hamburger price. First of all, the drive is outstanding. I usually crank the stereo when driving, but with my TL, I prefer to listen to the loud purr/soft growl of the TL engine at work. I've driven many a car in my day, but never one that hugs the road quite like this Acura. And the gas mileage is incredible for a car this fast. When parked, I listen to the stereo and the surround sound is mind-blowing. The seats aren't quite up to par with Volvo's, but they are business-class comfy. The moon/sunroof brings natural light into the experience. One of the few downers is the lack of an AUX input (but they put in a cassette tape player?!?!). It would also be nice to have daylight running headlights (why do only Canadian models get this important feature?).",5

Right off the bat make sure you have as much money on hand in order to maintain it because I have had trouble right off the bat the transmission went kaput after twenty one days ,and to get a new transmission was an uphill battle because I had to pay eighteen hundred dollars ,and when I got the car back the next thing went out was the starter ,and battery ,and had to replace it , the next month it was the alternator ,and yet another battery cause the pep boys battery was a horrendous piece of crap ! But I digress! A year went by ,and did the regular maintenance like change the oil ,and brakes ,and thats when the brake boosters ,the rack ,and pinion ,and the rotors went to hell at the same time .......say goodbye to my tax refund all $2800. Still the brakes were not completely what they were ,and then there was the hands on system which one of the idiot mechanics turned on which pissed me off cause I didn't want that on ,and lo- an behold my battery started to drain ,and thus another catastrophe that pep boys did to me but they cant claim responsibility for their actions ,and as well as four alternators ,six batteries , and then a year and a half later boom my transmission went straight to hell again ,and they told me that they were frazzled on what happened ,and knowing my luck it was not 1800 dollars no it became a damn near a 5000 dollar issue . Then there is the radio when one changes the battery your radio goes to hell ,and thus a call to acura another 100 dollars that they want to charge me ,and thus another six times ,and on the sixth time the radio goes to the same place like my hopes and dreams to hell ,and acura was willing to replace the radio but for 1400 dollars i told them to go eat the radio id rather hear the noise in the calm orlando traffic ! and speaking of it my a/c which i love to hate so much because the a/c system went warm of all the times in the dead of summer ,and it was the compressor ,and also the system itself asked acura ,and they happily told me it was for 3600 dollars i told them i'd rather sweat cause i weigh 290 i can use the sweat session in order to lose weight !  All in all my recommendation , if you want luxury buy yourself an infiniti , or you know what avoid any honda, or acuras all together .",1

2122, on 03/04/17 09:43 AM (PST),Trevor ,2006 Acura TL Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.2L 6cyl 5A),TL is a MUST consider if looking for new car," I have been an Acura fan for a long time now. That is because my first car was an Acura Integra. No matter what I did with that car it always ran and all repairs were reasonable. Just recently have come back to Acura from the Audi, BMW Mercedes and Lexus I owned over last 10 years. Not only is Acura less expensive with upfront cost but it is also less expensive when repairs, or maintenance is required. Plus insurance costs are much less the all German or luxery cars in same category as well. Besides being less expensive then any other luxury sedan in all areas. It's still provides you with a luxery sports sedan feel and look, with adequate power, style, handling and performance. If the logo was removed it would be very hard for anyone driving or looking at the TL and tell you it was not a German built vehicle. Every car ever made has its downsides, no matter what you look at. Most German cars repairs, parts & insurance cost is outrages plus BMW, Mercedes, Audi all I have a notorious issues with electronic problems. Which in itself is expensive and almost impossible to do yourself due to tools required and warranty restrictions on who must make repairs.  Now wiTh ACURA it's like buying a luxury car with Honda or Toyota repair costs. If you have a little bit of know how you can repair majority of minor repairs and services for maintenance, saving you a ton of money overall. The gas mileage it's great for the size of the motor. If you drive it normally not take of like in race every light, you will not burn unnecessary gas and will get the gas mileage that Acura indicates the TL has 28City 32 HWY. If you repair the timing belt and water pump at 100,000 miles and keep up on the normal maintenance and service aka oil fluids, breaks, air filter, and milestone services. The TL has the motor with a proven potential last until 400,000 miles with very minimal expensive maintenance needs, outside of what I listed above. As performance goes you can make a few small upgrades to your air intake,  headers, upgraded fuel pump and even the chip upgrade that is only 325.00 replacements/ upgrades for less the $1000.00. This will  illuminate all performance lacking when comparing performance with BMW Audi Mercedes in the same class that are all at least 8k+ MSRP. All the upgrades I listed from audio to performance upgraded can be done very easily and inexpensively without voiding your manufacturer warranty, and will not cause any long-term mechanical issues. This motor has been built to last and will last  forever if the proper maintenance is given. All vehicles need to be maintained but can still be problematic after 150k NOT the ACURA motors. They are built to last, very straightforward with minimal repair required if serviced. you can buy a Acura TL with over 100,000 miles if the timing belt and water pump has been changed and regular maintenance performed and not worry at all about any major mechanical problems. I agree that there are some features lacking and need attention.  These are the Bluetooth/handsfree system is horrible. Only pairs with a small amount of devices, iPhone not being one?? There is also no AUX port, built in USB charger and auto on-off mode for head lights. Everything I just listed is all not a deal breaker for all those issues except auto headlight feature, can be fixed with manufacturer and OEM add ons. Remove indash audio controls/cd/cassette system & replace with an Acura or Aftermarket Touchscreen - voice activated audio system with NAV/DVD/CD/MP3/Aux Port,etc for $300.00-500.00. That eliminates all those issues and gives you everything you would get in a more expensive luxury car both performance and technology add ons. Take the money u save from BMW,Lexus,Mercedes,etc on insurance and cost you pay to buy, take a little of that saved money and make the Acura taylored to your exact needs and I promise you there will never be an disapotment. You will be even happier when u go to sell or trade in later on for the Acura TL keeps is value, because they do run forever with minimal matinace required!!  Just do yourself a favor and at least testdrive one before buying any other luxury sedan, and consider that a small amount of money put into the vehicle will allow you to surpass any features or performance lacking from BMW or any other luxury sedan. Having that one Acura owner that is not like their car or regret their purchase.",5
2123, on 10/03/16 22:10 PM (PDT),Jay Waseem ,2006 Acura TL Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.2L 6cyl 5A),costs money to play," I purchased this 2006 base model TL after I sold my 04' 545i. I wanted something reliable, yet sporty so I purchased this TL. I bought it with 97k miles. It had an extensive service record, 50+ times serviced at a local acura dealer. One day check engine light popped up, and maybe 3 miles after that, my transmission was GONEE. Rebuild cost 4800 at a local mechanic shop. IT ALSO EATS THROUGH TIRES AND BRAKES. I put Michelin Primacy MXM4, and after just 15k miles, my tires are halfway gone. ( Alignment is within specs, as well as other suspension components). It's definitely the best bang for your buck, but I certainly don't see the infamous Acura reliability anywhere close to this model. Rattles and squeaks only when going over speed bumps, weird!! A lot of road noise as well. Accelerates & corners well, but torque steer is there. Make sure to use leather wipes on your seats, or they'll crack up in no time. No height adjustment for the passenger seat either. No aux, but who needs that when you have a cassette player (sarcasm). Don't spend anymore than 5k for this car & don't buy it from a dealer.",2
2124, on 09/09/16 11:00 AM (PDT),Joe ,"2006 Acura TL Sedan 4dr Sedan w/Performance Tires, Nav System (3.2L 6cyl 6M)",Love at first sight but faded after the honeymoon.," This car had everything I wanted but came at a price.  Performance, technology, and looked amazing.  There are many known problems with this particular generation of the TL.  Bluetooth stopped working and the replacement was pretty costly.  Cassette adapter for ipod/iphone music got stuck in tape deck.  Went through 2 batteries within 3 weeks and Dealership couldn't figure out the problem.  Once I was able to pry the cassette adapter out the problem went away.  Another known problem is the nav system.  The unit in the trunk doesn't last and the replacement is about $300 now from Alpine.  Once the trunk unit stops working you lose all the touchscreen capabilities on the display (ie AC control, radio control, settings, etc).  You also lose the voice control for the radio unit.  Voice control for making phone calls still functions as it is not tied to the trunk unit.  Lastly, the dashboard problem.  AcuraZine's website lists many people that have reported a cracked dashboard.  Mine 1st cracked around the airbag border on the passenger side.  At first I thought it was an airbag failure mode but upon research discovered I was seeing what many people were reporting.  Shortly after this initial crack I started getting multiple cracks across my whole dashboard.  Looks horrible.  Exterior paint is still holding up but some of the plastic coating around the window edge is peeling.  With all that being said I still enjoy the car but haven't got to utilize a lot of the technology for about 5 years now.  I'm looking to get rid of it soon and most likely will not buy another Acura.",3

I have a '97 Acura CL with 223,000 miles and the thing just keeps going.I have owned the 2006 TL for over a year and have enjoyed driving it, but the biggest downer is it comes nowhere near the advertised fuel economy.Check the forums online and you'll see other owners saying the same thing. This is the main reason I'm rating this car 3.5 stars and not 4.5 stars.Its way over 250 hp and with that power and weight you aren't going to get great gas mileage.  The quandary here is that similar Accords do get very good mileage, and my TL isn't getting close to what is advertised.I'm getting 16-17 in the city and only 19 combined. If I do take a rare highway trip its around 25mpg, but the downer is the city driving, I feel like it should be at least 20 mpg. Take this into consideration when buying.Acura is one of the only car manufacturers that had a Sirius XM receiver as stock in 2006, this is a huge plus!The stereo is also pretty awesome for stock radio, even includes a subwoofer.If you like keeping your paint perfect, the touch-up paint for the White Pearl model straight from Acura is a complete joke & will drive you nuts fixing little marks & dings. Its not even close to a match due to the two-tone nature of the treatment. You'll be spending hours to get one nick the right color from one or two base coats of white and then a dozen or so of the stupid pearl top coats to get the darkness to match because the base coat is way way too light. What every happened to the simple days or just one coat of paint in a touch-up tube that matched pretty well?The dual climate control works but doesn't work well if the passenger wants it warm and the driver wants it cold, the workaround is you have to turn the temp up really high on the passengers side to get warmer air to come out that side if the driver is pumping the AC. This is true in my car even though both sides have their own digital temperature control. Weird.A final complaint is you can lightly hear the interior creaks and noises when going over speed-bumps doesn't seem quite as solid as you would think from an Acura. You only notice this when driving along in a quiet car with the radio off. Nothing serious, but my 97 CL doesn't have this problem.The real selling point of this car is looks and reliability, if you can do with the weak MPG this might be the car for you. Its fun to drive, will impress the neighbors and is a real rocketship. If you can find a black interior, do it - stays much nicer looking if you have kids.",3

I also worked in Service at an Acura dealership. The most common complaint is the rattling, but a conscientious technician can fix that. (My car doesn't rattle and it doesn't happen in all of them.) Depending upon your personal driving habits, you *may* go through brakes and tires.  If you want a good quality, reliable vehicle, get a TL. My two 80-pound dogs don't damage the interior and neither will your kids. The TL is also mechanically sound. I've worked in Service for other brands so believe me, I'm loyal to Acura for a reason. Compare cost, features, and reliability and it's no wonder that Acura has the highest resale value. ",4.75

The TL smoked all of those in my book (after 6 months of research)! I drive mostly on the highway and average 28 mpg so it also gets great mileage. Everything is great! Except... The only bad thing is that since Acura used so many different materials on the inside, during the cold months they squeak and rattle sometimes.

My center console has gotten so thin that it looks pushed down all the time. Just not what you'd expect from a car that costs around $40k brand new.

Everything you can think of with a few exceptions (I'll get to those next) is included (not an option) like Bluetooth, steering wheel controls, driver & passenger memory seats, awesome navigation with touch screen and there's even a light in the glovebox.

I tried for 2 years to pretend they didn't bother me because the car is beautiful and reliable.  The real problem is the ride to the TL's prior to 2007 suspension upgrade was just too rough and it shakes everything loose. You can't even enjoy the DVD audio because ALL the speakers rattle and no one at my Acura dealership could fix them.  I had a 2007 loaner once and noticed they finally fixed the suspension-that car was quiet.  I finally gave up and traded it in this month (not for another Acura).",4.125

You do have to run premium if you want optimum horsepower and MPG. Go with the manual transmission and dump the stock all season tires and you can't go wrong. Couldn't justify spending two grand on a nav system when I can read maps, so I didn't order that.

Decided on Acura which was the best decision. Plus the reliability has been outstanding. Never in the shop except for one service at 12000 miles (I use synthetic oil).",5

I did quite a bit of research and bang for the buck, this car has it.  I just came back from a few long trips and I can't wait to go out again.  I actually got 34 MPG on the highway and I avg about 26 MPG around town.  The hands free bluetooth works great!  The acceleration, the comfort, the stereo/CD/XM radio are all fantastic.  If you are thinking about a Lexus, or a BMW I urge you to drive a TL or an RL.  These cars are great and the prices are reasonable for all of the options you get.

It has outstanding power for a sedan with a wide and very drivable powerband. It had a beautiful, well finished interior. Especially so in the two tone color combinations. The seats are very comfy and supportive enough to keep  you from sliding too much during agressive driving. On top of all of this it maintains good fuel economy given its power. Only downside has been the 6 speed manual gear box which is occasionally fickle about going into 3rd on quick shifts. Though reportedly this can be dealt with by using a different gear oil. Overall I think its a top runner in a very competitive class.",4.375

Mechanically the car is perfect.  You can tell the Acura is a quality build.  I switched to Acura from two prevous Nissan Maxima's.  Qualitywise the Acura is far better than the Nissan.

I didn't have to deal with option packages, everything I wanted was included standard for one low-price and it was under a brand that was known for reliability.

Finally bought a used '05 in Oct of '08.  Love it!  Sharp looking, powerful, comfortable, reliable, relatively economical.  Mine is silver with gray leather.  Bought it with 25k on it and I've put 28k on it since acquiring it.  I commute 33 miles to work 1 way.  Have seen 33 mpg on the highway a couple of times but average 31 on hwy.

Abundant whiz-bang features in the cabin -- lots of them linked to the particular driver's key fob.  Engine is very powerful -- wonderful sound. Front-wheel drive pulls the car forward nicely on dicey roads.  Soft leather seats.  Xenon headlights which are tightly focused.  XM/Sirius radio. European feel on the road.  Great value.  ",4.875

I think the car is quiet but I would agree about the some rattles. I have tried to find most and put an end to them which I have except for a couple which would entail a lot of work. I had to put new brakes on it (because it was a lease turn-in with 36M miles)and I have put about 15000 on it in 7 months. Have done nothing else with it...I owned a 2004 Accord that I put 140M on.

Big touch-screen navigation is very helpful but software seems dated compared to my wife's Benz navigation. The car picks up pretty quick on the freeway.

Being from the Midwest, and only having one car, RWD wasn't an option since we get something called snow which doesn't agree with RWD cars too well. Thus, I settled on the TL, and don't think I would have been happier w/ any other car. Acceleration is very linear, and the TL is extremely stable at 80 mph, and fairly quite at such speeds, which could be a dangerous combination. Torque steer is almost never an issue. Great sound system, excellent interior amenities, exceptional fuel economy (I've gotten 33 on some highway jaunts, although around town can be disappointing).

Very good looking car in and out (better in my opinion than the new model). Very reliable, only repair was A/C at 25k miles. Love the big touchscreen nav system that you can operate while moving, new models may have better graphics but non-touchscreen is MUCH less convenient.

The biggest misconception is that you have to use premium gas.  I have been using 87 octane since 2006 without any problems whatsoever.  My biggest criteria for a car are reliability, comfort and acceleration, and my TL meets all three.  Reliability?  15 years speaks for itself.  Comfort?  Leather seats and lumbar support are good for many hours.  Acceleration?  I don't need a Porsche, but when you stomp on the accelerator, even without the manual setting, you are pushed way back in your seat.  Last thing:  Acura dramatically changed the design of the TL (to a seriously butt-ugly version, imho) for their 2004's, yet I still see a ton of the 2003's (and earlier) TL's on the road, going strong, driven proudly by their owners.",4

The transmission failed in 2003, and again in 2009. Both were replaced under extended warranty.  The transmission that was installed in 2009 has been working fine since, with a redesign to prevent future problems.  The Acura service department was excellent in remedying the transmission problem, both times.  It has been 7 years and 80k miles on my current transmission.  My car currently has 190k miles.  My TL-S still has strong acceleration and surprisingly compliant yet firm ride quality and capable handling after all these years.  The interior materials are holding up well, and the dashboard still retained its original color.  The leather seats have aged much better than my 2008 Lexus ES.  If not for the transmission issues early on, I would've given this car a perfect rating.  My TL-S has held up much better than my friends' BMW 323 and Mercedes C class, which they purchased around 2002, and both of which fell apart a few years ago.  Asides from the transmission and a couple of broken window motors, I've only done routine maintenance on my car.  Kudos to Acura for building a mostly bulletproof car.",4

The only cons I have is the middle front armrest is not secure and keeps opening up. I use unleaded plus and have never had a problem in either car by doing this. ,4.5

Great power, really good handling, exterior style is head turning, very comfortable ride, decent gas mileage (if you can keep your foot of the fantastic accelerator), and while the interior style is simple all you have to do is put a little leather conditioner on the seats and it stays perfect. My seat heater (driver side) and light for the clock did break as did the radio control on the steering wheel but this is minor stuff. If maintained this thing will run for 250K miles + no question.",4.625

Great performance, and other than a warranty covered transmission problem at 45k, this car has had no work done at all other than routine maintenance.  However there are several design flaws that have bugged me ever since purchasing it: no auto headlights, the wipers are under the hood (can't raise them to wash the windshield), the top console compartment spills change out the back end when lifted up, the navi maps lack a ton of US city streets, especially in smaller <250,000 pop cities, and more.",4.5

Have gotten as much as 33 mpg on the long hwy drives; average about 23-24, which is terrific.  Sound system is great and finish is lovely. The CD player can make you a little crazy until it unloads and loads; that's the only flaw.

The TL-S isn't great by any of those standards, and that's it's best feature.  It can accelerate well enough to get on any highway, handle well enough to stay out of trouble, offer enough comfort and quiet so that you don't mind spending a day in the car, all at a price that's still within shouting distance of being reasonable, with acceptable gas mileage.

Battery replaced, factory replacement died after 7,000 miles. Headroom could be better as could fuel economy. Seat adjustability needs better range. Bought Type-S instead of Premium because seats fit me better as a taller person (regular seats too cushy and cut head room for me).

I honestly didn't consider Acura a luxury brand until I drove one! I narrowed it down to Lexus ES and Acura as both offered the best deal for the money. I am tall so BMW, mercedes and audi were cramped. After test driving the Acura TL several times I was hooked. The acceleration, interior styling and cabin room were second to none. The sound system is tremendous, and the Technology package works with ease. My dealership experience at Mungenast was the best dealership experience I have ever had when buying a car. Had the car for 3 months and no problems to report so far. ",5

I have fallen in love with this car and worked a great deal on it. My TL has done two coast-to-coast cross country trips with stellar performance. The car is kinda rare in the US so parts can get expensive if you break the wrong thing. But overall this car is great. A word of caution to fellow tuners out there: the design of this car is kinda nonsensical. Things like wiring a subwoofer are extremely difficult. But as a basic car, the 5cyl is really reliable and the interior is spacious and comfy. A pure-blooded GT car if you ask me.",3.875

I drove it hard too. But as soon as I hit that 130K mark EVERYTHING started to go. My car quickly went from being valued above 5K to now I'm hoping to get 1K for trade in. The breaks, the radiator, the intake system (?), and the timing belt all went within 1 year of each other. VERY EXPENSIVE TO FIX!! The three different mechanics all told me the same thing - it can cost 2 times the amount to fix these high performance cars as even just a basic Honda. I wouldnt advise anyone to buy one of these cars with high miles, especially if maintenance costs are a big concern. But always drove beautifully!",4

Other than 2 starters (a persistent problem with these cars (requiring the axle to be removed - $-) along with the terrible window operations), and the recommended timing belt change with water pump, I have performed all maintenance which consists only of fluids, filters and brakes (do my own work). This car now has 260k on it, drives as if it were new, with no smoke or leaks from the engine. It does need a power-steering pump but the kids drive it now and they need the exercise.

I do realize that it's an older car now, but the repairs are really starting to be too much.  Otherwise, the car runs great when it's running and sounds great.

Having problem with speed sensor now but the car is still solid otherwise. Other than maintenance and replacing the struts, this car has been low cost over the years.

Wonderful, well rounded vehicle that's attractive and engineered like a dream. My TL has 162000 miles and has seen less than $2000 in non maintenance repairs to date! That's pretty remarkable in my opinion. The service has been solid, but I must admit that I perform most maintenance personally (mobil 1 only).

I also replaced the battery a couple years ago, and new brake pads.  I'm due for replacing the AT fluid and filter.  All in all, this car has been excellent.

It has 88,000 miles and all I've done is change the oil, belts, and tires. (The lone exception was new front brakes & rotors at 87,000 miles) It rides like a cadillac but without the reliability issues. The interior is 1st class as well as the comfort of the seats. It's not a fast sports sedan, but the 3.2 V-6 200 HP engine has plenty of speed for us. Exterior is black and the paint has yet to fade. (There are the normal nicks from opening doors and such.)   Like the sleek exterior with the long front hood. I feel comfortable enough to sell this car to my daughter next month. Will purchase another Acura.",4.625

Despite this problem which I didnt discover untill later the car has been great. It is fun to drive with more than average power. My problems have been consistant with the other reviews. The seal on the driver side window is bad which makes for alot of road noise. The placement of the controls  in the interior are the worst of any car. Although stylish all of the luxury features are invisable because of the placement. The last thing would be that repairs are VERY expensive. I spend alot of money at the dealership, who are the only people who know how to work on that car, even oil changes. Trust me. ",4

It's beautiful and rides like a dream, although it does have some road noise, but the stereo is awesome.  I'm confident it will be an excellent car for us.  We looked at the 1999-2003 TL's and the transmission problems scared us off. We have a 2002 RL, and although the TL is not as luxurious as that, it is just as fun to drive and it has all the same toys, just a little smaller, and I LOVE this car!

Right now I'm having a problem with my transmission, but that'll be fixed soon.  Runs really quiet and smooth when kept clean and maintained all the time.  I do hate the position of the cruise control, fog lights, and seat heater buttons but every car has it's minor annoyances.  The road noise is a bit louder than what I prefer, but the smooth ride makes up for it.

On stock engine, STOCK TRANSMISSION, and up till a few thousand miles ago stock radiator. This car is my first car that my parents gave me and even though she takes a beating, I can't trade her in. Why? Because it can take turns at 40+ like Miata, accelerates with the current muscle cars (seriously), and rolls past Lexus owners and laugh. The stock sound system is BOSE and straight bumps, as a teenager this is huge! I love my Ac-Rite. People don't understand; treat any car with regular oil changes, fluid flushes (INCLUDING TRANNY FLUID), and constant monitoring...anything will take you far. But we bought this with about 30k on the dash, and at first we didn't care for it. But once I got it, I drove it constantly in manual (speed stick, speed slot), keep it below 6k revs, and gave SYNTHETIC oil changes every 4,000 or so and it'll run. Why? Because ACURA's are Honda's and they are built fantastically.",5

Save yourself some trouble and never buy an Acura or a Honda this is dangerous and outrageous especially the fact that the company will only replace your transmission with one that has previously failed after usually giving you the run-a-round this is the worst purchase I have ever made and I advise any buyer to do research on this car before you buy it.

Mine is Blue Pearl and people still compliment me on the car when they see it. And everyone who sits in it loves the all-black design.  I'd like if the paint were a little tougher, but it still shines in most light. The original tires were crap (Michelin), but the handling and drive GREATLY improved with Falkens and Yokohamas. The gas mileage has been great. I got 32mpg highway at 75-80mph numerous times. Usually I get 25mpg mixed.",4.25

The VTEC engine is punchy and quick, and the exhaust note is fantastic. Meanwhile, the leather bucket seats are remarkably comfortable with its heating capabilities, lumbar support, and cushy leather. The interior is premium for the price with much of the surfaces being leather wrapped or brushed aluminum. The back seat is tiny, but only to make room for a massive trunk that holds a bookshelf, a sleep in bag, and emergency kit, a thick coat, a marching band uniform, and groceries. This car is very practical despite its looks and performance.  The car handles adequately, but it suffers from massive understeer and ""boatiness"": the TL would benefit from AWD, which would help with the understeer. Other than that, the TL is a fantastic performer with its shockingly quick launch and acceleration, comfortable suspension, and 160 MPH top speed. The best part of the car, though, is the styling.

I feel the car is priced well when comparing to European cars with similar features. When I have family and friends in the car with me they always compliment the ride and what a nice car it is. I agree!! Only 2 complaints about this car: 1) Poor turning radius. I previously owned a Honda Accord which could easily do a ""U"" turn or whip right into a parking spot, not so with the Acura TL. 2) Several blind spots due to side curtain airbags and head rests.

There is an issue with ""torque steer"" when starting from a stop making a turn (a right turn at a light, for instance).  If you get too heavy on the accelerator you will lose traction.

The car has hd and xm stereo with the best sound system in a car.  Mileage could be better, but it is a very quick agile car, and hence some sacrifice on mileage.  This is a high performance Accord, make no mistake.  But, unlike the Accord, it's not boring, it's fun all the time, and could out-run most cars if you get the jump on them.

The acceleration is that of some of the true sports cars I have driven, it will put you back in the seat. The brakes bring you to a stop in a comfortable distance.

My previous car was a Honda S2000 and when I was exiting my ownership of that vehicle I was worried I would soon be stranded into a mundane driving experience. This was not the case. For a near 4000lbs car that barely breach's 300hp at the crank it moves quite nicely. I live in a rather snowy climate (number two snowiest city in the US) and while I got around with snow tires in the S2000 just fine, the SH-AWD TL was awesome even on all seasons, not to mention a blast of mash, steer and go. The car is well laid out as far as controls and technology and is very user friendly once accommodated with all the functions. It is incredibly spacious for my height and for a mid-size vehicle. Most of all, the build quality and material choice makes me appreciate the interior when compared to other vehicles in its used price range. The technology package delivers a pretty nice stock sound system with a very conservative navigation display. Beware that with this sound system the door speakers are prone to blowing out. However they are $25 to replace and this vehicles door panels are by far the most user friendly to take on and off. Seriously if you've taken door panels off before they are usually a nightmare of clips breaking, but that is not the case here. Overall I am very pleased with the value of this car for roughly $19,000 used with 50,000 miles when bought over a year ago. The Mayan Bronze Metallic color is quite beautiful as well.",5

BMW's and Audi's and such still have folks fooled(along with media such as MT). I love the design for its daring non-cookie cutter non-euro ultra technical look.

The Nav system is no longer touch, you have to use the dial which I found to be very cumbersome or voice which for some reason did not seem to understand me most of the time. The interior also kind of plain compared to previous years. I miss the blue lights. I also felt this new design did not seem to have the same quick pickup that I fell in love with in my 1st TL.

While not a true sports sedan, the car handles well for its size and intended use and the motor is a jewel - smooth and powerful.

There's a knock on the the multitude of buttons, bit I rarely go to the console because everything is voice activated, and besides, that's so much more fun.  The novelty of saying ""set driver temperature 70 degrees"" still isn't wearing off. Being a Honda, I'm sure reliability will be bullet proof.

I was leasing a 2006 Infiniti G35x and was contemplating a new one. After driving the new TL I was no longer interested in the G. The TL has a new exterior design that turns heads. The interior of the TL blows the Infiniti away. Everything feels solid and of very high quality. I have also been getting better gas mileage than I got in my old G35x. There is no other car in this price range that gives you the quality and the amenities found in the TL.,4.625

But, the coolest thing about the car is its smarts.  My wife keeps her key in her bag. She attempted to put her bag with the key in the trunk and the car beeped and popped back open the truck.

Looked at BMW 3 and Volkswagen CC. BMW was too expensive and everything was extra and VW was a little too small. The TL had everything I wanted standard (heated seats, sunroof and bluetooth). Dealer added the decklid spoiler for free. Engine is powerful and seats are comfortable. A little more road noise comes in than I would have liked. Dash layout is nice, looks modern and sporty. Steering is nice and tight. Fuel economy is great (22+) considering I averaged 14 mpg with the M35. I like the ipod connectivity. Good sounding stereo. I like this car a lot. ",4.625

It's as if they attempted to include everything on the exterior and the result is just big question mark.  What was the statement?  The interior is just as confusing with all its swoops and swirls... definite disconnection. The ride was comfortable, stereo sounded great, seats comfortable.

Also, unfortunately...armrests are decorative and not functional...just leather covering over a hard surface. Comfort is important to me...resting my elbows on hard surfaces while driving does not work well. Too bad...most manufacturers do not think of this, even Lexus.

It may not be completely as crisp to drive as a BMW or Audi, but in many ways it feels better and is very solid. It is a pleasure to drive and to own!

The steering is precise and communicative. The road noise has been improved considerably. The stereo is the known ELS which is very good. The bad news: The technology is archaic, behind the times, totally disappointing, head scratching, how ACURA allows their automobiles to be designed and sold this way. The Honda Civic and the Hyundai Elantra (!!) are years ahead in terms of technology than the TLX. The menu selections are awful, a lot of duplication. The response time is amazingly slow, to the point that one does not know whether it works. The software did get ""hung up"" once, during the first week but it recovered.

It holds the road like no other car I have owned. I was between getting another Passat, Infiniti Q50, or this car. What won out was the interior quality and looks of the TLX. The Q50 trunk was way too small and interior very tight for my 6'2"" frame. I would have got another VW , but thought I needed to look at something different. The things that I find frustrating on this car are the complicated radio, the Sirius only presets 12 channels, and you can't see what song is on Sirius until you turn the channel. Overall , the TLX provided a nice balance of quality materials, space, and amenities. Not perfect, but enjoyable car.",4

The car is extremely comfortable and has a nice smooth ride..I enjoy the IDS system which allows you to drive in sport mode etc. No Back seat USBS which I found surprising and the Technology features offered were expensive additional packages where other 2017 car manufacturers included these in the price of their cars..I went with the 4 cylinder which has a lot of pep and I enjoy the stick shift for a sportier interior look over the 6 cylinder with the push buttons.

2937, on 03/25/17 18:23 PM (PDT),BIndi ,2017 Acura TLX Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Regret Purchase, I own a 2010 Acura TL and it was time for an upgrade and I chose a 2017 Acura TLX.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am in this car and the regret I feel for spending this much money on a car with so many flaws I can't begin to explain them all.  The dashboard technology is so ridiculously behind and out of sync with other brands but of course I didn't realize how bad until after I owned the car and had a chance to deal with it on a daily basis.  Just an example is turning on heated seats requires pressing a button on the touch screen then selecting again a level of choice.  If you want to change it again that same two steps is required each and every time. I get so frustrated with how ridiculous this is when you think about safety and distracted driving.  If you use voice control it's the same two step process if it recognizes what you are saying.  The car is completely gutless and unresponsive and I don't drive it the same as my 2010 TL because I can't.  I'm discouraged I spent so much money on this car when the manufacturer hasn't corrected the past problems with their brand and went cheap by not updating and keeping current with technology offered by other auto makers in the same class.  Some things in this car just don't make sense and you won't know it until you drive it for awhile.,3

I have a 2013 Honda CR-V and love Hondas and decided it was time to upgrade the wife's car from a Mustang to this. Great decision the 4 cylinder has tremendous power even though I thought long and hard about going w the 6, the technology package is definitely worth the extra bucks for all the safety features and technology that comes w it.

I find this vehicle to be quiet, solid and sporty to drive. If you want ostrich covered upholstery and a vehicle that drives itself, this probably is not for you.

I drove it for several weeks including an out of town trip/vacation.  When she told me how much she paid for it, I thought she was confused and made her show me the purchase contract.  She paid a little over 30 for the base model.  You cannot get a car like this for the money.  People that complain about the acceleration need to learn how to drive.  The 4 cylinder has more horse power than a Toyota Camry.  When you are passing or merging you floor it to make it down shift to use all 204hp.  My normal car is an infiniti G37 (330hp).  I floor the infiniti about once a week and floored the acura two or three times a day.  I paid about 45 for my infiniti with all the bells and whistles.  My car has some features that the acura doesn't have but it has some that mine doesn't.  The acura has no gas cap and shows the tire pressure for each individual tire just to name a few.

The car still vibrates around 75 MPH, but less intensively.  Just  improve a little bit. I have driven four TLX V6 AWD from dealer, every of them vibrates.  My neighbor has a  TLX AWD V6 with tech package too, his car vibrates around 75 MPH too.  This time Acura made very bad car.   Acura client relation is terrible.

2944, on 12/22/16 05:36 AM (PST),Yardi ,2017 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),2017 TLX is an embarrassment for a luxury car," I am the owner of a 2006 Acura TL, and I must say that it is the best car I have ever owner for $27k, but it is getting old.  So I went to Acura to look at the new 2017 TLX, which is the TL replacement.  What an embarrassment to quality for a $40k car.  Interior is cheap plastic instead the softer leather/vinyl found in my TL.  Headroom in the back seat will only accommodate a person 5'8"" tall or shorter.  I am 6' tall and I had to tilt my head and sink down in the seat to fit.  Seats are leather trim instead of all leather which usually means that 80% of the seat is vinyl with a little bit of leather to fool people.  Front dash with speedometer and odometer looks very cheap.  Bottom line, this car looks comparable to a Honda Civic, which is what the ILX is suppose to do.  Now for the safety part.  THIS CAR DOESN'T COME STANDARD WITH A SPARE TIRE IN THE TRUNK.  Acura gives you a can of sealant  which more than likely WILL NOT fix your flat tire so that you can get off the highway and drive to a safe area.  So get AAA.  But what the sealant will do is wreck your TPMS sensor inside the tire which will cost a couple hundred dollars to replace.  Electronic assisted steering means that at any time you are driving your car, the steering will fail and take you into the woods or down an embankment.  Scary, isn't it.  If you are driving down the highway and you are in danger of hitting a car or deer that is in front of you, your natural instinct is to brake and veer onto the shoulder of the road to avoid a collision.  Acura's new Lane Keeping Assist system will sense that you are going off the paved road and pull you back onto the highway so that you smash into whatever you were trying to avoid.  The bottom line is that Acura has no replacement for the TL.  Now I know what you are going to say, ""What about the RLX?""  Well, the RLX is an old person sedan that my dad would drive and costs twice the amount that I paid for my TL for roughly the same quality of car.  Personally I think that Acura needs a new CEO who can bring back luxury and quality to the low-end Acura line without costing the consumer over $60k.",2

Been in shop over a month, so now qualifies under the “Lemon Law”.  I’m a long-term loyal Honda/Acura owner, so this is a big concern for me. It appears the quality of Acura has gone down over the years, in my opinion. I also do not like the idol stop feature. I turn it off every time I start the engine. That feature is worthless in my opinion.",3
2951, on 06/16/18 15:12 PM (PDT),NewAcuraFan ,2018 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),"One of the Better Cars I've Had, But Problems Rema"," I needed to replace my 2012 Camry, and the new Camrys are frankly awful inside and out, so I looked around and it came down to the TLX or Accord Touring. The Touring lost out primarily due to its use of a turbocharged engine. I really don't want to mess with all the issues around turbochargers. Despite claims above, the TLX's inline ( and naturally aspirated) four is plenty powerful enough for city driving and freeway commuting. The car is a pleasure to drive!!! The mileage is surprising good on the freeway, a little less so in the city. On a 90+ mile drive to the Golden Triangle, I've gotten as high as 41 MPG when the A/C was not running much. Typical ""open freeway"" (i.e., weekends) commutes around town are closer to 38 MPG. The negatives for the TLX are the NAV system and the departure warning systems. The NAV system does not reroute you for traffic congestion like Google Maps does for free. The first time I tried using it, the NAV tried to take me through a closed freeway intersection, the second time it tried to take me through a wreck which closed down three lanes of the Gulf. The NAV display is also a little hard to read from the driver's position. I can see green traffic flow but the red and orange (if that is indeed orange) is difficult. The voice recognition system is worse - it cannot understand simple English street names and has no clue on the many Spanish street names we have around here. The lane/road departure is confused by construction zones or any other place the lane markings are poor, partially erased, or change suddenly (unfortunately, the above is about half of Houston these days). I wound up disabling the road departure since I wound up fighting it 2-3 times a week. Do consider the TLX, but if you do also look at the Accord Touring. And Acura/Honda, please fix your NAV system!",4
2952, on 05/27/18 16:16 PM (PDT),Ralph Lawrence ,2018 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),I love this TLX!," It's been said before:  The TLX has been greatly under-rated by a lot of the reviewers.  I suspect a certain bias by them in the direction of ""snob appeal"" as though that was a ultimate criteria for car ownership, as opposed to high quality, dependability, and general satisfaction.  I would put the Acura TLX alongside any of the cars in its type and class.  This is my second Acura, after owning several Honda Accords earlier.  The earlier Acura was a 3.5RL (2004), and I would say the TLX (and the TL before that) is a better choice for a whole lot of reasons.  For one, the RL (now RLX) is a fine car but the new vehicle price of some $20,000 to $25,000 above a TLX does not deliver that much more value in proportion.  The TLX has all the features, technology, choice of engines, etc. that anyone really needs.  Feature for feature the TLX is a far greater value, overall. As a ""sport sedan"", it combines the best in top-of-the-line value, with ease of driving, snappy pickup on the freeway, and much more.",5

Yes, the handling is not quite as sharp as a BMW or Audi S series car, but it's better than a typical Toyota/Lexus/Honda family sedan, and the ride is comfortable without feeling to ""floaty"".  I would have liked to have seen a 3.0L Turbo engine by now, but, the naturally aspirated 3.5L V6 certainly has adequate power (0 - 60 in 5.7 seconds) and, I was happy to save a little money with the discounted price which is probably due to the car having slightly less horsepower than some competition (which costs $5K - $15K more).  The cabin road noise on the TLX is excellently quiet, superior to most other ""luxury"" cars until you approach the $100,000 or more price point and get dual pane windows like in a premium Mercedes AMG E series.  This is a car that makes me want to drive more, even if it's just to the grocery store to pickup some onions that we need for dinner.  It's also a far better looking car than much of the competition - the 2018 A4 looks like an upside down bathtub with a hamburger grill stuck on the front and the 2018 Accord and Toyota Camry both look like they're trying too hard to be ""different"" but not in a good way.

Every day, I look forward to driving it.   The SHAWD feature is impressive.   If you test drive both the SHAWD and the standard front wheel drive version, you will recognize the obvious difference.  I am yet to find the limit of this car's handling.  The appearance is striking, and it gets a lot of looks from other drivers on the road.   The interior is top notch.   The ride is smooth and quiet.  My only complaint is that every time I start the car, I have to manually disable the annoying gas saving feature that shuts the engine off at red lights.  I am getting 26 mpg average.   Hats off to Acura.  I am glad I waited for the mid year refresh before I made my decision to purchase.",5

I wanted to go back to acura even though the accord was a newer car the fit and finish of the acura was way better. the honda felt lighter and not really solid. I loved all the standard features of the A-Spec, V6 power its not a 4 cylinder turbo which is the new thing now. the solid feeling driving the car over bumps, sound of the engine exhaust , great red leather seats that feels like it will last more then 10yrs of use. excellent sound system, ambient lighting, beautiful LED lights with the yellow amber eyebrow lights, Navi system very easy to use.  SH-awd around the curves or exit ramps very planted.  The Cons gas mileage not very good, hate the automatic engine shut off have to this engage every time I start the car. or every time you open door while backing up for instance so i can see the curb while parking it automatically puts it in park, the ventilated seats are not super cold like the Lexus seats, There are so many things I need to  read about this car. So the bottom line is I still love this car and happy to be with Acura again. So shop around and try to get a good price the AWD option is a must have even if you don't get an A-Spec model it changes the driving dynamics of the car for the good.",5
2976, on 08/05/17 12:22 PM (PDT),Dimitrios Rigas ,2018 Acura TLX Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),The worst Acura," This is my fifth Acura. By far the worst ever. Not only as an Acura but as a car, in general. In more detail: handling is very good, road noise minimal. That is all the positives the negatives: the technology is archaic and extremely slow. It is head scratching how Acura or Honda allows this car to be sold. The software has locked three times in two months! It changes settings by itself and you never know whether it works because it is extremely slow in responding. AWFUL! This is supposed to be a ""luxury"" automobile. The transmission bugs have not all been fixed. The jerking takes place occasionally, nothing dangerous. And the worst part: it is always trembling! Yes, trembling! At any speed!! You cannot enjoy the driving experience, period. I do not now whether it is the transmission or the ""four wheel steering"". My 2007 and 2013 TL's were far superior as was the 2010, six cylinder TLX. Even the ELS radio is not as good as was in the 2013 Tl. My daughter just bought a top of the line MAZDA 3. Almost half the price and by far a better car. I truly do not comprehend how Acura allows this disaster to be sold. Totally regret getting this car.",3

Second area of concern is front seat. It is not adjustable for height. I use a cushion to gain enough height to see curvature of hood. ( I am 5' 10"" ).  I have been a driver since 1948 and have owned a number of cars.  Note: when the transmission is very cold, you can expect some rough shifts until it warms up.   Another point, I bought the car in North Carolina and drive it home to New York, The instrumentation indicated 34.7 MPG on Interstate driving mostly I95.. Speed limit in NC is 75mph! LOL",4
2981, on 05/14/18 12:19 PM (PDT),Zam ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Good Vibrations!," Variable Cylinder Management needs improved engineering to stop annoying vibration when cylinders are cutoff to improve gas management.  Vibration is similar to rumble strips (slight) or eroded asphalt.  Hopefully Acura corrected this annoying vibration in the 2016 and later models.  Shifting is a little edgy, but assume early recall corrected shift issue between 2nd and 3rd gear. Have not noticed the problem reported by other reviewers and did notice recall for this issue had been performed by previous owner.  Great car otherwise, very quiet, with typical Honda non-intuitive electronics that takes awhile to become proficient with.  Purchased from Audi dealer as the local dealer (Napleton) leaves a lot to be desired.  Certainly not the high-quality, trustworthy dealership provided by the previous owner.",5
2982, on 05/06/18 12:51 PM (PDT),Mitch J. ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Advance Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),"Seemed great at first, but...."," I owned an '07 TL and absolutely loved it.  So I went in fairly sight unseen to get what I hoped would be a step up from the older model.  I was disappointed to learn they had eliminated the standard V6.  Not wanting a 4 cylinder, I ended up selecting an in-stock 2015 V6 SH-AWD Advance.  After owning it for three years and 36k miles, I'm trading it in, and here's why:   1. Vibrations!!!!  Little did I know the V6's Variable Cylinder Management system runs on 3 cylinders probably 90% of the time.  Any time you are in a light cruise (basically settling into speed on almost any road type, when tach settles around 1500 rpm), the car produces a vibration similar to going over light rumble strips.  Much of the time you live with a low rumble you feel through the steering wheel and pedals. Honda designed complicated active engine mounts to cancel these vibrations, and Honda even issued a YouTube video describing this phenomenon as ""normal operation.""  There are aftermarket gadgets that can circumvent this system and keep it V6, but they will void your warranty.  Honda needs to make VCM user-switchable.  2.  More Vibrations!!!   Fairly strong resonance right at 72-76 mph, right at interstate cruising speed; feels like unbalanced wheels.  My dealer spent two days balancing, rotating, and force-balancing the wheels, to no avail.  So basically there's constant vibration while on the interstate, which is unacceptable in a $43k luxury car. I'm not dropping a grand on new tires to hope it goes away.  3. Awful transmission, awful push buttons.  Extremely sluggish shifting from P to R or D.   Shifting among the first 3 gears is abrupt and needs re-programming.  In Sport + mode, paddles take a good two-count from action to actual shift.  Forums are full of unfavorable commentary on the transmission. Those things were the deal-killers.  Some minor irritations:   4. If you're within several hundred feet of a car in front of you, the car will not downshift and accelerate to allow you to merge into a faster lane. Your foot feels like it’s going into a marshmallow and the car isn’t reacting.  A safety nanny that actually puts you in jeopardy or forces you to follow that slow truck.  5. If you're coming out of a turn, the car will not downshift and accelerate until you're out of the curve and going straight.  Nice and minivan safe, but hardly sporty-sedan worthy.  6. Auto-Braking system will often flash and even apply the brakes if you approach a right hand curve with an oncoming car on a two lane road.  Extremely unsafe.  This system needs refinement and reprogramming.  Perhaps it's been improved since the 2015 model.   7.  The stereo has weak bass response.  You can get almost decent bass by turning up the bass and sub gains all the way, but that shouldn’t be necessary.  The overall quality and imaging is very good; Bluetooth sources and XM are easy to use. 8.  The HDD CD storage system puts gaps between every song, and you can't reorder titles after they're loaded. Pink Floyd and many others don't work with gaps between the songs. 9.  Flat screen often requires two button hits for functions.  Dangerous to take eyes off the road for that. Climate control functions should have tactile buttons. 10. The Nav loses minor roads as you zoom out.  Other cars have systems that keep the detail on zoom-out.11. The headlights sure look cool but have a very sharp cut-off not backfilled with the high-beams on rural roads.  This leaves a light-dark contrast line that leaves you wanting more light up high.  The fog lights look cool from the outside but offer no additional illumination to the driver.12. The Engine Auto-Off is irritating, and shuts the engine off immediately after coming to a stop. Annoying at stop signs and in traffic.  However, it is switchable with a button.  Wish VCM had such a button. There are things I really like:  The SH-AWD system inspires confidence in all weather and pulls like a tractor in snow.  Seats are very comfortable, fit and finish is very good, cabin is very quiet, vibrations notwithstanding. Phone sync and use is simple. Storage is decent and trunk is roomy although it could use tie-down rings.  Handling is outstanding and nicely weighted. Heated and ventilated seats are great. And when you do want it to really go, after it selects a gear, decides how many cylinders to use, if no one is near you, and you’re not already rolling on a curve, the car goes like a rocket.",3

2984, on 04/04/18 10:53 AM (PDT),Jon ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Very solid except nav and entertainment," This is my second Acura. First was the sporty 2007 TL. The TLX has a less of a sporty feel, but instead that very solid feel of a very well-made car. Overall I have liked it. Good acceleration when in sport mode. AWD has been sufficient for Boston-area driving all winter. Ride and steering are firm and comfortable but not sporty. Gas mileage averaging 27 mpg. I bought this because I like a really good car that looks ""understated high-end."" I'm not into the ostentatious, showy wealth thing. Has served me well.  The only place where this car really disappoints is in the nav/entertainment system. The maps for the nav system are poorly designed and very hard to read. I abandoned using this almost immediately and use an app on my phone instead. Similarly, the entertainment interface is really bad. The displays are large and good, but they display almost no information. And the controls are very poorly designed. It's hard to figure out how to scroll through radio stations without getting the manual out. Plus the CD reader that was supposed to load and hold all my music on the car's hard drive, couldn't read the titles of 90% of the CDs I loaded, so it's impossible to search for a title or even album in most cases. Again, I rely on Bluetooth from my phone, which works fine. The only other thing that is a little annoying is that the front-facing BRAKE alert seems to see mostly ghost vehicles and at random times. Glad it's not set to automatically stop the car!",4

2990, on 12/29/17 23:56 PM (PST),Damian ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),I must be lucky," None of the problems I have thus far read about in the other reviews have crossed my path. Zero! Even the mention of acceleration not being up to par is far from my experience. One of the outstanding aspects of the 9 speed is the two dog teeth  gears, one in the low range for fast departures from a red light, and another for amazing  passing acceleration from 65 on up!  On a lonely interstate  I can easily pass a car doing 80 with a simple touch of the accelerator to a speed of 100. And it is anvil tough and quiet. I have driven the car for three years now with no complaints.  The nav system is fun to use when I drive to places I have never been before just to explore new vistas and then hit the Home button. There is never an issue with becoming lost.  The best technical aspect comes into play when backing out of a parking spot between two trucks that are parallel parked next to me. I can't really see beyond them whether a car is coming or a person  is starting to walk towards the back of the car but the radar warns me in both situations! It sees around both trucks and warns me to stop.    That is outstanding!  What is simply less effective however, is the lane keeping tech. This is due to the fact that the highway does not maintain its lanes in top condition, so that when the paint ages, the car sometimes does not spot the lane correctly . Also, the self driving mechanism works at most for about  30 seconds at a time at which point it demands that you take control of the wheel for at least a second before it re-engages. However, it was never touted as an autonomous driving machine, like a Tesla, but it is fun to watch it drive around curves on its own.  I like the soft material it uses in the interior but the push button mechanisms did at first take getting used to since I previously drove a 2000 TL with the combination manual/auto transmission. (That car also had no squeeks or rattles for the 15 years I drove it!).  I also like that you can read the air pressure of your tires on your dash board along with  the car's recommendation when to get oil. And as far as creep goes in city traffic, I have never experienced the jerkiness from 2nd gear to 3rd or any other jerkiness ever.  It is smooth from first all the way to 9th gear. I am very happy I bought this car and glad the dealership reduced the price $300 simply because I said that would be the only way I could get under my credit limit, which was true. Putting it on my credit card allowed me to get 2% back which I thought was a good deal.  As to gas consumption, I got 36 mpg on straight highway driving using sport mode. I like sport mode since it lets me react more quickly in case of emergencies. However keeping it in that mode in city driving I noticed I get less than the 24 (?) it's supposed to get, but not by much.  And I went with the PAWS because I believe the stop/start driving in the SH-AWD is not good for the engine or the transmission despite the gas saving. Besides, having 4 wheel steer around curves means you can take curves faster without needing to accellerate to keep the car in line. It automatically stays in the correct attitude around curves due to the rear wheels turning. It is simply a fun car to drive, anywhere! In re-reading  this I noticed I have left off minor perks like the huge size of the trunk, the ability to lock my car by calling Acura, the rear view mirror's automatically changing to a darker glass if the car behind you is using his brights (admittedly an advantage that has been around a while), heated seats (I did not opt for the cooling seats), leather and one cool car color called Phantom Blue Pearl, where the pearl has to do with tiny specs of gold that show up under sunlight or lamposts at night but you have to look carefully for it.  WHat can I say, I am a happy camper!",5
2991, on 10/30/17 18:35 PM (PDT),MikeH ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan Advance Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Yet Another Review on Acura's Bad Transmission," Like the other reviews, the biggest problem with Acura is the 9 speed ZF transmission.  About half the time it grinds and shutters between gears, it refuses to upshift, and the car is slow to switch into transmission modes (park, reverse, etc.).  I have taken it back to the dealership 8 times and they say they replaced the transmission.  I spoke to the Acura area rep (who was a poor representative for Acura, he was rude and told me the car is supposed to shift that way because of the government fuel economy requirements - what?!).  Our family has owned 3 Acura's so far and loved them all.  Sadly, this is our last Acura.  While I appreciate the car's fuel economy, safety features, and smooth/quiet ride - the horrible Acura response to a faulty product (especially for a $45k car), cumbersome infotainment system, and unacceptable transmission is shameful for a once reputable brand.",2

Lang ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Not As Great As I Had Hoped...," I've driven my 2015 TLX for a little over 2 years and I'm really sad that the ""redesign"" for 2017 didn't fix any of my complaints. First off - the shifting ""buttons"" in between the seats. So unnecessary and awkward. My dog has turned on my brake assist button way more often than me! Second complaint - weird acceleration. The car has get up and go but it shifts weird and sluggishly in the lower gears, better once it gets going but it' clunky that a car like this should be. Moving on - the ""Brake"" sensor that is supposed to alert you to brake because you're about to run into something has never actually gone off properly. It goes off when I'm taking a curve and there are parked cars on the road, or it goes off when I'm passing semi's but not once has it gone for a real reason. Good golly Acura, could you please just give me a damn twisty knob for the temperature control and fan. 15 screen buttons later I might finally be able to change the fan from floor to defrost! I can't believe I haven't hit someone yet while trying to work through the ""Infotainment"" system! You can't really dial in the windshield wipers. You might think you've got them on intermittent low, but low and behold this smart car ""senses"" more rain and kicks it into high gear which you can't slow down. The good - sitting in the driver's seat is very comfortable, rear seat, not so much! The car does handle the road very well and it does drive good in the snow and rain. I was so hopeful that the 'redesign' for 2017 would fix some of my major issues, but alas, Acura decided the keep the horrid infotainment system and the shifting buttons. I doubt many of my other cons have been changed either so sadly this Acura will be going back to the dealer soon and I won't be shedding any tears when I see it go! Overall - I should have kept my 2012 Honda Accord, I liked it much better!",3

My car of choice over the last 20 plus years has been Lexus. (GS and ES) I'm beginning to think I was spoiled by the customer service and overall quality and reliability of the 4 Lexus vehicles I've owned.  The battery on my less than one year old 2015 TLX  died in a parking lot and  thank goodness and not some place more dangerous.  I had to have the car towed-the dealership said they were too busy to send someone to help me since it was a Saturday.  They kept the car for 3 working days in order to replace the battery, which, I was told most likely had been on a shelf and was out-of-date before even being installed.  They were going to send me home without a loaner...it's Saturday, busy and so I can't help you. .  I had to engage the dealership head honcho and finally was given a loaner.  Evidently, the car's computer system went down when the battery failed and I'm still having issues with various tech features.  They can't seem to figure it out and I keep having to go back.  Now, about the braking/transmission systems.  When coming to a stop, or sometimes even when completely stopped, the car lunges forward followed by a forceful rear-end kickback.  The dealership offered up this advice, ""that's nothing to worry about, the TLX is known for this issue.""  Really?  Why not fix it?   I know I didn't buy a Lexus. I get that.  What I don't understand is if you know there's a problem, why don't you fix it?  Before the car depreciates any more, I'm going to probably trade it in for ...ready for this ?  Another Lexus!",3
3001, on 08/15/16 12:13 PM (PDT),Wes ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Advance Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Best Acura YET.  Tranny ok.  Nav = DINOSAUR," I have owned or leased four Acuras before this one: 2003 TL Type S; 2004 TL; 2007 TL; 2006 RL.  All great cars. This one is the best, IMO.  Yet it is still not good  enough to keep me loyal. I've had my 2015 TLX for 14 mos.  Generally happy with it. Common themes bring me back to Acura:  1. Drive and handling with descent fuel economy for MY driving style; 2. Sufficient amount of tech; 3. Unparalled reliability and durability; 4. Dealer experience; 5. Value.  If you are an avid Acura owner like me, then I am sure you get where I am coming from.  Brand loyalty is a funny thing, though.  You can look across many car groups (Subaru, Mercedes, Jeep, etc.), and it is interesting to notice the ""Seth Goden Tribal"" phenomenon with so many.  Humorous almost.  I am sure it applies to me, until I open my mind to something else, right?  That said, here is my review, and I will start with the bad.  First, I think Acura dealerships and the OEM need to get a clue about their NAV system and the entire user experience on the dash.  They need to stop boasting about being the inventors of NAV and that they have the best, most awarded technology.   This is utter [non-permissible content removed] and so 1991.  This system absolutely sucks!  It is difficult to use, the voice prompts are useless and complicated, the menu structure on the touchscreen requires way too much attention for the simplest of tasks, the NAV won't integrate with any smart phone without a paid subscription (really, Acura?) and the on-board NAV system is absolutely HORRIBLE, in fact worse than past years.  The 2-screen system is very cool and has potential for a well-designed solution, and it helps mitigate the user experience trainwreck that is like a tractor beam from the ditch.   Anything that doesn't offer Apple Carplay or Android Auto (or both)  is a dinosaur.  Period.  Hey Acura, these players own the space.  Get on board already.  Stop charging for it.  Looking across the digital car technology ecosystem, this is downright insulting. You are going to have to invent another business model for upside.  My hope is that Acura will provide an upgrade, and soon.  This system alone will keep me from buying another Acura after this, as on-board tech is the new differentiator for car brands.  This is where GM got it right, but I would have to own a GM, which is a non-starter.  Training a device to bluetooth is tedious, should be easier.  There are $29 bluetooth accessories that do better.  Phone control once in bluetooth is also extremely tedious.  Voice prompts are useless here.  Next, the transmission was annoying at first, but like other owners, I got used to it.  I drive in sport mode all the time and it seems to do okay.  There is *slightly* noticeable  lag, but quite frankly, it is not a deal killer.  This car is ""very fast enough"".      Now the good.  I love how this car handles.  I love how it feels.  The acceleration is there, even if in need of minor refinement.  To me, this car is the best of both worlds: good, smooth torque like my '06 RL and superb handling like my TLs.  The car feels big, smooth and solid, yet nimble.  Viva la SH-AWD. The engine sound is throaty, yet car looks like a lion in sheep's clothing.   The fold-down rear seat was a huge seller for me, and a deal breaker without.  (Hey cyclists, I can get my 56 cm road bike or medium size 29er MTB removing only the front wheel.  Huge!)  Despite my desire to haul my bike without an external rack, I love cars and how they drive, which is why I didn't look at Grand Cherokees, MDXs or Explorers, etc.  I have the Advance package.  The adaptive cruise is very nice, once you get used to it.  I find the lane control feature a little flaky and still in need of refinement - will be looking for an update on next trip to dealer.   I also love the rear and blindspot warnings and associated audible indicators.  They are especially useful in the Costco parking lot where worst parking lot drivers on earth tend to congregate at velocity.  Good looks, steering wheel controls, fit & finish.  No noise w/sunroof open during bluetooth call.  Here is what it comes down to for me:  Acura, don't be arrogant.  You have done great things to build the brand over the course of decades.  I am a living example.  But times are changing.  Even your loyalest followers will look elsewhere.  Pay close attention to the evolving definition of what makes the car/owner experience.  Tech is a huge part of that.  Gather quantifiable market and usability research, don't deny the findings, and keep up with rapidly changing consumer desires.  In fact, get out in front of the curve.  I am mainly referring to the touchscreen nightmare.  But styling and tranny too.  There are ways to improve this, to do things others have not, make it safer, and even more compelling.  Otherwise you could end up in the disrupted pile.  Yours truly, 14 year Acura loyalist slowly turning surfer of tinder for cars.",4

I've had transmission issues from the 1st week I've had the car;  Had the car in for service 8 times for the same transmission problem (car lurches forward after I come to a stop WHILE I HAVE MY FOOT FIRMLY PRESSED DOWN ON THE BREAK); Now the interior is falling apart....part of the drivers seat (plastic section) where the seat controls are has cracked and broken off.....now I'll be dropping my car off to have that fixed.  It's laughable that Acura/American Honda Motor Company has labeled the TLX a ""luxury car"".  Trust me it's not......but don't bother trying to get your dealership OR even American Honda Motor Company to address their poorly designed, crappy built and unsafe transmissions, because you will get no where with them.  Believe me, I've fought the battle and lost.  Do yourself a favor, don't lease or buy anything vehicle that is manufactured by Acura or American Honda Motor Company....you might as well buy a Ford Pinto.",1

Stay Away!!," Huge Acura fan, this was my 5th Acura in 4 years. This car really makes me question the brand. Good design (not so much in the back), awesome headlights, decent pickup, nice interior, awesome fuel economy (36 mpg avg on hwy), cool technology, good value, HORRIBLE transmission. I mean this thing is downright awful and RUINS the whole vehicle for me, what a shame! My car has the 2-3 transmission jerk and just sloppy shifting in general. It wouldn't be a big deal if this very well known problem among '15 TLX V6 owners (2-3 gear jerk) would be addressed and fixed by Acura, but they won't do ANYTHING for me and most owners. The '16 TLX doesn't have the 2-3 gear jerk, so you think they could fix the '15, right? Wrong! So don't think you can buy the car and if it has the gear jerk, it'll be fixed since it's under warranty because they won't do anything for you! I used to swear by the brand and recommend it to everyone, but not anymore, especially not their service! STAY AWAY FROM THIS CAR!!",3

The exterior is prefect, love the rims also. The interior is very attractive, minus the so-so navigation system and controls. If your looking for a roomy car, this isn't it. Remember this is a compact entry-lever luxury car. Currently, we have have 7,000 miles on ours, just developed a rattle coming from the inside the front of the cabin. The front seats are very comfortable and I love the frame-less rear view mirror. Now, here's why you shouldn't buy this car! THE TRANSMISSION is horrible! Believe the reviews! From 1st to 2nd gear it hesitates and lags badly! Doesn't matter what mode you put it in either.  Our Acura dealership has done two updates so far and they both haven't helped! Looking to trade soon for maybe a Genesis's or something else. Oh, one awesome thing about the car is the fuel economy! I have gotten up to 44 mpg's on the highway at 55 mph.",2
3007, on 05/06/16 13:31 PM (PDT),Randy Atkins ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Vibration at 1500 RPMs," I've had the car for about 6 weeks now and bought it after being extremely pleased with my 2016 MDX Advance.  It was a CPO loaner car with 4600 miles.  After about 2 weeks I noticed when I was cruising along at 1500 RPMs it felt like I was riding on a rumble strip.  At first I thought it was the road, but then it seemed to happen on any road I was on.  I took it to the dealer and they said that it was due to the VCM system (variable cylinder management).  When it reaches a cruising speed it drops back to 3 cylinders for optimal gas mileage and therefore causes a vibration.  The dealer said there was no fix which lead me to call Acura customer care.  After talking with them and them talking to the dealer, they told me that was how the car is supposed to operate, to which I told them no $40k luxury car is designed to rumble when you are at cruising speed.  They were absolutely no help and offered no assistance to remedy the problem, just repeated that was the way it was supposed to operate.  I took it to another dealer and they basically confirmed the findings of the first dealer.  In addition, I started to have a vibration when braking.  They looked at that issue and ended up having to replace the entire front brake system...not very comforting for a car with 7k miles.  I will say the gas mileage is exceptional as I got 38 MPG straight interstate on a 300 mile trip; however, I bought it for the ride more than the MPG and would gladly take a lower MPG for a smooth ride.  Probably won't keep it long.",3
3008, on 04/22/16 20:56 PM (PDT),westlx ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),"15 TLX - It is not that ""kind of thrill"""," Got a great deal on the TLX end of 2015 and only bought it due to getting thousands off sticker.  I did not think the 1,000 off sticker was justified for this car after driving it earlier in the year.   It does have a great smooth, quiet ride.  The 4cyl has more than enough power with the 8speed DCT.    It is nice having the rear cross and blind spot protection and it is a great highway cruiser getting around 35 on premium gas.  Do not believe the dealer than you can run 87, well yeah you can but the engine knocks.So pros: Quiet ride, very nice ride over bumps etc, sound system is great and gas mileage is good for a car this size.Cons:  2,000 miles into owning the car noticed a crease in the headliner, not just a wrinkle as I thought. The headliner was broken, how did that pass QA?   Dealer had to pull windshield out to put a new one in.  Just great having a new car all ripped apart.  This warranted 2 trips to the dealer, because it was not assembled 100% like new when I went to pick it up and they had to order more parts.Fit and finish inside is just ok, I would expect better for the luxury brand of Honda.Touch screen for hvac is just dumb, good I have LKAS cause you need it while changing the controls.  Granted I knew this and thought I would get use to it, but give me knobs back please.Now my most recent issue is the car when sifting out of drive will not go into reverse, you have to play with the trans to get it to work.   50-75% of the time it won't go in reverse.  On day one at the dealer I was told this never happened before. Now on day two being told it has happened before and it is a shift cable that is damaged.  I asked what caused the damage and I was told Acura does not know.  During this visit also asked to fox the rattle/vibration in the headliner. So much for no rattles after the car was ripped apart.  Now to see how the panels are fitting after being ripped apart twice now.  After the first time they certainly don't look like my loaner now where it is all neat and tight.  And forget calling Acura Client Relations they are a joke.  Person today was rude and told me they cannot do anything about these issues and that the dealer needs to address any complaints since they sold the car and each dealership is an independent business from Acura.  Based on the call today,  I guess Acura doesn't give a crap about the defects they put out from their production lines.   I had some initial problems with my Jeep, and I have to say their customer service puts Acura to shame!Overall I want to like the car, but so far the ownership is not what I had expected from an Acura product.  Go read consumer reports and check out what they are stating about the Acura brand this year before spending your hard earned money.Update:  ending up selling the car.  Around 8000 miles my seat seemed to break in, however where the seam is on the back by your lumbar area stayed firm. After driving. Ore than 2+ hrs it was like something was stabbing you in the back.  I took some trips in my jeep, and bam my back was no longer sore.  I tried to get two dealers to look at it and both said nothing was wrong with it.  Ended up ditching it as I could not take it anymore.",3

I have been driving my new TLX for about 18 months now and have about 16,000 miles on it. Fantastic car and offers great value for the money. This is not a sports car even though handling is superb. Best features: quiet interior, quality of materials, handling/steering, engine, fuel economy, style, transmission, LED headlights, great value for the money, and very solid chassis. Not so good features: front headroom good but not great (wish Acura would offer models without moon roof), no spare tire, automatic transmission sometimes jerks a bit when switching from reverse to drive when car is cold.",5
3010, on 04/08/16 19:07 PM (PDT),Brandon ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan Advance Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Good Car; Understand What It Is," Update after a year of driving the TLX:I still think it's a good car.   It has a lot to offer.  My major complaint remains the 9-speed AT - it's no good.  The car also has an intermittent and very annoying rattle in the back deck lid that the dealer has failed multiple times to identify, pursue, or remedy.  I've left the dealer multiple time feeling like I'm the one with the problem because they look at me like I'm crazy for complaining about the noise.Overall dealer experience has been very disappointing.The only way to make the car fun to drive is to use the paddle shifters.  Even said, the shifts are slow and the sense power is lacking even with the V6 due to torque curve (and lack thereof at low RPM).",3

3012, on 03/19/16 16:39 PM (PDT),Rick Drew ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Came up from an Acura TL," The Acura TLX is an excellent replacement to an Acura TL (which I drove for the past three years).  In terms of space, it is equal to the TL.  I cannot perceive a difference (from the TL) in the available space inside (I am 6' and heavy set) and I am totally comfortable in this car.   In terms of performance the car accelerates quite well ( I use the ""Sport"" setting) and it really knows how to ""get out of its own way.""  I am not aggressive enough a driver to benefit from the ""SH-AWD"" but I feel totally in control and very comfortable with the handling.  The audio system is just fine (I have the standard setup) and I have no problem dealing with the two screen control.   Anyone who says it's confusing just hasn't taken a few minutes to learn how to be comfortable with it.  I like that I can now ""type in"" directions to the ""Nav system"" as opposed to the TL which required me to ""spin and select.""  The soundproofing has been significantly enhanced and it cruises at very low cabin noise levels.  I really like the safety features such as the blind spot warning.  I also like the Lane Keeping Assistance System (LKAS).  It works very well.  If you don't keep a light touch on the wheel while it is in use, it will notify that ""Steering Required"" after about 20 seconds which is fine with me.  After all, this is not a self-driving car but the LKAS makes a long highway trip very relaxing just as cruise control does.  Mileage is amazing.  I get 25 MPG combined city and highway and it will travel over 500 miles on a (17 gallon) tank of gas on the freeway (averaging 37 MPG in cruise).  I have driven non-stop from L.A. To the Bay Area without getting into reserve.  What I would change:  I hate the engine idle stop feature (which is the default and kicks in at every stop).  I would prefer that the default would be that it is OFF and you would then choose to turn it ON.  I also disable the collision warning (that you are over taking the car ahead) because it sets off too many annoying false alarms every time I approach a car ahead of me.  I would make this default to OFF as well.  Finally, I wish it had exhaust tailpipes to funnel or direct the exhaust away from the back of the car.  As it is, the back end of my (white) constantly gets sooty from the exhaust getting caught up in the turbulence behind the car and pulled back towards the car.  Finally, it sometimes. ""Hangs on"" to a gear too long.  For example, if I use the downshift paddle shifter to decelerate, it may hold the selected downshifted gear too long when I accelerate out.  Summary: hey, it's just a car and no car is perfect (at least that I can afford) and overall I am very satisfied with the TLX.  It is a real step up from the TL and I am very glad I bought it.  I think it's one of the best kept secrets in the sport sedan class and offers terrific value especially when compared to its pricy German competition.Update September 2016:  I have now driven the car for almost a year (8,500 miles) and I remain totally satisfied with it.  There have been no mechanical or electrical issues whatsoever outside of normal maintenance.  I have regularly turned in my leased cars at the end of three years but this may be a keeper.  I am so satisfied that my wife moved up from an RDX to an MDX in May and we are just as happy with that.  I continue to believe that the Acura is an excellent value giving you lots of fun to drive and great reliability for many thousands less than its European competitors.Update after 12,000 miles:  I'm still really satisfied in every way.  I have had zero discrepancies with the car since new.  I get dealer service and it has been first class service all the way.  Both my wife and I enjoy her MDX but we both feel that the TLX is both quieter and smoother especially at highway cruise.  I don't drive at all aggressively but once in a while when it is appropriate, I open it up and I am always amazed by the acceleration as well as the ""snarl"" of the engine in a more performance acceleration.  It really is fun to drive.  I am a little confounded by some of the reviews.  For example, Consumer Reports does not show it as recommended (supposedly due to the reliability of the electronics) but it gets solid green on virtually every category of scoring.  Doesn't make any sense to me ...   At least for my part, I have not had a single problem with the electronics or any other feature in this car.  I have a year and a half left on my lease and then I will either keep it or lease a new TLX.  But I am certain I will stay with the brand.  After all, it really is just a spiffy Honda.",5

The difference is night and day. While both have the same reliable Acura quality, the ride in the ILX was choppy. By contrast the TLX is a very comfortable ride. I have the 4 cylinder base model, but I find it fine for me. If someone wants to drive aggressively, with lots of peppy acceleration, this is not a match for that. But for the average driver, the performance of the car is fine. Its comfort is well above average. I would compare the drive to a Lexus 350. I did not get the navigation system, because with a smart phone, it's all you need. Acura service is tops when you need it, but you rarely do.",4

They also gave me free service for life of warranty. I am pleased with the new car.  The transmission is 90 percent better than the old one.

The V6 is a great engine with typical Honda growl and furious acceleration. Unfortunately, the 9-speed automatic gets in the way of truly exploiting what this engine has to offer. The transmission is consistently caught hunting for the correct gear when you dig in for more power, unless your using the Sport + mode which does bring the transmission to life.  Unfortunately, Sport + mode also brings with it a ""rev matching"" downshift program that proves to be harsh for all on board, nothing like a manual heel and toe downshift. Left in Sport mode (not Sport+) the car does a decent job of being sports sedan but leaves the driver wanting more. It's too bad this engine can't be had with Acura's more precise dual clutch automatic (4 cyl only) or a manual transmission. The SH-AWD V6 is best suited in day to day use for people looking for luxury over performance. To that end, Acura does offer an engine start / stop system to improve fuel economy that shutters the engine at a stop light. Unfortunately, engine restarts are a bit rough and do catch the car off guard when you need more than a small amount of power off the line. Additionally, the stop / start feature will kill the engine on occasion, only to restart it 60 seconds later for no apparent reason and then shut it off again after moving a few feet in heavy traffic.Other tech features include Acura's blind spot monitoring system. which is very accurate and can easily tell the difference between a guard rail and a car in your blind spot. Unfortunately, the lane keeping assist seems more like a waste of money than an actual feature. The system can barely detect lane markers and consistently fails to engage. During my week with the car, the navigation system was consistently beat by Waze and Google Maps on my iPhone. Both offering better directions and more accurate arrival times than Acura's system. Apple CarPlay would have been 100 times more useful than another dated navigation system like that offered in the 2015 TLX.Overall, this is a good car. It's quiet. It's fast. However, it sorely needs a better transmission and better technology package. In all, the base TLX with an inline 4 and Acura's dual-clutch automatic provide a much better value as long as you're willing to bring your own Smartphone along for the ride.",3

It is horrible especially in early models (not sure if the issue is still present in 2016). My car also vibrates on a highway that takes tons of enjoyment out of driving, so if you drive a lot on highway, make sure to test it on a highway before spending hard earned money as Acura will not fix it!!!! My car was in service 6 times to address vibrations and 9 speed tranny and I gave up and sold the car cause I could not deal with it anymore.Also for people coming from 4th generation TL.

I do mostly highway driving and it handles great at all speeds and is quiet and well made. Oh by the way, the trade-in value is better than the Benz or BMW. You cannot buy a better car for the price. Test drove the base model and was not impressed but the all- wheel drive advanced package is a home run!UPDATE: After 36 months of ownership, I am still amazed at what a terrific car the TLX is. It is so comfortable and quite. I do mostly highway driving and it is incredible on the open road and there is no other car in its class that can compare to the TLX. I am averaging 30 miles to the gallon on the highway and it is like riding on a cloud. Every time I step into my TLX I admire the style and comfort of the interior so much warmer than the German brands. I intend to give my 2015 TLX to my 17 year old son and purchase a 2018.

I really like the Acura's separate screen for the navigation and one for the sound system.  The ELS 10 speaker system with surround is wonderful.  The car has good acceleration and gas mileage.  There are more technology features than other similar luxury cars.  Plus it is priced lower than the Lexus and Mercedes C-300 (which is a small car).I highly recommend the Acura TLX.

Why on earth did you buy, or even lease this car if you don't love it?  There are so many sedans to choose from, and I can think of five or six that are pretty close to the TLX in many ways.  You could have gotten a Maxima, a Passat, a Lexus ES, an Accord V6, a Malibu, an Infiniti, a Hyundai, a Kia, a Camry, etc., etc.  If you didn't choose the TLX because its such a great blend of technology, performance, reliability, and value then I'm sorry, but you're blew it.   This car isn't perfect but guess what..none of the cars I listed are perfect either.  No car in this price range does everything exactly right.  A couple of years ago I took a two year break from Acura (I've had ten Acuras) and leased a Lexus GS350.  It was a fine automobile, and nicer than any Acura I've owned, but I had to reduce my debt to income ratio in order to buy a home, so the Lexus went back before the lease was up.I managed to lease a 2015 TLX AWD TECH this month, for 24 months, with 15K miles per year, and with zero money down I got the car for $439 per month with tax included.  There was no better deal on ANY comparable luxury sedan.  Period.  If you didn't get a great deal too, that's your fault.  If you found out later that you don't like the nine speed tranny, or the lane departure system, or the fact that there's not USB charger in the back seat, or that the car can't be rolled in neutral if the batter dies, ITS ALL YOUR FAULT!  Its a car people.  It's not supposed to be perfect.  Nothing in life is perfect.  Get over it.I love Acura.  I love that its not a BMW or Mercedes or Audi because I think those cars are too expensive, and too prone to have problems, and I don't care about the perceived status people who drive them feel about THEMSELVES.  Guess what....nobody is impressed with your German car anymore.  They are ubiquitous nowadays.    I love that my Acuras make me happy, that their ELS stereos sound great, that I can drive them without any effort, and that they never actually need to be rolled in neutral!Happy motoring everyone!",5

Roadside assistance came out and they had no idea, I called the dealer and they said the only way to move the car is to jack up the car and put rollers under the tires.  So I wrote Acura and this is what they had to say;""We value you as an Acura client and we appreciate the opportunity of responding to your concern.

The climate control system when set to auto seems to set the fan speed on the higher settings which are extremely noisy and doesn't seem to hold temperature very well.The lane keeping system is a dangerous miss; it disengages often and for no apparent reason with an almost inaudible chirp, and sometimes doesn't indicate that it has disengaged at all. The navigation system is awful; The trip planning doesn't take into account traffic when calculating route times and therefore you will often get the worst routes. There is no option to send route information or addresses from your phone/online to your car's nav. The transmission is smooth in normal mode but the economy mode is a little herky-jerky. Shifting from park into reverse on a slight incline (think driveway) results in a gut-wrenching noise. The sport mode and sport+ modes are fun in winding mountain roads, but the lack of any acceleration limits their fun factor. Braking is mushy. The seating is spacious and comfortable in both back and front. The seating controls are intuitive and easy to reach. The two driver settings are tied to the keys which is a nice touch. The trunk is also large and easy to access. If the lane keeping system and nav performed as expected this would be the perfect touring car , but like I said it's a near miss",3
3023, on 11/14/15 11:12 AM (PST),Arathena ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Love this car!," I’ve had my eye on the Acura TL since it first came out years ago. When I finally had an excuse to get a new car, I made sure to test drive it, only this time the newer model is TLX. I test drove a variety of cars - sedans/sporty cars/SUVs, like from Subaru, Mazda, Ford, and finally the Acura ILX and TLX, not really sure which car I wanted, but I did know that I wanted something that combined elegance, sportiness and reliability, bonus for comfort, spaciousness, fuel efficiency, and if it came in crimson. I didn’t get that last one, but I definitely got everything else with the TLX! Pros:— Great bang for the buck! I didn’t set out to buy a luxury car, though Acura touts it as such, and it’s cheaper than their competitors. I just wanted something that has most of the things I mentioned above, and I got a great deal for them. — LOVE the Brake Hold feature. When it’s on, simply tap on the brake pedal, let go, and the car stays stopped. Step on the gas and off you go. Very handy!— It’s QUIET! I love whatever noise cancellation Acura incorporated. Whether talking on the car speaker phone system, listening to music or to silence, you get the most out of it.— Other pluses are the soft leathers, wood-like paneling on the door handles, a dim light that laminates the door handle so you can easily see it in the dark. The lights on auto adjust depending on how light or dark it is outside, so if I’m in a dark garage building, it’ll go brighter. The windshield wipers on auto can be adjusted depending on how wet it is. The trunk cargo - you can lift up the bottom flap and find extra cubby holes. — AWS rocks! Great handling, steering is stable and braking is responsive. I’ve driven it in light and heavy rain and had no problems. — Though 2.4L doesn’t have turbo, it’s still quite nimble and zippy.— Love the 8-speed Dual Clutch Transmission. It comes with 4 modes: Econ, Normal, Sport, Sport+ (this uses the paddle shifters). In traffic I switch to Economy, but by default I use Sport mode for the higher revs and faster acceleration. The paddle shifters can only be fun for so long, and not so fun when you’re trying to turn the wheel so you can’t easily paddle-shift up or down. Sport/Sport+ mode gives me the feeling of manual shifting, only smoother and without the stick. If they came out with a stick shift version, I would really love it more, but for an automatic, I think it’s pretty awesome!— Fuel economy - my daily commute involves a lot of stop-and-go freeway traffic, but so far I’m getting 25.4 mpg.— Suspension - this is such a comfortable ride! It’s rigid enough to be sporty, but you hardly feel the bumps on the road. Best of both worlds to me.— Infotainment: Generally easy to use. It’s strange at first that there are 2 screens. The upper one can display navigation or music playlist (easier to look at for line of sight, the lower one is a touch screen to control things like settings, climate, music (closer to access by hand). — Except for the front (see cons), I love the look. It’s classy, sleek, sporty. Fantastic wheels even at base model. I get a lot of compliments from my coworkers when they see me driving in.— I opted out of the tech package since I didn’t want to spend an extra $4K, nor an extra $10K for AWD and V6 engine, but if you can afford either, go for it. Very nice to have.Cons:— Infotainment: Slow response for bluetooth and could be more intuitive. It takes longer for the system to detect my device phone or tablet. When I skip a song or go back one, there’s a few seconds delay. It’s annoying, but I can live with it. What does annoy me quite a bit, though thankfully I don’t do much of, is that while driving and trying to switch to my phone that I just connected via bluetooth, if the mode is not already on bluetooth (like it’s on XM), instead of the Infotainment switching automatically to bluetooth and displaying my music from my phone, I have to tap on the bluetooth button. This is an unnecessary extra step. — Sporty, but not that fun on windy roads. This is probably due to the AWS, which keeps the car VERY stable, which means you don’t get the sensation of possibly slipping or tipping over, ha. — Front is a little conservative (it’s growing on me, though). I prefer the sportier look on the front of ILX, but over all I think I got more bang for my buck with TLX, so I don’t mind so much. — Not a gripe, but you should expect this in case you plan to have 4 other people ride with you on a more regular basis: the 4th person who will be sitting in the middle of the back seat will not be so comfortable, I’m told. Definitely not for a tall person, that seat. Make sure when you test drive that you have someone try out that seat.",4
3024, on 11/11/15 06:58 AM (PST),CKW101 ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Smooth Operator," Reading some of the negative reviews on edmunds, I was very surprised.  My 6-cyl TLX with Tech package is one of the smoothest cars I have ever owned.  This is my third Acura ('05 RL, '12 TL with SH-AWD) and it is by far the best.  Didn't need the SH-AWD in this vehicle, and I've really enjoyed the precision steering - I don't miss the SH-AWD at all (and my dad has the SH-AWD with Advance Package - also a great car, but more than what I needed).  The size is comfortable, the transmission is much much smoother than the 2012 TL I owned, and the interior quality rivals any other Japanese luxury standard.  If you are surprised that there is no gearshift, or that the badge doesn't have three letters in it, well seriously: why are you surprised or disappointed?  You should know what you are buying:  a comfortable and engaging sedan, with plenty of room, and excellent mileage (around 27 mpg in a mixed traffic for me) and the rock-solid reliability that keeps me from considering German competitors.  I didn't buy this car to impress anyone; I bought it for me - and it's been a great choice so far.  Changing the selection from Economy to Sport to Sport + is like changing cars.  It's all there, with tightened suspension and a completely different feel.  I looked at Lexus, and I drive everything in the rental car fleet, but this car is on par with the smoothness and comfort of Lexus sedans (and I really appreciate the luxury feel in the TLX - much much better than the jerky, muscle-car-wannabe transmission in the '12 TL).  Yet this car manages to still inspire with engaging driving dynamics and all-around dimensions that add up to a perfect 'fit' for me.  Don't expect this car to be another brand, drive it for what it is: a whole lot of car for the money.",5

Will definitely not purchase when the lease is up. In the first year of owning the car it had to be flatbed towed back to the dealership twice. Once for a loose land broken retainer clip in the transmission tunnel, and another when one of the rear wheel steering motor went out. I've also had the air conditioner evaporator replaced in the first year. Definitely not what I expected for reliability. My BMW was bulletproof. Go figure.",3
3026, on 10/24/15 10:01 AM (PDT),David D ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),It's Not a Thrill," Acura advertises that the TLX is ""Some kind of Thrill.""  A better descriptor is ""Some kind of Numb.""  My previous Acura was a TSX V6.  The TLX is also a V6.  Nothing about the TLX's performance connotes sportiness or performance.  At worst, it's a souped up Accord or it's the best Oldsmobile ever made.  It has no feeling of connectivity to the road.  This is due to the poor steering, suspension, and tire combination.  Rubbery describes it best.  All wheel steer creates an odd feeling and a feature to coverup engineering design flaws.  The brakes are average.  The pushbutton 9 speed transmission is silly, slow to engage, and has lots of travel when placed into park.  The touch screen infotainment is abysmal.  It's a design copout.  The engine is Honda quality.  Strong and gets great gas mileage on the highway.  It's quiet.  The headlights work well.  Acura took 6 years to release the TLX.  It's supposed to be smaller than the prior TL except it sits on the same wheel base.  Park next to an Accord and it's hard to distinguish the two.  That's why the TLX suffers.  Nothing about it makes it a distinctive sports sedan ready to fight the German competition.  If you want a fancier Accord at Honda value, this is the car for you.  Otherwise, look carefully at the alternatives.",2
3027, on 10/22/15 07:53 AM (PDT),Ann ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Love this car from the outside," Once you get in, and drive - particularly at NIGHT is when you really can't stand it.  The lights are so very dim - we live in an area with no street lights. Test drive was on a highway - and didn't notice how DARK the car is.  When you come to an intersection and need to turn - you see an absolute BLACK HOLE on the sides of the car - no visibility whatsoever. Can't see a deer, dog, bear, bicycle rider, pedestrian - zip nada nothing!  You have to use the high beams the entire ride - and my 2006 Acura had great lights. Loved the look of these LED from the outside, but the brightness is very short distance ahead.  Makes you very unsure around the next bend. I have to look into some type of fog lights being added, because my husband and I recognize we could well be killed driving this vehicle at night.The transmission is quirky - especially around 40-45 MPH, does this zooming up thing while you are coasting. Should you take your foot off the gas to approach either a hill or railroad tracks - the car comes to life and speeds itself up! Craziest thing.Update 04/2017: Another glitch... upgraded to I-phone 7 in January. Try as I might, I couldn't sync to the Bluetooth in the car.  Thought it was me. When I brought in for most recent oil change and service, asked them to fix the phone to my car. ""Oh, no... so sorry... the Engineers are working on a fix, your car is not compatible with the I-phone 7"". SERIOUSLY... the 2006 was compatible with I-phone 5-S, and this car is not compatible with the current phone models?Also, I had an autobody person move the headlights up a smidge - which helped minimally. Although Acura states there are ""NO ADJUSTMENTS"" possible of the headlights, apparently a run-of the mill auto body worker managed to do what Acura Engineering couldn't... simply amazing. This beautiful car fails in so many ways.Absolutely HATE electronics all on the screen. Simple function like adjusting fan speed can't be accomplished because of the glare on the screen. Just give me a dial!Why does the car rock repeatedly every time I brake - no matter how gently?I feel that someone went way too far with the electronics, and over engineered what ought to be simple tasks. Headlights are DANGEROUS and I foresee a recall in the near future - as was the case with the shiny ac vents reflecting off the mirror - which were replaced with black matte ones.BTW - Still haven't found the odometer??? 6 Weeks of ownership.",3
3028, on 10/19/15 09:59 AM (PDT),PJ ,2015 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Advance Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Best car for the $$$," Before making the purchase, I've been comparing cars within the $40k to $50k range that are not necessarily in the same class, like the BMW 335xi, 435GC xi, Lexus ES 350, Audi A4, and the Acura TLX. Taking into consideration the included tech and the SH AWD system, the TLX was the clear winner. With regards to the 9 speed ZF transmission I think it's hit or miss. I test drove three cars at the dealership and one car had a very jerky 1-2 and 2-3 shifts along with moderate in-cabin vibration between 60mph to 80mph and the other two did not. The jerkiness feels almost like letting go of the clutch too quickly while shifting a manual tranny car. I ended up purchasing the TLX V6 SH AWD with Advance package for 41780 OTD and I have no issues with transmission and it shifts like butter. The only gripe I have is the gas mileage in city. I drive in sport mode all the time and my commute is only 4 miles in the city. I only get about 16 mpg on the trip computer and I get about 250 miles per gas tank. On the highway it does great; I was able to get 33mpg in sport mode easily.",4

And that's fair, because this car lacks the style, power, or luxury of those brands. Still, it does have style, power, and luxury, just in more modest amounts.My priorities that led me to buying this car were that I wanted something:~fairly luxurious, but not extravagant in cost~good MPG, and good reliability, to keep the cost-per-mile on my long commute low~modern tech, advanced featuresHaving owned it a year, I'd say it succeeded on the first two points, and failed on the 3rd. My car is indeed about as nice as you'd expect for $35k, it is indeed getting 32-38 mpg depending on the situation, and it is indeed a Honda with rock-solid reliability. I drive a 60 mile round trip daily, and the car does a great job of rolling along with a quiet ride, and a feeling of confidence that it won't break down (like my BMW used to do all the time!). It has a nice amount of pep, the 8 speed tranny can get a lot of power out of those ~206 horses.My complaints are mostly with the tech:~dual screens are confusing, and it's frustrating having to push several touch-screen options in a row to do things as simple as adjust the A/C fan speed.~VERY SLOW on-board computer. Inputting basic commands into the Nav or audio system is maddening. It's sort of a similar feeling to using a first-generation iPhone which is overloaded with too much software. The CPU is too weak to can't handle the demands put on it, so it can take as long as 10 seconds to even react to button presses. 10 seconds is the worst-case, most often it takes more like 1-2 whole seconds to respond, but that is pretty terrible in comparison to the .05 seconds most smartphones take these days. Attempting actions like scrolling the Nav map image often lead to the system nearly crashing, or getting stuck and scrolling way farther than you wanted.~cell phone integration is very weak. It can sync with Pandora on my phone, but it requires several confirmation screens each time you use it, so it's not really worth the trouble. Siri hands free is a joke, you may as well just push the button on your phone and use that instead. ~The tech package supposedly has high-end speakers, but I've found them to be very mediocre, and lacking in bass. The single 8"" open air ""subwoofer"" is not impressive.I'd agree with Edmunds overall rating of the car as a ""B."" That is to say, it's basically what you expect, a low end luxury car. So long as you aren't expecting it to handle like a BMW or ride like a Mercedes, you should be fine. I'd have even given it an A, except for my disappointments with the outdated tech.",4

I would HIGHLY recommend this car to anyone.UPDATE: Went to trade my car in with 30K miles on it, it was only worth $23K. This was a $40K car. The 9 speed transmission really do suck.

The 2-3 gear shift is truly awful, I've brought it in twice to the dealer to try and fix and they say it is normal and there is no fix. It is so unpleasant that it removes any and all fun from driving the car. I'm still coming to terms that I might be stuck with this car for the near future. Acura, how can you sleep at night? The V6 models are a disaster. They clearly hand picked a non-defective one to lend to car review sites and now that we've bought them Acura doesn't care at all. Surprised there isn't a class action lawsuit for the V6 models yet. Going to try to take it in a couple more times to get it fixed and then see if it can qualify for the lemon law. You've been warned, stay far far away from the V6 models. I don't even care if this hurts my own resale value, no more people should be tricked into buying this $40k lemon. Buying a luxury car shouldn't be a gamble that you get a good transmission. Shame on you Acura.UPDATE: I have sold my Acura TLX at a loss less than a year after getting it after numerous repeat trips to the Acura dealership. Acura corporate even sent a technician to look at it, but they could not solve the shifting issues yet still refused to replace the car.

Transmission!," Hate the 9 speed transmission!!! As others have reported, the car shifts roughly. I could manually shift a four speed smoother than this car's automatic. 1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd gears terrible jerking. At 40 MPH coasting down hill the transmission starts searching for a gear causing it to shift into neutral and when a gear is found the car surges forward. This also happens in stop and go traffic where the shifting can cause unexpected acceleration. (Several near accidents) Despite a recall the ""Parking"" gear doesn't always hold. You need to use the emergency brake to be safe.  I've had the car into the shop 5 times in the past 10 months. Their answer to the problem, ""We are working on it."" Really? This is supposed to be a high-end luxury car? It won't be long before we start to hear about serious accidents caused by the uncontrolled shifting and acceleration.Update:We sought relief thru the NYS lemon law but since a ""mechanical issue"" was never found with the transmission (""It's a computer glitch that we are working to correct"" said the dealer's mechanics) the commission ruled in favor of the corporation's lawyers. Not surprise there. Over the three year lease we had left the car with the dealer for approximately 20 days to correct the problems but to no avail.The car sat in my garage for the last 4 months of the lease because my wife was afraid to drive it.

The new TLX has some problems.  First, there is NO emergency brake....absolutely dumb and stupid!  They ask you to electronically put on an emergency brake and then to get it off, electronically, you have to press on the accelerator.  Well, that can cause an accident, especially if you are pointed downhill.  Second, when you put the transmission in park, it drifts backward or forward, however you are pointed.  These defects need to be fixed, pronto.  If you like a hand emergency brake, don't buy this car!  ADDITIONAL:  After driving this car for two years I had to get rid of it.  The problems with the 9-speed transmission were unsurmountable.  Press on the gas, the car almost dies.  Open the driver's door in reverse and the car goes into ""Park"".  Take your foot off the accelerator while driving and the car surges ahead.  Acura is supposed to make a ""driver's"" car.....the 2015 TLX is not that car.

Awesome build quality.Bluetooth - Make sure your phone is compatible! Apparently, I am hearing that Acura is not the fastest brand out there to update their Bluetooth software. I had no problem so far, but some close friends are experiencing nerve wrecking issues with their phone connectivity.  Specially older models with newer phones.

Unfortunately, in the TLX they got the size right, but the car lacks any fun factor. Way too many buttons to push, no manual transmission option and cheesy faux wood paneling. At least with the old TL and TSX you could opt for no wood. The TSX also came standard with leather, not as nice as the TLs, but better than the fake leather used in the base TLX.

However, when you compare the MSRP of the TLX against similarly equipped German cars, you easily save $20K or more.

There is an issue, however, when starting the call and placing it into drive (or sport mode, etc), upon pressing the gas pedal the car literally does not move for a few seconds...almost as if there is no gas getting to the engine.

When I first began the lease, I was in love with this car. Great highway fuel mileage, very comfortable, love the safety tech, great night visibility with LED headlights, good amount of power, and with the SH-AWD this car is a unstoppable in snow. Seriously, I have never owned a vehicle that performs so well in snow. I leased my TLX due to the Acura's reputation for outstanding reliability. Unfortunately, I have learned that reliability is not one of the TLX's strong suits. The car has been back to the dealerships 3 times within under a year of owning it. Each time with a list of problems. The fuel pump has been replaced already, entire dashboard of car removed to replace the fan blower motor that screeched every time climate control was turned on. The car is pretty quiet going down the road, just making the many rattles within the car even more noticeable. The blind spot monitoring system on the passenger side acts up, and the adaptive cruise control will turn off randomly, not working again until the car is turned off and started again. At random times the heated seats refuse to work until again, the car has been turned off and started again. I was planning to purchase this car after the lease was done, but that is the last thing I would like to do at this point. I am extremely disappointed as this is not the reliability I was expecting from a $45k car, especially an Acura. I am currently working with the dealership to have this car taken back early.",3

I still drove off with a fantastic car for less than $40,000.  I had everything on it I could get.  I really enjoy the lane handling assist.  It turns off after 30 seconds if you don't pay attention, so it makes you drive.  And you can easily over ride it if you want to. Sometimes I""m to lazy to signal for a lane change and just do it.  The LKA nudges me back but my 2 year old grand son could easily over ride the nudge.  It won't pull you back into danger; in fact it won't even make a turn if it is too sharp because of the inertia in the car.  The car is extremely quiet and gets over 30 mpg on the highway most of the time, unless it's below 10 degrees F or unless I'm using a lead foot. Traction in snow (with snow tires) far surpasses anything I've ever owned.  I'm extremely happy with this car.

My fifth Acura.  I was assured by the dealer that, even though I'd read that the 2015 cars were experiencing transmission issues, the problem had been resolved in the 2016 models.  Right away I began experiencing transmission hiccups in lower gears as speed increased.  The car would hesitate significantly, then lurch forward as I increased speed.   Really scary, especially when leaving a rest area or going onto a highway from an on ramp.  Worse, as I braked and then almost came to a stop, the car sometimes jerked forward.  This situation was truly dangerous.  There is a class action filed in California concerning this precise issue.  You should also know that the tech package is really worthless at best and another safety issue at worst.  The brake warning beep and signal as well as the rear assist signal operate completely without regard to whether a car, person, or object is nearby.  The dealer tried to fix these problems twice, once in October and once during the MONTH they had the car in December.  I got it back in January and drove it 45 miles.  During that period, I experienced no fewer than eight of the transmission incidents described above.  I have read that even when the transmission is replaced, the problem hasn't resolved.

Despite some complaints about jerky trans issues with the 2015 V6 9 speed trans,  my 2016 is smooth and issue free, and the FWD Sport and Sport+ mode continue to provide incredible performance when some fun is in order. I even keep it in sport mode all the time given that the MPG is excellent for my short mostly highway commute, and sport or Sport+ keeps the driving fun!! I highly recommend the TLX for any folks shopping in the segment given the great value, cost of ownership and fun driving and acceptable level of luxury with this mid level sport luxury sedan. I find that the vehicle is nearly flawless, and hits that sweet spot of everything I'm looking for without taking out a second mortgage on my house to pay for a new vehicle!!The 3.5 V6 has awesome acceleration in Sport and Sport+ mode, 0-60 in 5.7 seconds. Not surprising given the 290 HP 3.5L V6, what is surprising is the 31MPG combined city/Hwy fuel economy that I am now getting even with car in Sport mode all the time. This car has an extremely quiet cabin and an awesome 10 speaker surround sound system that sounds like a concert hall in your car. I recommend anybody in the market for a midsize luxury sport sedan give this car a drive and compare to any in it's class. It is many thousands less for more and 5 star safety and the Honda/Acura reliability and resale value I can confirm thru years of resales and trade ins with Acura is among the best of any make. It simply cannot be beat for a luxury sport sedan of this caliber and all that you get especially with the Technology package.  Transmission issues reported on the 2015 are non existent on the 2016 and 2017 TLX, Acura upgraded the software and the issues from 2015 are gone, which is why I waited a model year before buying this new TLX vehicle.This is the best luxury sport sedan I have ever owned. The styling is conservative but sharp, the luxury is just what you would want without being over the top, and with Sport+ or Sport mode the 3.5L V6 FWD performance is awesome with documented 0-60 in 5.7 seconds (see zero to sixty website for TLX V6 FWD), it turns on a dime with excellent handling, and with the quietest cabin and smoothest ride you will find. With 5 star NHTSB crash ratings, and IIHS Top Safety Pick+ it is one of the safest vehicles on the road, and with the Tech package collision avoidance warning technology I personally avoided several very close call lane change accidents on my commute to and from work. If you are in the market for a luxury sport sedan and are looking to keep the price at or below 40$K, you will not find a better car in this class as the competitors will charge at least  11- 20 $K more for similar trim levels/options. I am a very pleased happy Acura TLX owner.",5

My car has the white exterior with the gray leather seats.  However, the  interior gets so hot because of the cheap black plastic dashboard and black plastic door trim which consumes a large portion of the interior cabin.   The air conditioner can't compensate for the intense heat buildup when the car is parked outside in the hot Florida sun.  This car has the seats that are supposed to cool and this function really does not help much. My 2009 Acura had  a BEAUTIFUL tan interior and a really good air conditioner that cooled the car so well.   I am so disappointed in the 2016 TLX, that I wish I would have kept my 2009.  The 2016 TLX was purchased for the safety features which are superb, but the car is so uncomfortably hot, that we will consider another brand the next time we purchase.

This is my second Acura and fifth car manufactured by Honda. I have been a loyal Honda customer, had two Accords and a Civic. Loved each one. Then, when my spouses Mercedes C300 4matic got totaled, we decided to try 2013 Acura TSX 4cyl (Tech package), and we were very impressed with it. Car had certain finesse about it, the interior was made of quality materials, it was crafty and had a decent feel about it. Engine and transmission were flawless. So, needless to say that when we received an invitation from Acura to trade in our older TSX for a brand new TLX (for the same monthly leasing price, with zero out of pocket costs, tax, tags, registration included) we were excited and jumped on it. Dealership was great, their customer service and finance department catered to all of our whims. They took off over $5000 off MSRP and we ended up leasing 2016 SH AWD TLX V6 Tech package with literally no cost except the first months leasing payment ($33/mo over TSX tech, but this is AWD, V6, nearly $10K more expensive car). But weren't we disappointed when we got behind the wheel! Yes, there is no way you can buy so many options in a car for $37,000 if you got with BMW, Mercedes or Audi. But at what cost! First of all, let me say it was completely convoluted idea to build a car with ""fuel economy at any cost!"" idea and put a V6 engine on it. If you want to cater to fuel economy crazy consumer why bother to attach 6 cyl engine to it? The end result is completely convoluted, lame, jerky and I should say overall TERRIBLE performance on the road! First of all, this car drives like under-powered 4 cyl and NOT anything like V6. Transmission hesitates and ""thinks"" for good few seconds before it decides what gear it will shift, so God forbid you are on a highway passing a car and a 18 wheeler is quickly approaching you. It will ride all over you and glue you from trunk through your hood before your transmission would even begin to decide what gear it should shift into. I have never had a car with such a horrible transmission. Car just never moves! As if this was not enough of inconvenience, this car will remind you what a foolish choice you have made when you eventually slow down in a traffic without pushing the break pedal. It will jerk and pull forward each time it shifts from one of its' higher gears towards the lower, and oh boys, doesn't that car have plenty of gears! 9 in total! Stay away from this car! Let Acura know that they must live up to the image they have established in earlier years and deliver quality cars as they used, or else we won't buy it from them again! I personally have no intention to touch another Acura once our lease comes to an end. I could live with extremely ugly design of the grill some genius designer came up with once upon a time (just who came up with the idea of putting a beak on it!), but I will not tolerate a car that handles like a dirt truck while claiming to be a luxury vehicle. And please, just because you are targeting certain socioeconomic demographics don't assume we are blind and can't notice how cheap and LOW QUALITY the interior design and quality are. This car has nothing of 2013 TSX , as far as interior design and quality are concerned. And I have said enough of it's drive-train already. In one word: just stay away from TLX.",2

But I did so, sight unseen, because this is my third Acura. I buy them for safety. My first Acura (2009 TSX) was T-boned by a truck into my driver's door: my passengers all walked away and for me, only a few ribs and sternum were cracked from the airbag. The car was a total write-off so I immediately replaced it with a 2014 Acura TSX and leased that for 3 years. Earlier this month, I had to lease a new 2016 Acura TLX because they stopped making the TSX, And I say ""TskTsk"" to that as the TSX is a far superior car vs the TLX. I no longer have the confidence to accelerate out of a situation. The car literally ""lugs"" before it gets going with a noticeable pause and delay. Once it's at highway speed, all is good and the gas mileage is terrific at 35 mpg hwy. The technology package safety features for lane-keep assist, braking, warning of cars in blind spots, etc are all very good. I love the smart wipers which sense moisture and automatically adjust wiping frequency. I'm disappointed in the navigation as you now have to be parked in order to set a destination or change en route. The touch-screen is awkward with a significant time delay and requires an unnecessary number of double-clicks on ""OK"" to advance to the next field when inputting a direction, phone number or song look-up, etc. The driver's seat feels like a cockpit. Very cramped. I'm not that tall (5'9"") yet I have no head room and my legs are cramped. The cup holders are less than 4"" deep and tall coffee thermos or take-out sodas flop around in there. The driver's side mirror has a ""bonus"" feature of a split mirror to show more - all it does is distract and make it difficult to use. All of the mirrors need the warning ""objects are much, much, much closer than they appear"" because the mirrors reflect a significantly greater distance than other cars seem to and this requires some spatial learning and driving practice to adjust to. They removed the tiny storage pockets on both sides of the center dashboard console - too bad! Those were handy for eye glasses, pens and that sort of thing. The engine is much noisier versus the TSX. In fact, in my TSX, people crossing in front of me in parking lots or on the road would not hear my car idling. In contrast, the TLX announces its presence from half a block away ... inside, while driving, you hear this noise too. In the first week of leasing it, I drove my car 1,700 miles on a road trip. My tire was shredded and I had to be towed because Acura no longer includes a spare tire or even a donut. Instead, they provide an emergency repair kit with a sealant (which I blew out trying to fix my tire and each canister costs $65 to replace). Overall, I'm disappointed. Sure, the technology is cool but at what cost? So quality, comfort and ride performance are compromised for some cheap electronics? This is my last Acura!",3

Cabin layout, trunk space, ride comfort, acceleration, etc all done to excellent standards.  However, the LED headlights make this car dangerous for night driving.   Projection down the road in ideal night conditions is at best mediocre.   Rain or snow conditions are downright scary.   The lights have NO sidesplash.  Going around a dark corner is like driving into a sheet of darkness, nothing can be seen until the turn is fully made!   The IIHS has found the same in their ratings and gave the TLX LEDs a poor rating.  Hopefully Honda will be shamed into correcting for the next model year?

The transmission is gets a little confused when starting from a stop in city driving.  The Auto Start/Stop and Econ Mode really help with the gas mileage, you can really tell the difference from the TL in that aspect.  There is also a lot of power hidden in the car as well.  Try sitting a red light, turn off the HVAC system, turn on Sport Plus, and hit the gas when the light turns green.  The SH-AWD eliminates wheel spin and torque steer and you take off like a rocket.  The front seats are very comfortable.  The head unit is a little cumbersome at first but you get use to it.  The Lane Keep Assist is very impressive when using cruise control.  I recently drove from DC to Ocean City, Maryland and got 37 MPG is highway driving in Normal Mode with the A/C on.  I never got that type of gas mileage in either of the TL's I owned previously.  The TLX may not stand out in the day time but at night when you see the Jewel-eye headlights in your rearview mirror then you see the distinctive taillights as it passes, you'll know that's a TLX.  This is an all around good car.  Now for my gripes.  I wish Acura didn't hide the exhaust tips.  The interior fit and finish could be a little better.  My trim piece covering the speaker on the dash board is slightly dislodged.  No doubt I will have the dealer address this during my first scheduled service.  The head unit has trouble managing two separate Bluetooth devices.  I usually use my I-Pod as my Bluetooth Audio Source and my I-Phone 6 as my Bluetooth Phone Source.  The head unit will sometimes get confused and switch these around during start-up without any prompts from me.  The folding exterior mirrors are not easy to fold, it's like they need WD40 or something.  The rain sensing wipers can be too sensitive at times.",4
3101, on 07/14/16 06:38 AM (PDT),Miles Lacus ,2016 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),It's that kind of easy listening thrill," Overall, this is a very nice car.  I like it but don't quite love it, at least yet.  I cross shopped primarily the Mazda 6, Buick Regal turbo, and Honda Accord V6.  I got the TLX with the 2.4L 4-cylinder with 8 speed dual clutch and tech package.   It is a nice, quiet, comfortable, light on its feet 4 door sedan that has a hint of sport and a great audio system.  The TLX won my spreadsheet analysis comparison but hasn't won my heart yet.  I found the 6 and Regal to be sportier and more fun to drive, especially the Regal with the HiPer strut and AWD.  The Accord v6 was a hoot with that sweet v6.  The 6 lost due to aggressive head restraints, a bit more road noise, and it didn't have much top end power.  The Regal lost due to poorer visibility and lower quality interior and switches.  The Accord lost due to aggressive head restraints that gave my wife a headache and the audio system that wasn't up to my audio standards.  For the TLX, my biggest complaint is the transmission mapping.  By 25mph I’m in 5th gear.  Oh my!  I give the car a little gas and it doesn’t do anything.  To do anything it needs to downshift a gear or two.  I always feel like it’s in a gear too high.  Granted, I am coming from a 2007 TSX 6 speed manual that I had for almost 10 years and loved.  That was a nice driver’s car!  Mat Hargett and Bryan Hourt of Acura say this is a red carpet athlete and it’s also like a horse you know well that won’t tire you out.  Well, I do think they are right to a certain degree.  It CAN be sporty if you put it in sport plus and corner carve a bunch of empty curvy streets and keep the revs high and the transmission in a lower gear.  But I’m so far just commuting and I want it to feel more engaging.  If I just relax and drive in a more relaxed manner, it’s more satisfying.  The v6 and SH-AWD v6 version were faster but felt heavier and even less engaging.   My expectations are maybe not in line with today’s auto practices.  My old TSX is nearly 10 years old and things have changed a lot since then.  The move from hydraulic to electric steering, going from double wishbone to strut front suspension, and gas mileage maximizing transmission mapping all take their toll on driving fun and engagement.  In the end it was time for a new car and the TLX 4 cylinder was the overall best, I liked it, and it was in budget.  I was just hoping to love it.",4

I loved it, and ended up buying myself one two weeks later.  For the money this thing is absolutely loaded with features.  Adaptive cruise control, active lane keep assist and the brake hold are great features that make the commute to and from work on a daily basis that much more comfortable.  As others have stated it takes a minute to get the hang of all the controls inside, but once you pick it up they really are quite logical.  You can either use the spin wheel (similar to BMW and Mercedes but up on the dash), or you can use the touch screen to do a lot of things such as navigation and audio.  The stereo is solid and the sub-woofer definitely helps to round it out with solid lows.  Prior to owning the TLX I drove a King Ranch F-150 and I never realized how expensive it was in most cars in this class to get some of the features I have grown accustomed to over time such as air-conditioned seats and remote start.  The Acura TLX provides excellent value for the money and I am really enjoying mine so far.  I would definitely recommend that you check it out if you are looking for a sporty 4-door sedan in the $40,000-$45,000 range.",5

But soon we started finding flaws on the interior craftsmanship. Speakers covers on the rear door have gaps. A discrepancy we didnt expect to find on Acura brand. On the side of the seat the gaps are fine but it's it goes around the corner in front of the seats the gaps get so big they just look ugly. The  cloth covering of the sunroof cover have been trimmed tactlessly. **And to top it all off, at only 2000 miles, the engine started leaking oil from the engine block itself!  We took it to the dealership, Hall Acura and Va Beach. At first they tried to patch it with some kind of bondo material. After I took it home it started leaking again. Took it back and they finally found a pinhole leak through the engine block. I'm going to speculate it was a manufacturing defect.  They replaced the engine block. Its the 2.4 engine.   But we lost our confidence on the car. We bought that car for the primary reason of reliability. And it's not at that standards anymore. So we wanted to turn it back in, or trade it in  for the bigger engine, hoping those are better engines. But Hall Acura Virginia Beach wanted to nickle and dime us for a newer car. And I thought that was an insult to injury. After we already we already suffered from all  the inconveniences.  Hall Acura wanted to give us $7000 less for this car as a trade in. And also wanted the full MSRP on the newer car!. What an insult. I try reasoning with their manager,  but I felt like we were being taken advantage of instead of helping us out.

3107, on 04/25/16 11:11 AM (PDT),indio82 ,2016 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Transmission negates the V6," I currently have an '06 TSX.  It is still in great shape and handles great, but it is 10 years old and I'm looking for something with a little more power.  So I've been eager for the TLX to come out.  So I was severely disappointed when I test drove the V6 AWD version.  The transmission completely neuters to V6 - seriously, it feels  like a really under powered 4 cylinder.  It has no power when you put the pedal down.  It shifts just just when you think you are going to get in the power curve.  My 4 cyl TSX feels more powerful than this V6.  There is NO WAY I would want this driving in rush hour traffic, when you need the car to quickly react when trying pass or merge into highway traffic.   The steering was...weird.  I've test driven the Lexus IS 350 (V6) and the Volvo S60 (5 Cylinder turbo).  They both had better throttle response and steering.  The Volvo has less HP than the TLX per the numbers, but you wouldn't know it due to the TLX transmission.  The cabin controls are overly complicated.  Just because you can put everything on a touch screen, doesn't mean you should.  I shouldn't have to sit with the ""IT specialist"" to learn how to adjust the cabin temp.  The push button shifter was...odd.  I guess you get used to it, but it would take a while - and I shouldn't have to put up with that learning curve.  In summary:  the transmission ruins the car, but the button shifter, steering, and overly complicated cabin/nav/radio controls don't lend itself to liking the car either.  I rejected this car from my list.",2

The styling is classic contemporary.  The cost relative to other cars in the class couldn't be matched.  The only thing I don't love is the touch screen controls for radio and the voice command system is hard to figure out and frustrating.  Other than that I am loving my new car.,5
3109, on 04/22/16 13:44 PM (PDT),Annie ,2016 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Engineers have overcomplicated dashboard controls," This car is drop dead gorgeous from the outside.It rides like a dream at 60 MPH - Simply HATE driving the car at lower speeds. The controls are all STUPID. Who dreamed up putting all of the controls onto an ipad screen that fades out when the sun glares onto the screen? What's wrong with a few knobs? So much easier to locate when driving and trying to keep your eyes on the road. Hate the way the car is programmed to have the seat slide all the waaay baaaack and all the way baack forward agaaaiiin when starting and stopping. Let ME control where I want the seat to be. I'll move it if and when I deem necessary.The beautiful jewel lights...SIMPLY WORTHLESS IN AN AREA WITHOUT STREET LIGHTS. Although I took the car back and made numerous inquiries because I simply cannot see at night, I was assured by the Service Manager that nothing can be done to adjust the lights, and I am awaiting (for over 3 months now) a reply from the Regional Service Manager due to my complaints about the lack of light from the lights. Interestingly, I just tore the bumper off the front of the car backing out of a parking spot and visited a body shop. We got to chatting that the car was so beautiful but the lights were so bad - and he offered to adjust them. Do you know, he adjusted the lights up half way - and they can be raised additionally - while my Service Manager at Open Road Acura insisted they could not be adjusted. This is infuriating!  The front bumper is so lowto the ground - right after my experience yesterday, while driving home I was next to another TLX same year - and the same bumper was torn -coincidence? I am amazed it tore so easily.The visibility - try looking in your side mirrors without becoming seasick - they are curved. So if you move forward orback and continue looking at mirror - the view moves and stretches.  Why??? Why does the air conditioning vent reflectinto the side mirrors - oh wait, they said it was a recall only the day after my purchase. But I've met other owners who were not given the revised ""matte black"" vent instead of the reflective silver version.The bars holding the windshield and windows is so thick that I have to lean forward and then behind the bar in order tomake a turn, because so much of the view is obstructed.  Then, when backing up - the cameras drop to the ground -a warning comes up on the screen that the Driver is responsible for checking behind the vehicle - but the mirrors are on the floor ??? Luckily,  there is an override for this particularly stupid feature.The Navigation is awkward to use and soooooo slow to respond. It probably takes a minute to start up upon starting the cr. It also isn't as accurate as the navigation in my older TL. Several times it has taken me way out of the way and then backtracking numerous times unnecessarily. Just the other night it took me off Route 80 at one particular exit. I drove through the town making numerous turns only to eventually be put back onto Route 80 and exit again two exits later. Why? Note to the Engineers - you don't have to control every aspect of the car for us - some of us would like to control things ourselves.The Safety ""Brake Warning"" comes on at unusual and not braking situations. Driving down a road - nothing in front, andthe warning begins flashing.I've made a complaint to NTSB about the lights, and assure them and anyone else who will listen - I fully expect to be killed in this car.",1

The car is within a whisker of greatness if those responsible for its design would study the competition and take a lesson is usability design.  Sometimes engineers get enamored with themselves .  I should know, I am one.  This car is an unbelievable value at its price point .  I bought it based on that and I don't regret it but it could be the absolute class leader but for a few points:1.  For Petes sakes heat the steering wheel and rear seats.  Comes in the Canadian model.  Is Minnesota warmer than Canada?2.  Please for the love of god sit down with a few customers who have tried to use your cockpit.  It is non intuitive and silly in some respects.  Don't you people ever drive this car?3. I like auto fold mirrors.  So do all the people who buy bmw Audi and Mercedes.  It's stupid but it makes us feel special.  Do it!4.  The nine speed has problems that everybody knows about... Fix it!5. The lane keeping assist and dynamic cruise are good.  Can you stop insisting I move the steering wheel?  Turning it off if I don't seems asinine.  It's like the car is saying "" move the wheel or I will kill us both.""  Also can you make the dynamic less responsive ?  It's like driving with a 16 yo with their first time at the wheel.  Even the GM system is better than this.  Let me repeat .  The GM engineers skunked you on an electronic system!Ok so enough with the negativity.  It's a fantastic vehicle with a fantastic engine and an ok drivetrain.  It is the quietest car I've ever driven.  I use it as my daily highway commuter and I like it a lot.  I got more for my money than any other car I looked at.  You could have the line out the door with just a few relatively minor changes.  Make them!!!",4

This doesn't feel like the quality car I have been used to. The ride used to be much sportier and tight whereas now it feels like you float on the road. The safety features are very unreliable.

Car was totaled and decided to buy a new car between TLX and mazda 6 GT.  I heard the 2015 transmission problem and was told by dealer the problem has fixed.  Searching online found no report on the 2016 model and people talking about the problem has been fixed by updating software (I was wondering if they are hired by acura!!).  I did tested the car I want to buy for 30 min  stop-go many times and noticed nothing (at 65F).  After 400 miles or so the car started to jerk at 0-30 mile/hr at all first 3 gears 80% to time (between 32F to 50F temperature).  Now at 700 miles the car started to jerk when slowing the car from 30 - 0 miles/hr.  What a nightmare to drive the car.  I hope Acura come out a real solution to the issue and fix the problem.,3

Honda Motor Company no doubt.  I have been very disappointed in this car which I got 3 months ago.  It has been in the shop 3 times to fix the rough shifting.  In stop and go traffic it is a nightmare.  The mechanic acknowledged they still have many complaints.  It is a software problem.... With  eight gears it can't always decide which gear to go to.   So far no software to fix it.  I've asked for out of my lease but they say no.  I feel stuck with a $400 a month annoying experience.  If they ever fix the problem it will be a pretty good car but the transmission on the 2016 4 cylinder is not ready for prime time yet.",2

A little history: The vehicle had previously been wrecked leaving the dealership when the teenager driving it rear-ended another car on the freeway.  There was no frame damage and the car was repaired at the Acura dealer back to factory specs.  Since the kid didn't want a car that had been wrecked before and since 'daddy' wrote another check for $50K to buy another new fully loaded TLX, this vehicle was subsequently sold to an independent used car dealer for about 1/2 the MSRP.  Their loss, my gain!This is my 4th Acura and 7th Honda product in recent years and so far I've not been disappointed.  Though Hondas have dominated our car ownership experience, our family has owned various models from Chrysler, Ford, GM, Mercedes and BMW over the years and there's reason we keep going back to Honda. The build quality on this vehicle is excellent by comparison to other models that we've owned, across all manufacturers.  The ride quality is great and the steering feel is good, though still not as good as the 3-series BMW.  The transmission can be a little quirky at times but nothing that's unacceptable. Even though my vehicle was essentially 'new' and I paid almost $15K off MSRP because of the previous wreck, it still would have been a good buy at it's MSRP based on similar cars in the segment with the same features.  Is this car the best in it's segment? No, it's not.  Does it represent the best value in it's segment? Absolutely!",5

Getting in and out is terrible as the reach to close the door is too far and the seats are too low. You can not see the front of the car so parking head-in is just guess work as you never know how close you are to the wall.  The entertainment system is far too complicated and not easy to use.

I could no longer take the road noise on the tlx- my husband and I could hardly have a conversation. The tlx is much quieter- not quiet, but much better.  I was hoping for better gas mileage for a 4 cylinder, 24 mpg  I really like the blind spot warning and the compas / street name at the top of the instrument cluster. The trunk is huge but wish it opened further when poped open. The plastic handle in the trunk for closing is hokey- your supposed to pull it and quickly get your arm out before it hits ya. I like the new headlights but miss the fog lights my tlx had. I was looking for a car that was luxury inside as I drive a lot but wanted good gas mileage and low maintenance expense and am hoping this will be it.

The Acura was more spacious inside, it is wider and there is more headroom.  Very quiet interior and the car seems to float over the road.  No problems whatsoever with the 9 speed transmission.  I understand it just took a software update.  I was bothered by too much road noise in the Lexus and the height/head room is tight (plus no sunglass holder!).  The Mercedes C-300 offers a high quality car.  However I found it small inside, particularly the width.  I really like the Acura's separate screen for the navigation and one for the sound system.  The ELS 10 speaker system with surround is wonderful.  I like to just sit in it and listen to my IPod.  The car has very good acceleration and good gas mileage.  There are more technology features than other similar luxury cars.  Plus it is priced lower than the Lexus and Mercedes C-300.  I highly recommend the Acura TLX, particularly the V-6 ""Advance"" (all the options).  You get much more for the money.  Test drive one, you'll be convinced like me.",5
3128, on 02/10/16 08:00 AM (PST),Zoomn ,2016 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Best Acura/Honda that I've ever owned," This new TLX replaces my 2013 TSX SE. The TSX was a nice enough car with a great interior (tu-tone suede on the SE trim) and a very sporty demeanor. It's negatives outweighed is positives, though, in that it had too choppy of a ride and too much road noise to be truly enjoyable over the long haul. Those shortcomings have long been Acura and Honda traits, but no more! The TLX has a truly quiet and comfortable ride that is well controlled and never truly harsh in any way. The rear steering, or PAW-S, allows compensation for the softer ride in giving back a sharpness to the handling that is equally appreciated. The only weak link in the handling is the stock 17"" touring tires that are stock on the 2.4L models. The V6 that I also drove handled slightly better with it's 18's without any appreciable difference in ride.Other than that and in spite of some weak areas in design, this car is proving to be everything that I could ever want in a sporty daily driver. The 2.4L has a nice snarl under hard acceleration, the 8 speed DCT is responsive and generally very smooth and decisive in its shifts. Again, the balance in ride and handling is quite good, but occasionally floaty over bigger dips at highway speeds. Tech features like standard lane keep assist, blind spot monitoring and cross traffic alert is all above par and works quite well. The same can be said for the Tech package's ELS sound system that delivers crisp, clear sound and incredibly low bass response from the sub. Lastly, the LED headlamps are truly impressive they are to headlights what Halogens were to sealed beams and Xenons were Halogens as they deliver brilliant light for good clarity and increased visibility.The only glaring shortcomings come down to Honda's tech packaging. The dual screen setup doesn't bother me so much as the number of steps needed to complete even simple tasks. Case in point is the seat heaters. You touch the screen and then a second tab pops up to select the level heat that you want. It would be much simpler to touch the screen, default to highest setting and reduce levels and to off by repeating that touch. This repetitive nature is similar for just about everything that you'll do including audio, nav and bluetooth related functions. Lastly, I have noticed a pretty bad lag in responsiveness to inputs at times especially with bluetooth. Honda really needs to address this issue as having driven a number of cars before buying the TLX their system was truly the least user friendly that we encountered. Not a deal breaker, mind you, but still a glaring issue on an otherwise really nice car. Note: Acura and Honda have made a huge improvement in it's infotainment suite for this year that allegedly should address any earlier gripes.So, in closing, the TLX is a great sporty sedan for those that desire a middle of the road approach in a car that delivers equal parts of comfort and handling in a truly impressive package.Update: just over 30,000 miles later and no true complaints, or issues have been experienced. Gas mileage has moved up nicely with one trip to the beach using Eco mode boasting a verified 40.1mpg! Of course, Eco mode is not my preferred mode (my default is sport), but it was cool to see it get that kind of mileage. Overall, still a great car for the money. It will not disappoint whether traveling, commuting, or barnstorming your favorite back road, it will do so with equally impressive ability.",4

Only small criticisms.  The key fob signal will not be detected by the car door or trunk if it is in your pocket with your cell phone.  I often have to take the key fob out of my pocket to get the door to unlock.

3130, on 02/06/16 08:28 AM (PST),Scott ,2016 Acura TLX Sedan SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),No more tranny issues.... now just a great car!," I bought a '16 TLX tech package SH-AWD five weeks ago and since then have put 900 miles on it. At the time I was looking around, there was still plenty of 2015's available that were nicely marked down in price. Hoping to save a few grand, I looked around for the very specific trim package and color combo I wanted an also did all kinds of research. I found that half the reviews were good, and half were bad because of the ZF 9 speed transmission. I was initially disappointed to read so many reviews slamming the car because of it. Understanding that the first model year of any car usually has issues, I considered a 2016 in hopes whatever tranny problems may exist are ironed out. As far as appearance and features go, there is no difference in the 2 model years. I went out and test drove SIX different TLX's (four 2015 and two 2016). The problems many people reported were clunky shifting from gear 2 to 3, downshift hesitation, slow roll take off hesitation, car jerking forward as it downshifts especially when descending down a hill giving the driver the impression the car is speeding up when it should be slowing down. I took special note to almost all the bad reviews saying that the car was fine for the first few hundred miles before it started so one of the 15's I drove was a program car that had 300 miles already on it. What I found was that there is a small learning curve involved with 9 speed transmission but I found no problems with any of the cars I test drove and I was really looking for them. All the upshifts were smooth. Some downshifts required an extra half second to find a gear since it is a 9 speed but nothing crazy like I read some people complaining that they were being put into accident prone situations. While stopped, the start/stop feature which kills the engine does take half a second as well to accelerate because the engine has to turn back on but it is quick doing it all things considered. I'm not sure how much gas it saves in real world but there's nothing gained from sitting still idling either. That feature can be turned off for those who don't like but I find I leave it on unless I'm in a lot of stop and go traffic. Going down a hill is no problem. You can feel the car push forward slightly to downshift wen it engages the clutch and stops engine braking for a split second however it is easy to identify and adds no danger. I don't feel the least bit nervous about it. I felt no difference between the 2015's and '16s. I bought a '16 because I found the black/greystone combination I wanted with the Tech AWD (advance was too expensive and I got the dealer to throw in the remote start anyway). I had the rear lip spoiler and full aero kit put on and the car looks and feels amazing! No tranny issues here. As for everything else, the 4 different driving modes are indeed different. The engine has plenty of power in any of them but eco mode really mutes acceleration response and lightens the steering and suspension a lot. Sport and sport plus mode tightens the steering and suspension (the steering still has a bit of artificial tightening feel when compared to my previous car which handled like a champ, but not a problem at all, just the slightest notice), but the acceleration becomes lighting quick in response and the car is a blast to drive on the highway on the upper end of the RPM range. Forget the paddle shifters with a 9 speed...too much work. If you use one while in sport plus mode, you are stuck continuing to have to use them unless you drop the drive mode to eco or normal. In all other modes, it goes back to full automatic after a few seconds unless you continue to use it. I ignore it but if you like paddle shifters, they do shift well and responsively. MPG's are not as good as listed, I got 247 miles on my first tank in Normal mode and 290 or so on my second tank in ECO mode, driving very easy - it's a 17.5 gallon tank but hey gas is below $2.00. The sound system is absolutely the best stock system I've ever heard - just amazing sound. Haven't figured out yet how to have texts read and replied through the blue tooth but I will be calling the service desk to inquire. Other than that the blue tooth and infotainment is great. Little learning curve with the dual screens but I like them a lot. Acura nailed it with this car!!! Love the looks (subjective I know) and the performance. If you're in the market, do not be put off by the transmission concern, drive a couple and see for yourself, maybe avoid pre-owned or left-over '15s or at least see the build date on the driver side door jam sticker. Anything built after August 2015 should be fine. Go get one, it IS that kind of Thrill !!!!",5
3131, on 01/27/16 04:57 AM (PST),Tom ,2016 Acura TLX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Great Value for comfort and tech features.," 1) It's more comfort/quiet than sporty, more lexus ES then BMW 3 series. If you looking for a comfortable commuter car to make a few aggressive moves, this car will do the job just fine. Plan for an extra second lag time when you hit petal to the metal, unless you are in sport, sport+ mode. 2) more car for the value. Car is almost the size of lexus ES (large midsize), not BMW 3 series (small midsize). It is quiet, It seems to be tune to weed out outside human voice and not so much traffic noise. traffic noise is hush to a very comfortable whisper. You can only hear the wind if you travel faster than 70mph. But not as quiet as top of the line BMW 7 or lexus LS. Road noise mainly through tires. Stock tires are average. You hardly tell the difference between going 50mph vs 100mph unti you look at speeddometer. Technology package really adds a lot of value even though it may not seem like it on paper. Lots of standard features even in the base model (LED headlights, rear view camera, heated seats, side mirrors automatically tilt down when in reverse). 2) Inexpensive, easy to own, premium fuel is recommended but not required. Buy pre-certified, and get benefits of cheaper price but has full new car warranty + 1 additional year. Maintenance is also cheap thus should buy rather than lease, compared to BMW or Mercedes which basically forces you to lease or sell the car once maintenance warranty runs out.3) Lots of technology and features at much cheaper prices compared to the Germans. standard rearview camera. I really like the 3 views camera (no need for parking sensors with a top down view, where you can see exactly how many inches before the bumper hits the other car). I disagree with some professional reviewers, I prefer the dual screen setup, where I can keep the nav map on top and audio/climate on the bottom screen. Blind spot warning lights are on the inside, not on side mirrors like other cars. The Best lane keeping assist system, though I prefer if it work at low speeds also.  Love the automatic record all CDs while you  place in the car. Insert a CD and by the time you listening to the 3rd track, it has recorded the entire CD, so you never have to re-insert the CD again. Back seats fold down. Great night time ambient lighting. Lots of interior storage places.4) Interior is Not quite full luxury experience. Very 2010 luxury feel than 2015-2016. No panoramic sun roof. Clean look, but no contrasting color scheme. Not all panels are leather or wood-like. Some use of soft plastics, hard plastic for the door trays. Lumbar support doesn't have height adjustment. Only highest trim has cooling seats, heated steering wheel,  and puddle lights. Overall TLX is a best value for the features and well rounded car with low maintenance cost.

I bought a 2016 4 cylinder tech. The 8 speed dual clutch on the 4 cylinder is a great transmission. A little rough shifting when very cold, but once it warms up it is a dream.  Heard too many negative things about the 9 speed transmission on the V6 model. The 4 has plenty of pick up and go, but is no race car. It meets my needs. Very quiet cabin, smooth ride. Front tires do spin easily on wet roads, from a stop. I think better tires then the Goodyear standard equipment could help here.  Only issue I have is that I cannot click over to any call waiting calls while on bluetooth.  I have an I phone 6s. My telematics unit may be bad.  Or could be a widespread software issue.

The 260HP engine was ahead of its time and can still keep up with recent models like the Infiniti G35 coupe.  Although the mileage was high, it was an excellent value for under $13K.  I just replaced the front rotors and pads at around 88K miles ($400), and the only other expense I incurred were the four new tires ($650).

The ride is firm enough to make handling very good. I did have the trans. replaced at 53K and plan to change fluid in pan every 10K. I hope that will help.

The interior is what really sets the Acura apart.  Good leather, wood grain plastic, hooks to keep the foot mats in place (the Grand Prix required after-market mats because the factory ones were useless).

I put on it 70k miles in 3 years and the only ""big"" investment has been a set of tires and brakes. Still drives like the day I bought it. Don't intend to sell it. I'll never regret the purchase.",4.625

I get it serviced at scheduled intervals.  Driver's side auto window feature has failed.  Brakes and rotors seem to need replacing more often than normal.  Currently have 95K miles. Repairs so far:  brakes and rotors - twice, auto window control, brake caliper leak, brake & headlights, timing belt... Not too bad in 10 years.",4.375
3266, on 01/25/09 12:03 PM (PST),Ian S. ,1999 Acura CL Coupe 2.3 2dr Coupe,A very reliable but fun car," I bought my 1999 CL 2.3 because I needed something reliable coming from a BMW. Unfortunately, my CL was in poor condition, but I got a great deal on it.  To my surprise, it was in excellent mechanical condition.  A little bit of elbow grease quickly brought its appearance back to life.  The first thing I noticed was the excellent quality of the paint and interior materials.  I couldn't believe how resilient the leather and carpet was.  The paint is beautiful after some heavy buffing and the car looks new after a thorough cleaning!  Mechanically, I have had zero problems. The transmission shifts smooth and engine sounds like new.  I would highly recommend this car.",4.25
3267, on 10/19/08 13:00 PM (PDT),JJ ,1999 Acura CL Coupe 2.3 2dr Coupe,Reliable & Sporty at almost 10 yrs!," I got a '99 CL in '02 as a certified used car, giving up my '91 Prelude. My CL is a step up in size, luxury (leather) and nice power accessories! It doesn't corner as tight as a Prelude, but it's sporty-looking & very reliable. Consumer Reports continues to list it every year as one of its best used car values. Mine has never given me any problems, still has a smooth ride, & feels comfortable and roomy for long trips. I wish there were a 4 cyl. luxury coupe out there now from Honda or Acura to compare to it! Mileage is pretty good-about 28 highway, and mid 20's city.  My CL is almost 10 years old but I won't get rid of it, since there's nothing else in a 4 cyl luxury coupe to compare to it.",4.875
3268, on 10/08/08 00:13 AM (PDT),dmitzah ,1999 Acura CL Coupe 3.0 2dr Coupe,You don't need the bling for luxury," I bought this car private party from the second owner.  Continually maintained by specialist shop.  Low miles for a 9 year old car (87k).  This car is pretty awesome.  It has loads of power to spare, it's super comfortable, takes the bumps pretty well, and it's fairly quiet.  If you drive a lot, this car will take a lot of road wear off YOUR body.  I drive a lot on the freeway, and I don't even feel the effects.  It's a pleasure to drive and has a lot of support in the leather seats.  I'm 6ft tall too, and the backseats aren't too shabby.  Really, if you want luxury or a comfy ride, this car is it and it's priced well.  BMWs, Benz and VWs are good, but you can't beat this price.",4.875
3269, on 08/11/08 12:24 PM (PDT),Wil-Mem ,1999 Acura CL Coupe 3.0 2dr Coupe,Disappointed," My wife loves the car but I'm very disappointed with trans. After driving an '86 Caravan and a '98 Buick LeSabre for over 300k miles each with never a trans service, I was certain this Acura would do the same. Wrong. Now it slipping on up-shift & down-shift. Brake pads & rotors do not hold up well. Had to replace left window roll- up device. Poor mileage for a 3.0L. Drivers seat memory has failed even after the seat motor & other items were replaced by Acura. Steering wheel radio controls correctly operate intermittently. Radio was replaced but did not help the problem. White paint is poor on metal parts but worse on bumpers.",3.625

It's comfortable to drive, looks great, has many great features, gets wonderful mileage (29-30 on the highway on regular).  True, for its age it is is a low mileage car (just a few hundred over 60,000).  No maintenance other than routine.  In nine years we have replaced the tires, battery, alternator, brakes, and recently, the timing belt and water pump.  All of these are routine for a nine year old automobile.  We will drive this car easily another 3 or 4 years, as there is no way we could purchase nearly as fine a car for its current fair market value.  This was a great buy for us.",4.75

It handles great on the open road and the Vtech has plenty of punch when you need it. This is our second Acura and the reason is their reliability. My Integra is ready to turn the odometer again and it still runs like a top. I do my own maintenence and these cars are easy to work on. The only problem with both cars is the radiator going bad but they are easy and cheap to replace. It doesn't cost 300 bucks to change the plugs either. By the way, the CL was designed and built in Ohio for those who think it's an import and women really dig it.",4.75
3274, on 09/16/07 20:08 PM (PDT),ScorpioEddie84 ,1999 Acura CL Coupe 3.0 2dr Coupe,Nice car," I bought this car around 4/07 from a private owner with 100k on it. They were the original owners and kept the car up well. I like this car a lot and wish Acura would bring it back (currently they have no 2-door cars available). But anyway, so far this car has treated me pretty well and is fun to drive. Only strange thing that has happened is the brake light in the dash... it will not go off sometimes when I start up the car even though the emergency brake is comletely off. The light usually goes out once it has been driven a few minutes. Also the cruise- control light sometimes does not light up at night. I assume it is very minor electrical stuff to blame for both.",4.625

For $17K I bought a car with 19K on it, which has leather and heated seats, a spoiler, good acceleration, a moonroof, fantastic reliability, and holds its value.  No other car has this combination for that kind of price.  To think that I could have bought a new boring Corolla for the same price!  It's so reliable that I did waste the extra $800 I paid for an extended warranty.  I put in 64K miles on it.  Only problem was an alternator that had to be replaced after it suddenly died on me.  Not one other thing went bad. ",4.75

I have had no issues with my car except that I had to get a new alternator in 2005. My mechanic says he has seen people bring this car in well into the 200k mile range with no major issues.  I love the power behind this car. The car is nimble & quick which has saved me from accidents in difficult DC area traffic.  The acceleration is great.  I used to date a car enthusiast who told me this car has such great guts that many buy these cars and soup them up for racing purposes.  I plan to keep this car forever.,4.75

The A/C is stuck on though and wish it didn't have digital temperature controls because there is no way of turning it off.  We have only had to replace the motor in the drivers window and the timing belt (normal maintenance though for a car with more than 100k).

Acceleration, brakes, interior quietness, road handling) ... the Altima couldn't touch my Acura. Every time I go in for service at the Acura dealer ...

3317, on 05/01/15 16:36 PM (PDT),hondalover41 ,1997 Acura CL Coupe 3.0 2dr Coupe,My beloved CL 3.0," I sold my Acura CL 3.0 in March of 2015 to buy the new more practical Honda CRV EX-L. I bought this car new in 1997 and didn't realize how much I would grow to loved it, until it was gone. At 198,500 miles and 18+ years it was time because I felt it was becoming less dependable, and much bigger repair bills were on the way. The day I bought it I walked into Acura to buy the 4 cylinder 2.2 CL with cloth seats, and drove away with the much more powerful six cylinder 3.0 CL, with heated leather seats, lots of other goodies, and the super cool alloy wheels. It was a blast, and I'm so glad I did it. Best looking interior I have ever seen in a car. Even now! Great job Acura &Honda.I still see this car around town from time to time. They guy who bought it from my mechanic loves it, but he doesn't take care of it like I did.  The last time saw it parked on the street, I had never seen it so dirty.  Today I am still glad that I went out and bought the new 2015 Honda CRV.  It makes a lot more sense for me in this time of my life.  BUT.......... if then I had extra parking space the  old Acura it would probably be sitting in it, right next to my new Honda CRV.I hope I never miss another car like I did this one!As of November of 2017 I still miss my old Acura but I do find the CRV be be very practical in many other ways. Even though it only has 15 less horsepower, it does not have near the get up and go of the old sexy beast.",5

The previous owner abused this car and I'm currently in the process of getting it back to its former glory. Fun to drive, absolutely amazing sound system, decent on gas, decently quick, there's just so much to this car. But my favorite thing I discovered today. I was in an accident. A reckless driver rear ended me, I was at a stop, he was doing about 40mph. I drove away in that car. There's very little damage, more damage was done to his 2012 accord. The doctor at the ER said I should be in much worse shape but I'm fine. I don't know what that car's made of, but I fell in love all over again.

The previous owner made some modifications (adjusted shifting, 18 in. rims, huge air intake, ) and it made the car so much livelier. the best part is starting the car... actually driving it is a dream the engine is a bit sluggish in the lower speeds but the car puts the driver in total control around 60 mph.

Ive seen many reports of 97 models still running great in the 300k+ range. Its been as trouble free as our 2002 Accord. Replaced window motor, and brakes once. It has the reliability of any typical Honda, the luxury of a Lexus, the comfort of a lazy-boy and plenty of power, which we all like. The seats are roomy, and 2 adults can sit in the back without being too cramped. The Bose sound system has a decent quality sound. The 200 HP Vtech is fast and fun to drive but stepping on the pedal comes at a price. Unlike the Accords and Civics, it doesn't have the best MPG.",4.375

I can't believe I got all these option in one package. Engine's good. AC, power seats, sunroof, ABS, radio all work great. Plus it's great on gas. It doesn't corner like an Audi or a VW but close. Has lotsa room and is built tight. VTEC engine performs great and literally sips gas. Why didn't I discover Acuras sooner?  Only thing I changed was a ball joint. You can pick these CL's up now for about 2grand and you wont be disappointed. It's a mixture of luxury and performance. It's not a Beemer but is much better than an Accord.

I like how even now, in 2006-2007, I still get compliments telling me how nice my car is, even though it is nearly 10 years old. The styling is hate it or love it and I absolutely love it.

Acura says it will take time to find the leak ($105 an hour just to diagnose and see where the leak is coming from). The 2003 automatic CLs are also known for transmission problems.

It handles great but the suspension isn't too rough for daily driving. The Honda-made J32 engine is extremely reliable and should last for many more years to come.

There is enough room for two adults in the back but I would advise against it. The performance is adequate. Compared to the cars available in 2004 it is lacking. However if you know anything about GS-Rs you know that the B18C has more than enough aftermarket support. The year 2000 is when honda/acura switched to OBD-II version 2.

The 1.8L VTEC truly is one of the finest engines ever. Tons of revs, lots of high end power, usable torque, good exhaust note and excellent fuel economy (35 mpg on the highway).  My paint was black and as long as you kept it clean and waxed it once a year, there were few cars that looked better. I loved that it came with a spoiler, something that has eluded many cars I have owned before and after this one. The shifter of course was precise, smooth and near effortless.

It has been extremely reliable, fun, and great gas mileage.  It doesn't have a lot of power off the line, but the V-TEC kicks in around 3500 and you feel it!  The back is very limited in leg room, but you can fit 2 (short) adults in back in a pinch.  I have done regular maintenance, and the only thing that has failed on the car was a cracked radiator (driving from Phoenix to Tucson in July).

3782, on 10/31/15 09:12 AM (PDT),Cathy H ,1997 Acura Integra Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,"Like me, this little car does not show its age"," I am the second owner of my 1997 Acura Integra LS. People are shocked to learn it is nearly 20 years old. The mileage is creeping up there (just like me)and I have kept up with all the regular maintenance like timing belt and exhaust replacements when needed just like I would check and maintain my own health issues as I get older and I am in pretty good shape for my age. So is my Integra.  I have had noooooooo major problems and none that you wouldn't expect from an older car. Another amazing phenomenon is that it has been just the last year it has just started to rust a little around the wheel wells but I live in the northeast and I expected a whole lot more than what it is. Kind of like my wrinkles. It rides and travels beautifully and the gas mileage on this little girl is unbelievable!! I get about 36 or 37 MPG on the highway. The other thing I like about the Integra is that there are very few blind spots around the car, unlike a lot of newer model cars. The Integra handles really well on snowy roads but not so good on ice (what vehicle does?) It sits low to the ground so if there is a major snowfall you have to tuck yourself in after the first few inches are on the roads until the road crews get out to plow. That hasn't been an inconvenience for me at all. The one ""negative"" I would have to include is the headlights. High beam on this car is less quality than low beam on most newer cars and the radius of the lighting area is not the best. If you are travelling in an area where there is a risk of large animals wandering onto the road, this could be a concern because you can't see them along side the road very well. This is such an awesome car I would recommend it to anyone who wants a classy vehicle that is economical and lasts a long time, just like some of us classy older models from the 60's.  : )",5

After 10 years all systems, 5-speed transmission, engine + components, shocks, electricals are still working smoothly. Never in the shop except for state inspection and routine oil change, tire installation, etc. I'm continually amazed it uses virtually no oil. Though it doesn't look like a sports car, it acts like one, with excellent acceleration (especially when the v-tech kicks in) with quick-response precise handling and excellent match of transmission + engine.

Haven't had any engine problems besides the stock radiator that gave up on me, which was about the right time it should wear down; 120k.  Clutch still grabs hard and flywheel revs up faster than most other sport cars I've driven.  Comes with 15 in wheels and larger brake rotors than the 94-97 models which is another bonus.

Great on gas, I've never paid more then $15.50 to fill from ""E"", and I usually only fill up once a week. Simply put, it's quick, handles great, inexpensive, reliable, loaded, fuel efficient, and fun to drive. Why buy anything else?",5

Knew I'd buy it on the test drive.  Had a '99 Mercedes S320 for a lot of years and took it to 180,000 but paid the price along the way.  The mechanics that looked at the Acura were amazed at how it ran and performed after all the miles and no issues at all.  Plan on driving it to 400000.",4.875

Still to this day there is not one rattle or anything on the inside.  I have always heard that Honda/Acura is a step above the rest.  After owning one for about a year I couldn't agree more.

I live in the DC metro area and you need to be able to get into traffic on the beltways and highways fast. This car has the power to do it. The comfort is nicer that some of the Mercedes I've been in and when I test drove the Acura it was up against a Volvo and a Lexus. The Acura won hands down. There was no contest. My only complaint so far was a $650 repair bill for replacing the motor of a rear window. The parts were almost $400. Seems just a little excessive.,4.625

Its pretty much clicking ""option all"".. Standard. Its a tank in the snow, literally. Brakes are amazing, but because of the weight, braking takes some getting used to. Stereo is amazing, couple with the quiet, smooth ride. This car went for roughly 47k 10yrs ago, I can see why. Only have the oil changed routinely. Other then that, no real ""cost"" to own and maintain. Not to mention the awd is amazing so this car only needs all seasons. As for""performance"". Its sports ""luxury"", not a race car.

The Navigation system, although archaic compared to later model Acuras, is simple to operate and precise. Although the fuel economy isn't great, it's very comparable to other sedans in it's class.

All parts are expensive and you really need to have it repaired by the dealership because most of the shops do not understand how to work on them correctly.  The front end pulls and I have had it aligned 3 times.  Again the dealership needs to be the one doing it or your wasting your money.  The valves also need adjustment at 110k  that will cost 400.00.

As soon as you get behind the wheel you instantly recognize the quality that was put into this car. The ride is very smooth. I replaced the tires with Bridgestone Turanza LS-V's which greatly improved the ride and reduced road noise. I have not had to put a penny into the car other than normal maintenance (and the tires). At 79,000 miles there isn't a squeak or rattle, it as tight as it was new. The engine is powerful enough for the car but not as powerful as it's competition in this class. Gas mileage is not great.

The stock tires were not good in snow, so I bought snow tires and put them on dedicated rims, and wow! The car is amazing in the snow. It's also a heavy car, so it holds tight to the road, like it's on rails. Is quiet and responsive but not demanding. A few minor issues: Chrome on the grill is peeling, which I see on all RLs of that year in our area. Acura had the brass to tell me the ""solution"" is to wipe down the chrome with a towel after every rain and snow! How about taking some responsibility, Acura!? Also, keyless entry door handle needed replacement, which is a common problem. ",5

For example, corners as if on rails but preserves quiet, comfortable ride. The engine is smooth and quiet around town but makes operatic noises at the top of the rev range. This is the perfect luxury car for with enough confidence to eschew driving a visible status symbol. I drove Audis before they went upscale to compete directly with Mercedes and BMW.

Before I purchased it, I searched the market well.  For about $50K Mercedes/BMW/Audi were some offering their stripped versions. If you own the top of the line luxury car, your dealer treats you like a king for maintenance calls (your loaner there if need be).  One thing was bad about these sports cars, they are so low. Even cement divider on parking lots touches your fender if you are not careful. Tires are so expensive (PAX system).  If you damage it, prepare to pay $500 per tire change.",4.625

Although the M35 might be slightly faster off the line I felt more comfortable in the RL driver's seat and was surprised by the sporty/firm suspension. The M35 may also win the looks category but the RL dresses up nicely with the factory flaps and spoiler. Having owned an Infinity and a Honda/Acura previously, I expect the RL to be more reliable and less costly to service. What really swayed my decision to the RL was after negotiating on both cars, the 2008 RL ended up thousands less than the M35. After a couple thousand miles, I am extremely happy with the RL.",5

I bought the car with 130k miles on it 3 years ago and i've driven it as if mileage didnt matter going from state to state. The only problems I've had so far: I had to replace a pulley (which was really random!) and i recently had to replace the altenator. Other than that all i've had was routine maintenance that wasnt luxury car expensive.. it was honda accord expensive. I probably wouldnt buy another one but I am happy with my purchase.

Major issues, basically had to rebuild the top half of the engine. I got it done and off I went. Next came the transmission.... I could stop at a stop sign and not be able to engage the transmission anymore, I was dead in the water... Only had reverse. So once we got it to the mechanic he said that a piece broke off my radiator, there was radiator fluid and engine oil in the transmission, and tranny oil and engine oil in the radiator. Boom!

It has all the tech gizmo's except Collision Mitigation Braking System and Michelin Run Flat tires (which you don't want!).  I haven't owned the car long enough to give credible Reliability ratings, but I am very impressed with the car's handling, brakes, ""solid"" feel, quiet interior, sound system and navigation system.  A warning I should pass on to potential buyers is to test drive the care and beware of a speed dependent whistling noise (sort of like blowing over a empty coke bottle).  It starts about 32 MPH and quits about 38-40 MPH.  Being a harmonic, I suspect it would also reappear and disappear at twice those speeds, too.  The RL I bought exhibited this noise on the test drive and I insisted it be fixed in order for me to buy the car.  It turned out to be a fairly expensive repair.  The noise is caused by a bad center carrier bearing on the rear driveshaft.  This normally wouldn't be an expensive repair, but Acura only sells this bearing as part of the entire rear driveshaft assembly and that assembly retails for $2,229!  (If you are facing this repair, you can get one online for $1,500 or so.)  Attention Acura engineers!!!  If you read these reviews how about designing a driveshaft assembly that has mechanic-friendly easily replaced components?  Your driveshaft is carbon fiber and ought to last for centuries, but bearings do go bad and ought to be easily replaceable.  If I hadn't insisted on this fix before purchasing the car, and had to pay for this out of pocket, I would have been very upset.",5

Many comments about lack of low-end torque/need for V8; I disagree, the RL has acceptable power but lack of road noise and handling give the impression you are traveling slower than you actually are.

I found the GS extremely comfortable, quiet, and with solid build quality.   But I wouldn't go back to that because it was just a bore to drive.  Now to the RL.  I could care less that this looks or is often mistaken for a Honda Accord.  I'll readily admit Acura doesn't have the prestige factor of a Lexus or Audi, both of which I've owned.  It's not why I buy cars.  The RL is really a hidden gem, a sleeper of sorts.   It might not look special, it might not be the fastest, most luxurious nor the best driving car. It ccomplishes what I both need and desire in a car - AWD  (sh-awd is no gimic, this system should be the AWD standard.  I've owned a few Audi's  and while Quattro is great in its own right especially in snow, Honda has something great in SH-AWD), reliability, sportier driving dynamics, luxury features, decent style in/out (nothing flashy, not overstyled, something that will age well, which conservative styling typically achieves)  And honestly, I think it's a great looking car.  There are a couple things I'd change which I know Acura has in newer models.  The 5 speed tranny is slow to shift in manual mode.  It also seems more geared toward fuel economy over sport, which I'd get but the fuel economy isn't the greatest.  There are bigger cars with V8's that get better mileage.    I don't like that I have to switch to a different menu to control the climate.  The voice commands are helpful but not always practical (like if a passenger is trying to sleep)",5

Car is very reliable and comfortable for long rides. This is the car you can take for skiing trip in the winter and feel safe during any weather. Its 5 years old now, but i still get compliments how nice it looks. Mine is blue metal, tinted. I drove my roommates Mercedes E550 many times, and RL is very similar to E550.

Acura rl was the answer. Its interior is beautiful and comfortable. I wasn't impressed by exterior first but it keeps growing on me. Navigation system is the best so far. My wife and baby daughter love back seat sunshades. It doesn't drive like a BMW but its awd really works. The cabin is Lexus- quiet and stereo sound is the best I ever heard. RL's unpopularity, price is more reasonable which was good for me. Unfortunately, fuel economy is pretty bad in city. For luxury used car for a price, rl just can't be beat.

When you go into turns you really just have to push it and let the computers take over which is a bit unnerving at first, but you can really feel it pivot as the car overdrives the outside wheels. The dash is controls are very easy to use and pretty intuitive and I love that everything can be done through the Navigation screen which is large, easy to read and sits high in the dashboard.

Even better all the technology works and is easy to use. This is vastly different than so many of the other cars in its class. The BMW and Mercedes NAV Systems are hard to use and inferior, the Lexus GS has no back seat or trunk space, and the AWD puts all of them in the shade. It is a quality car for the real world, not a special use vehicle that can only be used part time for some things.

I was sick of the repair bills on the Benz ($500 to fix a outside mirror motor!), and so far, the RL has been without fault.  I miss the torque of a V8, but I appreciate the improved fuel-economy, and for 90% of driving, the RL has plenty of power.  However, if they had offered a larger version of this car with a V8, I would have bought that.  One of the biggest reasons I bought this car is price.

I give the credit to the RL - driving is not work in this car.  Technology is awesome.  Navigation system has been on the mark 100% of the time.    Have 10000 miles without a glich.  Last car, 2003 Volvo XC70, had 3 visits to dealer by now.  Trunk a bit small and kids (3) wish for a little more width in back seat.  Highly recommend it.",4.75

However, the new 05 RL has so many improvements that I do not know where to begin. The best feature with the biggest difference that I have found is the ALL - WHEEL drive; very necessary if you live in the New England area. Not having all wheel drive would have been my only reason for looking at another brand of automobile. I get approximately 19 to 20 miles per gallon average with the 300 hp engine.

I come out of the sports car group of guys but I bought this for highway use and in town business use. It's a great sedan, not a great sports car. I was bolting through town tonight at about 65mph and the thing was surrealisticaly quiet. Beautiful, really good handling, tight, deliberate, but quiet. I like it. I bought the black. It's beautiful. The onboard system, if you like that kind of thing, and thats an important question, the systems are by far the best ever.

The interior is amazing, I love the wood and the leather.  The exterior-  the front could have been better, the rear is great. The 18"" chome wheels made a huge difference as did the rear deck spoiler. One of the best stock audio systems I have heard, no need for an iPod connection as it will play MP3 CD-R's (about 120 songs per disk) and they sound great. Navi voice commands work great, the traffic is sometimes not accurate, but I am sure will get better.

While each model had it's pluses and minuses, the combination of price, features, and prior experience with the reliability of the RL made it an unbeatable combination.   As with the first year of any new model, I certainly was in the break-in phase for much of the electronics.  Lots of little glitches with OnStar, Navigation, and XM Radio, but they were all minor annoyances.

The styling is great, the interior is 1st rate and the amenities are top notch, i.e., the steering wheel tilts up when the engine is turned off to allow free access out of the car. Although the city gas mileage is not great (I get about 22mpg freeway driving), I know it's because I have heavy foot and demand performance from my vehicles.  When I hit the gas to go around a suddenly braking car in front of me I need my car to respond and the RL does, admirable.

As a result the RL's sales were slow. I have always liked the styling of the then current Accord, which the RL closely resembles, however again when setting out to make a luxury flagship it would have behooved Honda not to make it resemble it's volume selling family sedan.  If you bought one new, because of it's rather anonymous position in the luxury field, you may find yourself singing the ""depreciation blues"" as the RL depreciated much faster than the Accord simply because of lack of name recognition.  For those buying one used, they were getting an incredible deal, as most RLs appeared on the market priced not too much higher than Accord, for a car that cost of maintenance is comparable to any Honda and built and appointed much like a Mercedes-Benz.  I bought my RL used with about 119,000 miles on the odometer and it was like buying a new car.  Everything worked as it should, no leaks, the interior holds up well as does the paint.  Mine now has 150,000 miles and still feels like a new car.  As I need a car simply to be enjoyable to drive, be comfortable and reliable, this one cannot be beat.  Whenever a low mileage example shows up on the used market, I am tempted to purchase it to have when this one wears out. I change the oil using Mobile 1 high mileage synthetic and treat it well.  There is a small spot of rust showing up on the rear quarter, but this seems to be common among Hondas of this era, so I am not to worried.  Given all the Hondas and Acuras of this age and older that are still in daily use, I feel me and my RL will travel many miles together.",5

I have a fairly long commute and am quite pleased with the low-mileage 04 RL that I bought this fall. Some say the Acura has ""no soul."" Nonsense. If ""no soul"" means ""car stays out of the shop"" then I'll take it.  Steady 21 MPG in mixed driving. Reliable as the day is long. Not the most exciting car I've owned but quiet, comfortable and a great value. Build quality is exceptional - tight, and all seams and panel gaps are very well done. Car mags hated this car new, suppose it wasn't such a great value at $40K+ brand new, but in the used market its a great value.",4.625

Nothing seriously has ever gone wrong: One driving light and one horn in all these years. The ride and comfort of the RL is outstanding. I get much better mileage than reported here, circa 24/27. Yeah, parts are expensive, but if nothing ever goes wrong, who cares? They're not much to look at, but I spend my time driving it, not looking at it. If you can get one of these used, go for it.

Biggest fault... no EQ (excitement quotient) when driving the RL.  Enter 2009 RL. Love or hate the looks that's your decision. I love this car.

If you are looking at this class, test the RL.  Improved low end torque is a big plus vs. 08 model.  Not as fast off the line as the 535, but as fast as the rest.  Sports mode helps with initial acceleration, but not necessary after that.  Quiet smooth ride.  Not as noisy or bumpy as the GS and doesn't feel like a big boat like the M-35.

Like the kool wheels. This car is nice. Except it needs a keyless entry and ignition.  Acura really dropped the ball here.  Most luxury cars in year 2012 have this feature.    Also, arm rest for driver could reach forward a bit further.Leather feels so thin, it appears to be vinyl. Ive been assured it is indeed genuine leather, but gee, not like the leather they used to put on cars!Glad i got the 6 sp standard transmission, fun to drive.   Trunk space seems small, compared to Honda accord.  Also, no pass thru from trunk, into rear seats.   Other features are ok.   But for the price, Acura dropped the ball on a few key items.  Hate the sight lines- we had to remove rear head rests to better view put the back. The car sits low and it is hard to see outnthe windows. Honda Accord and CRV had far superior sight lines.  Also, arm rest does not extend far enough for driver to rest arm on it while driving- bad design.  Why is gear knob covered in metal? This gets too hot in smmer sun, and too cold in winter freeze, making it v uncomfortable to touch, 80% of time-- Bad design, again. We switched it out for a leather gear shift cover.  C'mon Acura, devil is in the  details.    Acura missed the boat in several areas of detail on this car!Also, im NOT USING PREMIUM GAS, despite the recommendation by Acura to do so.  After 3 years and 30,000 mi., it seems to be doing fine on regular gas.   ANY OPINIONS ON THIS?   Let me hear your thoughts.Thank you ,AnnUPDATE-- still using regular gas, not premium.

I read the reviews and was aware of it before I made the purchase so it does overwhelm me. And like some others the white paint is a chore the keep clean. Every bug and tree dropping takes more work the normal to wash off.I still find the car a delight and pleasure to drive. it fits me perfectly. Still am not sure if the problem with paint is the pigment or the clear coat. It just seems to hold dirt and any color leaf stains like a magnet.

The reliability is just great as it is a Honda. This engine is bullet proof, one of Hondas best engines. I have seen 250K on these cars and they still drive great. Great Sound system, HID lights and Very comfortable seats!This car is a hidden gem. You hardly see any on the roads, most people dont know about this brand and model that Honda has produced for its europe market but rebranded as Acura for the USA.

Of course, you have to know how to hit the accelerator, and I've lived long enough to do that. There are a few minor things that are less than perfect. The location of controls on the steering wheel could be better. The door does not always stay open in the half-open position.

It has the most balanced handling of any front drive car I have ever driven.  You can almost throttle steer it through a corner.  The engine revs like a Ferrari V8, and the car feels much faster than the numbers indicate. The 2006-2008 cars have a markedly improved performance due to a larger throttle body and intake system, and the updated front/rear fascia and rocker covers make it look substantially sportier.

Took some getting use to, to say the least!  The Bluetooth is cool, but limited.  People complain a lot that they can't hear us (and I'm a loud guy).  All in all, a great car for the price!

The safety features are what I liked best as my wife was able to walk away with a bruised knee from an accident where someone hit her head-on at 40 mph while she was stationary.

As a serious car buff i searched long and hard for a good car to purchase that i could take to college. Factors included attractiveness, performance, gas mileage, comfort, resale value, MSRP, and expected yearly cost including gas. The TSX has filled its position nicely, performing and driving better than my girlfriend's 2009 model. My notes are as follows; allow a break in period as it is required to get to peak performance, 65-70 on a flat trip you will get well over 30 mpg, the car does turn heads, the leather on the seats creases easily, the kick plates will chip quickly, and it is well worth it to add a cold air intake.",4.5

So far after almost 6 months I am not disappointed.  This car is fun to drive and sporty, yet still gets awesome mileage (I have gotten mid 30s on pure highway).  Commuting mileage is OK and can get mid 20s.  For the price you get so many features found in many higher level models.  Audio is OK, but not the car's high point.  However almost all the features can be found on the new 8th gen Accord (minus HID headlights and bluetooth phone), in a much bigger but more powerful car.   Above all, this car is a Honda.  Dependable, great resale value, laundry list of standard features. ",4.75

It may only have 205-hp and a 4-cylinder, but the power delivery is so smooth and the revs come so quickly that it feels quick none the less.  It'll never win you pink slips, but it will certainly move you on the back roads.  It's not RWD, but it still feels supple and balanced.  Steering is too heavy for the Camry crowd, but enthusiasts will appreciate the extra weight and feel.  The 6-speed and clutch are so slick and easy to use that the car is easy to wring out when the desire arises (or every time you drive it).  The interior build quality is excellent, though the sound system is flat.  Never liked Hondas before; the TSX's Euro-breeding fixed that",4.25

The 08 car has a lot more bells and whistles than the 04 version and I love it.  The biggest downside to this car is the underpowered engine.

After a couple of days of haggling my TSX was shipped from Lexington.  This is about the 10th Honda/Acura that I have owned and the TSX has the least peppiest motor of them all.  My salesperson described the TSX as an Accord on steroids and I would have to say that the statement is accurate.  Acceleration is boring but the rest of the car fits me perfectly.

Besides driving excellent, this car has all the extras (standard) that you would want. My favorites are the Bluetooth and auxiliary input for your iPod.

And this Accord is not the same as the one my dad used to drive. Acceleration is good and feels fantastic when you down shift and mash the gas pedal. Just keep the rpm above 5K and it will keep you smiling. If you want to pass someone in a hurry doing 70 in 6th gear, forget about down shifting to 5th or 4th. Just go straight to 3rd gear open it up and feel the rush as the bigger cam kicks in at close to 6000 rpm all the way to the redline. It doesn't sound/feel harsh at high rpm. Handling is best part of TSX. Being 4 cyclinder makes TSX handle better than cars with bigger engines, and I'll take better handling over extra torque anyday.",4.625

That said, it is fun to drive and no other car comes close to standard features for the price. Interior of the car is well designed and well made.  Everything is well placed and comfortable except the station knob for XM radio.

It is not going to throw your head back when bearing down on the accelerator, but it is peppy enough for almost any situation.And the gas mileage is quite good.Close to mid 30's highway.

It's not  necessarily ""sporty"" compared to actual sports cars. It has stone hard economy tires and a soft luxury suspension.  So take it for what it's worth or upgrade your tires and suspension.

Compared to the other three models, the TSX offered all the creature comforts I wanted for 6K less than the G35 and Lexus and 10K less than the 328i.  Really easy choice to make, even after driving the other three cars twice each.  While the TSX doesn't have the speed and pick-up of the BMW or the Infinity, the engine is more than adequate for my style of driving (mostly city with some road trips now and then).

I had a TL before, but love this new car.  The handling is peppy, yet not too much like other competitors such as a g35.  The interior is easy on the eyes and all of the controls are extremely easy to use.  The back seat is small, yet the seats fold down to make a more-than-large trunk for this car size.  Handling is stiff, but not quite a BMW.  The exterior is due for a redesign, but this car's current body style is what makes it so classy.  (Not saying a few upgrades wouldn't help!)",4.875

It rides similar to my wife's 2006 Honda Accord but holds tighter through the turns and is more fun to drive.  There is a little less room in the back than the Accord, but the front and the trunk space seems very comparable.  The design is becoming a little dated and the redesign should be coming out some time in late 2008.  If you love Hondas but want a little more luxury, then Acura is the way to go.

I've had this 06 TSX for 13 months and it is a disappointent compared with my first. Performance, looks, and features are good. The issues are with the multitude of rattles and squeaks that developed within 6 months in the interior and the ineffectual wiper system on the driver side which the dealer can't seem to address (fluid dribbles onto the windshield and wipers - new and old - only smudge and smear, they do not clear very well at all).

You cannot beat what comes standard on the TSX for the price.  Leather, bluetooth, 360 watt stereo (XM, 6 CD changer), heated seats with memory, sunroof.  On top of all this, the TSX is extremely fun to drive and very agile. This car wants to be pushed to the limit and it eagerly responds. Note this is a sport sedan not a luxury car that floats on the road like grandpa's Lincoln. MPG is OK, average around 24 in mix driving and around 30 on the highway.

I have a short commute, and otherwise drive almost exclusively around Jacksonville, FL. My mileage is a consistent 22 mpg, meaning mixed highway/suburban driving.  I might get better if I laid off of the gas pedal, but it's fun to push it. Being an auto, you have to get it in the right gear, but it has the power to pull ahead when I need to.

Only downsides - premium fuel, just like any performance engine, and the 2.4L inline 4 loses a bit of its punch with the AC running, but compensates at higher RPM.

I commute about 100 miles a day mostly highway miles and find the gas mileage acceptable, >30 mpg. Seems 66 mph is the sweet spot for best mpg on the highway.

The car is great, definitely a good and reasonable investment.  I was willing to give up the performance for fuel economy.

The price was very reasonable and the amount of standard features were amazing to say the least. I could not have bought a better car for a better price, simply put. The handling is a dream come true and in Bakersfield heated seats in the winter are a must. The duel climate control tailors itself to any temperature I desire. The powerful yet efficient 205 horse power engine provides the perfect balance of torque and fuel mileage. I would suggest the 07 Acura TSX to any one looking for a luxury car that outperforms bmw and mercedes with the price tag not much more than a honda accord.",5

Bought it with 8K miles on it from it's first owner (Exec car). this car has been a great reliable car so far. No big issues but one small issue. There is an electrical problem which keeps on draining my battery life year after year. I've had the battery changed numerous times, the alternator changed twice and still no one seems to know what's happening. Went to the dealer and no one knows whats the issue. I guess I will have to find the electrical issue myself. Other than that repeated issue the engine, transmission, interior buttons, everything works perfect for a 10 year old car. This has been the most reliable car I'ver ever owned to the extent that I don't know how to get rid of it to get something new, it just too good for the price. I would recommend to buy it, but beware of electrical issues overall.",4
4603, on 02/27/18 00:21 AM (PST),TL ,2010 Acura TSX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 5A),Most Balance Sedan On The Road!!!," Folks this is perhaps one of the most balance sedan on the road in terms of power, balance and economical.  For  those asking for a V6, you really do not appreciate Acura engineering of the the K24 motor for this vehicle.  Aside from the Honda S2000, how many four cylinders naturally aspirated engine that pumps out over 200 horses you're aware of?  Not many.  That's  the beauty of this vehicle.  Acura is able to squeeze every last bit of horse power (they can certainly do more) from the 2.4 four cylinders to give this Acura TSX it's wonderful performance and yet economical at the same time.  When equipped with the manual transmission, the TSX may reach 0 - 60 mile in under 7 second.  That's nothing to brag about, however when you get over 30 miles to a gallon doing so is indeed special.  I've tested the V6 and really aside from the extra pickup you get, it really kill the dynamic and balance of the TSX.  The TSX is a smaller sedan, the V6 make it very top heavy.  As a result causing more understeer and diminishing its agility.  Lost most of that dare I say ""Fun Factor"" of this wonderful vehicle.  It's like buying a Honda S2000 and asking for a V6 because you do not appreciate the high performance of that motor.  I wish Acura should never put that V6 in the TSX's.  If you really wanted a V6, you should opt for the TL model as this vehicle is more engineer for V6 due to its size.  In addition, all TL came equipped with V6 standard.  My wish for Acura is continued to squeeze out more horsepower from the K24 motor and make it even more agile and nimble.  This my friends is the hallmark of the TSX sedan.",5

4606, on 05/21/16 23:01 PM (PDT),Kong Vang ,2010 Acura TSX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 5A),All that and a bag of chips!," Took the 2010 TSX for a nice cruise today, and I love how this engine loves to rev! The handling of this car is phenomenal, no body roll at all, and corners really well! To put it into perspective, you know those on ramps that curves and then merges on to the free way, normally I could attack the curve at 45 mph with your ordinary family sedan, then wait until my line straightens to actually speed up. With this car, 65-70 MPH on the curves--no problems, no body roll. The car stays planted and flat throughout the hairpin, very confidence inspiring! It's amazing how it handles like a RWD car! Perhaps that was the point?Love how the rpm climbs so fast, especially when u hit VTEC! Soon to get Hondata FlashPro for it, which engages VTEC at 4500 rpm! And shifts red line to a lofty 8000 rpm, that's a Type-R!Interior fit and finish is excellent. The seats are super comfortable and keeps the lateral G's in check (as in hugs you when you make tight turns at speeds). The reinforced structural rigidity not only makes this car super responsive in the turns, it makes you feel very safe knowing that you're inside a roll cage! The audio system is top rate and sounds absolutely amazing!Minor Gripes: the electronic steering feels numb at first, but once you get used to it, it's not so bad. Just a minor annoyance since you have no clue what the tires are doing, because no feed back through the steering column. Any tire slippage will come by as a surprise. No back up camera or GPS, not a deal breaker. Don't need a back up camera in a small car, it's not a truck! And Waze on your phone does a fine job of Navigation.Brakes would be adequate for most; however for me--it leaves a lot to be desired; nothing a little upgrade in brake pads and lighter wheels couldn't fix. You wouldn't notice it unless you've rode motorcycles all your life or drive a lighter car like the Honda Fit modded with lightweight wheels that has the stopping distance of a Sports Bike. I would say the Toyota Sienna and the TSX have similar stopping power.Bottom line 8.9/10 I would recommend this car, because it does everything exceptionally well stock! It's also one of the very few Hondas, if not the last Hondas/Acuras still built 100% in Japan so it's high quality and super reliable! With a Timing Chain instead of a Belt, maintenance is also minimal. Can't beat the value!",5
4607, on 07/13/15 08:09 AM (PDT),Brian ,2010 Acura TSX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 5A),Just a Great Car Overall," I have a 2010 black TSX (4 cylinder, no tech) that I bought certified in the summer of 2012 with 26k miles (now has 57k).  I could not be happier with this car.  To summarize, this car may not be #1 in any particular category, but it does everything well.  Its sporty, its comfortable, its technologically equipped even at the base model, its reliable, and I like how it looks (especially in black).  I had a 2003 Audi A4 before this car, which was an amazing performer, but was a disaster with reliability.  The A4 had so many issues that I got nervous every time I turned the key to start the car.   Also, (not that it was necessarily the A4), but I had 4 tires go out on me in 5 years on that model.  With the TSX, I like that it gives me a digital output of my tire pressure, so I always know I am good.  If you are looking for a fun, reliable, and pretty well equipped car, the TSX is for you.  Acura is not for everyone, but I am now sold and would like to get the TLX as my next model when the time is right; however, I know I can get so many more models out of the TSX so will hang onto it for some time.",5

After 4 years of driving my TLX, I am still loving this car. The 6 speed manual transmission adds another dimension of FUN on the road. Honda has one of the smoothest shift boxes around (traded in my Honda Civic SI). On the highway, I have opened it up to 125 mph effortlessly (I didn't have it floored either and wanted to push it but figured I was lucky enough to be ticketed). I have to applaud Acura as they do not nickel and dime you to death when premium features are added on. Try that with Lexus or Infinity?? ELS 5.1 stereo system is impressive.

One of my other top considerations was the VW CC, but I didn't like its bland vinyl interior and below-average reliability. The TSX is a very attractive car.

This is my first foreign car as a owner. I worked at General Motors for more than 25 years and drove/owned/leased virtually every luxury/sports car the automaker made since 1981 - including Saab. Without question the TSX is a very fine automobile measurable to any luxury sports sedan on the market. When you compare the technology, creature comforts, the TSX is very price competitive. Mileage is close to 26MPG city; 30-31 mpg on the highway. Contrary to other reviews, the 4 cylinder engine is extremely powerful and accelerates quickly in highway traffic.

For those of you who are skeptical about the performance, don't be, there is enough there. Not to mention the automatic shifts quickly and is pretty sporty.

It's a nice car, handles great, but it's underpowered with the 4 Cyl automatic especially when entering a freeway. Even in manual mode it's inadequate in the all important 40-60 range. If you are thinking of switching from a 6 cyl to the TSX 4, think twice. The TSX had better features for the price, but when you step on the gas at 40MPH and nothing much happens, features don't help. The 6 cyl was $3,000 more (too much). The VW has it where it counts, low end torque. Unfortunately, the VW came only with leatherette(Vinyl) and my wife hated the VW drving position.

After they put the V^ engine in, they re- designed the suspension in a clumsy and unfinished way. Other customers have complained about this issue.

The bluetooth phone had a loud static noise when on and you could hardly hear the person on the phone.  The drivers seat kept slipping downward as if the motor or track was stripped(I weigh 180).  I traded a 2008 Accord Sedan in on the TSX.  The TSX is too much like the Accord but with a little more horsepower(not enough).  So far the G37 is 10X the car.

This time is no different & once again chose Acura over Infinity, BMW & Lexus.  Recently I traded in my 2007 Acura TL for a 2010 Acura TSX. When it was time to get a new car I looked at all the big boys including the new TL. I didn't really dig the TL's new exterior body style or its new found higher price tag of $43k; just a bit more than I wanted or needed for my daily urban driving.  When looking at the TSX I was concerned about going with the 4 cyl having just come from a pretty powerful, fun V6 but went for it.  Wow, am I impressed. The TSX is NOT a slow car by any standard.

It's smooth, sounds great, revs freely, and has enough power to be entertaining with 6MT.  It delivers good mileage too.  I love the interior: fantastic seats, good visibility, great ergonomics, and even the base stereo is excellent.  For an urban enthusiast's daily driver, the suspension tuning is perfect.  It's tight and responsive but never harsh.  Only fly in the ointment is the steering.  It's numb on center, which isn't great on the highway and detracts from driving feel.  But it's accurate, with good off-center feel, which works great on twisty roads.",4.625

For the past year I had been planning to purchase for myself another Honda Accord EX-L and just by chance I checked out the TSX.  I loved it.  It came with everything, factory installed, even options like memory seats, passenger power seat, home-link, and directional signals on outside mirrors that you couldn't even get on a loaded 4-cyl EX-L Accord.

The materials look and feel of high quality and there hasn't been any rattles or strange sounds as yet. The paddle shifters take some getting used to. You don't have FULL manual control of the car until you move the gear to ""S"" which downshifts to 3rd gear and then you use the paddles. I miss the flick of the steptronic to manual mode in my old TSX. Road/Wind noise has improved but I can't say much about the handling. The car seems to float at times when you turn the wheel.

Package is a great car with a smooth perfect sporty feeling ride. I love the car because it’s reliable! I so far haven’t had any issues with the vehicle. The only thing that has me worried is the transmission I haven’t heard anyone complaining about it so far, but it’s rough at time when it shift between gear 3rd and shifting into 4th mine feels like it’s hesitating, I do not know what the problem is yet with that. The car is perfect for a daily vehicle. It looks great from the exterior & interior as well. The only problem with the interior is the leather they used its cheap, for an Acura that’s the least you would expect, it should of been upgraded to high quality leather. I noticed that a lot of people complain about the navigation and how Bluetooth is a hassle to deal with, that’s why there’s a manuals book for you to read! read the instruction and learn how to use it. I never had a problem with it.",4

I bought an 06 with 150K and love it every time I get behind the wheel. Controls are logically laid out and where you would want them. The true quality is in the driving experience. I test drove both Mercedes and BMW but neither was as much fun to drive as this car! The engine power seems well balanced to the car and never feels like it breaks a sweat. The size is perfect, as the TL is larger but also heavier and gets horrible MPG. This get s 25 city and 30 highway. I was lucky and found one that was garage kept and faithfully maintained by the dealer. Other perks are the sound system, xenon headlights, ancient but very usable NAV, and looks almost new.",5

Great, precise handling and sublime shifting action with 6 speed manual. Purchased the Acura A-Spec suspension kit that adds to handling and gives car slightly more aggressive stance. Extensive standard equipment list as well (I like the xenons). A lot of people think my car is a lot more recent and are shocked when I tell them it's an '06. Very comfortable seats as well. Also has nice and sharp, clean sedan looks to it and isn't too gaudy (see 10th gen Civic) and doesn't have looks that will age with time like a lot of new designs. Visibility is good all around even with rear wing spoiler. Only thing I wish was that the city gas mileage was better, especially considering this car isn't a blazer. Also wish passenger window had auto up/down feature. I've also noticed recently I've had to carry around a quart of oil around between oil changes to top off. Car does have close to 110k now however. Overall great car that I'd recommend to anyone looking for a sporty entry level luxury car. To me Acura was at their peak with the 04-08 TSX and TL.

But for a daily commuter I needed something a bit more practical. As soon as I got behind the wheel to test this car I knew I was going to buy it. The perforated leather seats maintain a modern look and offer great comfort (I've even received compliments on comfort from passengers in the back seats). The steering feels precise and ""substantial""... it feels sporty and heavy enough but is still smooth and comfortable. I was actually quite impressed with the headlights as they are very brights and white. Significantly better than many other cars I've driven. The audio system and aux input are more than enough for me to appreciate some music and podcasts on the way to and from work.

The only repairs I have made on the car were the alternator, passenger door lock actuator, idler pulley & seized rear brake caliper.   It drives nice, accelerates decently for a 4-cylinder and has almost no rattles or squeaks for it's age and mileage.   I would definitely recommend this vehicle as a used car if you can find someone who maintained it well.  The original Michelin MXM4 tires are worth the extra cash as they match perfectly with the car's handling abilities (wet or dry).   I wish the HID headlights were made of glass as the plastic fades into a ugly haze.   The leather seats are in perfect condition and the interior hardware has held up nicely.   The Bluetooth phone feature doesn't work as well as newer cars and I have difficulty consistently connecting to my phone.

Short throw shifts - get it in the max torque band of 4000 RPM and it won't disappoint! Don't get me wrong, it's not a turbo-charged or straight 6 - 3 series, but it is priced accordingly, so please stop with the comparisons.Absolutely nothing has failed on it - the only things that have been done so far are brakes, tires, and oil changes (try that on your BMW). Do yourself a favor and install a high flow air filter, as it does make a noticeable difference.

I had been away for awhile but when I decided to get a new car last summer, I chose the TSX. I don't think you can buy a better looking, driving, or better equipped car for the money. The car has nearly everything I could want in features, the handling is very nimble, it is supremely comfortable on long or short trips, I really like the interior and exterior styling. The torque off the line is a little low but when you get the engine in 'the zone' it pulls hard. The navi system is great, the best part is that it's a Honda at heart and should run forever.

There are a few convenience features that the Altima had that the TSX strangely are lacking. Kinda weird you can't view total mileage and outside temp at the same time.

My previous car was a 2001 Volvo S40 with all the bells and whistles, however, it completely died at 18K miles. I have test driven many other vehicles in its class and the TSX is by far the best out there. It looks sharp with the ground effects kit which I have by the way and the car is loaded. When you add up these features with other cars, you are looking at at least $40K when all done and said (with BMW, MB, Lexus, etc).

My wife (Mich) grew up driving V-8s and V-6s; she said the TSX is the fastest car she has ever driven and her first manual shift.  Check out the top ten cars on the residual value list.  I am happy TSX does not suit everyone taste.  ",5

The vtec-4 engine is as smooth and strong as the competitors' V6 or I6. Handling wise, TSX's FWD gave little away to RWD rivals under regular street driving . While the base prices are in the same range, by the time you spec up to match the TSX (leather, cd changer, xeon, 17"" wheel) you are looking at something like $10k higher, so for me it was an easy decision. Only negative I have is with blind spots. The thick front A-pillar, steeply raked windshield, and high trunk lid all make it hard for my wife (5'4"") to drive and park in tight spots. Granted this is not unique to TSX as the IS is as bad if  not worse.   ",4.875

I was feeling a tad bit old when I started to consider a 4 door sedan... but you can't even tell that it is a 4 door when you are driving it. It hugs the exit ramps so close to the inside line and it is very diificult to lose control of this vehicle. The interior is sporty (I have quartz leather with brushed nickle finish) and easy to maintain. I hate that I have to sell this car to take over a company car - I won't say the name but that, my friends, is a car I guarantee I will notice the four doors. ",5

Handling is superb, and the automatic transmission in manual mode delivers very satisfying performance on winding roads.  The interior is very comfortable (although I'd like a little more drama), and the stereo is simply incredible.  The exterior styling is a little too BMW-like, but it's still very easy on the eyes.

Besides fun, it comes loaded with just about every feature standard, provides high reliability, and low TCO for a luxury car. The TSX automatic model is powerful enough for spirited driving on streets, twisting roads, and freeways. SportShift mode helps compensate for the TSX's low  torque at low RPM. I find SportShift a viable option to a manual shift. TSX is more fun than the TL. Gas mileage: 19+/32+ MPG city/country.

I immediately noticed a problem with quality of the radio reception for FM stations that are based in my city, as well as for XM stations.  Basically, if you get into areas of high voltage you either lose the signal (XM) or it becomes staticky (FM).  My dealership told me there was nothing wrong with the reception and that that was how all the TSXs were.  They gave me a loaner car to use and I noticed the same problem with reception on that car.

The TSX may not offer the best performance in any one category, but everything works together to create an ideal driving experience.  Fuel efficiency, in mixed driving conditions (50/50 city/hwy), has averaged at 25 MPG.  Braking performance is on par with generic (non premium) sedans.

It has a bit of power to accelerate with confidence. It handles and stops well. This is a drivers car and gives you feed back. Its construction is simple yet reliable making it a great car to purchase used. Repair costs are relatively inexpensive. It doesn't have a lot of newer electronic features to fail or cause issues. It has enough features to give you a comfortable ride. The stereo is pretty decent but not as good as the newer ones. Mine is going on 14 years old and the only worry that I have is that I won't be able to buy a new car for another decade because theres nothing wrong with the TSX.

I have taken it through its paces and it handles nimbly and with ease.  I do find the seats to be a bit uncomfortable on long trips and the gear shift a bit cheap feeling, especially when in sport shift mode.

There was a rattle in the dash at cold temps  told it was a cantilevered dash, so basically a design flaw.  Tried to fix 3 times & then a month or so after the last try it went away on its own.

The headrests can be a bit higher (I am 6'2).  Otherwise the car is perfect. Light on center steering, a lot of grip and very predicable at the limit. By the way, I know my complaints are very minor that's what separates this car from being perfect.  Of course, it doesn't have the ergonomics or style of A4 but it doesn't fall apart.

This car has left me stranded, things were breaking in the car 3-4 months after I got it; no pickup, awful in snow.   I don't feel safe in car, and don't trust that it will get me where I need to be safel - in fact, everytime I drive long distances, I get very nervous that the car will strand me somewhere b/c it has in the past.

The car runs admirably.  Lacking in power, it provides gas mileage, comfort, and fun driving. The overhead blue light during the night adds a unique but classy ambiance. The interior and use of all available space provide a wonderful usage for anything and everything, cell phones, chargers, cd cases. With performance being its only down point, I understand the balance, but it needs the extra horsepower or burst of speed off the line. There is one aspect from changing from second gear to third gear where it gets stuck even with the clutch completely down. Great car. ",4.75

This car is sporty, stylish, sleek, everything you could possibly want in a car, and with just enough a hint of luxury to make this mid-20s chick feel rich!

It makes a very good first impression.  This quickly wears off though after you drive it for a month or two.  It quickly develops rattles and squeaks and the precise handling quickly loses alignment. It's never starts without cranking too long. The fuel economy is much worse than advertised, even under optimal conditions.  Seats are narrow and uncomfortable for an average-sized person. No side-body protective molding. Also, some of the fancy features are poorly implemented.  It has power seats but no position memory which is worse (slower and less reliable) than plain old manual seats.  There's no ""mute"" button for the stereo.",3.75

The only thing that I think that could be changed on the car as the main thing, is the engine power. There is a very fair amount of power that you get from the car and it is very fun to drive just there is a little missing in that part.  I have had this car longer then I have owned any other vehicles in the past. Usually I keep for around 9 months, and I have owned my TSX for almost 1.5 years.

The traction control in this car puts me at par with any SUV on paved icy and snow covered roads. This is a fine entry level compact sports/luxury sedan.

The moonroof was rattling, after a second visit to the dealership, they put a tape around the sunroof, which helped, but it is rattling again.  CD changer was replaced because it was skipping.  Paint seems to chip easily.  Fuel economy is decent, however, since it requires premium gas, it does add up.  Power is just ok at initial get-go, you can really tell it's a 4 cylinder.

First of all, the safety features are supurb. The comfort is incredible and the list of standard features are seemingly endless. This car feels like luxury inside and out.

It's handling is excellent, and combined with a powerful inline 4 cylinder and interior creature comforts, makes this a great road trip car.  If you're a racer, this car won't do it for you unless you start modding it.  Fuel efficiency is good (I average around 25 mpg), but it still hurts that it costs about $40 to fill up nowadays because it needs premium gas.  I've had to get the brakes and rotors replaced (under warranty) after 7,000 miles, but that says more about how hard I drive this car than the build quality.

It's a little sluggish in either manual or automatic mode, but once you build up some momentum, the speed is definitely there.  Also, the TSX is a 5 speed automatic, and the 99 TL is a 4 speed, which makes for better downshifting in my opinion.  Acura/Honda needs to seriously work on the voice-activated feature on the navi.

I can be anywhere and just tell the car to take me home, or I can pull up a list of nearby Chinese restaurants in less than 5 seconds.  I disagree with reviews that it is overly complicated.

The recent ""beak"" phase in their styling department is thankfully and slowly becoming a travesty best left as a faded memory. The TSX's styling is crisp and attractive from pretty much every angle.

I found my dirty and uncared for 2004 TSX in a wholesale lot (being sent to auction due to needing some work). It definitely wasn't my first choice but I knew these cars are known to go 300+k miles, very reliable and very logical to own. I quickly signed the paperwork and drove home in it that day. I literally could care less about buying it, i just needed a car. Over the next year, I left the dealer and drove the car over 30k miles, slowly loving the car more and more with every mile. I spent 3 days polishing and reconditioning this car (the previous owner was a slob), put in a new climate system, and had a little electrical issue with the door locks. I'm not one to do this but I also swapped out the interior lights for LEDs. Otherwise this car has completely won me over! It still looks stylish and modern 13 years later, the black really shines, the leather has held up well, everything works great and I'm literally ready to put another 200k miles on it!

I purchased this car from Paragon Acura in Queens NY, & it has been an absolute nightmare ever since. In 1 year I have replaced/repaired:Serpentine Belt & Tensioner2 Rear Wheel Hubs3 Motor Mounts1 Transmission MountSeat Belt Sensor8 Brake Pads & 4 Rotors - warped at time of purchaseAlignments - bad at time of purchaseI've also preformed scheduled maintenance on this car, including:Oil ChangesCabin FilterAir Intake FilterSpark Plugs4 Brand New TiresI've replaced other broken or worn things that I simply cannot think of at the moment.5 Months ago my car started trembling in gear while idling. I've taken it to 3 shops & an Acura dealer. NO ONE CAN FIND THE PROBLEM! Acura wants to tear my engine apart to the tune of $600 (just in labor), with NO guarantee that they'll find the problem. I paid $130 dollars for them to turn around & say sorry we don't know what's wrong with it, here's your car back. The only good thing about that whole dilemma was getting to drive a brand new TLX for 4 days. The most recent issue I am having is the dreaded Center Stack Lights/HVAC - NOT working. I'm saddened that Acura would NOT call a recall on this, instead just extended the warranty (100K miles, or 7 years) & post a bulletin that NO ONE was notified about. I'm out of the warranty period by about 7K miles, or 5 years. Total BS. My first car was a 1997 Honda Civic DX & it did me justice, I purchased the 04 TSX thinking - ""Hmm, my Civic lasted me so well, & the TSX is a LUXURY version of Honda, so this should be an even better experience."" Unfortunately, I was SO wrong. Acura DOES NOT stand behind the cars they produce. I called Acura to ask about the radio & what I can do. I talked with a man who was more concerned that his shift was over at 5, than with helping me. I have read countless forums in the last month about the center stack lights/HVAC lights not working, caused by a faulty PCB (Printed Circuit Board) which has been discontinued, I'd assume because people were repairing it themselves for cheaper. This seems to be an issue A LOT of owners are faced with. It really is a shame that Honda & Acura owners represent this brand with so much dedication, however, they don't support their fans. This is a money devouring car, & there is NO recall for an issue Acura knows is present & persistent. STAY AWAY FROM ACURA.",3

The only major repairs besides tires, battery and regular service was a new clutch at 102K miles. Also needed new rear struts around 93K. Besides that, this car was the lowest to maintain, even better than my 1994 Accord. I used 87 octane gasoline, not the premium that Acura recommended.

All of the cars controls have a responsive, precise feel to them. Lateral cornering grip is fantastic and the car goes exactly where you point it with minimal understeer. The steering is precise and the manual transmission feels like it came out of a sports car, with very short throws and a buttery snick snick feel to it.  It's not a very fast or sexy sounding powertrain, but the power is sufficient. The interior is beautiful with quality expensive looking materials. Styling is very handsome inside and out and has aged extremely gracefully over the last 10 years. Tinting the windows and installing a lip spoiler completed the exterior, and ipod aux cable is a quick install. This cars practicality, reliability and fun to drive characteristics are unmatched in this price range.",5

There's a reason you still see so many on the road, they are bulletproof reliable and drive great, even after all these years.  Mine is an April 2004 build, and I'll admit it's been babied with just now 79K on it, but I still feel good getting in it and heading off to work.  If you find one with a good maintenance history, you ought to have several more years of use with it.  I've done nothing but the normal stuff, like fluid flushes, brakes, battery, etc...  It really is amazing how well built of a car this was from Honda.  All in all, for the price they are now used, I can't think of a better choice.",5

Controls and gauges laid out very well.  And the stability control program pretty much saved my life one day on I-459 in Birmingham, Alabama.",4.875

I still can't believe 3 years later how much I enjoy driving it (I'm usually quite bored by then and get the ""new car"" bug).  I found several things I could do to make it more fun.

Perhaps the most is how much the car does with the 2.2 liter 4-cylinder engine; you have to goose up the revs a bit to get the car to shoot up an on-ramp, but the engine and automatic transmission respond smoothly and seamlessly. I like the minimalist style (I'm an early baby-boomer and don't need the boy-racer image, though I enjoy performance). I also enjoy the gas economy; on a mixed highway-street commute, I get perhaps 27-28 MPG and and thus fill the tank only about every 320 miles.

Simply tint the windows with a legal tint and add a spoiler and you are left with a fun, stylish, sedan sports car.

I have a 2009 Acura TSX that i bought brand new in 2008. I had to commute for work and my miles were about 200 over the warranty so the dealership took pics of the car stated that his district manager had to approve if seats could be fixed, no one called back so I made the first move and called to be told no, there is nothing we can do about it.  I also received a letter in the mail about an oil consumption recall and was told that I was over miles but they may be able to work something out. I had to pay for a timing chain to be replaced on the car right at 100000 miles and was told that they don't make these cars like they use to not only am I embarrassed about the seats that have been torn for a while while making car payments now because the car is not worth the hassel. I asked when does it states that there is a certain mileage on a recall to get vehicle fixed for free this is not my 1st car.  I will never purchase another one looking at getting an Audi this month better quality. There need to be a lemon law on this car new or used .",4
4992, on 02/13/16 06:36 AM (PST),Paul ,2009 Acura TSX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),TSX Review for Used Car Seekers - Check Oil Issue," Feb 2017 Update:My TSX is still going strong, but it turns out the oil consumption issue became a problem, consuming more than a quart per 1000 miles. Although it was a tedious process, Acura ended up replacing the piston rings as part of their extended warranty due to this known issue. No more burning oil and my engine has a new life at 116,000 miles. Used car seekers should check if TSXs of this vintage have had the warranty work done, especially on manual transmission models which are more prone to this problem. If the exhaust tips are sooty then the car is burning oil.Original review 2016:I am the original owner a black, 4cyl TSX with 6 speed manual transmission. It now has 96k miles of more than half highway miles. Oddly enough, I'm more pleased with the car as it ages. Why? Because it's still performing very well, despite the expectation for an older car to start acting up. Power is good, handling is still tight, no rattles, the auto climate control is spot on. The 6 speed short shifting manual mated to a smooth clutch that doesn't buck in slow traffic is pleasure to drive. Manual lovers would like this car, and the engine is happy to rev.  Fuel economy has been 30 mpg with my type of driving. This is excellent for a car with decent power.The TSX handles pretty well in snow when mated with good all-season or winter tires. I am very happy with Continental PureContact Eco+ DWS. They drive well in snow and the traction control, when needed, works in concert with these to provide good control. I used to have Bridgestone Pole Position, which handled even better in dry and wet conditions but were horrible in snow. Surprisingly, the Continentals actually have improved fuel mileage by at least 1 mpg, as they claim.Rear seats are more suitable for smaller people. The door opening is a little tight getting in, but the seats are very comfortable once in. Child seats are a pain to use because of the bucket shape and the closeness of the latch. Now that my kids are beyond that, we happily use the TSX for our family of 5 over our Odyssey, especially when parking will be tight.My few issues:Bluetooth function for the non-Nav version is clunky so I prefer to use my ear bud for making calls. I have a vent-mounted phone holder to make calls easier and to facilitate using GPS on my phone.91 octane is tough to find so one usually has to pay for 93 octane. This is the price for getting 200 hp out of a 4 cylinder engine.This model year had brakes that wore prematurely but that is not an issue after I replaced them with non-OEM pads. I had to have the clutch master cylinder (small cylinder located at the clutch pedal) replaced at about 85k miles. Acura granted me a discount for this service when I complained that it was premature. The clutch is still in great shape. Last, but not least, the engine consumes oil. Acura has extended the engine warranty to 8 yrs/125k miles. Their threshold for warranty work (changing piston rings) is burning more than 1 qt per 1000 miles. My engine consumes about 1/2 qt. I wonder if this issue occurs because people followed the maintenance minder for oil changes. I was driving 8k miles or even more before it would call for oil changes. I think following that was a mistake. I'm living with it and it does not seem to be getting worse now that I change oil at 5k miles.I expect my TSX to continue to age well, and plan to pass it down to my kids when it's about 10 yrs old with 150k+ miles.",4

My company moved from the suburbs to downtown so my commute changed from an easy 10 minutes on a turnpike to 20-30 minutes of Indy 500 with crack-ups and rescue vehicles included, and I'm so glad I bought the TSX instead of some larger sedans or SUV's I was looking at. My wife has a 2011 Pilot EXL so the need for another SUV really wasn't there anyway.  We've had or still have six Honda's and two Acura's plus Mazdas and Nissans and some Fords. I'm getting over 25 MPG even with all the stops and starts and racing that I'm doing. I use the paddle shifters ALL THE TIME and it's so cool to pass or get around someone and then to accelerate and just get away from them (even within the speed limit, the acceleration is awesome).  I did read the reviews about geting the 6 cylinder if you can find one, and I did test drive a 4 cylinder and then a 6 cylinder, back to back and the 6 is spectacular.   I wasn't quite ready to pull the trigger, and the color of the 6 cylinder was white and I prefer black. The paddle shifters make the 4 cylinder a blast.  This car is very fun to drive.  It's easy to find a 4 cylinder in the color combination you want, and when you do, just buy it!  I got mine with 64,000 miles on it and I'm at 104,000 after 20 months.  I'll probably take it to 135,000 miles and then sell it and get a 2013 or 2014.

Mileage is decent, exterior design is great, and interior design is improved over the 04-08. Overall quality is not up to Honda/Acura standards, though. Brakes squeak at times, rear brakes go at 15-25k miles, engine pings on acceleration at below 50 degree temperatures, and leather is a bit thin. However, when you consider that for the same price you could drive a similarly optioned Camry, Accord, or Prius, and the TSX really shines. All the competitors are $5-10k more. Even with its shortcomings, there is nothing like it for the price.",4.375

I'm not a racing freak and use this car mainly as a family car. The interiors look great and the exterior is great too. So far the car has satisfied me the way I drive. I have driven it on highways (mountain roads as well) and it runs great. I would wait for few more months and would then assess its reliability. I bought it as a CPO car and assume that the known problems (if any) were solved. ,5

I'm able to drive for over 3 hours without pain in thighs as I experienced in my BMer and my RL.  Gas mileage at 75-80 is 34 mpg.  Around town it's about 21.5 on mid-range gas-- -doesn't need supreme.  I miss the 2 compartment (upper and lower full console in which I could put and FIND smaller things.  Voice recognition, as usual, isn't ready for prime time---it really stinks!  Accepting telephone numbers is near impossible even with my radio voice.

And I must now admit I did develop an emotional attachment to the way the BMW drives; the TSX just is not as exciting to drive. Here are the little things that do make up for the performance difference - tire pressure monitor, customized lighting settings, customized locking and unlocking of doors, auto reset of trip meter after gasing up, large GPS display, seemless bluetooth integration, nice all around visibility, very comfortable seats (and still sporty), good storage space, better pedal placement than the BMW, Ipod integration, and finally, zero maintenance issues.",5

I get 31mpg on long trips, Navigation and traffic reports are very useful.  Acceleration is pretty smooth up to 100mph (umm...so I've heard ;)  Looks nice and modern inside and out, and top notch fit and finish.  The car is no slouch, but the car feels faster than it really is when it's moving.  Overall, great value for money and should last a long time.

More than normal for us.  The reason I wanted to write this review is because I have no complaints about this car. It is the best vehicle I have ever purchased.  I'm 60 yrs young and I had many new cars (ie. Chevys, Fords, Volvo, Saabs, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Honda, Nissan etc.),  but this is by far the best I've had.

While this car is not a power beast, it has significantly more power than your normal sedan. The car is quick and somewhat nimble although when going around turns, I would like to feel more steering response- although this can be attributed to Acura's first attempt at electric steering in the TSX. The design on the outside is very modern and has really nice curves. Inside, the technology is amazing- a decent navigation system, good audio, voice controls- it is a tech nerd's dream.

Gonna buy another new Accord coupe, but drove an automatic and hated it. Drove the TSX and TL after driving the Honda coupe and Acura much better car to me...less road noise, better interior, etc. Accord never went back to the dealer for service in 5+ years...that sold me on Acura over Audi.

It's steering and turn radius is great. It's sleek and sexy looking with a sporty feel. It's great for city driving because it's still a smaller sedan, but big enough where you don't get bullied on the road or feel unsafe if you were to get in an accident.

Two complaints.  3400 RPM @ 80mph cruising is a little high, my 2000 TL does about 2150RPM at same speed.

The car does NOT feel as underpowered as some reviews suggest (an extra 20HP wouldnt hurt). Steering is not bad (could use more feel). The car likes to be driven fast (unlike my old 06 TL 6M which suffered from serious torque steer and an unhappiness when driven fast). It is also very comfortable and fits like a glove, everything feels right. Love the features: seats, steering wheel, FI paddle shifters, Bluetooth, USB audio (all cars should have this). HOWEVER, there is excessive dashboard glare that washes out the central display in a lot of driving conditions!! Why on earth would Acura use shiny/tacky material on the dash?",4.75

Bought it in October 2008 and have logged 17K+ miles to date.  No defects at all!  I shopped Lexus, BMW etc. and settled on the TSX.  Final choices came down to new TSX or used TL (or used BMW 330xi).   Former Honda owner so in the end I wanted reliability and sacrificed AWD.  The car is a pleasure to drive (quiet, no rattles etc.).  For pure fun, I would have bought the BM'r, but did not want to face any downstream reliability or expensive maintenance.   The only minor negative is the car is really so-so in the snow (even with snows) ... traction is not great.  Everything else meets or beats my expectations!   ",4.875

I do not race cars for a living, I drive near 80 miles per day commuting.  I need fun and comfort.  This car delivers on these.  From the very intuitive voice recognition, to the sat radio and USB interface, there is so much fun to be had here. While it is much maligned by um...

This Acura drives like a dream and I look forward to starting it up every day.  The standard features along with the Tech package give you almost every advanced feature imaginable.  The performance is almost comparable to the BMW (steering is a bit remote on the highway compared to a BMW) and is much more reliable (also, less expensive to fix - it is a Honda after all).

I was planning since last year to buy myself another EX-L Accord (4- cyl) and just by chance I checked out the TSX.  I loved it.  It came with everything, factory installed, even options like memory seats, passenger power seats, home-link, and directional signals on outside mirrors that you couldn't even get on a loaded 4cy EX-L Accord.

However, for the money, the Acura TSX is the best car I've had.  Excellent fuel economy, great features, nice design, and Honda/Acura reliability made this a no-brainer to buy.  I, like many, am not overly thrilled with the electronic steering, and it took some getting used to.  Frankly, now, however, I don't notice that it's any different from any other car I've driven.

For whatever reason, there is no option to dial your calls out, without using the voice activation system (which means the car has to hear and understand your VERBAL commands).  This means that when you can't get your verbal command through to the car, that you're basically not able to call out.  For a luxury car, this is absolutely unacceptable.

Would have liked a few more horses in the mountains, but if you keep the rpm up above 3500 it does well. The DVD audio is awesome. The trip computer is one to two MPGs optimistic.

When I do all highway, I am consistently in the low 30s mpg.  Agree the steering feels a little remote, but still drives wonderfully.

The audio display (where the navigation should be for TSXs with the tech package) has a glare at certain times of the day. Sometimes, it's to the point you cannot read what's on the display. I have heard that you can get a matte material to place beneath the display to rid of the glare. 4. The front two speakers crackle at certain frequencies.

The brake pads were defective, it started making the annoying squeaky noise after only 4 months. The bracket that holds the trunk door went out of place because some wire was not connected properly, so it wouldn't open with the remote control. They were both fixed under warranty at no cost.

5056, on 05/26/09 14:13 PM (PDT),TJ ,2009 Acura TSX Sedan Technology Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 5A),Left wondering about Acura , Had my new 2009 TSX for two just weeks when I heard a crackling noise coming from the rear shelf area. The dealer said it was known issue; Acura had issued a service bulletin to address this problem. The dealer kept the car  to carry out the fix.  Picked up the car but the noise returned shortly before I arrived home. Very disappointed in Acura for producing a defective product then selling it with a known problem. The Navi system has also been acting up. Generally the car has a spirited feel to it with a responsive engine. However the on-center feel at highway speeds is very poor-one needs to constantly correct steering. The seats are too firm and leave you sore after a road trip.,3.5

For about $3k more, I got a car with much more polish that is as fun to drive.  I like both the exterior and interior styling, although some people hate it. I've always driven manuals, but the auto TSX is plenty of fun, and I enjoyed it more than the 6-speed.  The car is nimble, extremely comfortable, and is a bargain. Some complain that it's not as muscular as a BMW 3 series or an Infiniti G37. This is true. It's also many thousands of dollars less expensive. For me, this was the sweet spot of price/performance.

The interior can feel a bit like the cockpit of a 747 at first, but within days I was comfortable navigating and controlling it.  The nav system with integrated blue tooth and iPod is a dream, and the the backup camera, while cheesy, is a nice touch.  The only drawback to this car is power.

I would probably be happier with the car overall if it had more power and the engine didn't sound like my 1993 Saturn with 180,000 miles on it.

Acura doesn't seem to know how to fix the problem and the dealerships are not willing to try any more repairs.  For 30K the brakes should not constantly squeal.  What an embarrassment for a vehicle considered luxury.  Stay away from this car.  For the money buy a Lexus IS.  If I go back I would leave this car on the lot.

The ride is exceptional and it corners like a bat outta hell. The interior is simple and free of the usual slew of buttons and oversized LCD screens.

5164, on 03/18/18 20:25 PM (PDT),Jay Cassius ,2012 Acura MDX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),IT AIN’T WHAT IT SHOULD BE !," It should sell for a lot lot less. In 2017, I bought the 2012 MDX used. 55k miles. I wanted a 3rd row SUV. Was in perfect condition, inside and out. Test drive was ok. Had only heard about Acura’s high end reputation. For the high price it must be pretty good? It ain’t. It’s not especially attractive. The dashboard and controls are pretty primitive. The buttons are cramped together, hard to read, poorly positioned. The multi information screen has  so many layers of headings and sub info that you need a special course to figure it out. Just to adjust the interior lights and door locks takes about 20 pages in the manual. Not because it’s intricate, but because it’s preprogrammed somewhere in China and they probably got the module for pennies. Like inexpensive furniture that you spend a day putting together yourself. It’s hard to get in and out. The driver seat is so high you have to lower it so your feet can get near the ground. I’m 5’10. The doors are short, too short, so you always bang your legs and feet trying to get out. You have to move the seat pretty far back so you can swing your legs out. The wood grain? panel along the dash couldn’t even pass for plastic, let alone wood. The electronic throttle is downright dangerous. You get to a highway on ramp, ease up on the gas before you accelerate....  hit the pedal.... nada... that hesitation is enough to give you a heart attack. Oh well, that’s the electronic throttle, nuttin they can do about it. I had a 2008 Lexus RX 350 before this. The MDX tries to be a cheap imitation that costs as much or more. Not even close. The 2008 Lexus was better in every way, except for the 3rd row seat. And I bet no one ever got the 16 estimated miles per gallon. I had to make a conscious effort to get 12. I’m trading it in before 6 months.",3

5169, on 07/07/17 15:58 PM (PDT),Lee Hoagland ,2012 Acura MDX SUV Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Great SUV substitute for sport sedan," I’ll try to keep this short and simple.• The gen2 MDX drives much smaller than it is. Even with the high ground clearance, it rivals many sport sedans, especially with the Advance pkg that comes with the Active Damper System (ADS) in sport mode. The overall dimensions (length, height, width, and track) lend themselves to a wide, stocky, and aggressive stance that handles very well.• The J37A1 engine is no slouch and while the 0-60 split isn’t fantastic at 7.1 seconds, it has more than enough torque for brisk highway merging and passes. Bear in mind it is a high-revving engine, so you really have to get it above 3500rpm to really let it purr. • The most annoying thing about the MDX is the shift mapping on the transmission. It is constantly trying to upshift prematurely, sometimes to the point that it seems something is wrong with the powertrain. I do not use mine in Drive mode; I always have it in Sportshift mode with the paddles engaged, so I have full control over when the transmission gears up. It does not turn it into a DSG or SMG, but it allows you to hold gears through turns and up hills, or gear down to prep for a highway pass. The engine has rev-matching, so it helps ease it into gear more than most automatic transmissions.• While rated at 16/21mpg, you will rarely see better than 18mpg if you use the paddles routinely. But, this is the price of having a sufficiently powered 4,550-lb vehicle that can hit the twisties better than the majority of crossovers, and better than some sedans.• The SH-AWD is fantastic and one of only a few torque-vectoring 4WD systems currently available. The only vehicle in the same class that has a comparable 4WD is the Audi Q7. The X5, RX350, XC90, and JX35/37 have atrocious 4WD/AWD systems that do nothing but add additional cost to the vehicle. The SH-AWD is highly advanced and is an incredible feature to have.• Wind noise is minimal as the aerodynamics are quite good. The engineers at Honda spent a lot of time in the wind tunnel making sure this beast was comfortable at highway speeds and it’s a very comfy ride.• If you are a performance oriented driver, definitely grab the Advance trim if you can. Additionally, look at the ATLP or RV6 J-pipe to replace the stock J-pipe. These $500 bolt-ons can add 15-25awhp, which translates into 25-40bhp. A custom CAI, resonator delete, and high-flow rear mufflers would put your output in the 340-360bhp range.There is much more to be said about this vehicle. [contact info removed]",4

Quickly discovered it burns oil at a rate of a quart every 1100 miles.  Thought the previous owner had abused the engine and not changed oil regularly.  WRONG. Seems that most ""reviewers"" and organizations have missed the fact that Acura has a bad engine - the J37A - out there on the 2008-2014 MDX.  A new cylinder material is rumored to be abrasive against the piston rings - and the oil is being burned quickly.  Acura has taken the stance that a quart/1000 miles is ""normal.""  And they are only ponying up money to totally irate consumers with signing of an NDA.  There is the rumor that the rings were installed improperly at the factory.  Initial statistics show that over 11% of Acura MDX's have this problem with the J37A engine.  Advise strongly again buying unless some warranty guarantee from Acura.  The problem has shown up in cars with as few as 40,000 miles.  Usually AFTER the warranty is expired.  Caution!!!",2

Tested the X5 and X3, the Q5, the ML 350 and the similarly sized Infinity; the MDX was hard to beat for overall driving, quality build and standard features.  SH-AWD is in a class of its own for on-the-road traction and performance.  Driving during a couple of heavy down pour is a breeze.  Surprisingly it has decent ground clearance for logging roads and unimproved two-tracks yet felt lower in driving than the others.  Noticed how low in the bonnet the engine sits, must be how Acura lowered it's center of gravity.  Lastly, could not believe the deal I struck with Acura vs. the German cars - much better.Three years later, now with 52K miles - not one issue or problem with the MDX.  We've taken it many long trips, have used it for carrying large items - still going great as a people and cargo mover.  One area of concern, the MPG seems to have fallen both for local and highway driving.  On a recent 3K trip from TX to NM to CO and back back, overall MPG for the trip was about 19.5.

It was a fantastic new car on the scene. Well, 15 years later, my daughter is 15 now and learning to drive and she will inherit the MDX as her first car to drive around. It has 210K miles on it. Its mostly been trouble free. Transmission went at 129K so was out of any warranty. (Apparently the early models, including mine, used a GM transmission as Acura had not quiet gotten their transmission ready for the car, later models used Acura transmission). The transmission rebuild cost $4500 but included a special attachment to the radiator to resolve the heating problem that these transmission had. On this second transmission, the car is now at 210K miles and it looks like it would probably do another 20K-40K without much problems. Changed battery 4 times (we live mostly in hot climate). Changed Tires 4-5 times. Changed brakes twice. Three timing belt jobs. One 100K tune up. Countless air filter and oil changes. Leak in power steering fixed (twice). A/C hose replaced. Engine mounts replaced under warranty. Catalytic converter went at 160K miles...feel I have spend $6-7K on all the repairs and normal maintenance over the years including wear and tear items like Battery, Tire, Brakes , Wipers etc....that works out to less than $500 per year which is not bad at all. I feel part of the issue with car trouble is crooked dealers who try to get you to replace items which don't need immediate replacement. Unless its an obvious problem impacting safety and drivability don't replace the item unless you are convinced it needs replacing. Car still looks new after 15 years. Amazing paint job. And guess what, didn't like the look of the new 2014 MDX so bought a nice new Range Rover - very fancy - but after 2 years and  numerous problems, I traded it in for an UGLY but hopefully much more reliable 2016 MDX. New 2001 MDX touring bought for $37K in California in 2001. New 2016 MDX Base model bought for $39K in Texas in 2016...which was $5K off the MSRP due to up coming model change over.",5

I have owned the MDX since November of 2013 and with the exception of routine scheduled maintance I have not had to spend a dime on repairs. Another positve is the room and confort of the interior which is very nice when you are on those long trips. The only negative I can ssay about my MDX is wind noise on the highway.

I now have 45K miles on my vehicle, but I've never had a vehicle with more problems in my life.  It's a good thing I bought the extended warranty, but it's still a pain to have to deal with constant problems.  The last time I took my vehicle in to fix the stuttering at acceleration, it took to two visits before they could diagnose the problem.  However, they told me the reason was the software, which Acura engineering was addressing, but the software fix was not available yet.  So, they replaced the transmission fluid as a temporary fix, which did work, but I'll eventually need to have the software update.  Since then, I've had the tailgate electronic release fail, so I need to take the vehicle in for service again.  As for the navigation system, it's quicker to stop in a gas station for directions than it is to input an address.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy an Acura, especially an MDX.",1

This car is much more refined than the 06. Beautiful style, great fit and finish. I added the following options; towing pkg, fog lights, roof rails and cross bars, mud flaps, and rear bumper protector. I felt they added a lot to the style as well as some function. This car is primarily my wife's car. She says it is the most comfortable car she has ever driven or ridden in. Good gas mileage for this class vehicle, however the 91 octane fuel requirement over regular cuts down on any fuel savings. I was concerned about the variable cylinder management system, which Acura used to get the 28 mpg. I was pleasantly surprised, no noticeable delays or lack of power. Most cars of this class get improved gas mileage  via CV or 9 speed transmissions, the 2014 did not. Strangely enough the 2015 model did come with a different tranny, however it did not seem to improve mpg.The only real gripes are with the navigation and the radio display. The navigation locks you out on many functions while moving (safety) however it is frustrating (when passenger cannot input address or search for points of interest). My VW warns you but allows all functions. The GPS display does not provide the posted speed limit like my $100 Garman portable or my VW Touareg GPS.

5302, on 09/15/15 08:37 AM (PDT),VP ,2014 Acura MDX SUV Advance and Entertainment Packages 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Acura is not worth leasing or buying," Update:  After driving leased Acura MDX for 3 years, I was very happy to return it to the dealer even before my lease expired.  Not a good car at all.  Eats gas, poor performance, transmission problems.  I am driving Acura RDX now and its not a good car either. THUS, Acura is not a good car, do not waste your money on it!I leased new Acura MDX in 2014 after driving it for 18 month, I am extremely unsatisfied with its performance.The engine is lacking in power, the car jumps at 20mph and 40mph points and stoles and shakes, so  speed changes are very palpable inside the car. It also lacks in performance as it’s almost impossible to get the speed to 80mph. There are noises from the front and sides of the car every time the speed is over 40mph and they increase with speed.Break safety feature works at its own whim and beeps at any time, no matter if there are cars in front or if road is completely deserted. Lane departure feature is unusable, when its on, it beeps all the time and distracts from driving. Multi-view rear camera does not have all necessary angles to maneuver safely in a tight spot, it is too high and not a wide angle.However, absolutely unacceptable is the way audio system and navigations system work, or more accurately – don’t work.  It’s a shame that car that costs more than some homes do has such a poorly designed and obviously malfunctioning navigation and audio systems.  Navigation gps, if able to find an address at all, which happens 5 out of 10 times, will show you the longest route, if to the correct place at all.  The directions end about 400 ft away from the address and you are left guessing about your final destination all the time. The gps screen is very user unfriendly and when you enter the city it “helps” you by showing you cities that start with the same letters you typed all over the US. Many times it cannot find the street or the house number on the street. Gps cannot be updated without spending additional $200 every year and it is about 10 years behind even on a new car, so any road or development built after 2005 will not be found by this gps.The good navigation system in the car was one of my main requirements when I was signing a new lease, because I use it for work, and I was assured by dealer that this is the car with best gps in the marketplace.  I am ashamed every day to use it in front of clients because in most cases it will either take me to a different address, cannot find address at all, or directs me to drive 16 miles in a roundabout way when my destination is located 2-3 miles away. The features to find a place by name or by category usually show places that are on the other side of the country. If I am searching for closest coffee shop or gas station, it will usually direct me to KY or NJ, and I am in FL. You cannot find an airport by name or address or any other popular venue by name at all.Audio system does not work with blackberry phone, it does not transfer contracts, interferes with audio and navigation when linked to a phone, and changes settings automatically without me re-setting the system.  There were so many times when after a phone call I was not able to disconnect, or not able to pick up a call at all, or the panel screen would freeze on the phone disconnect screen and would not switch back to navigation.  Many other features do no work at all, but I have no use for them anyway. When talking on the phone,  navigation sound increase so that you do not hear the person you are talking to. The voice recognition does not work, the voice dial does not work, I stopped using Bluetooth function completely because it interferes more than it was ever useful. So the second main feature why I leased this car is also not working, and creates a danger on the road when I have to hold the phone instead of being able to use a Bluetooth.Overall, I am completely dissatisfied with the car functionality and features. I asked the dealer to help, but if system does not work, it does not work, there is not much the dealer can do.  I went to a dealer and asked him to exchange my car before expiration of the lease because it makes no sense to be paying over $550 a month for a car with features that don’t work and create problems for me.  I wanted to get out of this lease and switch to Acura RDX without the crazy navigation and audio systems, just a basic car that drives (hopefully).  But I was told that there is no way I can change the car until the end of the lease term. So my understanding of the situation is that car does not hold value and it makes no sense for company to buy it back.  I send a letter to the Acura headquarters, and after a long conversation was told that they cannot help because every dealership is doing their own thing and the dealership only can make a decision to exchange the car.  I advised both the headquarters and the dealership that I will use all available social media to share my experience with Acura.",2

The nearest Acura dealer is a 2 hour (one way) drive for me, but an certified Honda dealer is only 10 minutes away.Acura now sends me a recall notice informing me a bolt needs to be replaced.  The Honda dealer tells me they can do the work, but it will be covered by Acura only with prior authorization.  Acura denies authorization and will require me to undertake a 4 hour trip to effect this recall.

Power is still impressive and smooth especially when you remember it is only 290 horsepower.  Acura claims it is faster than the '13.  Getting in and out of the back seats, including the third row is a breeze.  Mileage is excellent for a vehicle this size.  I'll get at least 26mpg on the highway - maybe 28 on summer blend gas.  Around town has been closer to 18.  My complaints about the car are minor.  Visibility through the C and D pillars is not good.  You really need the back up camera to see what is behind you.  The technology in the stereo, navigation, bluetooth, etc is impressive, but not intuitive.  I have had to flip through the manual on several occasions to do something I had thought should have been elementary.  Some simple tasks like changing the fan speed require two or three inputs.  I guess a complaint about the '13 was that it had too many buttons and knobs.  This car has two few.  The old system with a simple knob for a specific function was better.   Also, the car deactivates some sophisticated NAV and music features and requires you to use voice commands when driving, which can be MADDENING when the voice recognition misunderstands.

My first trip on the hightway the MDX averaged 31.4 MPG, no cruise control, I was speeding around 67 to 70 MPH, a long road trip this weekend average city and highway 28 MPG, so I'm happy so far with this. One of the tech parts I most love is the ACC and LKAS, this is basically a self driving car, a small touch to the weel from time to time is the only thing you have to do. The Aha service provided with Acura-Link is not as responsive as I expected. The interior is comfortable, quiet, and well-crafted. ",4.5

I was seriously looking at two other highly rated luxury SUV's but when the decision came I couldn't pass up another MDX. The Hybrid was a risk I felt I was taking being a new model but so far it is a seamless transition. You wouldn't know its a hybrid other than the fact that the tachometer periodically go's to zero. Very quiet and has nice pick-up when changing lanes and entering highways. Comfortable ride and I love the new exterior design. I was never a fan of the ""bagel Cutter"". The advance rear seat package is very luxurious and tops all other vehicles in this department. One item that Acura gets poor marks on is their information systems...I don't get the criticism. These systems are all complicated yet once you learn the ropes they work great and are no problem. My wife drives a new Mercedes and its complicated at first too! So far (3000 miles) I haven't seen super gas milage. I'm getting 28 city/hiway. This is about 8 miles more than my previous MDX Advance. The Hybrid does improve pick-up and I can drive around my pretentious University community with a hybrid badge on the side of the car :-)   .",5

The front seat is really an unfortable piece of work. Limit of adjustment and steering wheel make this a never ending quest for comfort. The firmness factor is unbearable for any drive over 30 minutes. Not suitable for a 6 ft person.  The Technology is total mess. While the world is racing to compete with advanced user interfaces like Apple and Android, for some insane reason this cludge of function is reminiscent of a Dos computer. A night time drive was out right dangerous with distraction of radio controls buried in a mess of heater, ac, seat, presets, tuning, and an array of hard buttons and knobs, each with multiple degrees of function. 6 steps required to change map orientation from North to direction of travel. ?? Are you kidding...  Fit and finish one glaring miss aligned fuel door jump out at you and the service manager said they’re all like that with no fix in site.. Overhead control panel has me constantly calling Acura link or emergency when simply trying to open the garage.  Net.. a nice platform with 1980’s implementation.  Way overpriced for this awful level of refinement. The pilot and odessey have both abandoned the two display infotainment system along with the rest of the industry..Update..basically reaffirm the above but I would add the 2018 finally added CarPlay but the goofy two display has not yet caught up to the Pilot and the depreciation is far beyond disappointing.

She wanted something with an interesting design, high quality and would be fun to drive. Kids asked for second row captain chairs with heating. 3-rd row would also be nice to have, since we occasionally need more than 4 people in a car. And finally, we needed an SUV comfortable enough to handle our long family trips. Besides comfortable seats, it had to have driver-assistance capabilities to reduce driver's fatigue. The budget was around $65K. When we started putting together a list of models we wanted to check out, my wife mentioned that one BMW is more than enough for our garage (my 01' M-roadster), so she'd exclude x5/x6 right away. Over the course of 2 weekends of dealership visits, the following options were rejected: Cayenne (only 2-row seating, pricey fun-to-drive models), Macan (just too small), MB GLE (didn't like overall philosophy), Jag F-pace (seating config, compromised rear-seat comfort due to its sedan-based platform), Model X (fabulous car, but way above the budget), Lexus RX (liked the interior and design, but non-heated and somewhat cramped 2-nd row). As such, MDX and Lexus GX were short-listed for test drives. Initially, we tested a gasoline version of MDX (sh-awd). My wife's impression about it was ""safe and boring"". I think it's because of the transmission on the gasoline model, which takes it's time to decide which gear would be better to use right now, considering a few dozen of factors, which probably include speed, inclination, ambient temperature, recent driving pattern, weather on Mars etc. etc. All this, while you have a really small window in traffic to merge into. Our Pilot was way better in such cases. I asked the sales guy to call me when they get a hybrid version, since I knew it should behave differently in that sense. My wife was excited to test the GX because she preferred its design and interior, due to some reason. Her impression after driving it was: ok on a straight, but so horrible even in moderate curves that it wasn't safe. We decided to wait for the hybrid MDX and keep the Pilot for another year or two in case we didn't like it. When the test car arrived a few weeks later, it exceeded our expectations. For $1500 premium you get two major improvements over the gas AWD version: the Acura's hybrid drive with dual-clutch transmission and the adaptive suspension. The former makes the acceleration faster and much smoother, while the latter allows configuring it for agility or comfort, depending on the situation. As a bonus, you get an outstanding fuel economy. With a bit of knowledge of how hybrids work, it's easy to beat the EPA numbers by 1-2 mpg. If it's not your thing and you prefer active driving style (like my wife), you will get the stated 26-27 mpg. At current gas prices, $1500 extra should pay back in 3-4 years with 12K miles per year. Considering all that, the only meaningful reason of going for a non-hybrid MDX I can think of is the budget limitation only enough to get a base FWD model. FWD Tech package and especially AWD Tech and above doesn't make sense in a non-hybrid model.",5

I had a 2016 w/Tech. Hated it!! Loved my others. The transmission and brakes were horrible!! I should have kept my 2011. But with the help of my dealer, I was able to trade in my leased 2016 for a 2017 Hybrid w/Advance. (I test drove it a month earlier when it was released to dealerships.) Totally different vehicle! This hybrid is what I expected in a petrol MDX. The system is SUPER quiet and seamless. Actually have more power (torque wise) than my 2016. The technology of the Hybrid is nothing short of spectacular! Smooth, quiet, powerful, and informative. Has a cool information screen to tell u what system is working and which is charging the battery! The suspension and brakes are also different from the standard MDX. Much smoother with the adaptive dampers and the brake travel is firm with a short throw. When having my Hybrid accessorized I had a MDX w/Advance loaner. Now I could actually do a comparison. Unfortunately it drove like my 2016 with the exception of stop/start feature which was an annoyance. In the Hybrid, the system works the same way EXCEPT when u accelerate you are actually on electric motors THEN the motor starts seamlessly. By the way it doesn't use a conventional starter! The front electric motor IS the starter! How cool is that. AND when driving you would never know when the engine is on or off unless you are looking at the tachometer! Even when you initially start the vehicle you can barely hear it. And the gas mileage is EXACTLY as advertised- 26.6 city/27-28 highway so far. I cannot see anyone who tests drives BOTH vehicles to not go with the Hybrid. It's only $1500 more than a comparable equipped MDX. The best bargain I have ever seen for this much technology (and I am a tech guy)! Out of the 21 vehicles I have owned since 1965 this by far the BEST vehicle I have ever had!! And that includes 2 sports cars that I loved!! Only one real drawback, Acura is no longer including a spare tire kit so I had to purchase one. One day Acura may only be making Hybrids (so far RLX, NSX, MDX). But for a newly introduced vehicle to the market, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG!!",5

This is the 4th model MDX I've owned, and as I'd expected, it's simply far and away superior to any of the others.  Pros: Hit the gas (or should it be called the hybrid) pedal and it flies off the line.  Quietest interior I've ever been in.  Steering is tight and responsive.  My kids are big fans of the second row captain's chairs.  Driver's assisting safety features (lane departure, etc.) seem top notch.  Interior features (seats, wood accents) are very nice.  Averaging 26.6 MPG so far.  Cons: not a fan of the infotainment system.  Miss the old buttons for heating and cooling seats.  Takes too long (IMHO) for rear view camera to kick in.  Had to wait over a minute yesterday for navigation menu to activate - not a big deal unless you're running late like I was.  A few minor things I'll have to get used to.  Overall I'm a huge fan of this ride.  After test-driving the competition, I'd have to say that the bang you get for your buck with the MDX made my choice a no-brainer.  Again - just one man's opinion.",5

The 9 speed takes a second and a half to down shift but after that it just goes through the gears.  Finished rear end similar to what is on Mercedes, a great touch.  Don't especially like the leather or shall we say 'fake-leather' interior.  Not good, and between the transmission and fake leather had to take a point off the 5 star rating.  Great paint and nice chrome accents that 2015 didn't have.  Not terrific in the snow, tires are touring, main culprit.  Nice looking grill-another reason I traded in '15 for '17.  Really like the vehicle and so do other people, that is why there are a ton of them out there!  Great lease price on tech package, again change of year model and opted for only 7500 a year as Acura rolled in the 2015 14,000 miles under, only paying $433 month for 36 months and most likely will purchase vehicle at the end of lease for only 30K!",5

Driving on the street it does not know what gear it should be in at all and the car literally jerks back and forth as the gears shift extremely rough. Coming to a stop at a stop light the car jerks as it shifts gears down. Then stepping on the gas at a green light and be careful you don’t smash into the car in front of you as the car stumbles into 1st gear and jerks and shoots you forward into second. Then second jerks the car into third. It’s absolutely horrible and very frustrating. I leased this car brand new in December and took it to the dealer two days ago in March. The dealer told me this is normal. When I reverse I hear a loud pop as if I ran over a plastic bottle. This is every time I reverse and again the dealer told me it’s normal. The Bluetooth connectivity is a joke because nothing works besides my music in my phone. Pandora doesn’t work, text message retrieval doesn’t work, Hell most of the time it won’t connect to my phone unless I go into my phone and connect to AcuraLink. I’m very dissapointed with the mdx and Acura overall. I won’t be buying another Acura. I will go back to bmw or Mercedes maybe even Land Rover when this lease is up. Acura is supposed to be a luxury brand but from my experience with them vs my experience with Mercedes, Lexus, bmw, and Cadillac. Acura has a lot to learn about being a luxury brand.

The car had 378 miles on it when I purchased it.  Immediately after driving off the lot, I noticed the timing of the transmission seemed to be off. I was pressing the gas, however the car was hesitating and then it would shift into 1st or 2nd gear, but the shifting was rough, enough to jerk you forward when the car finally moved.  When I took the car to Frankel Acura for diagnostics and repair, I was told the vehicle was operating properly. I was also told that I would have to deal with the issue until Acura issued a software update for the transmission.  The dealership offered no further action regarding the transmission.

The response I get from both is that Apple IOS updates are too frequent and Acura cannot react in a timely manner with a compatible fix for the A-Link system. Whatever the excuse, the feature is flawed. It is upsetting that the dealer knew connectivity was an issue as the salesperson said you can use Siri to access your address book, but did not tell the rest of the story.  MDX owners all paid for a hands free phone feature with voice activation, a common feature even in economy cars today that promotes safe driving. Acura, along with the dealer network, knew the problem existed and were glad to charge for the feature.  So what about resale value? Would you buy this car with this sort of defect?

The vehicle is pretty much top notch in all categories but it doesn't necessarily scream luxury on the inside.  It is definitely very well appointed but I was hoping for just a bit more of a luxurious feeling on the inside.  That's the negative I knew about and purchased the car anyway.  The other negative about this vehicle is the clunkiness of the technology (which I guess if I'd test driven it for more than 15 minutes I might have eventually discovered) and the fact that the iPhone connectivity is poor (which I didn't know until after the fact).  All menu and sub-menu options are toggled to and selected via a main dial that's about as big as the channel dial on a very old television, and there's a small bit of lag between pressing/turning the dial and the system responding.  In addition, and even more bothersome, is the fact that iphone contacts do not seamlessly synchronize via Bluetooth.  I have hundreds of contacts in my phone, and only about 5 of them synchronize.  After wondering what the heck I was doing wrong because I just couldn't get my contacts to synchronize - in addition to the voice command system not properly recognizing prompts - I turned to Google and, alas, found forum after forum of other MDXers complaining about this very same issue for years now.  In the end, I'd still probably have purchased this vehicle because it was the highest rated for safety in this vehicle class by IIHS and NHTSA, and safety is my number 1 criterion when I purchase a vehicle, but I might not have opted for the Tech package if I'd have been aware of these issues.  Another disappointment is the fact that the AcuraLink app doesn't have functionality to remotely start the car, yet it can remotely lock & unlock doors.

We spanned a total of 2.5 months of research, testing and outside, more thorough evaluations provided by Edmunds, Consumer's Reports, Kelly Blue Book and the brand websites themselves.  We were thorough.  Edmunds and Kelly both list the Acura MDX as having the lowest Total Costs of Ownership (TCO) of the 3 brands we listed above.  That matters to us.  The reliability was also important since we were downsizing from 2 cars (2013 Infiniti G37X and a 2012 RX-350) to 1 and really needed to know what we would be relying on.  Stakes are high.  Re-sale values were also key to minimizing our total costs - so how the car looked and how well the interior/exterior matched as well as the prevalence of certain colors remaining from last year's models told us what was selling and what wasn't, so we avoided those that appeared to be lingering resulting from the public market's taste and consequent purchasing behaviors.  How it went was this: Audi clearly has the performance edge, but the ratings for the Q5/SQ5 were not as good as the Q7, but the Q7 was too large for us.  The Q5 and SQ5 CR ratings and TCO of the Q5/SQ5 were not favorable to the MDX or Lexus, historically, however, they have invested for the 2018 line to improve it.  It is too soon for the data to say anything conclusive, except the performance was very good for the newly improved car.  Since the interior trims were too limited, we scratched Audi, not really knowing about the ""Sport"" mode available for the MDX at that decision point - the performance at high altitudes and climbing the I70 to over 11,000 feet on the way to where we live identified as a key metric.  The Lexus was very good and we were used to its design and performance - it was powerful enough, and very quiet, about the right size.  Yet, the 3 Lexus dealerships we visited ( 1 was visited 4X) could not provide the inventory for us to compare the look of the exterior colors to the interior colors.  They were kind enough and very professional, but did not deliver on what we needed to see to compare.  Everything else remains Lexus quality - very good.  Enter Acura: Lowest TCO.  Yes, you can push a button on the center console and switch from ""Drive or Normal"" mode to ""Sport"" mode where the 9 gears are used slightly longer and higher up the RPM scale while the intake and exhaust valves are re-calibrated to descend into the combustion chambers slightly more for higher performance.  Off the line, it is not as fast as the Audi SQ5 ( 5.0 seconds to 60 MPH) but it does move much faster than the Lexus RX350 - RX450H (has the CVT transmission which really ""lags"" when you need to move yourself around busy traffic).  We decided to purchase from Mile High Acura in Denver since their Senior Sales Consultant - Matt Heintz - is a multiple award winning sales performer, yet is excellent of his product knowledge and integrative/non-presumptive of what you want.  He asks.  He provides.  He informs.  He went through the final transactions quickly, demonstrated the controls, introduced us to the maintenance shop management and we were on our way in under 2 hours.  On our way home, this is what Matt and the MDX did for us:Matt's high competence was on full-power today while meeting our demanding schedule while between/during our client calls.I set the MDX to ""Sport"" mode to make our client dinner appointment in time in Breckenridge.  Driving through town and merging into fast traffic flows was easy, climbing the I70 to 11,000 feet going into the Eisenhower Tunnel was no problem.  Ha! I even passed by an Audi Q5 struggling to maintain speed.The blind spot tech, lane centering ( 3 gentle tugs) came in handy while driving in busy patterns followed by backing down our long driveway using the panoramic cameras made it easier.Our purchase has been validated on that drive alone.  Yesterday, we had business associates on a hike with us.  It started to snow.  I went back and got the MDX and set the 2 rear captains chairs to high heat.  The dirt road to get to the group was already covered with already-driven on hard snow pack and ice and pitched steeply downhill.  I left the car in ""Drive or Normal"" mode.  While taking it slow, the car did not slip or lose traction at all, while the dashboard indicators flashed a few times indicating the SH-AWD was actively compensating and channeling the torque/power to whichever wheel(s) were the best choice for traction and control, while going over a very irregular dirt road.  By the time I got to the group, all the seats were toasty - they thought it was ""AWESOME"" while climbing in.  My wife is very pleased with it and we both are still learning the tech of the car and how to set it all up, but it is intuitive once you get it set.  It does not distract you like the RX350/450H controls do while driving.  We have reason to be optimistic, perhaps you will find this thorough review and recommendations helpful.",5

5393, on 07/14/17 09:59 AM (PDT),Nancy ,2017 Acura MDX SUV Advance Package 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 9A),My favorite MDX so far," I've owned 2004, 2010 and now the 2017 Acura MDX.  The 2017 is an awesome car.  I looked at the Infinity QX60 and Audi Q7, and I thought the MDX drove the nicest and was the most comfortable.  The improvements between the 2010 and 2017 were many.   The handling is better, the seats are comfortable, the 4 captain  chairs are great,  the sun shield are handy,  the rear camera and views are very helpful.  I am averaging 27mpg (on the 2010 I averaged 18mpg)  I think the fit and finish is way better with the 2017 model.   The sensors work, almost too good.   I have noticed that when I'm driving back roads and have a sharp right turn and there is a vehicle is approaching at the turn, the ""brake"" sensor illuminates.   I do not mind the engine energy saving when at a complete stop, I've learned to anticipate when to let the foot off the brake to restart the car and continue on my way.  I was concerned about purchasing the MDX after reading some of the reviews here, and I'm so glad that made the decision to buy it.eUpdate:  I've owned the MDX for 9 months and have been able  to drive it in winter conditions.  The MDX handles Michigan winters flawlessly.  I appreciate the Auto Start to warm up the car before I get in it, the seats and steering wheel are warm and toasty when it below zero outside.  The 4 captains chairs available with the Advanced package have turned out to be great.  There is more room in the 2nd row since the chairs can be adjusted and I do not feel bad having a couple sit back there because of the ample leg room.  All in all, the MDX is a great car.  I will own it for years.",5

It drove jerky from day one. It is not just ""me getting used to a 9-speed transmission"" like the dealer is telling me. It does shift jerky and frequently slows down independent of what I am doing on the gas or brake. Will occasionally jerk strongly and repeatedly like it is about to stall when driving 35mph for several miles with no need for gears to shift at all. I took it back to dealer within 2-3 weeks of purchase. They claimed could find nothing wrong. It continued as before and before I could get back to the dealer a week or so later this happened: Stuck in stop and go highway traffic for half hour. Every press on the gas was herky jerky but suddenly when traffic finally started to move freely, a press on the gas produced nothing but RPM's revving. I took my foot off the gas and tried again 2-3 times. I put on my flashers and barely rolled to the shoulder through the swerving traffic. I turned off the car and restarted to make my way jerkily back home. Second trip to dealer is so far producing the same bs that they can find no problem. I just found several stories online of same problem. Unless they fix this I am not driving this death machine.",1

My wife and I sat in and drove many SUVs. We felt like this SUV offered a lot more than the others for the price. The biggest/best surprise is the SH-AWD (google torque vectoring if you haven't already) which makes the car a lot of fun to drive and adds a spare tire. The ELS sound system is great. The safety features should be standard on all vehicles -- the technology package adds the blind spot detection which is awesome. I was worried that the transmission would at least take some getting used to given the complaints but it's great actually. Their are plenty of YouTube videos explaining why it feels a little funny between 2 gears but I have honestly not had a problem in any IDS mode (sport, comfort, normal). The complaints don't seem to be primarily regarding reliability. I was also worried I wouldn't like the shifter after so many complaints. It is actually very easy to use and keeps me from ever having to look down. It has the added benefit of protecting you from changing gears when you shouldn't (i.e. P while driving, D while shutting off the engine, etc...) which ultimately saves wear on your transmission. Good warranty compared to the other SUVs (7 years on the drive train). The infotainment system is just ok even with the tech package but has all of the functionality I need. I wish that it had a panoramic sunroof. If you compare to other vehicles in the class, for example the Lexus RX, Audi Q7, Volvo XC90 etc.. or even the Pilot, Pathfinder, Highlander, and Forester, I thought the Acura was ultimately the best bang for your buck.",5

Very disappointed and frankly surprised that Acura would install such a ""behind the times"" old technology blurry camera from another decade into this high end car. I have had other cars that cost less and their cameras are far more superior and way sharper then this one. Fix the problem or recall it Acura!!! Its dangerous to rely on your blurry camera to back up. Its a lawsuit waiting to happen.

That's based on the black on black combo we got. Bought it after selling our pilot (you will be missed). Anyway , the Pilot's big bro MDX is a great vehicle. I have never seen my wife more happy with a car we ever owned, than with this. On the road its calm , serene and commands a presence of its own. If the  diamond grill and 22"" wheels don't turn much heads, then the jewel eyes sure do it. It has a mind of its own even if you are feeling sleepy and it will tell you that by beeping every time you get too close to another car. Be it changing lanes or head on. Automatic braking is the most understated feature. Come to think of it, there have been times when I was driving another car and wished they had this one feature. Ample space for a family of 4 and spare seats for those once in 6 months or a year need for extra. Yes it comes with 2 memory sets of mirror and seating paired with 2 sets of keys. So when wife drives it mirror automatically set to her taste and when I do , it welcomes me with open arms and pre-adjusted seats and mirrors. Automatic liftgate, keyless car access and ambient lights give a feeling of luxury so does filling the gas tank with premium, only pinching , while drinking. That's about the only pinch though. For buyers, with remorse, who would get a touring or elite younger brother, this gives a justified peace to its owner with the fact that its just couple of thousand more than the younger sibling. It also displays authority, with the body styling, shows seriousness, with 9 speed auto and means business when compared to the touring or elites, of which it claims none but possesses both.

It's not 100% perfect on design, but it's pretty darn close.  Let me summarize simply with Pro's and Con's. PRO'S are: Awesome handling with SH-AWD, I mean really awesome. Just about as good as my E92 M3, I totally mean that, for all intents and purposes on the street. The semi-autonomous driving features are great. The Lane Keeping system, the Adaptive Cruise Control with Follow, Blind spot warning, all make it ALOT safer to drive in these days of distracted driving. You must study the functionality of each system to know when you can and should not rely on them. But overall I find them productive and adding to safety for me and those around me. Comfort is 8.5 of 10. Seats are not super duper, but definitely more than acceptable. You can customize the crap out of all the systems, and if you read the 500 page manual like I did, you will be amazed at what this car can do. Walk away auto locking system is quite nice. WIth the right setup in the menu, you never, ever have to take the key out of your pocket/purse. Just walk in, walk out, the car does exactly what you want, when you want it, and you just never touch a button on the remote, EVER.  Worried about the car being locked? You can send it a message via your remote, querying the lock status, and I've tested that at 100 yards remote distance, no problem! Engine is satisfactory - it ain't a Porsche, BMW, but it gets the job done. The 9 spd tranny does fine! All these complaints about transmission hunting around for a gear, but I have not noticed it.  Auto engine stop awesome, auto brake hold system awesome. Headlights are freaking amazing, SO BRIGHT.  Sound system is 8.5/10. I have heard better, but this is totally fine. Mileage is pretty darn good, on a freeway going about 65  you can easily get 25mpg if not closer to 28-29mpg. CON'S: the navigation system sort of sucks, compared to Google Maps. You can't beat Google with it's machine learning and real-time mobile updates on traffic etc. Plus the processor powering the Nav and the Phone menus is slow and outdated. But usable if you have to. One huge con is for USB flash drives, the search functionality is AWFUL, as you can only scroll the huge list of songs or folders, you cannot search by Artist, Title, etc.... If you want to bring your own music, you better have a large iPOD, in which case the Search/Selection functionality is reasonable.  OVERALL: definitely a car you will enjoy taking road trips with.",5

However this will be my last purchase from them. I have an 2017 MDX. The GPS and entertainment system is unusable. Don't take my word for it try it before you think about a purchase.GPS does not work- If you try take a different turn then directed on the route, most GPS is will recalculate and redirect you. Not this system. They have made a design change where the GPS will actually direct you off the road. Apparently my dealer tells me that they know about the problem for a long time and hoping for a fix. The car does not allow you to cancel the route as you are driving.The voice activated commands absent do not work. Dealer says they know about this. They tell you not to use the voice activated system.The dealer tells me that the MDX system is not entertainment compatible with iPhone (somewhat odd given their popularity).",2

Good power, great ride, it has a sporty suspension that can take jumping a curb or ramming through uneven pavement going 60 mph. So that's a plus.

First the wiper and light controls should be lit at night: they are not.  The biggest issue I have with them is that they lack the European feedback that BMW offers, i.e., I like to not have to look down to see what gear I'm in, what level wiper I am on, or what light is on.

There is a soft thump thump when I first start the car and reach 20 mph. I don't know if it is transmission, engine or suspension knock. There is a rattle on the pass door somewhere. The shifter is on the left of the center console and gets in the way of my right knee/leg. Info center is too small and in wrong place. No compass.",3.875

The 3rd row folds down flat for lots of cargo space when not using the 3rd row.

5521, on 10/02/17 21:53 PM (PDT),LeawoodEsq ,2011 Acura MDX SUV Technology and Entertainment Packages 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Nearly Perfect," The 2011 Acura MDX with Technology and Entertainment packages is a very good mid-sized SUV . Some reviews call it a large SUV, but to the owner of a Chevy Suburban and a GMC Acadia, it is mid-sized and shows it most in the third row seating. Other reviews have covered the high points - quality of materials, driving position, handling, power, transmission, and the fantastic ELS sound system among them - so I am going to focus on the few things that detract and may have all been corrected in the latest model. The backup camera at night that is so dark it is dangerous to rely on for backing up. The radio tuning knob seems to be geared at 50:1 - you'll know what I mean when you try to go from Channel 18 to Channel 176 on Sirius/XM. The side mirrors do not fold electrically. The tailgate that does not power open when using the outside hand release. The third row seats do not power up and down, an inconvenience when hands are full. And there is no push-button start/keyless entry, which is hard to explain when so many other contemporary, comparable vehicles have it. On balance, however, I enjoy owning and driving the 2011 MDX. The engine pulls well, the transmission always seems to be in the correct gear and drops down quickly for rapid acceleration, and the steering is quick. The relatively short wheelbase makes parking easy. The high-beam headlights are as outstandingly bright as the backup camera is dim at night. The center stack of the dashboard - the topic of broad criticism - is straightforward if you compartmentalize it into three sections: top for HVAC, middle for media, and bottom for navigation/information. The ride is compliant and not too harsh for an SUV. The buttery-soft leather seating is of a very high grade and the front and second-row seats are very comfortable. After 67,000 miles it looks brand new. A great mid-sized SUV that seats five adults comfortably and two children in the third row in a pinch.",4

For the most part, I have been very happy  with the performance of the vehicle, however I was shocked to receive a $4,000 estimate to replace my front struts and rear shocks from the dealer for the car's ""electronic"" suspension. At the dealership, the Acura maintenance person told me the expense would be covered under the extended warranty. As Acura had extended the warranty particularly for problems with the SUV's electronic suspension, they had acknowledged the problem and were doing the ""right"" thing by repairing it for free. However, the maintenance person went back on his word and subsequently informed me that my vehicle actually did not qualify for the extended warranty. I further voiced my complaints by calling the Acura Care line, and the representative told me there was a good chance that Acura could make a ""goodwill exception"" for my vehicle, allowing the repair to be covered under the warranty. However, once the representative called me back, he informed me that because I bought the car with greater than 100,000 miles on it, albeit from a relative, it did not qualify. I just wanted to post this review to draw attention to my experience. Overall, I have enjoyed the car, however I will never buy an Acura again. $4,000 - $7,000 expenses on a car worth $17,000 doesn't make sense, and I’ve been very disappointed by the false promises made by the company.",2

No car I have ever driver beats its user friendly approach and boasts the same functionality. Acura service is fantastic. You get Lexus like service without the cost. Sure its more than my wife's toyota or a Honda, but only marginally. If I had to come up with a complaint it is this: I get all service done at the dealer and just about everytime I am in there they have some sort of recommended service. Then again, I think all dealers do this. It has plenty of acceleration when using the paddle shifters (which are great), but the std acceleration could be a tad better for those very heavy foot drivers. But the handling is great and the driveability is perfect. SH-AWD is money in the corners and about 18mpg with this is good enough for me - esp since I have a heavier foot. I am a big guy at 6'5"" 260lbs and this car gives me plenty of room. Even the back seat is nice with its reclining seats. 3rd row is for small adults or kids.

It is stylish, sporty, and everything I could have asked for. I can drive alone, or load family and friends and still enjoy the ride.  The one thing I don't like in Acura MDX are the front wipers. They stink! The wipers started jumping within few months of my buying the MDX and Acura could not fix it. So I am living with it. My transmission failed once and they fixed it because it was under warranty.  Anyway, I think MDX is a great car. I love every bit of it. ",4.75

Its been two years and it still turns heads on the road (even mine after I park it) because the styling is simple, yet screams I have 300 hp under this hood.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with the Acura brand from a prestige, reliability and value standpoint.

Plenty of passing power and very comfortable on long trips. Acuras are rare in Germany and I get stares all the time by curious Bavarians wondering what kind of vehicle I have.

Honda/Acura did a great job with the suspension and driver aids.   The interior space is very nice.  This car is wider than most of the competition so that translates into more passenger comfort when you have more than two passengers in the back seat. The third row is fine for kids or adults on short trips.  I am disappointed in the gas mileage.  In the city I am lucky to get over 12 mpg.   On the highway I get about 19.  Nowhere near the numbers advertised.  I also find it pretty pathetic that a $40K+ vehicle has fake plastic wood.  I have had panel gap issues.  ,4

Other than increased cornering ability and better brakes, this car is a step back from the previous MDX. The steering wheel is seriously uncomfortable and the centre console hurts my elbow if I am resting my arm on it while steering. The front footwells have poor room. The motor is rough for a luxury car and suffers from a serious flat spot between 4500 and 6000 rpm meaning performance is more theoretical than actual. For the NE the ride is real hard and the car bounces from bump to bump as opposed to flowing over the road so it cannot be trusted at speed. This car may be good on a track for a suv but is seriously flawed as a family vehicle for the road.",3.25

This could be dangerous if attempting to make a quck turn in on-coming traffic. You want to go, but the MDX moves very slowly or not at all.Second, the cabin lets in so much air that during the winter, the heat must be set to keep the cabin warm, especially at the feet.Last, the MDX looses lots of horsepower as it cycles through the gears.

However on rough roads, I notice wheel noise. I am impressed with little sound from the outside entering in the cab. I forget what other vehicles sound like as they rush by in this car.

Spacious interior, although 3rd row seating is not for adults - it's more a 6 seater than 7.  All other features are great, independent rare AC - love it.

Have not had any big problem with the brakes, except a little slow/sloppy when fully loaded with 5 people and a load of cargo.  Big disappointment is gas mileage.  One of the reasons I bought the MDX is because I wanted better gas mileage than my previous guzzling LX470 - but mileage is way below advertised, and not much better than the much bigger and heavier V8 powered LX470.

When I bought the car I went for the 12 month extended warranty for an extra $1200. About 11 months into owning the car I got a check engine light and flashing D5 light. Took it to the Acura dealer. Trans DEAD!!! They replaced it for free since it was under warranty and gave me a loaner while they did it. So then about 2 years ago I notice the trans slamming into gear. Changed fluid....same crap. So October 2014 D4 blinking light and check engine light AGAIN!!! Car would not switch out 4th gear. I took it to a trans place and had the trans totally rebuilt new Valve body, PC, gears and synchros. The builder took pics of the trans it was HORRIBLE all burned up and stuff. So what Honda does is place the trans cooler into the Rad so I have no idea how but the cooling fluid got into the trans fluid probably because trans cooler in the rad and ruined the trans. So the builder added an EXTERNAL trans cooler. So now just a few days ago.....D5 blinking light. But no check engine light and car drives fine. I took the car back to the builder and he said there were no trans codes in the history or anything. I'm so done with this car. I am VERY VERY disappointed in Honda. All the Honda 5sp Autos are pure garbage and they should be ashamed of themselves. Other than the 2 trans I had to replace the car is awesome. But that trans ruins it!

The Hybrid semi-autonomous systems work incredibly well (including the Lane Keep Assist, which makes the car nearly self-driving, with no ping-ponging from side to side), and the versatility of operational customization through the settings menu is stellar.  The four-drive-mode setup is also excellent, essentially allowing you to own three very different cars that you can instantly call up, depending on your mood and purpose in the moment. (The difference between Comfort and Normal is subtle, but Sport and Sport+ transform the car.) I know that some people feel the interior design and materials fall below that of other ""luxury"" cars, but I find the cabin very well made, very useful and very attractive. Like most BMW's, the interior is solid and understated, and avoids the ostentatious bling-bling look that some now equate with luxury and ""prestige."" This is a luxury car, but without pretension. The lack of glitzy features (like the completely unnecessary gimmick of Google Earth in the NAV system) is a relief, and makes the car functionally safer because of the lack of distractions. (If you want to play video games, I'd suggest you stay at home. If you want to know where you're going, simple map graphics are required.) Operationally, the Hybrid is complex enough in operation and functional options, that a new owner should take some time familiarizing himself or herself while still in the garage.

For an average size and weight, this car is humongous, lots of space for the entire family. We were able to test the seating capacity, drove for about an hour and a half — no complaints; but I will not suggest it for a very long drive as the middle sit of the second row is quite uneasy to look at. Perhaps this can cary 6 adults and 2 kids? Acceleration is quite good for its size and the MPG was easily achieved, actually moe than the advertised combined MPG.

So here's the deal, after test driving all the trim levels, I decided on the base model. Reason being, it comes with all the options that you will ever need. The tech package is  advantageous if you REALLY need the blind spot monitor. However this car is very easy to drive/switch lanes and is proportioned very well. And keep in mind, tech package adds a pretty penny to the purchase price.  I had the new body X5 but was paying an arm and leg in lease payments so immediately got rid of it, meanwhile the MDX has more options and is half the price.  But going back to the car, it drives well, size is relatively small thus making it easy to drive for smaller statured people, has great utility, and actually fun to drive so long as you have the SHAWD.  The only drawback is the infotainment system. However, with the 2018's having apple carplay, it makes it bearable.  The shifter is annoying in the beginning, but easy to get used to. The Infiniti QX60 is probably the only viable competitor but to get standard options with AWD that you get in the mdx , it will drive up the price significantly. Added bonus is you get a fleet of standard safety and driver aid options with the base. If youre in the market, just go with the base model with SHAWD. Youre welcome!",4

Put it in sport at a stop light and it is a rocket ship taking off.  O.K. not a Tesla, but for as big as it is it gets up and goes.  I haven't driven up to Tahoe yet so I can't say how it performs climbing the hills.  If it is anything like the previous 2004 MDX, I am sure it will do great.  I am happy with the gas mileage on the freeway.  I have achieved 25 mpg at 75 mph.  That is on the flat.  City mileage is around 16 to 18 mpg.  I love the LED headlights.  I don't like that the headlights do not self adjust when the car is loaded.  For the price and that it is the Advanced Package, Acura should have installed load sensors and headlight adjustment motors.  On coming traffic really does not like to be blinded by LED lights.  That is a big letdown in my opinion for a '17 SUV.   I am not real happy with the voice activation everything.  It is very clunky, does not understand your voice and very slow.  If you have not memorized the commands it will just frustrate the hell out of you.  I also don't like the little upper screen and the very grainy picture for parking assist.  My '04 MDX with the rear view camera had a more clear, crisp picture.  I don't like that I couldn't get 18"" or 19"" wheels.  They are 20"" and are not low profile tires or run-flats.  I wanted a smaller wheel so it won't bend so easily when you hit a pot hole.  Aluminum wheels bend easy and are really, really expensive to replace.   I am not real happy with the active cruise control.  I was zooming along at 75 mph the other day with the car in front of me going the same speed.  We were in the middle lane of a three line freeway.  A car from the fast lane decided it want to be in the far right lane.  With no blinker, they moved between me and the car in front and then to the far right lane.  The active cruise freaked out, slammed on the brakes (collision avoidance) and sounded the alarm and the flashing orange light on the dash.  It scared the $h_T out of me!!!  When I bought the car I asked if the radar could be turned off and the cruise control be regular cruise.  ""Yes"" they told me.  No you  actually can't.  I tried.  Today I was listening to a podcast on my i-phone (6) when I got a phone call.  I answered the call and I could her the caller, but she could not hear me.  This is the first time I have had a problem with an incoming call.  My wife has an i-phone (8 plus) and the contacts will not completely load.  Acura says it is and Apple software problem.  I can not comment on the cost of maintenance yet as I have not had anything done on it yet.  I have changed the oil because on a new engine I like to change the oil withing a few thousand miles to drain out the engine break-in byproducts.   Over all I am very happy with this car.  It is fun to drive and very comfortable.",5

I will say that our 2015 & 2018 MDX are not near as sporty as the previous generation that ""included Super Handling all Wheel Drive"". For some reason Acura still does not have a panoramic sunroof or heads up display.  All Acuras still do include the ""old school"" style sunroof when most other MFR's gouge you for about $2000.  At one time all Acuras came one way - fully loaded. As time goes on Acura is starting to become like the other MFRs by being slick & greedy with all the confusing different packages. All cars of this class should also come standard with NAVI. Acura used to stand out much further than it does now because you did not have to ""build the car""!  At least they are now finally offering a nice looking black rim but it is about 10 years late and they try to bend you over for more than two grand! Overall the MDX does offer a very high end luxury experience with a ton of interior space. It would be even better if the second row seats could retract further back though.",4

PROS:  Very comfortable especially for my taller husband, most switches in easy reach, manipulation of back seats very easy, lots of cargo room, peppy engine for larger SUV, grips the road very well.     CONS:  Very noisy cab- lots of road noise and wind noise.  Burnt smell occasionally coming from circulation vents- mechanics have not been able to source it so not fixed over almost 5 years of ownership.  Controls on steering wheel not intuitive.  Climate control difficult and not real efficient.  Of the 2 USB ports, one quit working after a year (front of console).  Biggest and most dangerous issue was an issue with electronics; warning lights would come on, often several, radio lights would come on, engine would speed up and not be under normal control (this was after a year of ownership, still under warranty).  This progressed to multiple attempts to start (warning lights all on and acting like dead battery).  Would get jumps to start, bought a new battery and the car would still be difficult.  Became dangerous to drive so was hauled to dealer by tow truck.  Dealer attempted a repair that was not successful and car died again when out of town.  Dealer tried to fix again and was unsuccessful- could not find issue.  Finally had a relative who was a mechanic tell us about a Honda recall on electrical issues and steering column electronics.  Had dealer do the fix for the Honda issue and this fixed the problem.  Look up related Honda issues for Acura issues.",4

If I knew about these things years ago I would have purchased one then.  The size, power, handling, safety and comfort just seem to all work together.

6031, on 08/14/16 09:18 AM (PDT),Anonymous ,2013 Acura MDX SUV Technology Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Satisfied with my Purchase," I purchased my 2013 MDX in April of 2016 as a Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle. I researched the vehicle for about 5 months before finally making a purchase, I wanted to make sure I was buying a reliable vehicle since the car I traded in for the Acura was less than reliable. While I am overall very satisfied with my purchase the MDX did fall short in a few areas, at least for the 2013 year, there is no push button ignition, backup camera is very blurry and useless at night, and the vehicle likes to shift out of first gear very quickly which can be aggravating instantly losing that power(shifts at about 2200 RPM, would be smoother shifting around the 3000 RPM point), I also don't like the lever release for the parking brake, I'm use to ""push to release"" parking brakes, but it's no big deal. With those 4 complaints though, the MDX makes up for it in other areas. For starters, it runs great, there is no shortage of power and the engine has an amazing sound running through the RPMs. The vehicle also handles like a dream, you can take it on a mountain road and not feel like it's going to tip over or that you need to crawl up the mountain. Of course the appearance is what first caught my attention to consider the MDX, I have received nothing but compliments from coworkers and friends over the way the vehicle looks, it has a very aggressive front and rear end. The stereo is also amazing, while I could stand it to be a little louder at times, most people are not going to have an issue at all. I also get decent gas mileage, I average around 20 MPG, given the size and horsepower I don't consider that bad at all, although requiring premium gas does make that number a little irrelevant spending at least 50 cents more per gallon at the pump than a rival running on regular. One issue that has been prevalent since I purchased the car has been a vibration that comes and goes, after changing 2 of the tires it went away then came back a few weeks later, running the car to 5500 RPM completely eliminated the vibration, now only a slight vibration shows up on rare occasions and goes away shortly after. I have also noticed complaints about bearings going bad fairly quickly on the MDX, I have an appointment soon to check a slight roaring noise that I believe may be one of the bearings. Overall though, i would recommend the vehicle to anyone.",5

After loads of research and test driving it was easy to zero in on the final 2 of RX 350 and MDX. MDX won due to following. Exceptional road handling over RX 350. Killer looks to match the Road handling. Excellent acceleration combined with the growl from under the hood makes you feel like a F1 race driver. And finally I only saw 5 star user reviews for MDX. I have now clocked 45000 miles in 2 years. (No major repairs only maintenance so far) Still feel like a kid getting into it every morning. Feels good to drive it knowing it will not fail me and give me the best driving experience. I just returned from the 2016 LA Auto show and realized my MDX is still so very good. I do get 17.5mpg combined. Highly, highly recommend this car. I wish Acura continued with the same or higher powered engines for the 2016 and up models.

I suppose we should've read actual owner reviews.  The model appealed to us largely due to its advertised ""luxury"", and its size (with third-row seating) was a good match for our family of five.  At $50,400, our SH-AWD model with Tech Package was certainly priced in the premium segment over the Honda Pilot on which it's based on.  Unfortunately, as time went on, we grew to like the vehicle less and less.  Amongst our major complains are the lack of luxury.  This car simply does not feel luxurious.  The windows (all four of them), when lowered even slightly, rattle uncontrollably.  There is literally a half-inch of play.  Acura dealer says this is normal.  We don't think it is.  The rattle is not only VERY audible and annoying, but it doesn't befit a $50k luxury SUV.  Second, the overall interior feels cheap.  Many parts are not aligned correctly, the materials feel like they were made by the lowest bidder.  For example, our steering column cover has a huge gap in it.  The pieces were clearly not correctly attached at the factory.  When I brought this up with the dealer, he blamed me for breaking them and quoted me a price to replace it.  Which brings me to my other major disappointment.  Service.  They do not treat their customers like valued luxury-brand car owners.  They're more interested in constantly selling their high-margin services (ATF Fluid change, cabin filter, etc.), rather than addressing known issues.  Our local Acura dealer is consistently cold-calling us, trying to sell us ""specials"".  All this, despite the fact that Acura corporate tells me I do not need any service that is not displayed on the dash board.  We're not due for an ATF Fluid change until 20k-40k miles.  Our dealer said it was dirty and had to be changed at just 8k miles!   The power liftgate has been to service three times now.  Each time they claim to fix it, it breaks a day later.  I don't even bother taking it in anymore.  But reliability isn't a major issue for us.  The car has been relatively low-maintenance.  It's the little things that ultimately add-up to a less-than expected experience.  The infotainment system for example.  I'd expect it to be a little better.  We own a 2015 VW GTI (for which we paid roughly half the price - $25k), yet the infotainment has a beautiful, fluid interface.  It's fast, responsive, and does what you need it to do.  The infotainment on our Acura MDX has an interface as if it were designed by a first-year graphic design student.  They really aimed for the bare minimum.  It's also slow and unresponsive.  Changing functions or settings often results in a 2-3 second lag.  Why not use an updated processor?  The premium ELS Audio (as Acura calls it), is also, sadly, a joke.  It simply sounds horrible.  I don't have many cars to compare it to other than our 2015 VW GTI, whose premium ""Fender"" audio system is simply generations ahead of the one in our MDX.   We're frankly just not that impressed at this, supposedly ""luxurious"" vehicle.  It feels anything but, with a lot of the interior pieces feeling loose, being misaligned, and a the rattling windows and doors feel like they'll fall apart.  I was quite optimistic about the vehicle when we first leased it, but over the past two years I've grown to really dislike it.  We can't wait for our lease to be up next year.",2

Biggest disappointment is nav-still use my phone, yet paid big bucks for what I thought would be luxurious, it is cumbersome & unuseful- never never use, sad technology. Radio reception can be shaky, connection light goes in & out(including volumn)-I live in metro area & should be clear as a bell. I am frustrated because what I read was so stellar on the MDX, car of the year. I realize I am fussy but I thought I was paying for that. Not so.

Do not feel special in the least driving this car, what has happened to that's a cool looking car. Bottom line I would not have spent the extra money on an acura, it's not that great. Unfortunately, this is my dream car for a long time.

After looking at many different manufacturers and not wanting to go back to a GM product due to repair and breakdown issues we settled on the Audi and the Acura.  Looking at and test driving both vehicles we both felt the Acura was more comfortable, offered better visibility and had a nicer interior.  We went with it and the MDX has been fantastic.  Definitely a 5 Star ***** vehicle.  Performance, handling and overall satisfaction could not be higher.",5

For reference, these include:      Body panels were missing attachment clips when car was delivered, quarter panel and bumper came loose. Multiple electrical issues including a bad alternator that dealer took 3 visits to diagnose. Satellite radio failed. Braking became uneven in the first year, dealer refused to address (in tolerance), now needs a brake job after <30k, abnormal tire wear, white paint comes off of car with the most minor contact (paint is thinner to save weight, per dealer), transmission shifts oddly with a great deal of engine noise (within tolerance). Aside from the quality issues, the electronics are poorly executed and difficult to use. You need to read the manual to learn how to change a radio station...and don't dare try to change audio or climate control while you are driving, its is so complicated as to be genuinely dangerous. I just had a great call with Acura customer service where I was told that I should bring the car back to the dealer and discuss all of these issues, again, with no support from Acura. This was once a great brand that produced great products, the MDX should really be out of the premium SUV category and reviewed against Hyundai, GM, Ford, and Toyota, it is premium to those products only in terms of price.",2

Driving experience is excellent, comfy, well responsive, good visibility to the front. Poor visibility to the back when parking. Infotainment is big mess. I find using my i-phone more than car's features, because it takes so much time to enter or find any Point of interest from Acura database which is extremely poor or algorithms for searching are poorly designed. Acura owns apology to all owners for this mess and perhaps free update to fix it. It is also very slow in response and user experience requires numerous endless clicks to get to anything. I prefer hands down my GPS in 10 year old Honda Pilot EX than this new Acura. It seems that a lot of owners are furious over this infotainment fiasco. I really want to love this vehicle but in the future I will definitely look more closely at many other brands before buying another Acura.",3

Owned a TL and a TSX so familiar with the Acura style.   Overall - great SUV.  The most striking thing you will notice 1st is the ride.  Here in N. Texas, very bumpy riding on hard concrete roads that heat crack and leave you wishing for quite & smooth blacktop. The MDX performs extremely well taking a lot of the smashing right out of the ride.   The leather on the seats is the softest I've ever encountered.  Handling is great with the AWD.  Engine power is throaty and responsive.   For improvements, the NAV is crazy.  Found the best way is to just type in the address (good display for such).  Trying to use the voice recognition for NAV is just stupid.  You say,  ""Dallas, TX"" and it says ""Ft. Lauderdale, FL.""  Whatever.  Also stupid is that the NAV system locks (most features) while driving.  Come on!  Hey Acura, there is a passenger who can NAV while driving!    Any new car with a lot of features will eventually make you reach to understand the system instead of being intuitive.  The NAV takes time.  Once you have the address in, the NAV works great. Storage is good so long as the 3rd seats are not used.  Using the seats leaves you with a small space left.  Also, these 3rd-row seats are kid seats as grown ups will have a difficult time getting to them and being comfortable.  I've had luck with the quality- no issues.  Got a recall notice for the bolt on the compressor for AC.  Easy fix they say.  Dealership experience is great.  Give you a free Acura loaner if your request.   This is my wife's car and she loves it for herself and our daughter.   In fact, my daughter always wants to take the MDX over my car.",5

6061, on 08/13/15 08:16 AM (PDT),CORunner ,2015 Acura MDX SUV SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Huge disappointment!," I have owned my 2015 MDX for about 8 months so far. I have tried to love it, or even like it, but I cannot. I traded in my 2008 MDX after six years of loyal service to “upgrade” to the new model. That was a big mistake.The 2008 MDX was a great car and I loved it from the day that I bought it. It wasn’t perfect, but it was good at almost everything. The 2015 was a hassle starting on the day I drove it home. It was raining really hard outside, so we did most of the deal looking at the showroom floor model. My mistake. The salesman informed me that all models had parking sensors, fog lights, and Michelin tires and I assumed that he was correct. In fact, he had lied about all three… I got the dealership to agree to swap my tires to Michelins for free (they only come on the top of the line model now). The fog lights and parking sensors were something I should have checked, so I decided to pay for the upgrades myself. Buyer beware. The fog lights went in without issue, but the parking sensors were a joke. When you upgrade, you can only get rear sensors, not front, and they are not the same sensors that are used on the top model. My installed sensors were not flush with the bumper and they did not work. I had to back almost completely into a brick wall to make them start beeping. So a 50% success rate for dealer installed options. Not impressed. Why Acura would dream of building a $50,000 CUV, make it longer, and not include parking sensors as standard is beyond me!The changes from the 2008 to the 2015, or rather the 2nd generation MDX to the 3rd, were largely not improvements. The power to weight ratio is better on the new car, but acceleration feels anemic in comparison. The suspension is absolutely awful. I had the electromagnetic dampers on my 2008 and it was impressive in the corners! The new model feels far less confident when pushed and my front dampers have developed a constant squeak that causes pedestrians to watch my car as I drive past. The stereo in the old MDX was one of my favorite features and somehow they managed to ruin that on the new model as well. The bass response is weak at best. The touch screen controls are simply awful and make things like adjusting the fan speed for the climate control dangerous while driving. The safety features, like lane departure warning was such a nuisance that I had to disable it. The forward collision warning is dangerous. Mine would go off randomly when I wasn’t near another car! The last thing I want is for my car to slam on the brakes and cause an accident that otherwise would not happen. I spoke with the dealership about the function and was informed that sometimes metal manhole covers or expansion joints will cause the system to produce a false positive. Another safety feature that I had to disable. The materials used inside look and feel cheap. I have a black interior and much of the plastic actually appears to be dark brown. I have had people ask me about it as soon as they get into the car for the first time, so it is noticeable. Finally, the redesign has lowered the height of the vehicle, so while there is a slight increase in cargo space, I’m finding it to be less useable. Oh, I just received my first recall notice…Acura North America has been useless.To be fair, there are a few minor improvements. The cabin is generally much quieter, the LED headlights are great, and the gas mileage is better. I was previously getting 14-16 mpg city / 20-22 mpg highway and I am now seeing 19-21 city and 26-28 highway.If I could go back and undo this deal, I would! My 2008 MDX was superior in almost every way. Build quality has seriously gone downhill. I'm not sure if it's just with the introduction of the 3rd gen MDX or if it's also the assembly line moving from Canada to Alabama. If you are seriously considering a new MDX, I suggest that you take your money elsewhere. I wish I had.",2

I'm told at the service area that they can't find anything wrong and cannot pinpoint the problem, but will keep checking the their update sheets and if anything comes across, they will let me know.  This is a safety issue as far as I'm concerned as the breaking light comes on, my reaction is put the breaks on.Also, have a problem with the windows being down at high speeds, the tailgate wants to try to pop open, you can see gaps appear along the sides.  Again the service agent cannot find anything wrong.I have the heated seats and it feels as if they were never turned off, making it a little uncomfortable during the summer months.The interior is comfortable, but with a lot of road noise; handling is good and acceleration is really good.I am sorry that I spent what I did for this car.I have since traded my 2015 Acura for a 2016 GMC Acadia and am much happier with the overall performance and handling.",2

Handling is very light but easy to get used to. The interior is where the MDX shines, materials are very nice inside and easily accessible however having the tech package you certainly must be good with today's technology because at certain points it can feel overwhelming. Road quality if very nice as well, having owned the Audi Q7 it is very comparable. However only having 15,000 miles I cannot touch base on reliability quite yet.",3

I get a message that the camera is too hot.  10-15 minutes later, the cameras start working but by that time I am already home.  I purchased this car because of these safety features but did not realize they would not work.  What a waste.  The voice activated navigation system is equally poor and does not recognize addresses or place names so it is another lost cause.  I do not recommend buying this car for these features.On the plus side, the SUV is the most comfortable vehicle I have ever owned.  The seat hugs you, the ride is quiet and it is easy to drive.  This is why I want to love this SUV but the negatives outweigh these positives.  I purchased a high end vehicle specifically for these safety features and when they don't work, I end up hating the car all over again.  I will not buy or lease an Acura again.",3

If I drive the car awhile, and then park it for an hour or so, the next time I take it out, the car thermometer will read about 10C to 14C degrees higher than what it should be. As a result, the AC will then blow full blast for about 5-10 minutes until the thermometer gradually adjusts itself to the correct temperature as I drive around.

Purchased in Oregon and drove the AlCan highway up to Alaska in Feb. to where I live.  This vehicle handled every bit of snow & ice thrown at it. I drove 2400+ miles, for 3+ days on glaze slick roads & never felt a slip. Very comfortable & lots of room.  It drives much smaller than it is.  The LED lights are very crisp & reach pretty far.  The infotainment system is definitely something you have to get used to.  It does so many things & is extremely complex so initially it was a little overwhelming, but after a few hours of seat time, things are easy now.  I drove the RX450 Hybrid, Audi Q5 & Q7, VW Touareg & Pathfinder & the MDX won us. I recommend it.  *** UPDATE***Been about three years now and I'm still pretty excited about driving the MDX every time I walk towards it with the key in my pocket....  It's our vehicle of choice when it's icy or snowy outside as it handles most everything Alaska has thrown at it with ease.  The SH-AWD is amazing.  I'm still not very good at using some of the tech that's installed.  The voice command systems is a bit sketchy.  It misinterprets my commands quite often, although I've used others and have had similar results with others, so I think the technology industry wide is still getting up to speed.  There are a couple of bugs I've noticed in the electronic system, like heated seats won't work after I've auto-started it twice, but nothing that would change my mind about owning it.  We can load quite a bit of cargo in it so long trips and stops at Home Depot work well, and if I keep my foot out of the ""go fast"" pedal, we get in the lower 20mpg's combined.

We purchased a 2016 MDX technology - a non titled dealer loaner in Oct17 with 9800mi.  I cannot stand the jerking shifts the transmission makes when you start off.  It is flat out annoying.  And yes, as I read in reviews, it also lunges a bit when it downshifts right before a stop.  Scarry.  Also, if you use the paddles to downshift manually, the car goes into neutral for long pause between downshifts causing the vehicle to actually speed up (like it is in neutral)  when you want to click down and slow down.  The brakes are also questionable. It seems like there is air in the system.  They really grab well if you hit them a second time every time you are stopping. They don't seem affective if you don't.  We are also amazed how little drink holder utility there is.  Don't think about leaving with two drinks - ie coffee and water.  The USB ports are also extremely difficult to plug into.  This vehicle also need a new driver door seal as wind noise rushes in next to the drivers left ear.  And finally, good luck acclimating to the nav system.  Wish I had spent more time in the Infinity - The QX60 is so smooth so quiet and so roomy.  I hope I have given a potential buyer something to think about - especially the horrible transmission.",3

First, the good things: the car is spacious, our family of 4 took it on long road trips and it has enough space for all our stuff. It's not as much space as a Honda Pilot, but enough. The car is relatively quiet and has comfortable ride. Inside materials are fine, nothing special, but nice to look at and touch. If I could have this car for $40K, it would be a great deal. The things that are not so great: acceleration, you hit the gas and the car thinks a couple of seconds before deciding to lurch forward, redline and then slowly speed up. The only way to deal with this is floor it when merging on a highway or passing, then the car (most of the time), accelerates straight away and relatively smoothly. I got an advance package with lane assist and distance control. Distance control is 'ok on a highway (but I don't trust it in stop/go traffic). Lane assist is awfully designed, every 30 seconds it shows me to put my hands on the steering wheel (I usually have a couple fingers at the bottom of a steering wheel) and if I don't respond, it silently disengages and car starts to drift, WTF? How about an audible alert or something to tell me it's about to disengage before driving me into a ditch? The only time I use it is on a long stretch of a highway with not many turns or cars around when I can rest my hand on a steering wheel. The whole technology package (navigation, audio, etc.) was clearly outsourced to the lowest bidder in a third world country, in my opinion. Monochrome! button selection with no apps (at least it's touchscreen). My 2012 Toyota has better navigation/audio/apps than this 2016 Acura MDX (Yes, I am one of those folks who wants to listen to Pandora or check a forecast while stuck in traffic). Blutooth is bad too, the car decides to use my phone for making calls and my wife's phone for music, how is it even makes any sense? If you are willing to accept these limitations, MDX is not bad, mostly because it appears reliable and comfortable. Oh, BTW, I got 45,000 miles on a car and tires need to be replaced, so just average life with stock Continental tires.",3

A ""bucking"" motion occurs as you drive, jerking the car and happens every time you stop and start your car on the road. It's as if you're driving a stick shift and you did not remove the clutch in time. Awful feeling, not reliable. The Acura dealership said ""yes we know there is a problem with the transmission- there is no current solution, you gotta live with it."" Another big problem is the technology package- phone connection with calls and messaging are full of glitches and now my messaging abilities do not even work (reading out loud or sending them by speaking to the car). Acura dealership also says they have no updates for these problems. After spending close to $60,000 for a ""luxury"" automobile, it is very unfortunate that the Acura company gets your money and runs.also  if you get a text ,  Anytime you change the shift, if your parking going back-and-forth it keeps repeating text to you.

Had driven only around 9500 miles when this problem started. Dealership replaced the transmission, but then also changed the radiator and the starter (since those also apparently had issues !) - all this took almost a month. In short, major components were bad/poor quality (?) in a brand new car - only major remaining part to replace is the engine !!! After the repairs, car still gives slight jerk during gear shifts. Dealership and Corporate customer service response was - slight jerk is normal for MDX. So buyers beware - from personal experience it seems Honda quality is not transferred to its luxury brand !!!

We test drove and almost bought a Ford Explorer Sport, but the Honda loyalist inside of me said the Acura would be a better overall purchase. From the moment we leased this MDX 6 months ago it has been a HUGE let down. The transmission is horrible and shifts almost violently (dealer said this is normal), the suspension pops and clunks on every bump (3 attempts by dealer to fix), the touch screen is cool in theory, but when you just want to turn on the seat heater or adjust the fan it takes far too much effort.  The cargo area is poorly designed (in my opinion) because the roof slopes in the rear and limits capacity. The seats seem to be okay; they are a little small for my 6'3"" frame but my wife finds the car comfortable. On the plus side, the ride on the freeway is compliant and gas mileage is phenomenal (although, keep in mind you have to use premium fuel which offsets some of the MPG savings). I love the LED headlamps, but more and more cars are adding this feature, which makes is less special on the Acura. Remote starter was standard on my Accord, but we had to pay $400 extra for it on the Acura. Overall, the car looks much better than it performs. I never thought I would say this about a Honda product, but if you are in the market for a midsize SUV, do yourself a favor and drive several other vehicles...this Acura just doesn't live up to it's name.",2

This being my 4th MDX the 2016 is the best driving experience I've ever had. I was a little nervous with the move to a crossover design, happy with the feel of the RL I've missed. The slight one inch lowering to the ground was a concern but still keeps me high enough on the road to see ahead in traffic. The new safety innovations are incredible and give me a new sense of road safety beyond what I've ever experienced. The gas mileage is through the roof beyond what I expected which was my main motivation for buying in May of 2016. I don't get all the transmission complaints, but I must say, I don't drive the car fast, I drive it economically for safety and good gas mileage. For this reason, the car is a dream. If you want a sports car, then go buy one. I love having the option of the engine stopping if you press the brake a tad harder at a stop. At first this was strange, but now a natural part of driving the car. All the technology took a small learning curve but once you learn, it's part of you. My Acura dealership has been completely responsive with any questions I have. The MDX handles beautifully with new smart technology helping to keep me in my lane when driving the freeway. I love the distance setting of three choices when using cruise. I'm not trying to out drive anyone, just selecting my space on the freeway to drive most economically. Hitting 28 miles to the gallon on a long trip is the best MPG I've ever received from any Acura. The sound system and tech package is delivers all I need and then some.

The module update is supposed to correct the shifting - it didn't. The rear end work did help the noise in the rear end.  The fan blower for the air conditioner is so loud that even on the lowest speed, phone calls sound like you have your window rolled down.

THERE SHOULD BE A RECALL TO UPDATE THE SOFTWARE ON THE TRANSMISSION.  ACURA, ARE YOU LISTENING TO YOUR CUSTOMERS?  Acura should be embarrassed to turn away customers.  No wonder they are LAST in customer satisfaction.  Now...onto the car.  Two major issues with this car: the transmission, and the infotainment system. The interior is nice size and comfortable, even though it doesn't feel so luxurious.  Handling is great, ride is smooth when the transmission isn't jerking you all over the place.  The overall infotainment system, navigation included, is SO slow and my 2008 Infiniti G35 had a better nav system.  It's pretty pathetic.  This is my first (and probably last) Acura until they get their act together, stop trying to fool customers into thinking their product is the ""best in it's class,"" and until they produce a real transmission and a real infotainment system.  What a shame.  BTW, my dad had 3 MDXs...a 2009, a 2013, and a 2016.  He loved (and so did I) the 2009 and 2013.  He had the 2016 for 5 months and got rid of it.

The navigation system and voice recognition system is really a joke as well. I replaced it with a dash-mounted iPhone. The car does handle well and the all-wheel drive is great.,2

My first time owning an MDX, the jewel lights are great.  I am a little annoyed by the dull hum when you turn the steering wheel.  The service guy says that is how it is made.  I did not hear it in the other vehicles.  The controls screen HAVE to be UPDATED to include a single button to change air circulation, when you see some exhaust and dusts you have to scramble to find the control and press TWO BUTTONS to change to recycle.  I am able to get by just putting the car in AUTO for AC.  You have to press TWO BUTTONS to turn on and off AC!",4

The car has unusual new car smell. At the beginning, I thought it will disappear soon .I am wrong. I can't stay in the car without the window open for more than one year. But unfortunately after two summers, the smell of new car just reduced a little bit and the leather seat still gives off strong chemical odor. I can confirm because if I smell closely to the leather it's just too strong chemical odor. I have owned multiple cars with leather seats before. This is the first time I hit the issue. I very understand that leather products usually has ""leather smell"" and I actually like that. But this smell from ACURA 2016 MDX seats is not typical genuine leather smell. It's just unpleasant chemical smell.  At the time I bought the 2016 MDX, I noticed it smells more strong than 2015 MDX. And it seems to be issue with all 2016 MDX at least the first batches.  I was told by many people that baking the car in summer could reduced the new car smell. Now I have done it twice in the summer. Almost every sunny day I leave the car outside and open the window just a little. I have verified it doesn't work for this car. Because this time, issue is from seat. I am pretty issue besides the seat, the smell is OK. Just the leather chemical smell is too bad. One detail I noticed is there is no smell from back piece of seat. I am guessing that the back piece of the seat has different leather.",1

I felt that there was no need to let others know about my problems , but my conscience just kept telling me to share my thoughts with the media. When I was driving home the first time from the showroom there was a metal knocking noise under vehicle and was quite concerned. I immediately called my salesman who put me through to service.the manager said there is a bulletin on this but acura had no fix ,but are working on one. i asked how long? and he responded by saying they have been working on it since 2014.I laughed and then choked and said what are you talking about. He said the design of the parking brake cable was not designed correctly and it knocks like a chain hitting the bottom. after quite a few adjustments and the rear brakes overheated from  overtightening the cable, I just gave up and  said I will live with it until acura comes up with a fix. Well, to continue, Ive had countless parking sensor issues that just go off even if no one is around waiting for the red light to change. It sometimes scares me thinking another vehicle is approaching .The only way to shut the sensors off is to override them and shut the system off completely. they removed my bumper 6 times ( damaging the bumper)and replaced modules and sensors and harness and still no fix.The dealers remedy is to just shut them off permanently, even though i bought the advance model to get this option factory installed.My preset steering wheel only works sometimes. My 9 speed tranny clanks ,I guess it wants to let me know its still there . My brakes practically go down to the floor and acura tells me that its ok. Seat adjustments are not great,but i guess acceptable. My rear backup camera looks like I have been driving in a dense fog ( useless) .They say other mdx cameras look similar. The ride quality on smooth roads is fine ,but try hitting a few minor potholes and it goes right through the cabin. While I was even servicing the vehicle a woman was complaining about the terrible ride quality and vowed to sell her mdx just to keep her sanity. There is a scraping noise when you first start the suv in the morning. Might I have to say more. Acura customer relations keeps telling me that they would like to continue working with me to correct these issues after more then 5 attempts ( i stopped counting) and yes I am aware of the lemon law.I said the right thing is to put me in another vehicle and you can continue to correcting these issues on your own and spend 24 hours a day to figure it out so other loyal customers don't suffer. Acura ,unfortunately with being the best selling luxury suv cannot get it right. i guess people gravitate to it because the price is great compared to other similar suvs .Also, acura shares the same mother company as the civic and accord who have held top honors for many year, so people that want luxury and reliability will hopefully get it like the honda products previously mentioned.I am not writing to punish acura  I just want them to get it right. In closing, Maybe I just might just decide to stop punishing myself one day and move on to another brand after owning acura's for many years. I guess Im finally getting wise that taking off a shield on the front grill or giving real wood trim instead of plastic will ultimately not shield this company from customers realizing that there is something wrong here. What acura needs to do instead of fixing a grill issue is to fix mechanical issues that are the real reason why people have always purchased honda products in the first place called reliability.",1

I tried to restart the engine and when it did, it move very slow and roughly to the shoulder of the freeway.

Each of those years I test drove  a variety of SUVs  (the usual suspects) and always ended up with the Acura!  So when the 2017 Acura hit the showroom last week, I was pretty sure I would end up buying another one.  It's not going to happen.  Took it for a test ride and noticed immediately how differently it shifted when accelerating onto a highway.   Couldn't get out of its own way--that's the way it feels anyway.  Back in the showroom the salesperson told me they changed the gears from 6 to 9 back in 2016.  I have no idea what that means I only know that the car doesn't feel right going through NINE gears.  Like I'm towing a boat or something.  It has the power; it just takes too long to get to it.  What a shame--just when they finally changed the front grill.",3

Given my happiness with Honda vehicles, I always assumed it would be an Acura MDX. After taking it for a test drive I have nothing really bad to say about the vehicle, only that it looked and drove like a very, very nice Honda, but not what anyone would consider a luxury vehicle. It lacked the plusher interior as well as the driving enjoyment that one would expect from a luxury car (at what what still a luxury price).

I'm so glad I did. I've owned two MDX's since purchasing my first MDX in year one of the MDX introduction in 2001. I'm amazed at the transformation, I'd been driving my MDX with 180K miles. Having also been an RL owner, I now feel I have the best of both vehicles in one. The slightly lowered height from the road is just perfect! The few lower reviews of the entertainment system has not been a problem for me. There's a lot to digest with so many great features, I take each feature one at a time which for me has been an enjoyable easy process. I love the new touch gear shifting! I love the sportier drive for an SUV, it really does not feel like I'm driving an SUV. The gas mileage increase is sweet, which is one reason I waited so long to buy a 2016. Love the seat air ventilation system that keeps me from back sweating during hot summer months. I can now seamlessly play music from my iPhone. The biggest surprise and enjoy is the warning system and lane keeping assist system. I feel like I'm now protected from blind spots when changing lanes and drifting out of my lane. This is simply the best vehicle I have ever owned! A huge leap of comfort, safety and technology in the past 10 years! I've never experienced this big of an upgrade in any vehicle I have ever purchased. Love this vehicle!!!",5

Took the car in for routine service in may, told the about dash rattles, banging noise in the rear and the transmission hunting for gears on down hill grades. They said they had service bulletins on the shifting and the rear end noise. They reprogrammed the computer and installed new bushings in the rear suspension. The two actions made a huge inprovement in those issues.  As far as the dash rattles I found that by putting cardboard between  the passengers window  pillar and the dash the rattle was eliminated.

Thud/clunk noise e-v-e-r-y time I accelerate from around 40 to a higher speed.  Head mechanic at dealer acknowledged this shouldn't be happening, had my car for weeks, put in a new drive train.  Problem still there so then they told me that all of the MDXs do this.  Wait-what??  Engine will shut off when I stop, every single time I stop, unless I deactivate the fuel saving feature.  Get in the car in the AM, deactivate, go to grocery, get back in car, deactivate, stop to get gas, get back in car, deactivate.  You can see how irritating this becomes on a daily basis.  Dealer tells me no way to get around this.  Driver's side window rattles when it's about 1/3 of the way down.  After my first month of driving this car, transmission made a thud noise when in reverse (dealer was able to fix this).  Very jerky ride at slow speeds (i.e., pulling slowly out of my driveway or rounding a corner).  Lots of ""cool"" touch screen controls -- until you realize that you can't just turn a knob to change the AC or heat, you have to hit the control screen multiple times.  Even my husband, who loves everything tech, complains about what a pain this is.  When you shift gears, rolls forward or backward quite a bit so don't you dare park too close to anything.  And there are other smaller things that make driving this vehicle every day unpleasant.  My car history: every 3-5 yrs, when a typical manuf. warranty runs out, I get a new car (I've been hit more than once so I'm very concerned about safety) and this is the WORST car I've ever owned.  I hate it.  What am I comparing it to?  Going way back to my Honda Passport, Mercedes ML350, Mazda MPV, Subaru Tribeca, Toyota Highlander Hybrid, Volvo XC60 (all of them high-end models w lots of features).

Been very surprised that car does not deliver well on at least two of those traits.  Had a transmission issue the first day I drive the car.  Transmission got stuck in low gear.  Was solved with a software upgrade and been ok so far.  I did a lot of research on the transmission issues and was under the impression that the ills of 2015 were fixed in 2016.  Not sure of that.  Next issue was a rattle from the rear of the car since day 1.  Turns out that a bolt was dropped into the chassis during assembly which required taking out part of the interior to find.  How did that ever pass the quality check before delivery I don't know.  On a positive note, I am actually getting great mileage - averaging 25 mpg on the freeways, far better than my last Lexus.  But the car feels cheap and as if corners were cut.  Lots of plastic and poor damping on the different cubbies in the car.  My Lexus was far superior for only about $3k more.

Sport mode was not even an option as it was super jerky and completely annoying.  At 6,800 miles it suddenly started making a high-pitched chirping noise when shifting into second gear, almost like the sound of tires screeching when peeling out. I immediately drove it to the dealership and the technician confirmed the issue. The next day they called and said the transmission needed to be replaced.  What!? I've owned several Hondas over the years and never had major issues. I thought I could trust Acura for their reliability record, but apparently not.

It's not as sporty as a BMW X5, not as big/bold as a Chevy Tahoe, not as pretty/sexy as an Audi Q5, but its (fully loaded) price is most likely the lowest in this group, its fuel efficiency is good (I averaged almost 21 mpg with mostly city driving, and about 28 mpg on highway), has very large cargo area (if you fold down the 3rd row), a quiet/comfortable ride, handles impresively on snow, and it comes with almost all the safety features that you can imagine.A few major gripes:1) Watch out for the middle seat's seatbelt (a real safety hazard, and a major design flaw) - since the seatbelt automatically retracts to the roof where it is anchored, my mom was hit hard on her face (by the seat belt buckle) as the middle passenger released his seatbelt.2) On a two-lane windy road, the auto collision sensor can mistaken an oncoming vehicle (in the other lane) as an obsticle and suddenly hit the brake for you (which can be very scarely to anyone in the vehicle)3) Unimpressive accleration for a 3.5L VTECH engine.4) So-so brake performance5) Lacks a ""360 degree camera"" which I believe is an option for other countries (since the owner's manual talks about it)6) No way to program the vehicle to ""remember"" the heated seat settings, which can be very annoying in cold climates7) Interia material is OK, but not in the same league with the Germans8) Why an SUV requires premium fuel??",4

USB port could also have supported the rear video playback (ex: AVI/MP4)2. Similarly, instead of decade old audio/video jack ports in the rear video in/out, they could have included the HDMI port or maybe another USB port.3. Could have included the BluRay disk drive instead of the previous/old generation DVD optical drive for the rear video playback4.

Have an older Acura MDX that I love!!! The new Acura looks nice, handles well but seems a bit smaller inside (although I was told it is a few inches bigger) the head room in the third row is cut back because of the angle of the body. This limits who is able to sit back there. It is very jerky in the shifting while excelerating and if you are moving very slow it feel like you are not in gear...Not happy with that! In addition, the radio is horrible. Most stations that I listen to do not come in clear. I have no problem with this in my other Acura or even the car I had before this one. Clearly the antenna is not good! I just feel like from my old Acura (2005) to this one (2016) they have definiately cut corners and the quality is not as good! For the price you pay I would expect an all 5 star rating which I can not give. We have been loyal Acura cutomers but think that this may be it for me.

We originally looked hard into the Toyota Highlander and Honda Pilots but realized the lease incentives were absolutely horrible due to the demand of both of those (we are in a spot in our lives where leasing makes more sense).  We started to look into non-3rd row options since our youngest is 2 and we have another one on the way in June, and we could go for a 3rd row when they got older. So I noticed a lease deal on an Acura RDX and wanted to investigate since we didn't like the RAV4 and CR-V options.  The RDX drove well but was too small.  The salesperson told me about a lease deal on a base MDX so we test drove it and LOVED IT.  The features are the same and the quality is better than the higher trim Highlander and Pilots and the lease payment was cheaper per month.  It has heated seats, leather, moonroof, backup camera, dual cabin screens, a 3rd row, jewel eye LED headlights, among other options.My wife has been driving is most of the time but so far we love it.  Definitely give it a shot if you're open to lease and are considering Toyota/Honda 3rd rows - you'd be surprised on payments.",5

The ride is generally smooth and comfortable. The infotainment system is not very intuitive, can be annoying at times, and the bluetooth does not work seamlessly, in comparison to our 2017 Toyota Tacoma and 2016 RAV4.  We have had minor transmission problems that caused the vehicle to jerk forward when near idling at very low speeds. That problem seems to have been fixed with a computer system reboot. However, we have had intermittent tailgate malfunctions that the dealer to this point has been unable to resolve. At this point we haven't decided on whether to purchase at the end of the lease. We probably will not switch to a lease on a new MDX considering that Consumer Reports no longer recommends the MDX based on lower than average reliability.",3

When I returned to pick up my car the service invoice coveniently mentioned that they ""could not duplicate the noise"".

But I immediately caught them doing this and asked the dealer to  inflate the tires back to 35psi.  Acura is no help either.  Both Acura and dealership say this is normal variation of the MDX, and the lemon law does not apply since ""there is nothing wrong with the car"".

They called and said they test drove a new MDX off the lot and it vibrates worse than mine so it's a characteristic of the vehicle. They actually put this in writing on the service order. I asked if they were informing consumers of this vibration characteristic when they were looking at the vehicles and they said no, I told them just because the other car vibrates does not make it right, it sounds like a design defect to me, this  directive came from the District Service Manager I cannot believe they would actually think that is acceptable, they all vibrate so that makes it acceptable????

The downside is that the Acura MDX has built quality issues. The panels either don't lineup or the gap is not even. For instance, the fuel door is off center, both side of the trunk lift gate have uneven gaps and both side of the front top fender panels are off and don't lineup with the front bumper. Very disappointed and I would consider other brand of SUV such as Lexus in the near future. If you are in the market for any Acura vehicle, do check for quality built issues. Chances are the panels don't lineup and the gaps are not even.The engine idle stop feature does not work at all after a few miles. In addition, don't even try to connect a smartphone because the vehicle does not recognize it no matter how hard you try. This is not what I anticipated for a new vehicle especially an Acura MDX.

It did not solve the problem, took it back a second time where I was told by the service writer that there was nothing wrong with the car, I would find nothing wrong with it and it drives just as well as any car on the lot. You can visibly see the steering wheel shake and feel the vibration. I took it in a third time, took a service technician out with me, he witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating. So I asked, ok we are in agreement that you witnessed the steering wheel shaking and vibrating he said yes, I took his name and wrote it down along with date and time. The dealer had my car for about a week, which they did give me a loaner, they called and said they had figured it out, they replaced the brake rotors. Needless to say the vibration is still there, since then I have taken it to a tire store that told me I had three bad tires, took it back to the dealer, they road force balanced the tires, vibration is still there. I have been in contact with Acura Client Relations since the second service appointment, next step is meeting with the District Service Manager. Not to mention how the transmission shifts, I am hoping they come out with a software update for that. Needless to say I am very disappointed and regret purchasing the MDX.",2
6265, on 10/26/15 08:43 AM (PDT),Peter K. ,2016 Acura MDX SUV SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),The vehicle that's gone from great to a total dud," I hardly ever write any reviews but figured I just had to do one on this vehicle. I owned a 2010 MDX Tech, which was a great car, that unfortunately got flooded during Hurricane Sandy. Then, I got an ML350 and when the lease was up, we decided that we needed another 7-seat vehicle. So, as we'd already had an MDX before, we figured we couldn't go wrong with that one, right? Wrong! The first thing I noticed on my drive home from the dealership is that the car becomes ridiculously jerky while in traffic. The new 9-speed transmission just doesn't work well for daily city driving or when you're stuck in traffic on a highway. If you live in a rural area, chances are you'll never experience this. But if you're in traffic every day, well... you've been warned. I've adjusted my driving style since then and learned that switching IDS to ""Comfort"" makes it a little better. The problem, however, never went away and the dealer refused to acknowledge its existence despite the fact that Acura message boards are filled with similar complaints (I should have read those before I got the car).Then, there's the touch screen. It's very slow with a non-intuitive interface. I've had it lock up several times while selecting a route.I've always played my music from a USB flash drive and this is another area where this car is a total disaster. Once music is on, you can't switch tracks until the car's MP3 system is done reading the whole drive. So, it takes about 2-3 minutes in my case before I can switch songs or select another album/artist. It could be my flash drive but it's the same one I used on the 2010 and ML350 - worked flawlessly there.We have two car seats installed in the second row (one behind the driver's seat and another in the middle). It's impossible to pull down the remaining second row seat and access the third row when there's a car seat in the middle. I had no problem doing that in the ML (needed the remaining seat pulled down sometimes to transport my bicycle).Finally, there's the cargo net or lack thereof. I kept the cargo net from the 2010 and was able to easily install it on the ML. I figured it would also fit on the 2016 MDX. Wrong again! Acura has changed that as well.",2
6266, on 10/26/15 07:14 AM (PDT),Mike ,2016 Acura MDX SUV SH-AWD w/Technology Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),Great Vehicle with Terrible Infotainment," We recently leased a 2016 MDX AWD with Tech Package. If we were to do it again the smart money would be the base awd model with the AcuraWatch safety feature package. Let me explain why....First off the car rides, accelerates, stops, turns, and everything else regarding moving extremely well. Even the headlights are exceptional. The interior seating design and the way they slide  is also great. The safety features shake the steering wheel if you depart your lane and warn you when other cars are too close.  Whats left is the way you interact with the controls in the dash and on the steering wheel. Every single thing about the interaction with the controls is unnecessarily complicated. In many cases it takes an extra click or 2 in a menu than in other cars. For example to turn seat heater on you need to click a button on the screen, select the heat level, then close the sub-menu. In every other car on the planed you click the button once to turn on the seat heat then another click to change the heating level. I consider this annoying, but not a deal breaker. Then you get into the gps. The gps takes longer than most to figure out how to do the basics. Its cumbersome to enter an address. The guidance is also poor. Sometimes there is no audible instruction on when to turn and a strange map of your turn with a flag that isn't always oriented the way you are travelling.  To sum it up you are better off placing your phone with google maps over the nav screen. I can only hope there is some kind of update to enable android auto or the apple car os. Last but not lease the Bluetooth connectivity doesn't play nice with my samsung galaxy s6. Every 30 seconds or so it pops up an error it can't import the phonebook. A quick google search indicates this is a common issue for many.  Then you quickly find out the text interaction is terrible. When you get a text a notification takes over the entire screen asking what you want to do (imagine you were getting ready to make a turn following gps). So then when you act on the notification you have to pick from a very small list of predefined reply messages. Every other car I have used including cheap rentals allow you to speak a text reply. My other vehicle is 2015 ram 3500 with uconnect and it does all of this with no issues.  In a day and age where so much of your interaction with a vehicle is the electronics acura needs to do a much better job. The kicker is you pay thousands extra for this tech package and get terrible tech bundled with some really good safety features. After having the MDX a few months I can say I would buy it again, but would not get anything above a base model awd with acurawatch.",4
6267, on 10/12/15 11:53 AM (PDT),Daniel ,2016 Acura MDX SUV SH-AWD w/Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),"Not what I had hoped for $50,000+"," It came down to the 2016 Volvo XC90, Honda Pilot, BMW X5, and 2015 Toyota Highlander.  We were inclined to get the XC90 for all the safety features & the incredibly cool look. The drive is great, however it felt really risky getting a brand new everything car.  The dealer had been saying they would get in Jan, the first ones did not appear till May and it seemed like they were trying to get it right.  Visibility was ok.  However, loaded with all the safety features it was getting to 60  though it starts at $47 all cars had very confusing option packages & what is considered a safety feature.  The test car 3rd row seat seem to have a problem. Then they recalled the vehicle to fix the third row airbags. We keep cars for 10 years & did not want to be going back to the dealer over and over again. The final straw is when they were offering factory maintenance for all models except the XC90 which had 1 year less of the maintenance.  On a new model they should not insert more doubt.  The BMW drove great but the 3rd row was not big enough for anyone over the age of 12 so had to cross it off.  The highlander felt less luxurious but most importantly did not have all the safety systems that we were looking for so we decided to pass. At the time the 2016 was not out, it appears from the reviews that they have added some safety features. We were left with the pilot and the MDX. In the end, the Pilot's cheap minivan arm rest on the drivers side along with the bad handling and turning radius on turns made us skip it.   Any man over 200 pounds will find there is no way to lean on the arm rest comfortably.  The turning handling and radius were a big concern also as on a sharp turn near our house the car veered into the oncoming traffic lane.  We did it twice.   Finally, unless you get the highest trim the handling is so ""trucky"" the kids got out and were ready to throw up.   This left us with the MDX.  We were excited to be moving up in the luxury ranks and were hoping the reliability would be there also.  After a bad selling experience we picked up the car and immediately noticed things.  There is a paint defect under the clear coat on the roof. There was a sticker there so it was clearly a known problem and they sold to us anyway. We have complained with no response. The hood does not latch unless you slam it.  If the hood is already down there is no way to close it without opening it and slamming it.  Finally if you look around the car you can see multiple places where the rubber is not flush including the doors & hood.  I walked around the lot and would say 50% of the cars had the same problem. Not what we had expected at $50+ .  Dealer was no help with these issues, I have read on line about cars getting water on the inside I am hoping that the rubber problems will not cause that. When you go to the car wash & open the back doors there is water in the painted part.  As for the drive it is pretty good, the 9 speed transmission is a little bouncy especially as low speeds, but no one is getting dizzy at least. The stop start feature takes getting used to, as if you need immediate power like turning onto a highway of making a left turn onto oncoming traffic, the car will hesitate long enough to make it dangerous.  You have to turn the wheel of take your foot of the pedal to start the car & be ready to go, or turn the feature off, however if you do that I can't imagine how much worse the gas mileage it would be. We are getting 15.5 in the city, & its Premium so it has been surprising.   Power in the SHAWD is very good & its a quiet ride with good handling.  Seat comfort for a large driver is not as good as I would have hoped.  I would like the seat to go back more when its high up and it just wont, so you end up sitting kind of low which removes one of the benefits of and SUV.  As for the safety features the lane assist works well on a Interstate highways at high speed, not so good in other settings. The automatic follow feature is very sensitive and breaks really hard and speeds up hard, so much so that you can't use it.  The break alert system works ok, I wish it would also go on if I am breaking but not hard enough. It will not stop the car automaticlally at low speeds like the volvo. The heads up display in bright sun creates a distracting reflection on the winshield & and the pairing with SIRI does not work well.  The NAV is a complete waste of money, I wish I could convert the screen to show my iphone instead. Nav traffic & directions sub par in every way.  The voice input is the same as our 08 Accord, very clunky. AC is hard to keep constant, need to adjust all the time.  In the end we are very disappointed with what we hoped would be an amazing car.  We hope it lives up to the reliability.",3
6268, on 09/15/15 18:57 PM (PDT),Suzanne Thorpe ,2016 Acura MDX SUV Technology Package 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 9A),My first SUV purchase," I typically drive a vehicle for as long as possible. So when my 2003 Toyota Camry was starting to show some signs of wear and tear after 13 years, I decided to check out the new SUV's.  For me I wanted comfort, quiet, smooth handling, navigation package, something easy enough to get my aging parents into, and most importantly something with a solid reputation of being a reliable and quality vehicle.  My pros: I found that I liked sitting a bit higher on the road. The drive is very comfy, quiet and the vehicle is very responsive.  When I test drove the car I got the speed up to 90 entering the interstate before the salesman in the backseat coughed uncomfortably, but the car never hesitated and was very responsive. The headlights provide an amazing view of the road at night. The bluetooth for phone calls is crystal clear. I am using midgrade octane gasoline and I am averaging 24.5 mpg. My cons: I wish the cup holder was a smidge larger so it could hold my bubba cup of water. The navigation system is a little confusing but now that I am used to it things are fine but it took some patience on my part. The driver seat is self adjusting to driver 1 or 2 but I wish that I could get the seat to automatically move further back than it does upon going into park.  I understand that Acura has accessories for sale but I think that for the amount of $$$ you spend they could have included a net in the cargo area to keep the groceries from sliding around, I think it should have been standard not optional. Overall I really have been impressed so far and have not once regretted my purchase.  I don't have any maintenance issues to report after 4 months of ownership.",5
6269, on 09/10/15 22:07 PM (PDT),Sid J ,2016 Acura MDX SUV SH-AWD w/Advance Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),I love my new 2016 MDX !," My wife and I were in the market for our first luxury crossover and we couldn't be happier with our purchase (Advance Pkg, SH-AWD). Let me say outright that we did not consider any German cars for reasons ranging from high price point/high maintenance to poor reliability/longevity. We weren't particular about having 3-rows, but felt it'd be nice to have the option (for trips with family/friends) - the MDX fit the bill perfectly. I've had my MDX for 6-weeks and driven 1800 miles, so its obviously too early to talk about reliability(which the Acura brand is known for) but here are the pros/cons as I see it.Pros:- Drives great. Plenty of power to summon in any situation (esply with Normal/Sport IDS modes).- Very comfortable seats & ride. You don't feel minor road imperfections & the suspension does a great job of dampening out big potholes.- Very quiet cabin. Conversation between 1st & 2nd row passengers have never been easier.- Gas sipper (I use premium 93 octane). I consistently average over 24-mpg in combined driving. Averaged 26-mpg during a recent 600-mile road trip(80% highway) with 5 adults, fully loaded cargo space (3rd row folded). That said, I always use cruise at highway speeds and avoid very hard acceleration/braking.  I calculate MPG estimates to be 100% sure though the tip computer is not off by much (-0.5 to +1 MPG off actual).- Realized the beauty of SH-AWD driving on curvy, hilly wet roads (yet to test on snow/heavy rain). Just when I thought I needed to hit the brakes to slow around a corner, the MDX breezes past with aplomb. It drives like a car - you don't feel body roll, side-to-side weight transfer during turns.- Love all the safety features, esply the Lane departure warning.  I read recently that it received great crash-test scores.Now for the Cons:- Depending on the gear you are in, the transmission sometimes seems to lag for a split second before it accelerates. I believe this has to do with dog clutch in the ZF-9 speed design. - Adaptive cruise may seem hard on braking/acceleration depending on how you normally drive.- Touchscreen response is a tad slower than I'd like it to be.- Fog lights are offered only as an accessory (extra $)- Power-folding side mirrors, panaromic roof,  motion-activated power liftgate not available.I've seen people voice concerns on online forums regarding transmission, build quality(as MDXs are built now in Alabama Vs Canada until about a couple of years ago)  but based on my experience, I'm inclined to believe most of them are unjustified. There have also been complaints about higher than usual noise coming from under the hood(for someone outside the car) even when the a/c compressor is not running -  the owners manual clearly says that is expected as a result of the system checks ! Complaints related to dual-screen is a matter of getting used to - I actually find it convenient. The 3rd row of seating is mostly for kids (or short adults for upto 2-hr ride). In my opinion, this is the most well-rounded luxury crossover offering an optimal mix of comfort, handling, value and safety. Get one - you'll love it !",5

So far so good. Great handling, smooth riding SUV. Quiet and comfortable on the road. Very responsive in sports mode. The infotainment system was not simple to use at first, but when I learned how to use it, I really like it because of its cool advance tech. features. Great sound system. Excellent Rear entertainment system with wide screen that produces a surround sound quality similar to a high end home theater system. Safety features are probably one of the best in it's class. The adaptive cruise control/ lane keep assist are great feature on long drives.Follow up review: after 9 months. So far so good, still an excellent vehicle. no major issues. I really like the push button shifter. Contrary to some reviewers complaint, doing a three point turn is an easy step for me: put the hand over the gear selectors, pull the reverse button to back up with the index and middle finger, push the drive button with the thumb to forward, no arm travel is needed. One minor issue is the back up camera was slow to respond. Just like some of the reviewers here in the site, I also noticed that ocassionally, the drive in lower gear is not smooth particularly in sports mode, but it's not a big deal, for me it has similar feel when driving a manual trabsmission car at 1st gear.Highway mpg is spot on, 26-28 in long drives at 60-70 mph on a flat road. City is around 19-20.The lane keep assist can keep up at 45-65 mph when there is a clear lane marking, at >75mph, I noticed that the car gets too close to the next lane when going on a curvy free way. Adaptive cruise works well in my car but can slam on brakes a bit hard in some occasions particularly when there is a slowing down of traffic in front of you. Not quite as smooth as a human driver braking.To me, the dual infotainment system is cool and high tech looking especially now that I'm used to it, but could still be improved to a nicer, faster, HD graphics. I wish Acura could come up with software upgrades in the future.",5

Keep in mind we only have a few hundred miles on it so its still really early. We looked at a lot of vehicles before choosing the MDX. As far as a luxury 7 passenger vehicles go this seemed to have everything we wanted and needed after a couple of weeks of shopping and doing serious looking at the German counter parts. The MDX meets all of our requirements as follows in no specific order. Luxurious, stylish, roomy, safe, quality. We hope the maintenance is low and that it will hold its resale value I guess time will tell. The ride is great in the awd however on bumpy roads you can hear some road noise. The steering is awesome The turning radius is amazing making u-turns a breeze. This is a very easy and stress free vehicle to drive. Unlike most of the reviews I have read the command center is easy to operate we were a little worried after reading the reviews but it is super simple! We thought we wanted the black on black but after looking at the Lunar Silver Metallic we fell in love with how it really accentuates the lines on the vehicle.",4

The ride is jerky or the car surges. The dealership is aware of the problem, but solution not available. Also the memory seat/steering doesn't always return to the set drivers position and the navigation system worked correctly 1 out of 4 attempts. Knowing what I know now, I would not get this car.  UPDATE...after the recall to installing the transmission warmer the car does not seem as jerky as it once was.  However, even with this change, I would not recommend this car. I just sold this car and couldn't be happier.  I had forgotten how a car should drive, it proves the Acura was just terrible.",1

A comparable BMW or Porsche would have cost 20K more.  I was immediately impressed with the comfort, quality, and performance.  Although not as sporty as BMW products I have owned, it drives and corners smartly.  Probably the quietest vehicle I have owned.  After many dealership visits with the Jeep, I look forward to years of routine service only with the Acura.",5
6274, on 07/27/15 16:58 PM (PDT),G. Adams ,2016 Acura MDX SUV SH-AWD w/AcuraWatch Plus Package 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 9A),"Great, responsive car. Terrible interface."," Before buying, I test drove a 2016 Pilot EX-L and a 2015 MDX. In my opinion, the MDX felt more agile and responsive than the Pilot, and I preferred the MDX's interior and exterior styling over the Pilot. The Good:Car handles incredibly well. Accelerates, turns, and brakes superbly. If you're looking for a three-row SUV, I can't think of anything that would come even close to the same level of performance and value, except perhaps a Pilot. The only other option I considered was the Volvo XC90, but it would cost around 25-30% more, and although I greatly prefer the Volvo's interior and user interface, my friends with Volvos have had issues with reliability. Audi Q7 also looks great, but again price and reliability issues steered me away. So, from a price-performance-reliability standard, the MDX is very hard to beat. I took the MDX on a curvy, secluded mountain highway, and it was truly the most thrilling drive I've ever had. I'm happy with the car.The Bad:The user interface is disgraceful. Acura's worst yet, and that's saying something. Even though the dealer set up the car for my wife and me, my wife's first solo drive in the car had  her near tears because of the maddening user interface. For instance, getting the car to accept her phone's bluetooth connection instead of mine was crazy complex, and you have to go through two entirely separate menus if you want to transfer both the phone operations and the phone's media (e.g., Pandora) from one source to another.  Even everyday tasks like turning on the seat's heaters, adjusting the A/C, or tinkering with the audio settings (e.g., fade/balance) all take multiple levels of menus, requiring too much of the driver's focus and attention. I sorely miss when I could do any of those things with a single gesture (flip a switch! turn a dial!) without having to take my eyes off the road. Now, I have to find the 1 cm square on the display panel that takes me to the menu to adjust the fan. Then the menu changes, and I have to navigate my hand to the ""+"" and ""-"" icons. Even when I know what to do -- which isn't often the case, because the menu system is poorly laid out -- my eyes leave the road for what'd I guess to be about three seconds... just to adjust the fan! Speaking of user interfaces, the displays in the car are terrible. Just plain old washed out and ""fuzzy."" I'm wondering if Acura got a deal on surplus parts from circa 2001. Backup camera quality feels like it's made from Soviet-era parts, and the touchpad was probably made from leftover Microsoft Zune panels. Resolution and clarity are shameful. Other annoyances:The glove compartment light apparently only comes on if the headlights are on. I, personally, tend to open the glove compartment when the engine is off, and even if it's light outside, the back of my glove compartment is still pretty dark.The chrome trim used all over the center stack reflects the sun like a mirror, creating an annoying and blinding distraction. My wife and I each experienced this independently, so I don't think I'm being nit-picky. Look for a recall on this in future months, where your dealer installs non-reflective stickers over the chrome trim to solve this safety issue. ;-)   With Acura's button-based transmission system, it seems impossible to park the car, turn off the engine, and keep the radio on. There's a ridiculous ""car wash"" mode that lets you turn off the car and keep it in neutral, but good luck remembering the proper sequence of brake, button, and transmission to put it in this mode, and I'm still not sure how practical this mode is anyway. Suspension is... bumpy if not jarring. Too much hard plastic.Acura dealer mentioned crazy expensive parts when trying to upsell on warranty. Do headlights really cost $1,100!?Notes on AcuraWatch Plus:AcuraWatch plus is a suite of features like adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist. Unfortunately, it does not include blind spot monitoring. I had great hopes for both adaptive cruise and lane keep assist, but neither seem quite ready for prime time. Adaptive cruise is a little too slow to react, especially when speeding back up either when the car in front accelerates or when you change lanes to go around a slower car. Lane keep assist is at times too aggressive while at other times too oblivious of the car's drifting across lanes.  It also seems to continually ""test"" if the driver is actively steering by subtly turning the wheel slightly back and forth. After a couple of hours of driving, my arms and shoulders were sore from subconsciously fighting these small, constant tugs on the steering wheel. On the other hand, I have had at least one successful driving experience where I let the car do most of the steering while I barely assisted. That was kind of fun, but I don't foresee those opportunities arising often, due to typical traffic and road conditions.Overall: Great car, terrible tech.",5
6275, on 10/30/17 10:07 AM (PDT),Sunil ,2004 Acura MDX SUV Touring AWD 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 5A),Beast that puts latest SUVs to Shame," I recently moved to US and this is first car I bought based on overall reviews of used SUVs. I bought it at 131K and had no idea what to look out while buying a used car which costed me heavy since its all maintenance were pending. I spent over 4100 Buying 4 new Tyre, Timing Belt, replacing whole Power steering kit, front sway bars, rear shockers, driver side passenger door motor+regulator kit, front axles. The Car runs like beast, I haven't traveled very long distances but my last 500+ mile trip was great. Power is available when I want, it accelerates when I want, even after driving it 3-4 hours continuously, don't feel tired. While It was given for fix, I was offered Equinox and Nissan Rogue for driving and I'm not getting into those SUVs again. I tried couple of more SUVs and they felt like plastic boxes. Having spent so much, My Mechanic says this Car is now good for another 60K mile without any mechincal or transmission issues. I asked him how long can I drive it and he said it will easily go 300K + miles.",5
6276, on 12/10/16 06:36 AM (PST),TT Smith ,2004 Acura MDX SUV Touring AWD 4dr SUV w/Nav and Entertainment System (3.5L 6cyl 5A),Pleased," I spent a significant amount of time preparing for and shopping for a used vehicle as a primary vehicle. My previous vehicle was dying and I needed a replacement. Highlander, Lexus 330, Traverse ... but once I drove the MDX, I knew that a 2007 or 8 was what I was looking for ... Then I found this 2004 with only 88K miles and 'imported' from San Diego to Denver area. What a bulletproof beast she has been for the last year. Pretty heavy travel year, and I'm now at 112K with only great performance. Little bit more money into it after the purchase than I anticipated: timing belt, 105K maintenance, 2 motor mounts, new tires, new leather on the passenger side. But, I love the 3.5, the ride and the performance in the snow ... and great road trip vehicle for 1,000+ mile trips. Probably, the best vehicle I've ever owned -- we'll see. Basically, looks brand new so I expect that I'll get 5-10 years out of it. I agree with all of the positives listed on these reviews. Like the previous Lady's review, if it lasts that long, I'd be happy to keep it to 400K, I feel.UPDATE 6/20/17:  By the time the 4th of July Holiday is over, I will have put over 40K miles on this 2004 MDX during my 18 months of ownership. I'm happy. Other than the above, the only other things I've handled on this vehicle is having the worn out leather redone on the drivers side.  Change the oil every 5K (uses about a quart), rotate the tires and get it aligned on the unlimited package at Sears. When I get to 150K I'll have the front end redone and replace the sway bar (about $1100). Otherwise, I expect she'll just keep going. Great road-trip vehicle.",5

My husband bought it new for me in 2004.  I have just hit 401,000 miles.  It still has the original engine, but the transmission was replaced about 200k miles.  Regular maintenance and an exceptional service department have given this girl of mine the longevity she deserves!!  A lot of history and many miles on the road together have made this purchase over 12 years ago a wonderful gift. My next car will be an Acura, likely an RDX, as the new MDX is way out of my price point, and nearly matches what I spent on my first house.

I have owned it for a little over a year and it just hit 170k miles with no major problems.  The original owner maintained it well for it's first 160k miles, as have I for the last 10k miles.  I do have to replace the power steering pump soon, the loud whine that seems to be a common problem, but otherwise no problems.  I have never owned a car with mileage this high so I have no basis for comparison but I am very happy with the reliability.  It also drives great and if the odometer said 50k miles I would believe it.  The navigation system seems very modern for a 12 year old car and the leather is in like new condition.  We have an Infiniti JX35 with 50k miles and the drivers seat is already more worn than this MDX with 170k miles; they must have used a very high quality/durable leather.  The only downsides are no blue tooth in the 2004, I believe 2005 models have blue tooth, and the interior is small for a 3 row SUV (trade off for handling well for a 3 row SUV).",5

It drives pretty decent but will not make you bounce back in your seat. The driver's seat however needs to get fixed because the back of the seat isn't straight, it's at an angle which causes my back to slide down toward the right side all the time and I can't position myself straight. Also the right exhaust pipe is hanging a little lower than the left one but that shouldn't be a problem. Other than that the car is pretty nice.

Buyers of SUV's should evaluate before purchasing, since it took me 3 months to decide between the Lexus RX, the MDX, and the Pilot. The MDX has the best overall performance, features, turning radius and off road ability as comparable to the Pilot. If a person would like to have simple styling, then go with the Pilot.

The pressure build to the point where it cause the unit to blow.  Dealer replace the battery and the A/C relay.

Downs - black interior trim swirls and scratches like crazy.  Leather seating looks like it's been sat in for 10 years already.  It sags and has permanent indentions.  I use Meguiars Leather cleaner/conditioner and it makes them look clean and shiny, but leather still looks worn beyond actual life.

While I test drove the BMW X5 (3.0) and the Audi Q7 I  always came back to the MDX (Tech/ent). While the other SUVs offered some minor technologies not found in the MDX, those features would have satisfied less than 1% of my needs but when they were configured with all the features of the Tech/Ent MDX the competitors were $8k-$10k more.  The performance of the car is really great and even when taking a bend at a high speed it seemed to handle the road better than my coupe.  The exterior design is very nice and gives the SUV and aggressive look. My wife and I love the SUV but really miss the efficiency that we once had with a sedan",4.5

When you think about the balance of power, handling, value, reliability, it is hard to beat this SUV.  In 2006, Car and Driver did a comparison test and MDX came out on top.

The 2.4 L engine's 200hp/170lbft are only adequate.  A turbocharger that punches with 235+hp/260+lbft that arrives significantly below 2000 RPM in a utilitarian vehicle that handles like a, well, a CAR, is a recipe that would keep me out of high-CoG SUVs  permanently.  If Honda would build a 9-speed DCT into such a vehicle, the need for SUVs would become a moot point.  BTW, I like the Technology Package's Nav & SiriusXM.  The mini-Jack & USB inputs, like most, need to have volume equalization programming so users don't wake the dead changing to CD/FM/satellite radio sources from theUSB/mini-Jack sources.  I'd buy this car again if they were still building them.  I can't imagine buying an RDX to get the utility my TSX offers.

Yet, the jet black 2012 S Wagon TSX caught our eye.  It's counterpart sedan was also an impressive car, but since we were parents of a 2 year old with one on the way,we needed some additional head room in the storage/cargo area. The s-wagon made sense. It had ample room to store everything from strollers to beach gear. The compartment under the trunk lid is also very useful. Additionally, the leather is great. Real leather at no additional cost for an entry level vehicle unlike some of the German counterpart wagons we looked at. The tech package is easy to use with bluetooth, nav., a cooler in the arm rest console for warm days, where you can store a cold can of soda! It was phenomenol. The rear seats split allowing storage for longer items. The auto 6 way adjustable seats are also great as are the memory seating. The heated pereforated seats help out alot and you can keep it on the low setting.Performance wise, the car is very conservative on gas consumption. Additionally, it performs relatively well. It is fun to drive as you can paint the road lines with the car. Steering and handling are awesome. it does lack some juice, but the inlive V-4 engine is pretty solid and comparable to some low end V-6 model vehicles. I would say the trade off for saving on gas and the little bit of extra juice you get off the V-6 is well worth it for this car.Overall, great family car with tons of features and luxury amentities. I think this is an awesome car for a starter family, that can double as a great and comfortable commuter car for kings. Acura also holds value and runs like a champ for years, as this is our second acura we purchased. I think we will ride this one for a while.

For the past 8 years I have adored this car.  I typically fill the car up on the 15th and 30th because of the excellent gas mileage for a car that size.  The power is just right to have the pickup you need in tight traffic situations but not too much that it will get away from you.  In the city, the car is excellent.  The storage area is great and with the seats folded down, you can get quite a bit in the car.  I've moved 2 boys to and from college with this car using the roof rack for overflow and it has not given me one problem.  Maintenance is great, very inexpensive to care for this car.  I use my local Midas mechanics and they treat it like a baby.  Even at 8 years old I still get looks and people can't believe it is a 2011 model.  Young men love it and I even had one group of guys tell my son that it's a 'sweet ride man!'  :-)  You see very few on the road and when you do, heads do turn.  Very stylish even now.  White is the perfect color for this car.  It looks so sleek.  In regards to safety, I have no complaints.  I've driven through the snow jam of 2014 in Atlanta and during the 12 hours, 20 mile drive home, the car was a champ.  Thank goodness for the DVD system I had installed as we were entertained and comfortable.  The seats are like sofas, especially the back seat.  I was amazed at the amount of fuel used during that time, not 1/2 tank being that we were sitting for the most part but the fact that the car ran for a solid 12 hours in freezing conditions, we were warm, the windows stayed clear and there was no thought of the car breaking down or freezing up.

6478, on 05/12/18 11:51 AM (PDT),Cliff Bloom ,2014 Acura ILX Sedan Premium Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),sporty ILX," I had a Cadillac CTS V with about 180000 miles sucking up about $100/ week worth of gas in 2013.  Gas was approaching $5/gallon at that time.  I wanted a car that got better miles/gallon with a manual transmission that would be fun to drive.  There weren't many options for cars with manual transmissions then and now.  I drove a couple models, VW & BMW and was skeptical about downsizing to 4 cylinders in the Acura or VW.  I would have bought the VW 4 banger diesel, but none were available with a manual transmission unless I wanted to wait 3 months.  Test drove the ILX and Muller had 5-6 different ILX manuals to chose from plus Acurwas offering no interest loan (I could have paid cash).   The ride's not as cushy as a Caddy or the BMW, but I tend to prefer a tighter more responsive go cart like feel, and the 4C has plenty of power for acceleration and passing.  It's a bit noisy.  My only complaint is with the gearing.  I don't know why Acura didn't take out a couple teeth for 6th gear, letting it cruise at higher speeds at lower RPM?  The front wheel drive handles well on snow & ice.  I haven't had any problems so far approaching 100000 miles,",5
6479, on 12/07/16 20:51 PM (PST),ryhi ,2014 Acura ILX Sedan Premium Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6M),Second hand ILX 2.4L 6MT," I was looking for a good commuter with a manual transmission I could hold on to of the next 15 years. I have owned 3 other Hondas so I have seen, first hand, how their powertrains hold up as I maintain them myself. I was interested in either the '16 Civic LX 6MT or the '16 Accord Sport 6MT. I, personally, like the new civic but, at the time, only the LX had the 6MT available. I didn't want to spend ~$19 grand on the base model, base 4 speaker stereo and wheel covers.  I have been spoiled with the features I've come to enjoy in my 2007 Accord EX-L Sdn V6 6MT, I know I was being too harsh on the LX. I began to seriously consider the Accord Sport, it is a gorgeous car on the outside, but I found I would have to give up many features: quality stereo, sunroof and (at the time) leather on the inside. I have always loved the powertrain of the Civic Si, excellent engine and transmission but personally, I didn't want the Si and wasn't too fond of the interior. To every man his taste. I then noticed the ILX. I would never consider buying one brand new for $30k+, but a clean white one at ~$21k @ 10,000 miles and in immaculate shape it became an excellent choice! The new Accord Sport is pushing ~$27k but I got so many more features with the used ILX. I have throughly enjoyed this car and even with the 6MT coming available in the EX-T Civic I find I'm still enjoying my choice without regrets.  (I would really be sad if a Leather/Manual/Turbo civic option had popped up), even with the turbo manual option the Apple Car play is great but it still lacks a bit of a list of features ILX has. Some features I have really enjoyed are the sound system, there is a Sub in the back and the higher wattage is very noticable, much better sound and intensity than my fully loaded 2007 Accord EX-L. The HIDs are excellent, I purchased the car in OR and drove it to CA during a rain storm at night to outrun a snow storm. Those headlights were impressive for that drive, I could see both sides of the road (worried about deer) and much further I have ever been able to see with my other Hondas, the handling is also very light and precise through the mountains. What I wanted in a commuter was good powertrain, this car always puts a smile on my face driving home, this is the best manual transmission I have driven and that engine note never gets old. This thing is quick. Even on starting the engine it reminds you of its capabilities with that aggressive engine note. I've also been pleasantly surprised with the fuel economy. I commonly get ~40 mpg on my 40 mile commute one way, which includes hills and plenty of stop and go, I usually average 31MPG overall with lively city driving. On a longer drive to UT I saw an overall 34.5 MPG on the computer. I've only put premium in it and honestly don't mind the extra dollar or two at each fill up. Even with the newer choices of the Civic Turbo manual and even the excellent Mazda 3 I still went with and couldn't be happier with my choice in the ILX. My only gripe, echoing the many, was no Navigation. Fortunately I have it in my Accord. Honestly, It's a pleasant convenience in it but wasn't a deal breaker in the ILX for me. The screen in the ILX is honestly rather poor, but the sound system quality is what I was looking for. Another gripe is the fact that it revs a little too high for my taste on the freeway, but I like the shorter gear ratio than those longer gears found the Mazda 3 6MT.  The keyless entry and push button start has also an excellent feature I've come to truly enjoy. If you're looking for a good option, the ILX is a solid choice if you can find a good one off lease. This car is a tidy package for the long run. Also the fact that someone designed it so the oil filter is conveniently on the bottom of the engine directly behind the oil drain plug (rather than spilling all over the back of the engine like on the Honda F series engine or spilling all over the subframe on the J series) is brilliant.",5

This vehicle doesn't feel like a comprehensive 'package' - It's an economy car, that's it.  Acura has taken a Civic (which is perfectly good as is) added a great dash, and some engine and suspension tuning and called it a day, and these mechanical touches don't really seem to add anything to the Civic package nor compete with the Civic Si(as if engineers just threw ""good parts"" at the car without testing).

Acceleration, handling, mpg, etc all seemed acceptable, but it didn't stand out.  However, I ended up taking a test drive because manual transmission cars have become hard to find, and they were giving big discounts.  After a test drive though, I realized that this car was something special, and the more I drive it the more I like it.  I'm happy to say that this car has a much higher fun factor than I originally expected.  The clutch and transmission are just a pure joy to use.  It's definitely the nicest manual transmission I've ever had, including multiple VWs, a Saab, and multiple Subarus.  The engine also loves to rev and has a wonderful sound for a 4 cyl.  It's no track monster, but for real road driving, I can't think of a car that was more fun (even more than my WRX) to drive around without doing illegal speeds.  Lastly, I find that the EPA gas mileage is easily exceeded without trying.  If I had to knock it on anything, it's the road noise.  For a 'premium' badge, I would have expected to be more quiet.  However, if you are OK with the normal noise levels found in Hondas/Acuras, this is a great choice for a little sporty car!",4

I don't have many miles on it yet but so far it is amazing. I have driven a 2013 ILX and this is by far a lot better. I have one possible problem so far and the service is great. With the car being brand new there are to be some problems. The vehicle is a luxury Honda. Honda is the co-parent of Acura and therefore it is to be a ""pimped"" out Honda. That is the sole purpose for starting Acura. Just like Toyota and Lexus or Nissan and Infinit. The car is geared toward younger people.",5

I had to buy another Acura thinking the car would make me just a happy.  That didn't happen.  The transmission doesn't know where it is.  It bangs and knocks and when you left off the gas it feels like you are lunging forward.  They say that the banging noise is ""normal"".  I was told that I was confusing the car when I drove it.  After all, it's a sensitive transmission.  What a piece of junk.  It's a hard ride and very noisy as well.  They cut every corner they could on this car and it shows.  They didn't cut the price either.  What is standard options on so many other cars now, you pay dearly for on an Acura.  I will never, ever purchase another Acura.  Never!",1

This car is different (let's face it.  There are few cars available today which are going to handle like the Integra.). Most modern vehicles have electric steering (ugh) and McPherson struts or something similar.  The double wishbone is gone for the most part.  HOWEVER, although this car is different, it is still a lot of fun to drive.  It handles extremely well with a lot of horsepower for its size.  The steering is good for electric and there is good feedback.  This is he first automatic I have owned in many decades of driving.  My advice: put it in sport mode, step on the gas and look for some winding roads.  You won't regret it!March 2018.  It is 7 months on and there has not been a single problem with this vehicle.  It handles pretty well in the snow.  It handles well on wet pavement. It is nimble and very quick on dry pavement. I drive in comfort mode to commute and it responds very well when I need to merge into traffic.  CR rated the ride poor, but I don't find it so.  I think it is perfect for a ""sport sedan"".  I've hit a few very bad potholes with no serious side effects. Two minor complaints: the armrests are too low and there is no dome light.  Otherwise, it is excellent.",5

The Subaru had a lot of safety features but wasn't very attractive. Honda surprisingly didn't ride that smoothly and if I wanted all the bells and whistle was very pricey. We have a 2006 TL and it has been a great car so we decided to look at Acura and the last car we saw was the ILX and it was IT!  The ride was smooth and had much more power than I thought it would, it has all the bells and whistles I wanted and the safety features that Subaru has.  We were able to get the Tech Plus for a price lower than both the Honda and Subaru with the features we got.  I've had the car a couple of weeks and the gas mileage is great and I'm truly enjoying it.  I've had several people comment on how good looking the car is.

Than I fell in love with my ILX, It was the best car I have driven out of all the four cars I listed. I drive 45 minutes from my house to Manhattan and it was saving me money and was a quiet and comfortable ride. I had a 2012 Passat SEL but I had so many problems and waste so much money that If I add all the maintenance prices plus the passat I could have boughten I Lexus or BMW, So I got the ILX.

6501, on 12/15/16 07:20 AM (PST),SDA ,2017 Acura ILX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Regressing but still worthy," Feels like Honda literally sent Acura a civic LX and they ""pimped your ride"" with some leather and such. Back in 2007 with my first new Acura, the TSX was with navi or not, and came fully loaded with all the other features and was tons of fun to drive, especially in the twisties (mine was a 6 speed manual). Now they have packages and trim levels (no manual trans offering) and it seems the value of Acura has gotten lost and swept up to try and compete with heavily option oriented luxury brands where you're nickle and dimed for each and every convenience. ""Pleather"" and heated seats, bluetooth and a dual clutch trans are all nice and standard features but also very basic ones you'll find on most cars with stickers in the low $20k range these days. If you want a touch screen entertainment system you'll pony up $2,000 for the premium package and also get some nick-nack features like perforated leather and blind spot detection. If not you're stuck with the 2006 looking blue interface that is way past its due date to be redone. The 17"" wheels they put on this thing belong on a base model civic in my opinion and make the car look a touch like it's trying way too hard to be cutting edge styled, otherwise the styling of the car may be one of it's higher selling points. 2.4L motor is standard now so 201hp but it still feels like it could use a kick in the pants in that department for being damn near $30,000. Truthfully it really is just a very comfortable, better looking Civic that you can lease for under $300 a month with $0 down, however, it may be the best thing you can get for that price in the luxury market.",4
6502, on 12/12/16 08:02 AM (PST),Redwings15 ,2017 Acura ILX Sedan Premium Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Fantastic Entry Level Luxury Vehicle," Overall extremely pleased with my new ILX. The vehicle is attractive to the eye with quality panel fit and finish and a stunning paint job. The dual clutch transmission is a large step above traditional automatics and has quick throttle response and incredibly nimble shifts. Overall engine power leaves a little to be desired, but at 201 HP it is quick off the line and peppy enough to put a smile in your everyday commute. The car handles fine and sticks to the road as expected for the size and weight. Steering feel is light enough to make for easy everyday commutes  by sporty enough to provide decent road feedback when winding about on country roads. Interior quality is OK, a bit below my expectations for a luxury vehicle but maybe right on par for an entry level luxury car. The ODMD head unit could use a refresher but is generally easy enough to navigate through after spending some time with the user manual out exploring all the system capabilities. Audio quality with the Premium system meets my expectations, with decent power and bass response. Imaging and dynamic range are better on this stock system then any other vehicle I've owned. Best thing is it's a Honda so the reliability, resale value, and quality are something I do not have to worry about. Perfect car for a young professional looking to purchase an affordable, attractive, and fun to drive luxury vehicle.",5
6503, on 10/15/16 18:14 PM (PDT),Laurel Blue ,2017 Acura ILX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),A new Dud," I just leased a new 2017 Acura ILX two months ago. This was the seventh Acura I've owned or leased, beginning with the 5 cylinder Vigor many years ago. I loved each and every one of these cars...except this one. I HATE it. There should be a warning sign on these- ""Watch out! Buy this if you're a dummy."" The ""new"" 8 gear transmission, with two clutches, is way too complex and does not offer performance as Acura bills it. The car hunts for gears as you accelerate, and has very little power from 10mph to 40 mph when you are accelerating. The car lugs in the lower gears. My previous car, a 2014 Acura ILX was perfection itself. I should have kept it. The most annoying aspect of this new car? The muffler. Acura is apparently ignoring its traditional (loyal) adult audience and seeking to attract new users that are young men in their 20's. So they have ""boosted"" the HP, but this is not accurate. The car is much less powerful than before, despite the claims for higher HP. And it is supposed to be thriftier on gas, but so far (I now have a little under 2000 miles) it is not as much of a gas-saver as was my 2014 Acura ILX.  The worst thing? The muffler. It is noisy as all get-out. I suppose this was to attract those young males. I would do anything to get a different muffler that is quiet. I do not wish to hear the constant ""throaty growl"" Acura has decided is necessary.  I keep thinking 33 tortured months to go...Arrgh.",1

She wanted certain thing like a backup camera, leather, and navigation and the only car she could afford, that ticked those boxes was the Acura ILX.  I drive this car a fair amount, so I do have a good sense of the car.  First, this car DOES NOT feel like an Acura.  My dad has a 09 TSX and everything from the materials, comfort, suspension, and performance on the ILX does not feel like it is related to any Acura.  I have read from many forum discussions when the ILX first came out, that it is truly is a civic in disguise, that requires premium fuel and I can attest that it is.  Most built-in navigations are terrible, so I'm not surprised with the ILX's system, but how can a 2013 ""luxury"" sedan have such a cruddy back-up camera?  It does the job, but even the Toyota Corolla comes with a better camera.  The suspension feels like it was made out of very cheap components, as it feels like the right front wheel is already in need of a ball joint.  The exhaust shield fell off and the paint is prone to chipping.  My suggestion to anyone thinking about getting an ILX is to get an older TSX or just get a fully loaded Civic.",2

I took a look at buying out my Civic, or purchasing another new Honda, but both of those options were thousands of $s more than a pre-owned ILX still under warranty. I am a car nut so I am quite familiar with the ILX and its relation to the Civic platform. The ILX fit my needs perfectly and solved most of the issues I had with my Civic (garbage infotainment system, NVH, pokey acceleration). The ILX is great for my longer highway commute, and the tech package is a must-have for the ELS audio. I don't really use the nav system but it works well the few times I played with it. Would like a bird's eye view option though. The only feature I miss from my Civic is the LaneWatch camera, but turning my head to check my blindspot is very easy and I feel the visibility is slightly better than on my Civic. Car is no rocket, but it is a willing partner when you punch it. No issues passing or getting up to speed at all. MPG is obviously less than my Civic, but I am still getting around 29-30 combined. Worth the MPG trade-off for the comfort level alone. Definitely could use a couple more storage cubbies and maybe another USB outlet, but I'll survive ha. Passengers report he backseat is roomy enough and comfy. I cant imagine why anyone would buy a new Kia Rio or a base Honda Fit when they can get a bulletproof-reliable, well-styled, feature-packed luxury-ish ILX for the same price.",5

So far so good. I had a Honda before and loved it so figured my next step would be an Acura. First the positives: Car rides well, love the GPS, blue tooth connectivity, and voice control. For a 4 cylinder vehicle it accelerates quite quickly and is very good on gas. Also the car is spacious, it comfortably fit me plus 3 other adults on a short road trip. Now the not so good: storage is extremely limited! the car doesn't even have a place to put spare change, I literally dump everything into the center counsel. Also the USB cord is awkwardly placed, when I first test drove the car I thought it was damaged (if you've seen it you know what I mean). Lastly, I got the tech package so I have leather seats but when I first started looking I was shocked to see that the base model comes standard with cloth seats, I've never seen a luxury car with cloth seats.",5

Initially I looked at a BMW 335 and a Infintity G37 coupe, both of which I loved being a man. However I knew my wife wanted a good gas mileage that also had navigation, a CD player, heated seats, etc. I ended up choosing the ILX as it was below the book value at the time, was fully loaded, and though a hybrid it was sporty looking compared to other hybrids on the market. I also liked the option of shutting off the hybrid mode, which gives the car more umph when getting into traffic in the DFW area. On average with city and highway driving we average 39.3 MPG with the car not in hybrid mode. We have kept up with oil changes, etc and I don't know if there is a correlation or not but the car does get better mpg within the first 20% of a new oil change. The front seats are comfortable especially considering that the basis for this car is the Honda Civic. The only flaws I see are limited storage, and no leg room for an adult in the back seats. However the interior dash layout is great, the hands free is one of the best I have used, and though it takes premium gas I have never paid more than $24.00 to fill it and my wife can drive 4-6 weeks before filling. It also looks like a higher dollar car. We will always be an Acura fan due to this car.",5

I loved the car, I wasn't ready to give it up but the cost of repairs, the difficulty in repairing the car, the nickel and diming from Mazda because of the rotary engine was taking it's toll and it finally came time for me to consider trading the car in for something more reliable.  I had considered Audi and BMW, but the biggest ""want"" on my car wish list was that the vehicle had to be easy to repair and not cost an arm and a leg each time I took it in.  I just wanted something that had the sleekness and handling of my RX-8 but with the engine of a Honda.  So what better than an Acura?  Granted, when I test drove the ILX, I was rather bored, I thought the car was too sedate.  However, I had to remind myself that I was used to the squirreliness of the rear wheel drive on the RX-8 and that the sedateness of the ILX could be good for me.  While the ILX does not handle as well as the RX-8 (I am a rather aggressive driver and enjoyed the manual transmission on the Mazda), the ILX is pretty decent in acceleration, handles corners well (I don't have to worry about fish tailing), and has an overall feeling of ""gliding"" that I really enjoy.  I also love the interior.  Some of the reviews on the ILX will say the interior is not as nice as the Audi A3 or the BMW 3 series, but I beg to differ.  The interior is sleek and comfortable, the user interface on the touchscreen fairly easy to use.  The one complaint I do have is that the navigation app is only compatible with iPhone and as I am a Galaxy user, it is useless to me.  Also one thing to note with this car that salespeople at the dealership may argue with, is that this car performs WAY better on premium gasoline.  When I purchased the car, the sales person said the car takes regular gas.  I put regular in the car and experienced lagging at acceleration, rough idling, and I could feel the car stumbling when I would push down on the gas. When I brought it up to the guy who sold me the car, he said that was impossible, however, when I refueled with premium, the car was back to ""gliding"" and I have no trouble with acceleration.  Use your best judgement but don't always listen to the guy selling the car.  The guy who sold me my car knew nothing about the car and kept saying ""It is a beautiful car, it sells itself"".  Overall, I am very happy I did not go with Audi or BMW and know that when this car will need servicing, I will not walk out missing a huge piece of my paycheck.  It was a great transition from the RX-8.",5

It handles great on curvy roads, the seats feel like they were made for me. The price was even reasonable for the performance and comfort. This is the best manual I have ever driven, it's smooth, it's fast and it's so much fun! I highly recommend this car to anyone who wants a sporty, yet functional car.",4.75

The engine and transmission are as smooth as silk and it feels spritley.  It also looks great.  Great car!!!  I really enjoy owning my ILX.  The ILX offers a great value.  For just over $27,000 you get a lot of standard features including leather, 17"" wheels, back-up camera, luxury car dealership service treatment and Acura reliability.  The ILX handles great, for a small engine it is refined and smooth.  Acceleration is decent and the car feels more powerful than 150HP.  On the highway you don't even realize you have hit 80 because it is pretty smooth.  Road noise is the only downfall, but when you are listening to the great stereo you don't hear a thing.   If you read some reviews I think they are unfair, the car is excellent.  I test drove the Audi A3 1.8T and the turbo and love the ILX by far.",5

The refreshed 2016 ILX is what we expected in 2013, but instead got an expensive Honda Civic.  The 2016 feels much more premium and is quieter on the road.  The suspension feels tighter and more solid.  The exterior refresh is quite nice; it gives it a sportier look, but still looks like a luxury vehicle.  The greatest attribute of this car is the 8 speed duel clutch transmission, that is paired with the 2.4L engine.  The K24 is already a seasoned and beloved motor and this new 8 speed DCT is incredible.  The shifts are smooth, quick, and the rev-match down shifting is addicting.  This truly is the best compromise between an automatic and manual transmission.  This is my sister's car, which already has 47,000 miles on it and no problems have occurred.  That is no surprise, as my dad has an 09 TSX with 95k(never using the required premium gas) and never a repair once.  My father is now eyeing to replace his TSX with the ILX A-Spec and I too, will now be in the market for one, as well.",5

Premium  (leather pwr pass /drvr seats, etc.) Acura Watch Plus fully loaded (not A Spec) with 100,000 bumper to bumper, free roadside assistance, those expensive rubber trunk/floor mats,and 7 complimentary oil changes /tire rotations for $27,000 and 0% financing.  It handles like my old 1997 A4 Quattro 6 speed and not like the over priced, poorly designed, bastard-driving Audi's-BMWs-Mercs of this generation.  I used the paddle shifters to easily drive through icy conditions and felt incredibly safe.  It corners as well as my old A4, looks great, and with the Acura Watch Plus, I feel safer than I did in my large SUV.  Use your turn signal and the car tells you everything around you.  Forget about the turn signal light on the side mirrors, you don't need it.   Rear camera, lane departure, adaptive cruise, brake warning, BLIS, all standard with the Acura Watch Plus.  The best part is the driver can not only manually enable and disable, but also modify the settings for almost each feature.  Couldn't do that with the Volvo, Audi, BMW or Merc I test drove.  Got a job in LA and drove this car I-40 from NC to CA and at one point on cruise control, I looked down and the meter registered 500 miles before empty.  Normal city driving is usually closer to 350 miles per tank. Cruising at 90+ felt like 55...so watch the speedometer.  The nav system takes about 20 seconds to register once you start the car, but it got me through 2500 miles and not one wrong turn.  It even automatically reset the time zones for me.  I knew exactly where I was all the time.  The complaints about its awkwardness is probably from some professional reviewer who was paid by Volvo. The bluetooth is clean and clear and Siri sync works 99.5% of the time if only Apple would update software more often.  If I had to complain, the pass through is right at the wheel house, so it narrows and you lose about 12 inches of space where the seat drops.  But I was still able to load the trunk with two 40"" LED TVs with oops I forget to pack this in the moving van room to spare.  People are really impressed with its comfort and style.  I drove 2500 miles in 3 days and the seat was incredibly comfortable.   Best part is I laugh when I pull up to get gas and all the PREMIUM UNLEADED people watch their $$$ pour right into their tank.  My 1997 Audi was great, but when it needed repairs $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$  and $$.   I've owned American muscle cars and European sport sedans and a crappy Nissan Maxima swearing I would NEVER buy a Japanese car again.  This Acura is the best car I've EVER owned and I know I will easily and safely get over 100,000 or miles out of it.  Shhhh... don't let the secret get out.",1
6532, on 06/24/17 12:16 PM (PDT),Monica ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Expensive Name with Basic Entertainment," Very disappointed in the hands-free system when in actuality it's Hands-On. You can only dial numbers that are stored in your speed dial other than that you are having to use your phone to dial numbers. While driving your phone book and dialing is not accessible which is the reason why you need these options accessible to you while driving so that it can be hands-free. I feel as though for this car to cost so much that I paid for a basic Ford Focus entertainment system on the inside of it. This car doesn't have a dial pad to dial a number you have to roll the button and push the numbers which is Hands-On. The technology in this car doesn't make sense and is not a safety feature as they say it should be. I feel as though for this car to be as expensive as it is that this Siri radio should have come along with it. But no it's a basic radio station with speakers that are not loud at all and there's no touchscreen to do anything. This is by far the worst car I've bought and wish I would have kept my Hyundai Elantra which features on the inside were so much better than this Acura and I paid 10 - 15 G less. I've contacted Acura numerous of times with only to be told that this will go in a file for my complaints. I sure wish  they would give me another car with the features that are  basic in other cars or buy this one back. This is a $30,000 car and I am so disappointed in it . I advised them that I would sell them this car back in a heartbeat and now I'm stuck with an expensive car with basic features and a High car payment. So definitely think twice about buying the ILX because you will really be disappointed in the features that they offer you in such an expensive body.Review: nothing has changed for the better. No room in car and I've almost received ticket due to having my phone in hand for trying to make a phone call because the Calling system in the car is poorly done.  I've call the company and they still have not tried to rectify my problem or even offer me a better car from my money. Their attitude is oh well.

Like the exterior styling of this car very much.  However, I have a spine condition and find the buckets are too deep and make my back hurt after 30 minutes.  Hate the hesitation with acceleration & feel like I'm driving a tank, but need to make allowances here since I am coming for a car that has 260 hp.  Wish I had gone for the Navi on upper level package because there is a stupid black screen behind the clock that is distracting.  The cabin feels claustrophobic and small.  The seating adjustments are not enough.  I'm trying to find a seat cushion to fix the bucket issue, but everything pushes my head into the headliner.  I've had this car for 3.5 weeks and am counting the days until I can sell it & get something else.  I've sat in every Honda and Acura product and only found 3 seats that were comfortable for my back...Honda Fit & HR-V, and Acura TLX.  Latter is too big and hated the push buttons (had those on my teenage car and not going back!), car also too big.  Fit is OK, but feels like I'm downgrading from old Acura.  HR-V was OK, but don't want an SUV.  Finishes on interiors of Honda & Acura products really cheaped out now.  Still looking for something to replace this Acura ILX.

We currently have 6 Honda made products; 2 Civic (2005 and 2007), 2 CRV (2009 and 2013), the Ilx, and a lawn mower and all have been super reliable. I place reliability above anything else and my experience with Honda cars have been excellent. Both Civicc and the 2009 CRV have way over 100k miles and not one ever had a single problem.

The good thing is Siri works well and does understand voice commands. Likes: snappy, 8 speed transmission is outstanding, Best reason to own are the electronic safety controls.

After 300K+ miles and 11 years, I gave my old 2004 TSX to my son who is still driving it. I decided to lease a new 2016 ILX after Acura did the redesign of the exterior and put back the peppy and quick VR4 that was in my TSX. On the plus side, the car is just like the TSX: great handling, terrific on corners and curves, super reliable, solid feel, awesome braking, beautiful long drive on the road touring vehicle, takes 5 passengers around town comfortably with room for luggage, and gets lots of compliments on the styling and interior design. Gas mileage is okay - but not the 29 mpg average promised. Only getting 27 consistently when 1-2 passengers, much less with a full car. On the minus side, I wish the car was like the TSX: the dual screen technology seems redundant and is very distracting compared to the single touch screen the TSX had, the acceleration is hesitant - the car seems to 'think' about moving faster before it actually goes into gears. Gas mileage sucks in city driving. Freeway is 31mpg only, not the 35mpg promised. UPDATE after 1 Year: Exterior pain gets stained easily. Design flaw. Looks like the clear coat is easily damaged by on road flying liquids. OVERALL: Great car, just wish Honda/Acura had not removed the 'fun' and 'simple' aspect of the TSX.

I live in the city, but most of my work commute is on the highway.  I am a stickler for gas mileage and this car does not disappoint.

A HUD, which I feel is a must for all luxury cars2. Lack of lumbar support3. Poor entertainment system. Other brands offer a Bose or a bang and olufsen system. This car's audio is WEAK! It is sort of OK at its highest settings.4. Complicated command system. The voice command is OK, but messes up most of the time. Rerouting the GPS is a pain. Not very intuitive at all.5. The car takes a good half-one second to catch up if you suddenly floor the gas pedal - then it is sheer pleasure, with the engine roar and sudden burst of speed!The Good parts:1. The interiors don't feel cheap, very well done. A true luxury car!2. Low center of gravity, and very good handling. Very smooth start due to the 8 speed gear box.3. The looks ! With the 5 LED headlights, to the complicated body lines! This car is a looker, and people keep staring at it.4. Cost & maintenance. I also own an Audi A4. The windshield wipers on an Audi are $250 Bosch. They are $18 on the Acura!!! You can drive into a honda dealership and get parts, servicing, tune-ups. The german cars will bleed you dry, these won't!The german cars are quieter inside. But they cost $15,000 more to own, and are horribly expensive to maintain. I've started to spend about a $1000 annually on my Audi - the other germans are very similar.5. The seats are quite alright. I am about 6', I've tested the BMW 3 series and the Merc C-300s. The head room is the same, maybe slightly better on the ILX.The problems I've faced with mine:1. The cars don't come with a spare tire. BIG PROBLEM. I blew mine in one month, ended up buying a donut. The boot won't fit a full sized spare. Not ideal, but I can live with that.2. The lane correction system on all these cars is a pain in the neck. I now drive with it turned off.3. A problem with the transmission handle shifting to gear mode without the release /safety button being pressed. Has happened once. Will have it checked out at the next servicing. And oh, the servicing, including oil change, carwash & tire rotation was $100 only !!!!!I would love for Honda / Acura to improve the negatives that i've listed, and this will be a really 5 star worth car!",4

Obviously I am loosing the utility and AWD of a RDX but gaining more features, slightly lower payment, better gas millage, and a car easier to park.  Compared to the 1st gen the 2016 ILX is a huge improvement in every category.  Looks while subjective are much better with a more pronounced front end and a less frump tail end.  The amount of tech and features you get are way up from the 1st gen and the performance of the 2.4 direct injection 8 speed DCT is awesome.  While the performance is much improved the car might be a tad racer boyish for some with it's loud exhaust for those who prefer quiet luxury.  The ILX isn't as luxurious and doesn't perform as well as the Lexus IS 200T, BMW 320i, Mercedes CLA250, Audi A3 but it costs thousands less (up to $10,000 less).  I am leasing my ILX for 24 months but I negotiated my premium edition with a MSRP of $30k to $26,260.  Furthermore the highest trim Tech with A-Spec only adds up to $35k, so is True* luxury really worth thousands of dollars?  For me the ILX has just the right amount of luxury, tech, and value that I can ignore not having AWD, real wood accents, or a German branding.  What I can't ignore is the back seats being a 1 piece fold down and not a 60/40 split and not having a pass through.  Nor am I huge fan of the car requiring premium and the fact that AcuraLink only supports iOS!  Also, while Acura would love to capture a young audience the base and base with AcuraWatch are pointless because the Civic Touring features and price beats those models.  Acura you can't have you cake and eat it too, just sell the Premium and Tech Versions which still are reasonably priced at $30k-35k Msrp.  The Premium with Blind Spot, cross traffic alert, real Milano leather, and the two tier screen system are worth every penny.",4
6543, on 04/30/16 09:18 AM (PDT),Eric ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan Premium Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Hard to Categorize," This is a great combination of luxury and economy.  I paid  $9,000 less than the dealer's best offer on a comparable BMW 320i.  It's pretty quick at 0-60 mph in 6.4 seconds ( .2 seconds faster than the BMW according to zeroto60times.com) but still gets 36 mpg (the same as the BMW epa estimate) on the highway.  After driving the BMW 320i and the X1, the ILX interior materials seemed just slightly inferior.  And the noise and handling were just a little off.  I am very sensitive to squeaks and rattles.  So far, not a single one.  The 8 speed DCT is very smooth and precise.  Driving in sport mode changes everything.  The shift points are at much higher revs and the engine responds much more quickly.  This is my second Acura.  I drove the first one for nearly 200,000 miles and all I did was change the fluids and bulbs...not a single problem. I can't attest to the reliability of the ILX, but I'm betting it will be similarly phenomenal.  The expert reviews are all over the map on this one.  Do you compare it with a Toyota Corolla, or a BMW 2 or 3 series?  Therein lies the problem.  They have to put it in a category to make sense of all the vehicles and this one doesn't fit.

After looking at all the entry level luxury vehicles, I decided on the Acura ILX. My situation is, I wanted economical luxury. I wanted a car I could drive until the wheels fell off. I wanted a car that I didn't have to make difficult appointments for to get serviced or maintained. I didn't want to worry about what service needed to be done when the service due light came on....a burden I had driving the mini. For me, this car works great! I bought the premium package in black right around when they launched the 2016's... Drove it for a year and realized I had made a huge mistake. Black is a horrible color to keep clean when you commute and don't park in a garage! So when I took my car in today for its second ever service, I was somehow made an offer I couldn't refuse on a brand new white premium with ASPEC. There is a major difference between the two. I love the ASPEC seats and odometer and foot pedals. The front looks less like a beak! I'm so glad I upgraded! Maintence is painless and affordable! No stress car for younger commuter! I'm happy!***update 1 year later.  This car is a great commuter and is so easy for me to get serviced. No hassle ! I'm so glad I got a white car because I think I only washed it 4 times in a year! I'm driving the heck out of it and it's great!  Only complaint is the scraping if you exit a driveway or take a dip too fast.. you must be very very slow since the front end sits kind of low. Other than that, no complaints so far!",5

After owning 10 Honda's also , I thought I'd check it outThe car has a nice cockpit but no lumbar support or adjustment so it was out for me with back issues. It is laid out nicely but storage is the least I've seen in any other car. console compartment is small and cheap feeling and the door storage can fit a tennis ball??My main compmaint is a general one with the CVT transmission on ANY car. It COMPLETELY takes the fun out of driving and one feels like they're a passenger in a very expensive lawn mower or sewing machine. These transmissions are solely for fuel effiiciency. Very effective for that but that's where it ends. In one minute I knew this wasn't the car for me. It shifted five times before I got to 26 mph. The 8 speed transmission makes this worse Over al the car has great styling and will last for hundreds of thousands of miles like all Japanese cars. I just want to actually enjoy the driving experience. Acura is only better than Honda of you can spend over $30K. The Civic is a superior car to the ILX and less expensive.

6548, on 03/08/16 17:57 PM (PST),Tim S ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Swing and a miss," I bought this car because after test driving it reminded me of my '07 Civic Si, which I sold to go back to school, only a bit more refined. However, having spent a couple months in it, any refinement I perceived was a false assumption based on the Acura badge. I'll start with the positives: The engine is good; it's a rev-happy Honda engine with an okay noise and feels quick enough. Certainly not under powered, though it can feel like it's working a little hard sometimes at 80mph and above. The transmission is pretty good too, but it's an automatic. This car needs a manual transmission. And finally it has the right balance between ride comfort and feel for the road.Now to the bad: everything else. The worse is the driver's seat. The lumbar support is not adjustable. If you don't like to crank lumbar up to 11, you're not going to be comfortable. The upper part of the seat is even worse. There is absolutely no support for the shoulders, and consequently, zero lateral support. If you make a left hand turn at more than 5 mph you’re going to fall into the passenger seat. And somehow my feet even seem to get lifted off the floor when making turns at a reasonable speed, giving an odd weightless feeling that leaves me grasping for something to brace myself on. Which makes driving rather difficult. So you can forget about any spirted driving on twisty mountain roads. Then there’s the fact that in the best position I’ve found, my head is about half an inch from the ceiling, which creates more than a few visibility problems.The rest of the interior just feels cheap, like it was made by Fisher Price. I had been driving a mid-level Ford Fiesta. I assumed that even the cheapest Acura would be a huge upgrade in quality. I was wrong. Here’s the things that were betting in the 3 year older and $12,000 cheaper Ford: Steering/handling; leather wrap on the steering wheel; stereo (the stereo in the ILX is garbage)’ phone call quality; ease of using phone controls…pretty much everything related to the infotainment system. And the overall feel of the interior materials is just not that much, if any, better in the Acura. Also, the trunk is extremely cheap on the ILK. The lid feels like it’s made of tin and weighs about 2lbs. So you might think that if you don’t care about the infotainment system or having the feel of a luxury car, and just want something with decent driving dynamics, this car is worth a look. If it weren’t for the issue with the driver’s seat and lack of a proper 6-speed manual, I might even recommend it. But as it is, there are many other cars in this price range to look at, such as the GTI, WRX, and even the Civic Si.",1
6549, on 02/14/16 12:26 PM (PST),PJ ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Deserves one more star but please read it.," I got my car back in April of 2015. Reason I took off one star is squeaky front brakes issue.  It's factory defect and acura is aware of it (Please google on tgat issue if you are interested). Acura did not want to change my brakes at time I came in and I don't have any more time to waste with them so I live with it.  It's a huge disappointed  especially for a brand such as acura. Another star I taken off because I believe few other things could have been better.  Such as,  very rough ride over uneven pavement and especially potholes. No 40/60 rear fold,  whole rear seat just folds.  Steering is a little numb as well. Not too much headroom for tall drivers. Never the less its an enormous value. For $27k you get compact (a plus for some)  0-60 in less than 7 seconds,  great fuel economy,  decent handling,  sunroof,  keyless entery,  duel clutch transmission,  full Led head lights,  Adaptive cruise,  crush prevention system, auto dual climate, heated seats and mirrors,  back up cam,   Acura badge (Might matter to some.",3

Just thought you'd like to know.  I sincerely don't understand Edmund's grade of ""C"" for the ILX.  I drove the Lexus IS 200t.  Yes, it was very smooth and very powerful.  But it costs almost $10,000 more than the ILX.  And has anyone noticed that the front grill of the Lexus looks like the mask for Darth Vader?  I'm sorry, but once that picture became fixated in my mind, I just couldn't stand looking at it any longer.  I also drove the BMW 228i.  A little more money than the ILX but with half the standard features and honestly, I didn't feel much difference between the BMW and the ILX.  I love the look of the ILX with the Prem and Aspec package.  The spoiler and upgraded wheels make the vehicle.  The upgraded interior is also really nice and the seats have a nice sporty feel to them.  The acceleration for this 200 hp engine is tremendous.  Okay, so I also drive my 013 Toyota Tacoma so getting into the ILX is like getting into my own sports car.  I like the sound of the engine and I like the feel of the road.  We also own a 014 Acura RDX and it drives like a charm.  My only tiny complaint is I wish Acura would make a coupe the size of the new TLX or the ILX.Updated review....Still fun to drive, just not as fun as I first thoughtThe 8 speed transmission lags when extra speed is needed. Also, the transmission kinda jerks when it is down-shifting and then I need to punch it to accelerate. Also there is a rattle that just drives me crazy. It is a fun car to drive. I'm not sure I will buy another ILX. Who knows.",4
6551, on 02/05/16 23:08 PM (PST),carfever ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan Premium Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Bells and Whistle Galore!," I really love this car.  It has everything I wanted for a great price!PRO:($30,000 out the door)This is the perfect car for me since I am not searching for people's envy.  This car has everything in my opinion. It has great gas mileage(I am averaging 32/gallon), galore of standard features like my favorites(resetting the gas odometer and mileage whenever I refuel, also 3 different backup camera viewing angle was very helpful when I need to back into my garage).  The leather are very comfortable.  Stereo with 7 speakers and sub-woofer, usb, bluetooth, HDMI, and sat radio keeps me going on my daily grind.  Great value for my hard earned cash.  I would recommend this car to anybody that appreciate great value and reliability.  CON:If you are looking for true luxury entry-level luxury sedan, this is not it.  As per the review said, the interior are nice but not as luxuries as Mercedes or Audi.  It does not drive with peppiness that you get with Mercedes or Audi.  I find the acceleration weak but the thing is because this car is trying to save gas, so it keep shifting below 2000rpm....(you can do manual shifting if you are into burning up your gas and driving faster).  Your neighbor is not going to b like ""oh my! you got a new Mercedes or Audi!). But you know what? I got good price and great value for my car so F the neighbor...haha!",5
6552, on 01/24/16 08:48 AM (PST),BAN ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan Premium Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Great car!," I got the Premium pkg. This car handles really well. Great pickup, very stable, breaks nicely, feels solid and safe. I am ver happy with the great mileage. The interior is nice and roomy. My husband and son in law, who are tall fit fine, no complaints. Great looker, I love this car. The Navi I'm not too crazy about, but I just use my iPhone; for me, the rest of the great pros override this one feature.",5

Pricing-wise, the base MSRPs are not that far apart; but, once you start adding options, the prices begin to spread apart.  Comparing all the features in an Acura ILX with Technology Plus and A-Spec, the price differences can vary as much as $5k-$10k. Add to that the recent year-end incentives, and the price difference can go as much as $12k.Considering the reliability of Acura, and its traditionally high resale value, the ILX represents the best value in this category.",5
6554, on 12/07/15 08:57 AM (PST),Ronnie ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan Premium and A-SPEC Packages 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Not as thrill asi thought to be," I came from a manual stick shift 2003 Acura RSX Type S. I love that car and the only reason why I stick with Acura. I need a small compact 4 doors vehicle since I'm a family man with two kids. I looked at the Civics, the Accords. But they just blah and not exciting in terms of styling. Plus. I didn't want to be like 80% of the car out there on the road, so many of them. From teeny boppers, grandma's, Grandpa, to your soccer moms. No thanks. So there it is, I got the 2016 Acura ILX with premium/Aspec package. Honestly, its not really an upgrade from my RSX. Everything about this car feel cheap and could be better. Feels like they are rushing it. The gears always shifting. It can never stay in one gear long, it always shift to make sure the gears are highest fuel economy at the current speed. It's good for gas saving but when you trying to merge or switch lane, you need it to be in a gear that responsive to the throttle. Instead, the car will downshift creating that half to second delay acceleration. Coming from a cable, maybe it have to do with the new electric drive by wire, who knows but its really annoying when you need that quick acceleration. Now on the other hand, the Dual Clutch mode is awesome, stellar and works perfectly. I think that pretty much the only part of the car that stands out. Very responsive, smooth gear transition from downshift and up shift. The steering is numb and you don't feel that much road feed back. The handling is good. Not much body roll. The car puts me to sleep. I need some excitement, the thrill of a screaming VTEC kicking in. Instead I got a very boring tone. The seat doesnt have much bolster to snug you in. I feel Acura lost touch with its racing heritage. My other pet peeve is the head room, I'm 5'11"" but it really cramp in there. Only about in of space left from the ceiling to my head.  I will probably pass this car to my wife in a few more years and get myself a stick shift car. If you like driving like grandma, just chill, relax, cruising and looking good in it. Then this car is for you.",4
6555, on 09/01/15 15:13 PM (PDT),Shane Gochenouer ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan Premium Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),I LOVE this car!," This car has met all of my expectations and surpassed most of them, it is everything I was looking for at a very reasonable price point. I previously owned a 2014 Civic EX 4dr, which I bought, at least partially, because Civics are traditionally modders, with a lot of potential for customization. Not so much the case (mechanically) anymore, unless you get the SI, but I work in the city and bumper to bumper commuting with a manual, forget it. At any rate, the ILX offered everything I wanted my Civic to become, sporty, both in appearance and performance (big emphasis on performance), as well as more luxury and Honda/Acura's legendary reliability. I did a LOT of research before pulling the trigger on the purchase and I just don't think that anything out there can touch the ILX if price is at all an issue for you. Go to Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus websites and ""Build and Price"" their entry level offerings with same/similar features and you will see what I mean. In NONE of those cases are you getting anywhere near the ILX in features, performance, quality or reliability for under 40K (the model I bought, w/ premium package, stickers at $30,820 with destination charges). If you are looking to buy a status symbol, this isn't the car for you, but if you want luxury quality and performance combined with unmatched reliability, this is definitely worth a look and test drive, I consider it a class leading example of what I call ""practical luxury"". Also worth mention, I had a 2015 ILX base model (with the 2.0) loaner for a day and a half while the dealership installed a remote start and was NOT impressed, the 2015 would not have won me over, I would still be driving the Civic, so if you have an  earlier model and weren't pleased or it didn't meet your expectations, give the 2016 a test drive. The only Cons I have to offer are getting into and out of the vehicle (at 5'11"" with short legs and a long torso) can be slightly awkward and low speed crawl can be chunky at times (for the first week till you get used to shift points) however from the reviews I have read on its competitors it still excels in this area (I haven't test driven any of them).UPDATE: After 8 months driving it every day, I still love this car. My only takeaway after 8 months is that without Navi the 2 screen layout can feel pretty redundant, but that's such a first world problem I don't even feel good complaining about it. Sport mode is awesome, whether or not you use the paddle shifters, which by the way can be used in normal drive mode as well.",5
6556, on 08/28/15 09:43 AM (PDT),barry ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan Technology Plus Package 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Solid Commuting Car," I use this car almost exclusively for commuting, about 20 miles each way. It's a good solid car with great value. Acceleration is more than adequate and the extra tech you get with the tech plus package is great. I did have a  problem with my car upon delivery. About a week after I got the car I noticed a vibration, especially in reverse. I brought it in to the dealer and they found that the engine mounts weren't aligned. They fixed it and I was on my way. About a month later the vibrations came back. I brought it back to the dealer and they replaced the engine mounts (covered under warranty). I haven't had a problem since.Pros:Great value for what you spend. Braking is excellent, gives a real secure feeling. I know a lot of pundits complain about the dual screen system but once you get used to it there's no issue.Cons:Transmission at highway speed is very smooth. At low speeds, particularly stop and go traffic, the transmission can be very choppy and downright uncomfortable. After about a month of driving I became more attuned to this and am able to avoid a lot of the choppiness. It can still be a minor annoyance. My other complaint would be a lack of lumbar support. Any car that claims to be luxury must have it.",4
6557, on 07/28/15 13:33 PM (PDT),Donald Bassett ,2016 Acura ILX Sedan Technology Plus and A-SPEC Packages 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 8AM),Issues with infotainment, This is my first Acura and generally I am very happy.  I haven't had it in for the first service yet but wanted to know if anyone is having issues with the infotainment system.  About once a week when I start the car the radio stations will come up with all the programmed numbers wrong.  The stations are correct if you select them but the numbers displayed are wrong.  Sometimes it will correct itself after a while and sometimes it won't.  Twice the backup camera has not gone off when I shift out of reverse and the upper display stays on the back up camera the entire time I am driving.  Next time I start it will go back to normal.,3

There was a brake defect where the brakes kept squeaking and after the rotors were replaced once and pads twice, the issue came back.  I think a recall will come at some point, but I was not going to wait because I was very disappointed.  The other Acura's I have owned have been great, I was very surprised that this car was released with this issue.  I traded it for a Mazda CX-3 and it is more fun to drive and and feels more powerful then the Acura.   The other issue with the Acura I noticed was the engine hum, it actually bothered my ears when I had the windows open.  The 2014 Acura ILX I had I liked better overall after owning this one for 3 months.  Before purchasing ask the dealership to give you one of their loaner cars that has a few miles on it and make sure you like driving it in everyday driving.  I would recommend buying a used 2013-2015 ILX instead.  Or a Mazda 3, I think the Mazda 3 GT would be more fun to drive everyday than the Acura.",5
