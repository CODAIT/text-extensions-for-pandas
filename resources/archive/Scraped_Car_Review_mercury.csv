1, on 03/26/17 13:50 PM (PDT),Jacque Montague ,2002 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan LS Premium 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),I see why these are so popular.," I purchased one of these used, from the original owner, the car currently has 125,154 miles on it and still is in excellent shape both cosmetically, and mechanically. This car is very simple to maintain, and everything is simple to use, no fancy things like on modern cars, but isnt completely in the dark ages. Instrumentaion is plenty, and easy to read, stock radio is very good, and cassette deck is still working fine. The leather interior has also held up very well for being 15 years old and has no holes or tears, trunk space is absolutely massive! A perfect summer home rental for tourists! The 4.6L V8 is an excellent motor, and can get out of its own way when asked to, and I personally get about 18.5MPG in town and 26MPG out on the highway on 87 octane. Its been an excellent car, and I can see why they last so long, one of Ford's highest reliability cars/platform! I would recommend one of these to anyone who's looking for a smooth car, with excellent reliability, cheap to service, but still doesnt kill the pocketbook on gas.",5

I spent $7,000 for a 2002 with 70,000 miles on it.Now at 100,000 miles I have to put $2,200.00 into the car. The whole front suspension is shot.Upper and Lower Ball JointsSway Bar LinksIdler and Pitman ArmsI am very disappointed in my investment. Also that car gets horrible horrible gas mileage.

Garage kept, prestine condition.  Have had it two weeks and am enjoying the 45 mile round trip commute to work.  Surprisingly great gas milage, I use premium in the tank.  Smoother than silk ride, corners like a dream.  I definitely feel safe having my family in the car.  I forsee many excellent years in this beauty.  By the way, this is my first Ford...swore I would never own one...previously only owned Japanese or German...making a believer out of me. ",4.875

I bought mine in February 2009 with only 56,000 miles on it and lots of garage time, so it is immaculate.  What a pleasure to drive.  Mine is the LS with the billboard size digital dashboard readings and all the bells and whistles.  Though it is seven years old, everything works perfectly.  Never and oil leak or a squeek or a squak.  The ride will nearly put ya' to sleep.  My worst MPG is 21.6 mpg and my best is 25.8.  Nuttin' wrong with that.  Love this car, and just wish Daddy could have seen it, as he loved Mercs!  This is my first one after owning Dodges, Buicks, Olds, and Pontiacs.",4.875

Proper winter snow tires are essential for driving on snow and ice and where permitted studded tires improve traction immeasurably.

I don't know where some of the people get off giving it a bad review. I am 43 years old and have driven everything from Beetles to Vettes.

8, on 05/23/07 17:23 PM (PDT),Roy ,2002 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan GS 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),Good Car that Could Be Better," My experience with FoMoCo products is that they are good ideas poorly executed. My Mercury is a case in point.  While perfect for people looking for a traditional RWD sedan that owns the road, this car lacks the solidarity and reliability its predecessors possessed.  It handles well for its size in braking, acceleration, and cornering.  It also is a good ride on the highway.  But don't expect too much from it. The engine has mounds of torque but is noisy when pressed. The engine is a great performer, but you got to go light on the gas unless you (a) can afford speeding tickets and (b) are related to a Saudi prince and have inherited your own private oil well.

One can only sit on 3/4 of the front seats as the seat belt receptor is solid and sticks up through the seat. It can not be moved. Without that seat belt reception problem, one could sit in the middle of the seat and get support on the right side of the cushion. As it is one sits on the left side support and middle of seat: extremely uncomfortable. It would be ok for a small person, i.e., 100 pounds or less could sit in middle.",3.875

True more people would look at us if we had 23's, or full-fledge aero kits, flip down DVD's,etc. Oh well, the price you must pay if your wife tilts the scales at 300+, your kids pack enough junk for a weekend trip for a whole summer camp, and you have a lead foot that eats CV joints for breakfast",4.375
11, on 07/12/06 00:09 AM (PDT),Lisa ,2002 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan LS Premium 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),Cushy gas  hog has issues," We were so excited to get into this buttery ride only to have our Marquis buzz killed when the fuel pump went out at 47,000 miles after only having it a month & one 400 mile trip under our belts. Another surprise was the terrible city mileage, much lower than the stated 17 mpg, around 10 mpg. Highway ok w/25 mpg. As I've seen mentioned I have to agree the lack of a center console leaves one stuffing everything into the paltry pockets given in the front seats or on the floor. So despite the wonderful smooth ride the overall economy leaves me wishing we'd shelled out for a Camry etc. PS.Loaner car during fuel pump was a Sable '05. It was a gas hog also (15mph?!). Ford/Mercury needs to wake up",3.25

The car was totaled, my life was saved.  I now own a 2002 Grand Marquis LS Ultimate, purchased new, and I couldn't be more satisfied with an auto. Gas mileage in town is 21 and on the hwy it's 26, great for a huge engine like the Grand Marquis sports. I feel so safe and comfortable in this car. I just wish the newer models had the same comfortable headrests that my 2002 has in place. I have 90,000 miles on the odometer and the car still drives like it did when it was brand new...still looks great too! A tremendous car for the money!!",5

The alarm system will not disarm.  It had a water leak and smells like swamp water.  There is nowhere to put anything.  It is total junk.  I've already had to replace the exhaust system.  It is basically $22,000 worth of junk.  I will never own another.  That's a promise.  Mercury will fix nothing.  36,000 miles and you own it baby.",2

Only bad thing is town mileage is 12 mpg.  The only thing that has gone wrong with this unit is the heater fan went out.  With the leather interior it's very similiar to the Lincoln..body mounted on same platform.  Purchased this car for $9,000 less than same year Lincoln.  If you're looking for a large comfortable car with great hwy. mileage you won't find better in this price range....Now the sad note....I have to purchase an Expedition 4x4 for my business and we all know what kind of mileage they get.

Had a 94 Grand Marquis that was so bulletproof, I bought another Grand Marquis.  This one has been flawless as well, other than the driver's door speaker needs replaced or tightened.  Starts, runs, and drives without any complaints.  The car is much quicker and handles better than the 94, but the exhaust is noisier, the ride is firmer, and the steering much less isolated from the road.  Not sure which I prefer, but the basic goodness is still there.  ",4.75

Other was a '96 which I drove for 100k miles and loved doing it. My 2002 I bought used with 11,000 miles on it and it hasn't been a dissapointment at all. Rides great, acceleration good and gas mileage on highway averages 27 mpg. Love it esp. with the price of gasoline going up these day.

20, on 12/17/04 14:53 PM (PST),Big Car Lover ,2002 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan LS Premium 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),It's a toss up," I want to make a few comparisons between this and my '94 Gran Marquis.  Same: Road/Wind noise is too high, especially the windshield when it's raining. Odd huh?  Suspensions: The '02 is MUCH stiffer than the old boat-like ride the '94 has. This would be personal preference for which is better. To me, the '94 is better for highway cruising.  Interior: '02 is more stylish, but some of the items seem to be of cheaper material. I like the '94s button layout better.  Exterior: '02 a bit sportier looking but I prefer the rims on the '94. '02s are very generic looking to me.  Other stuff: Give me a real antenna! The built in one for the '02 just doesn't pick up the signal as well!",3.875

Why can't Ford start making some cars not cruises. I also own a Toyota Avalon which is ten times better.  The Mercury takes 9.7 seconds to get from o-60 with a v8 engine with 224 HP and the Avalon takes 8.5 seconds with a v6 engine with 210 HP. If you want a big boat go Linclon, Toyota, Lexus, or Acura.  This car has been in the shop ever 40,000 miles.  It has mainly been in the shop for electric problems and loud radding.  Go Toyota Boo Ford!",2.75

Spacious, GREAT smooth ride, ok performance, super inexpensive to buy, maintain, repair and insure.  It's no sports car, it's certainly no gas miser Prius (12 dense traffic, 16 mix, 23 highway @ 80mph), but if you want a comfortable, roomy, low cost per mile ride this is it.  The interior materials are not high quality but are serviceable.  The trunk is good old American sedan huge and the car seats five comfortably, six in a pinch.  The rear air suspension does a great job of keeping the car level when loaded.   The handling is not as bad as some write ups would have you believe.  It's open differential RWD without stability control.  If you don't have a reasonable understanding of physics, go find a modern nanny-mobile to do the driving for you.You can drive over pot holes without worrying about blowing a tire or knocking the front end out of line.  It's much more forgiving than a modern FWD with weenie low profile tires.  Personally, I got tired of replacing tires and wheels during winter driving.  2006 and newer models share a solid 4 speed transmission with the F150 pickup truck.  This is a solid vehicle.",4

This is the 3rd used MGM in our family so far. I got all of them used for stupid cheap.  This one had only 31.5k miles on it.  Inside is all leather and walnut burl.  When I bought it, the driver window was stuck down -- I had the armrest window switch replaced for $85 (parts & labor).  The tires it wore looked like the factory tires yet and were dried out, so I put on some new Michelin Defenders; not cheap tires but the ride immediately became smoother and quieter.  The driver's visor vanity mirror lid was cracked -- I replaced that with a used eBay visor for $50.  Other than normal wear items such as tires, a battery, etc, the car has been pretty much flawless.  It now has 51k miles and runs like a top.   Brake pads still have plenty of meat left on them.  Car tracks straight and handles great.  Decent pickup for a big car.  Not a race car by any means, but easy to merge or pass someone with on the Freeway.  Tons of seating room.  Tons of cargo space.  Nice for towing a light UHAUL trailer whenever you like.   Woodtone steering wheel feels wonderful, although I normally drive one-handed at 6 (and maybe also 9 o'clock) position and it's perfect for that.  Wonderful bright headlights that light up the shoulder when you hit your turn signal.  Integral fog lights.  SIX...yes, I said SIX seatbelts.  Mine burns regular but also accepts E85 flex fuel.  Surprisingly good mileage on freeway -- over 26 mpg driving from LA to Sacramento area and back.  In town, the mileage sucks, but remember, in LA you are idling a lot at red lights.  Things I would like to change:  Raise rear end a bit so hitch doesn't scrape.  Brake function....although I may have some air in my brake lines.  Driver seat is too benchlike; it is very comfortable, but I'd like more lateral support.  Previous owner did not order with side airbags; I would have ordered those...UPDATE: Took over my wife’s car in late 2017 and sold this one.

However,if you read the Edmunds review, it sounds like this car belongs in the 19th century. What is the purpose of a car? To get one from point A to point B safely, comfortably, and reasonably economically. The Grand Marquis does all of this very well. I get 27 MPG on the highway and average 23 around town. I drive it conservatively. I'm tired of Edmunds and others running down these cars in favor of more sporty handling vehicles that corner better. What the heck do you need that for?

This is where the 2003 Crown Vic. is the most fun to drive but the 2008 Grand Marquis wants to drift all over the road. I think the problem may be that the front end is set up for the old 16 inch wheels and with the 17 inch wheels you are getting a wider bite of the road which causes it to want to drift. The high beams are also pretty useless. They do a great job of illuminating signs and trees but don't put much good adding light to the roadway. This may also be a 16"" vs 17"" setup issue.",3.75

Now the intake manifold gasket is wrecked due to leaking antifreeze and made worse with rain (which my mechanic couldn't suss out for months because it wasn't throwing error messages through the machine), which fried one of the cylinders - parts are about $400 alone.  Only 145k miles on it and it is just falling to pieces.  Not to mention since the car is rear-wheel drive, even the barest hint of snow or mud made it slide like crazy.  Even with the best studded tires and weight in the trunk, this car could NOT keep a hold on the road in anything but sunny conditions.  Gas mileage, even mostly highway, wasn't all that great.  Not the worst, but certainly not cheap to keep filled.  It wasn't all bad, though - very smooth drive, lots of punch and power (especially uphill - nobody cut me off!), incredibly, deliciously comfortable seats up front and in back, tons of storage space, and very classy-looking.

The car is beautiful, it looks better than most town cars. Mine is silver with a black cloth roof, and decked out with chrome.       I have never been in a more comfortable car, its very quiet and it rides wonderfully with that air suspension. It's a shame that its viewed as an ""old person's car,"" because I am 20 years old,and love the car. It is extremely easy to handle, park, and drive; people who complain about bad parking or bad handling need to go back to driving  school.

Well all said and done, second too none. The MGM is by far the best car I have ever owned, inside and out. I've given this car the highest ratings all around including fuel economy. I find though my research most larger cars as well as mini-vans or other family sized vehicles average around 20-25 mpg. I average about 25 mpg (26.7) to be precise with my Grand Marquis. Now factor the size and weight and power of the car and compare that on a scale to ANY small car or large car. You will find the MGM is the green or most fuel efficient car on the road. Outside of fuel economy, I rate the reliability five stars. MGM has a proven record and still holds it.",5

Driving is effortless. The base V8 provides more than enough power to get you into trouble. The car gently glides over bumps and potholes instead of jarring the passengers like most cars. Handling is surprisingly sharp for such a large car. It has enough room to seat five adults comfortably and an extra seat belt if you have to take six. I have the LS Limited, which is almost as nice as a Town Car for a lot less. Because Ford rarely changes them and the old cop Crown Vics flood the used market, there are plenty of deals available.

You can red line it forever without over heating it.  Super easy to install a super charger and HP chip which put's it over 500 HP and torque.  Very nice interior/exterior.

One down side is it is smaller inside than a TC but everything short of a van is. If you are looking at one to buy I would jump at it. Great safety, dual air bags. Handles like a sport car, rides like a luxo coupe. Good mileage, lots of space. Looks fantastic. If you want a more sporty ride get the Marauder. But I can not fault this car.

I also owned two Ford Crown Vics basically the same car. Outside of car is rather large .Front interior room above average, shockingly little leg room in back. Adequate head room for taller drivers. Very comfortable seats has lumbar adjustment.Pleasant interior.Smooth ride. Odd that it has a tachometer for this is not a performance car.Plenty of front leg room, adjustable steering wheel nice.Easy to get in and out. Easy to operate power windows and power seats.Awful electronic digital odometer that I can't read in bright light . Perfect for long trips but dangerous on wet and icy roads for it has rear wheel drive and will easily lose traction,so I don't recommend for anyone living in the snowbelt. Appearance of car is pleasant ,looks like a Lincoln Town car and has the same V8 engine which gives plenty of passing power basically a Lincoln Town car for a lot less money. Huge trunk !They  improved the handling in 2003 .Try to find one without  those awful rear suspension airbags that would leak.Electronic throttle stuck cost $550 to replace.The ENTIRE AC went out compressor,actuator,blower wheel and dash board  switch cost $2,200, common problem this year.1995 through 2001 have plastic intake manifold that cracks cost $800+ to fix.The engine will last 300k if you change oil.No transmission problems.Poor trade in value but overall are an inexpensive used car .Try to buy one from an older person who maintained car.Many used as police and taxes avoid those for they tend to have over 200k and are usually worn out.The early Mercury Grand Marquis had a plastic intake manifold that would crack and overheat so look for a latter model with aluminum intake.Gas Mileage is just fair ,especially bad around town.Engine and transmission smooth and reliable,ZERO problems !!!  The electronic gas pedal stuck a very dangerous situation ,it cost $600 to get it repaired. Even more expensive the entire AC went out at 35k first the AC compressor went out then the actuator that opens and closes the doors switching from AC to heat. Then the fan blower starting howling followed by the dash switch shorting out. It cost over 2 grand to repair. I live in Scottsdale, Arizona so you have to have AC.I owned a 2000 Mercury Grand Marquis and NEVER HAD any AC problems. This is the type of car people either love or hate for it is so large and is an old fashioned design. I mostly bought car for it is easy to drive  and the engines and transmissions in these cars go over 200k.I am 6'3 and 250 pounds and this car is easy to get in and out. Most modern cars are super small inside and I have trouble getting in and out. I do a lot of long highway driving and this car is perfect for that.Not very nimble in traffic.Large outer body by today's standards,sits low compared to all these SUV's and crossovers so you can't see over the other cars.Adequate acceleration.The center caps on the wheel covers keep popping off,I lost three of them.Really cheap wheel covers on the GS model.I noticed on other Grand Marquis they are always missing center caps,it you hit a pot hole they  will fly off.The LS model has nice aluminum wheels so this is not an issue.The LS model comes with leather seats not recommend in hot climates like Arizona.The cloth seats in the GS model are nice looking and never seem to wear out. Tires don't last long on these cars for they are heavy cars,expensive to replace,they wear out at 25k. Because these are heavy vehicles  make sure when buying a hydraulic jack that it is rated at 2 and quarter tons or higher.Most of these modern day hydraulic jacks are listed at only two ton,these will fail if you try to jack up the front of the car. Visibility is great.These cars will easily last over 200k if you change the oil and transmission fluid,some go over 300k so if you are looking for durability this is the car for you.I have owned several Fords including the Crown Vic which is very similar to the Grand Marquis.Most Fords products  are very average cars but this model holds up well,far better than the  pre 2010 GM models I owned. These make great used cars but check out the history of the car before buying,many of these started out life as a police car or a cab,so it may have a zillion miles on it.A lot of elderly people bought these things new ,if you can purchase one from them it will usually have low miles ,these cars will give you years of trouble free driving and are reasonably priced.",3

Generally my experience is relatively negative to foreign autos contrary to published opinion. My 1998 GM repair bill was under $3,000 for eight years of use while I averaged 25 miles per gallon on the highway. Everyone loves the room and comfort of these autos on a long trip.

The lumbar cushion in the front seats have given wonderful support.  I have the optional handling package which gives and extremely stable and smooth ride.  I also ordered the laminated security side glass which not only offers protection, but also adds sound insulation from road noise.  It's nice and quiet.

Just as much room as a Cadillac DTS but much more economical to buy and to maintain.

218, on 05/11/17 23:13 PM (PDT),Jim ,1998 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,Best affordable​ used car!," Bought this car for $500 cause the body looked like crap. Live in Ohio. It's going to rust. Had it for 10 months and put 30,000 miles on it. Minimal problems. replaced the intake manifold. Most owners will. Biggest drawback on my opinion. This car Handel's pretty good for a boat of a car despite the fact that it has the turning radius of a national park, but it has some of the best steering of it's time  The car is really comfortable. Not as roomy as I thought but it's roomy enough. The two drawbacks of the interior are the radio controls are pretty far away and the lack of storage. I bought an aftermarket console which solved the problem.controls on dash are simple but work. Repairing the car is pretty simplistic. There is a decent amount of space in the engine compartment. Parts are also cheap. Engine and transmission run strong. Engine lack power a little bit. But you don't buy a Grand Marquis to race. Replacing this car with a 99 in alot better shape and I hope to have that one for a long time.",4
219, on 07/25/15 05:58 AM (PDT),ed ,1998 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,"A ""new"" used car"," Update again: Another 8k miles, no repairs  or complaints so far! I may do a coolant flush and fuel filter soon. Idles nicer than a new car I rented.They asked me to update again. Now at 174K daily driven it is still doing fine. I got original Ford brake pads on Ebay for $10 (new old stock from 98!) and the dust issue is solved. Stops great too! Aside from tire rotations and oil changes, no issues! Update: She now has 165K miles. One slight issue was the starter didn't work one morning. After inspection I realized the starter key terminal was corroded, and I replaced with a Motorcraft starter for $100 and 2 hours of work on a tight bolt. Even if a shop did it its not an expensive repair.   Still gets 22Mpg and daily driven.  Original Tan paint is still in very good condition if it is detailed. Leather drivers seat is starting to show some wear. Neighbor now owns a 2002 GMQ and is very satisfied too!  Soon I'll change the coolant and 4 quarts of trans fluid. My only complaint is the wheels seem to attract brake dust, but I was told by the Ford dealer to use only the FORD OEM (not motorcraft) pads to stop dusting. That is what they install on those vehicles for a service. I used Thermoquiet which are great except for the dust.I got this car for $800 with about 135K miles. I put on about 12K issue free miles already, my neighbor has a brand new car in that timeframe, and it spent considerable time in the dealer, including fuel pump issues leaving him stranded. He said when its time to sell a used Panther is in his future. I am handy with cars and replaced some things, maybe more than I had to.  I changed all belts and hoses, but honestly the originals were still very good. The intake manifold MUST be inspected and replaced if original. If there is a plastic tube behind the alternator just swap it.  It causes everything from misfires to engine failure. It could be a DIY job, plenty of good tutorials. Pull the coil plug closest to the thermostat to check for leaks. Ball Joints wear at high mileage too. Electronics on this car are very reliable. I did a fluid and filter change on the trans, it shifts like new. This car easily has another 100+K miles left, millions of cabs have proven that. Just a matter of holding on to an older car. Handling is a bit boaty(but controlled) but improved somewhat with KYB gas adjust shocks. Mine does not have the sport/handling package, those have dual exhaust, stiffer suspension parts, bushings, etc, air suspension(which isn't expensive to service on these cars) and distinctive wheels. 2.71 gears give it 22mpg combined. I do have lots of nice features like a digital dash, cruise, auto dim mirror and power everything. I installed heated seats. These cars (pre 03) can't have a double din radio unless you replace the duct with an 03+ one. I wanted a newer panther but the price was too good to pass up. I'm very satisfied, and was close to leasing something that would have set me back thousands in this timeframe. Check the frame for major rust too, it likes to rust out under the air conditioner dryer on the passenger side. I put some fluid film there so there won't be an issue.",5

This is a problem with these motors. You can look it up on the net. The same motors are found in the Crown Vicsand the 8cy mustangs.I replaced the motor with another one with about 118k on it which I replaced with a after market intake manifold made out of aluminum instead of plastic.

Also to stop putting so many miles on my baby, my Mustang.  As far as performance, I'm used to the power of my GT, though the power is nothing like my Mustang, it's very powerful for what it is.  A full sized sedan.  I have only one problem with the car, and that's the interior. Only two cup holders (The car can seat 6 people).  Also the front arm wrests should have storage, along with the back arm wrests (If the car had rear arm wrests).  Oh, and the car needs a posi so both rear wheels spin.

The Mercury Grand Marquis does this better than any of these unibody fwd/awd, poor excuses for an automobile, cars.  Who cares that it doesn't handle like a BMW?  Most of us drive in relatively straight lines. Who cares that it doesn't go from 0 to 60 in 5 seconds.  We're not drag racing, are we?  Who cares that it only gets 28 mpg on the highway? Uhh, that's a lot better than many of these pretenders.  Who cares that it doesn't have blue tooth, etc and a lot of other foolishness that has no business being in a car and actually contribute to distracted driving and causes accidents and death.  When you're driving a car, you're supposed to drive it.  It's not a place for streaming video or talking to your friends or checking on emails.  Drive it or take a train or bus or cab or airplane. These are great cars.  I own one.  When it dies (maybe 250000 miles) I'll get another one. The only thing that comes close is a full size suv and they get lousy gas mileage.

The Panther platform extends form the Ford Crown Victoria which has been the work horse of every police department from here to Kalamazoo.The Mercury Grand Marquis is just a more dressed up version.

The Grand Marquis is a big, powerful, and comfortable boat. It is spacious in all aspects from the interior room to the size of the trunk. It floats along, but after some time in the drivers seat, you learn how to drive this car perfectly. I live in Muncie Indiana, the pothole capital of the world, and the suspension absorbs everything. The stereo is also better than you would think. If you drive calmly, you get fairly good gas milage. If you drive aggressively, you still go far thanks to the 19.5 gallon fuel tank.

For a V8 this car's horsepower is way less than impressive, most V6's and a lot of l4's nowadays have more power than it.

This engine is designed for fuel efficiency while being powerful enough at .75 hp per cubic inch. The car is designed for comfort, which is why I like the arm rests instead of a storage bin.

When I bought the car I was planning to put in a tuner kit to add 100 HP, but decided I did not want more horsepower as it had enough for anything but the drag strip.  It has room inside.  The steering is effortless, the brakes are good.  I feel safe if and when a foreign car were to destroy itself against my big Mercury and the insurance claims prove it.

They were/are all great cars.  Decent performance and economy; wonderful room, comfort, amenities, and ride; I find them to be quite handsome-looking (ymmv); and basically bullet-proof.  The front seats could provide a little more contour (they're kinda' flat) and ""cush,"" but they are still quite good.  I actually prefer cloth seats, but these are leather and that's just fine.  Bought it Nov 21, 2017 with just under 79K miles for $6900.  It was originally from Nevada, then Missouri so NO RUST anywhere - my mechanic gave it an inspection and couldn't find anything wrong with it at all.  Nice.  I promptly added some Nokian WRG3 SUV tires for year-round traction here in Michigan and also hit Crutchfield to upgrade the sound system with better speakers, an amp, and bluetooth capability.  I have also had two Crown Victorias (and was really looking for an LX Sport or PPH Package when I found this) and can't really find anything to complain about with the Panther cars.** UPDATE**Got an email from Edmunds requesting an update, so here it is:Still running and driving great overall.  Has a persistent ""squeak"" over bumps, but it's not that noticeable.  Required a rebuilt ETAC/HVAC head, and currently will miss a little when it's wet and cold ... probably needs a coil pack (I hope that's it).  I probably won't worry about that until next winter.  When I got the car with under 80K miles on it, the service history showed several brake jobs which I thought was a little odd.  Now the brakes shake/shudder a bit and I'm getting them done again here pretty quick and it only has about 10K miles on it since I bought it ... for some reason, this car chews up a set of front brakes about every 20K miles on average.

312, on 07/11/15 17:45 PM (PDT),DavidW9819 ,2009 Mercury Grand Marquis Sedan LS 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),Great Car For Tall Drivers," I'm 6'3"" and 300 lbs., and most cars made since 2000 are WAY too small to accommodate a man my size.  Not so with the 2009 Grand Marquis.  I have more headroom and legroom in this car than I'll ever need, although the back seat is a bit cramped.  That's not an issue for me, as I rarely have any passengers in the car with me, and if I did odds are they'd be a lot smaller than me and just fine with the rear seat accommodations.   I bought this car in 2011 for less than 1/2 the original MSRP and something like 27 K on the odometer because it was a fleet vehicle and the Grand Marquis was slated to go out of production that year.  In the four years I've owned this car, the only maintenance costs I've had are a new set of tires and regular oil changes.  I wouldn't even had to purchase new tires if the ones that were on the car when I purchased it hadn't dry-rotted.  (I live in the West, and the desert sun and heat rots rubber like you wouldn't believe.)  The steering column shaft was replaced under recall by the local Ford dealership in April 2015 even though my car is six years old, so kudos to Ford for having the integrity to stand behind its products even though they've discontinued the Mercury nameplate.  The only downside of the car are the low (around 11) MPG's, but that's probably because I do mostly city driving and run the A/C (terrific, by the way) 8-9 months of the year.  Fortunately, my round trip mileage to work is less than 10 miles, so even with gas currently at $3.15/gallon locally, the low MPG isn't really an issue for me.  I'm sure that the fuel economy would probably double if I drove on the interstate more often.  The 2009 Grand Marquis is one of two vehicles (the other being the Ford Ranger) that I wish Ford hadn't discontinued.  Both are reliable, low maintenance vehicles that will easily go 200,000 miles with proper care.  Hey Ford, how about making more vehicles without all the latest gadgets for us old guys?",5

This is the main thing I was looking for, since my wife has a physical handicap.  The front doors are high and wide, and hip and head room are excellent. The front bench seat, without a console, is a plus, for the extra legroom.   The leather power seats help getting in and out.

No problems to report other than lousy interior noise. Two Ford dealers have been given opportunity to correct noise problem--both have failed, in fact, I dont think they knew how to fix problem. Will not consider buying another Mercury or Ford product until noise levels have drasticall been improved. One dealer told me the Michelin tires could be the culprit. Pay $700 to $800 for new tires and problem could be resolved. Should have bought Honda or Toyota",4.625

Handling is very good for such a large car. Turning radius is a bit high (40 ft or so) which occasionaly complicates parking lot maneuvers a bit.

We have not have the car tuned or anything else to enhance gas mileage. This is no hype or exaggeration.Now, I know that it is listed to give 22MPG Hwy as the official number. That might be true when it is new but, once it is broken in, the MPG shoots up.

I've owned Mercedes, BMW's, Jaguars and Saabs. Needed something with low mileage and a great price. I was able to get both AND a great car. Looks like a boat but it's a wonderful car. Smooth ride and shifting. Quiet. I happen to like big cars. I'm not even a senior citizen! Has a lot of nice touches - turning beacons, nice interior touches, great finish, wonderful suspension. Wish it got better MPG's...15 in the city but much better on the highway...up to 29 mpg's which is amazing for a car this size. Power seats on both sides for the front split bench. Wish it had a console and floor shifter. Steering wheel has a lot of controls on it - cruise control (works great), audio, even temperature and fan control. However, the ""next"" button which goes to your next radio station or CD track only goes one way - up. So, you have to work your way around your saved settings. Has 2 outlets in the front - huge ashtray. Could have used a light there. The dash could have used a little sprucing up rather than some of the basic black plastic. Sound system is good but great. These cars have a tendency to have a bag leak in the rear air suspension. Will eventually take out the bags and put coils - for $250. Easy engine to work on - lots of room to get your hands dirty. Self-dimming rear mirror. Lots of value in this vehicle. Paid $3,500. Low resale value but my guess is I'll have this baby probably for a long time. Really am enjoying this automobile. The only issue I have with it is that the airbags for the rear suspension probably have a slight leak. This causes the compressor to kick in pretty often. I can either replace the airbags or just have springs put in their place. Same ride. It will cause the airbag light to stay on but who cares? Cost for springs is $250 plus labor.",5

Proven reliable platform and 4.6 is rock steady. Tuned for smooth power delivery and quite performance. Has no problem getting out of it's own way. I bought this car with 50000 miles, put a little money in to freshen it up and I love it. Also put a new radio, being a 2000 still had a tape player(tape player in 2000?). The cup holders are small. It now has 116000 miles. Costs  so far are air conditioning, bad coils causing misfire, and basic maintenance (oil, gas, tires). If you can get a low mileage gem with a good body, it's a good buy. Being a domestic fleet vehicle for much of it's production run means parts are cheaper and easier to find than some alternatives. Not much changed till they stopped producing in 2012. They became more reliable and efficient towards the latter years. Shares all major components with Ford(Crown Victoria), Lincoln(Town Car) stablemates (Body, engine, Chassis).  It's a real good car.

I have to say, I'm surprised it has lasted this long with us. The engine is great. Very powerful and quick to take off. Will definitely spin a pair of tires off. But, the transmission was terrible from the start, and the interior sizing is terrible for a car of its size. It's like they crammed to much sound canceling material into it before they thought about how they were going to fit the seats into it with enough room for the passengers to be comfortable in it. Air is great, I like the fact that it is a climate control system. Radio is terrible. And the rearview mirror is placed entirely to low. I wouldn't recommend this car to really anyone. ",3.5

Lots of room in the cabin and trunk though Id like a center console for storage. The driving experience is muted by vague steering and minimal road feel. The car wallows over bumps and turns and doesn't instill confidence in its handling, especially in wet conditions.

This is the first hybrid to drive like a regular car.  It is also clearly superior to the Ford Fusion Hybrid, Camry Hyrbid, Lexus HS250, Prius, and Altima Hybrid if you compare carefully.

Got a great deal and with the Federal tax credit and sales tax deduction an even better deal...better handling & road feel than a 2009 Accord & seats better than a Camry, however front headrests take some getting use to.

Once you are seated into the plush leather seating and settle back you will notice the headrest will push your head forward.  Long trips will put you into misery and a maybe even a visit to the chiropractor office.  When you try out the seating make sure you are not wearing a winter coat, that's what it takes to keep your head from being pushed forward.

Trans cost $2600; rear end $600.  Now I see people indicating there are suspension problems.  I am terrified.  This is not American! Ford has numerous complaints about trans. Problems.

After three tows, found out it was bad ground wire. vehicle sometimes seems to lag into gear from park when cold. Also transmission at times acts like something is going wrong. Have 75,000 mile warranty, hope it goes before then. A fine vehicle otherwise, gas mileage around town is 13 and highway is poor at only 18. Questionable whether I would buy another.

Or the next big one is the torque converter solenoid! So yeah good vehicle but somewhat hard to work on yourself. Overall it’s a good SUV good on the highway but not running and gunning around town you will eat that tank up fast! It’s also good in the snow as well, you can drive without chains.

I found my mountaineer for a steal of a price and haven't regretted it one iota. It's been a champ through and through. The gas mileage is what one would expect, but it more than makes up for it in the lack of repairs. The one thing I was warned is that it will chew up tires, but I bought a good quality set some years ago and have them rotated with each oil change. They've lasted just fine. The interior is roomy and altogether very manipulable- seats fold up for hauling kiddos and fold down very well for hauling cargo or sleeping in the back on a long road trip. It tows my small to medium loads very well and offroads without hesitation. The tech is outdated but reliable and user friendly. Aside from the usual routine maintenance have not had one breakdown yet in 10 years. I think my favorite is its incredibly tight turn radius.

Easily handles our 6000 lb boat and the standard hitch integrates nicely. Wish the mileage was better but all things considered, we are very happy after one year of ownership.",4.5

The 2006 is not an improvement but a huge disappointment. The ride is not good, very stiff! Even my 8 year old says his rear hurts after only 15 minutes. The transmission shifts hard and you feel it. There is very noticable jerky feel to the ride when at a steady mph. The 3rd row seats have a hole in them from the metal brackets when the seat is folded. Rear visiblity is very poor due to the headrest not going all the way down to the seat on the 2nd and 3rd row. I wish I kept my 2000 Mountaineer!",2.25

I worked for the US automotive industry a few years back, left, bought a Camry, but have since returned to my roots. After a lot of investigation, I was quite impressed with the Mountaineer specifications. Now that I own it, I am confident it was the right decision. My wife feels the same way. Gas mileage, well, you'll have to get over that. Do your homework there as well and you'll find that it's not so bad. Good luck. ",4.75

But watch that hard shift b/w 1&2 gear.  Ours (14 months old, 13,000 miles) is now in the shop for the third attempt to repair this.  Two torque converters and two transmission rebuilds later, we hope it is fixed for good.  Ford, in their infinite wisdom, would not authorize a replacement transmission.  So the mechanics keep rebuilding and replacing torque converters. Do not ignore the hard shifting b/w first and second gear if you have it in yours.  Otherwise we love the truck in all respects (except for the lack of door handles).  When it ran it ran great. What a shame. ",3.25

Wasn't planning on getting the fully loaded version and definitely didn't need it, but I noticed a BIG difference between the basic model and this (and didn't have a lot of choices for the good price). This drove much better than the basic model! I read lots of reviews before buying and I would say the petty things that were complained about aren't worth deterring you from this vehicle. If you try the Premier, you won't settle for the basic model. The difference is remarkable and worth it! Not really a complain ",5

The 4Runner is also overpriced IMHO. I also had a really hard time getting comfortable in the 4Runner. I always felt like I was facing downward; it was a weird perspective so I finally gave up on it.

Never overloaded it either. Can't figure out why/how this happened. 2) Rear tailgate has a plastic body part with Mercury emblem on it. It cracked even though there was no accident. Heard of other owners having same problem. Why did/does this happen? 3)  Power windows freeze up in winter will not work until they are thawed out.    Overall I like this SUV.

This is my grocery/camping/work/family vehicle. I love the sound system and leather seats and 17 inch wheels. It handles great and has good power for passing.

856, on 10/25/16 18:36 PM (PDT),TheDuke ,1998 Mercury Mountaineer SUV 4dr SUV AWD,I've been spoiled!," I bought my '98 Mountaineer for $6,400 in 2005 with 114,000 miles. The ride was smooth, although certain parts start to rattle after 150k or so. Excellent visibility. The rear wiper didn't lie flush, so I avoided using it.  Two days after purchase, the transmission was producing a warning light. Lucky for me, the dealer was willing to cover the $1800 cost of repairs. Aside from that, I never had any outrageous problems with this car. For the first five years, I used it as a work truck - hauling trailers, and at times piling as much stuff on top and in back as possible. This SUV is a tank! The 5.0L V8 pulled bushes and hauled trailers with ease. I was rear-ended twice, pushed dead cars to gas stations, and put this thing under countless other stressors and only had a few scratches to show for it. My wife has said that she has never felt safer in any car. Speaking of safety, the all-time AWD has spoiled me. Living in Missouri most of those years, my Mountaineer saw its fair share of ice and snow. I could go out when the pickups couldn't even escape their driveways. You should always be aware of road conditions, but your capability goes through the roof with some good tires and AWD, which in my experience is far better than 4WD. Even off-road, the Mountaineer will surprise you. We're talking dirt (even mud), gravel, and fields; it doesn't have the suspension to [properly] handle anything beyond that because that's not what it was designed for. Maintenance: other than routine maintenance (ball joints around 150k, alternator 150k, lock actuators around 170k, plus regular oil & tire maintenance), the biggest issue was a power drain that showed up around 145k, and would bleed my battery, killing it if left sitting for more than two weeks (this was common in college). This was inconvenient, but ultimately not worth the effort to locate the faulty wires.  I just parked uphill so I could roll backwards out of the parking space to get a jump if needed. I had to sell the vehicle at 185k, and my father jumped on the opportunity because he knew how reliable it has been given proper TLC. The last time I checked, he's got her up around 235,000 miles! Thought she was on death row last month, but after replacing the tires and ball joints she's running like a dream again. I don't think I will ever find another SUV or truck with that kind of longevity for the price. If you find one with low miles, jump on it.",5

I repainted the vehicle in 2005 as there was some slight paint fading, but considering I was living in Florida at the time and the SUV is black, you can expect that to happen, also minor electrical problems (doors). I have no plans to buy another car until this truck stops running; period! It currently has 125,000 miles and I have only replaced a water hose for $65, thats it!

I love how the 3rd row seats fold into the floor with a push of a button. I like the height, and my 90 year old friend can get in and out of the passenger seat without a step, with assistance. I have a toddler and it was nice not having to bed into a car to strap him into a car seat. The 3rd row seat is apparently pretty uncomfortable, and isn't easily accessible. It's ok for short trips on rare occasion. It got me around in hilly/rainy Pacific NW for 2 1/2 years without major repairs, until a couple months ago, at about 79000 miles. No accidents (only off-roading has been driveways). Despite routine maintenance, we've had to completely replace both the brake system and the power transfer case (total: about $5k), both destroyed due to the fluids inside leaking out. The thermostat, a hub, and the Navigation system have needed work or replacement as well. Every winter I've has to have a tube flushed due to debris (pine needles and such) coming in through the sunroof , causing rain in the car coming from the light  console. (said indoor rain has killed a couple of my personal electronics). The Nav isn't user friendly anyway, I ended up using my phone most of the time anyway before it broke (or disconnected in the wiring?.. we're working on that problem now).Now I realize my  descriptions may not be the most accurate, but my mechanic hubby understood and agreed with all the repairs, and has fixed some of it himself) If somehow it has very few miles on it I would say to get it, but otherwise I own a 6 yr old car with a lack of power that's required major repairs (that don't usually happen to cars under a decade old).",2

It has the same options as the Explorer. I just wish it had came with better color combinations. Not to mention, it drives practically the same.

There are a few feature missing like rear motion detector and heated seats and DVD..but for the 24K i picked this AWD up for we love it.  The 3rd row is not very practical..but we kinda knew that..it more of a nice option just incase you need to seat more people.  Once in the 3rd row...its not too bad even for adults.it just getting back there that is the issue.  However I think this is the case with most mid-sized SUV's.  The mileage is not great..but c'mon its an SUV what do you expect ;)  I really love this car and glad we went with this instead of a Lame Toyota Sienna.  Highly recommended..8.8 outta 10.,4.125

Its almost as comforting as Fords' full size sedans.  Controls on the dashboard could be a little better and they should add a power lumbar seat on the passenger side.

967, on 02/08/16 14:40 PM (PST),James L. ,1999 Mercury Mountaineer SUV 4dr SUV,Reliable and strong," My family purchased this vehicle in mid 2001 with about 40,000 miles on it. It's now sitting at 261,983 with no issues from the engine or trans. As a work vehicle, we had about 1,400 pounds in the back at all times, and it had no trouble hauling that. The AWD functions great, and with a chip to synchronize it, every wheel pulls the same no matter what. Traction is great, and even feels like it grips better in slightly wet conditions than dry. The interior has worn well for what we used it for, with the only major spot being the center console armrest having a hole worn in the cushioning. The radio works great, with better reception than our 05 Towncar. All in all its the most reliable vehicle my family has ever had, with parts lasting far longer than expected, like a fuel pump going for 250k miles, or an alternator going for 260k. Engine and trans are still strong, despite the overweight driving. Gas mileage is on the low side, but the stubbornness more than makes up for it in my eyes.Even overheating to lock down after a hose broke didn't slow it down.And update in Feb 2018. We still have it, and with even more abuse, including driving hot due to a radiator failure, it is still going strong at 300k miles. I would still recommend the Mercury Mountaineer to anyone looking for a used SUV.",5
968, on 09/06/15 20:35 PM (PDT),christopher ,1999 Mercury Mountaineer SUV 4dr SUV AWD,good starter vehicle but poor overall, ive put about $400-500 in this vehicle since ive had it at the start of 2015. ive had this vehicle since march of 2015. and im posting this on September of 2015. suv now has 177750 miles on it. bought it when it had about 168000 on it for $2000. lots of things wrong with it still. heres what ive noticed.. outside temp gauge has common problem of messing up and going out completely... brake lights dont like to come on and stay on unless your on the brake decently hard.. the brake lights will go off even when your braking and thats with a new brake light switch. driving on hwy is noisy as the design is bad... u can hear wind pretty good almost as if some window is cracked. headlights are poor design.. the point way to low down and dont go very far out.. hard to see at night. rear wiper blade doesnt even touch the window when it wipes. thats a common problem. another common problem is the radio goes out quick. had to replace it when i bought it. another downside is it has terrible gas mileage.. i get about 13 mpg in the city and around 16 on the hwy. and thats with keeping it maintenenced. 21 gallon fuel tank goes fast as hell in this suv with this mpg. the upsides..... parts are usually cheap for the vehicle... it has a nice outside look to it.. with about 100 bucks i made it look mean... (put a hood scoop on it and a light bar on top). its awd... so.. better traction all the time. its hard for me to even squeal the tires when i floor it from a complete stop with tires with only about 30% tread left. so traction is really good. my overall.... its a starter vehicle... not a good vehicle to have for the rest of your life thats for sure.,2

The 5.0 L V8 is a gas-guzzler that despite only putting out 215 HP propels the nearly 4500-pound car well. The interior quality is fairly formidable, though its aesthetics are lacking.  The cargo room of the Mountaineer allows it to function as the ideal vehicle to carry baseball, golf, or sporting equipment. The car is extremely reliable, far more so than the current mid-size SUV slate Ford offers. The fifteen-inch chrome wheels are aesthetically-pleasing as is the car's grille which sets it apart from its Ford Explorer sibling.  ",4.375

Other than that it has always kept us safe, kept driving us home and I never worried on long trips about it. I knew it would keep us all safe.

I paid way below book value, due mainly to the fact that it's somewhat of a gas hog and everyone was shopping for fuel efficiency at the time.  It now has 190,000 miles on it.  Just had new tires put on, new wheel bearings, and replaced a worn control arm.  I have had zero mechanical or electronic issues. We did replace the back hatch panel at about 100,000 miles which I hear is common for those to crack.  One hinge on the back glass hatch was replaced at the same time.   I hit a 10 point buck in January of this year that garnered me a new hood, driver side headlight and fender, grill and front bumper.  The Mountaineer took the hit, and I was able to drive it home!  There was still way more value in the car than the repairs cost.  I have the 3rd row seats and there is a ton of room for hauling kids, adults, and cargo when all of the back seats are folded down.  The leather interior has held up well; driver's seat is starting to crack a little.  The exterior is still nice except for a rust bubble forming over the passenger back tire and some rust on the interior back doors(?). The electronic ""perks"" are limited due to technology not being available at the time of production, but what's on it still works.  I love this car and dread the day that I have to trade.  I'm sad that there are no more being produced, but since the Ford Explorer is virtually the same vehicle, I'll probably go to that when I turn this car over to my teenage son.",5

Regular maintenance of tires, battery, brakes, alternator and exhaust along w/some suspension worries probably due to MI weather history.  I also had the CHECK ENGINE light, annoying dashboard light and rear windshield wiper failures that others have noted.  I recently had to replace the fuel pump (also annoyingly located in the gas tank) and that fixed the Check Engine light.  This might sound like a lot to some folks but I love this vehicle.

I had a sub wired from the factory head unit, and it sounded good for whathe it was.Gas mileage was horrendous, 5.0 awd, I would make 10 in winter and around 14 in summer. Because of age of the truck now it would do 0-60 in a solid 12 seconds.Seacting was spacious. Enough room for everyone in the leather interior. Mine had a 6 cd changer that whenever you would hit a bump it would cause the cd to skip.Two things that really weren't thought over by Ford truck; no heated mirrors and no heated leather. Upsides are if someone hits you, you always get money for it. In North Dakota if a car is older than 10 years then it can't be totaled. So every time someone would back into the car it was nothing but pay day.Upgraded to a 2016 Trax because my husband works at chevy and he would complain when it needed work.Sad to see it go, but the upgrade was necessary. 20+ mpg  here I come!",4

It needed a little tweaking, having 180k miles on it, so i fixed some minor issues, installed a cheap mp3 radio, some heavy duty shocks in the rear, and Bridgestone Blizzak snow tires...let me tell you, this thing is a beast in the snow! Absolutely unstoppable! The awd and 5.0 mustang V8 are the best features in this reliable suv. (Okay, i put a Flowmaster muffler on it too, just so i could have that nice V8 rumble in the winter time as well). Its not a horsepower monster...the top end sucks, but its a torque beast. I can launch from a stoplight at 3k rpm in a foot of snow and not slip one bit! It handles like a wide receiver in ballet shoes, like any 90's suv, and it sucks gas too, but every vehicle has its trade offs. This thing is awesome though.",4

I purchased this car 9 years ago with 150k miles it now has 228k miles very reliable no major repairs except I did replace the heating box in the dash because it only blew hot air (a flap inside malfunctioned)$400. There were no check engine lights on until a couple 1000 miles ago the parking brake light came on not bad for a car pushing a quarter million miles.

Unfortunately a cross-country move made it angry and the transfer case is has gone bad, but it's still drivable, just getting a lot of clunking from the chain connecting the AWD.

I am looking for another used suv, not because anything is wrong with the mountaineer, I'm just getting worried about mileage. But, I won't be selling it.

I've never driven anything better in the snow. I've only had to replace a front all wheel drive part and it has been hard on dash lights for some reason. It tows a boat twice the size of the truck. Expect about 13 to 14 MPG in the city in the V8 and about 18 MPH on the highway at 70 MPH. I've seen several in crashes and they hold up like a tank. The AWD model gets 65 percent power from the rear wheels and 35 from the front.  When slipping or in the snow the computer adjusts for traction.  It rides like a truck but if you can find one in good shape you have a good truck for as long as you want to own it.,4.375

Car is getting around 13 mpg and with gas prices edging closer & closer to $5.00 have come to the realization that it's time to get rid of it.

I needed something that can get me through each season, which is why I chose a used Mercury Mariner Hybrid 2008 AWD. I successfully added my own receiver and mounted in under the gps receiver that comes with the car (which I spliced into the cigarette lighter power and ground), and added a 10 inch sub in the back. I can confirm this vehicle can power an extra receiver/sub/amp/ and the hybrid battery can handle rumbling from the sub even when the sub is directly on top of the compartment that the hybrid battery is in.  In the winter time, this vehicle can get through snow pretty easily, and can handle ice with below 0 temperatures. In the summer, the car has not overheated in over 100 degree f temperatures. The interior is made with poor material but looks nice. The outside looks decent but has some rust above the wheels, and the paint has survived 8 years and still looks decent. The speed limit where I live is 70mph on the highway, and when going 70mph I maybe get 23-25 mpg average. If I go around 65mph I get 24-27mpg average. So no, you probably wont get 29mpg as advertised on the highway unless you are going way under the speed limit. When in town, if you stop quickly or are going slow, (usually slower than 25mph) the hybrid battery mode will kick in, which just uses hybrid battery power and not gas. This also makes the car almost silent, however you have to be going pretty slow for the battery to stay on, otherwise the engine turns back on. in town if you are going fairly slow, you can achieve up 60mpg with the battery fully on. If you are varying slow and fast speeds, you should be able to get at least 25-40 mpg in town. The only issues I have had was my steering column started to fail, and it costed me around $1000 to fix. Also one tie rod needed to be replaced, and both of the front wheel brake sensor and tone rings needed to be replaced. Lastly my transfer case had to be replaced, but this is most likely due to the 22 inch rims I used to have on the vehicle. Overall, for a used hybrid mini suv that also has AWD, this is a pretty decent buy.",3

Rust developed on both rear fenders on the top section. I found out this is common to Ford vehicles of this style. It has to do with the welding or how the two sections were fitted at the factory that allows moisture to collect. The vehicle is excellent. Not perfect but we wanted a fuel efficient SUV for traveling. It does that.  The seats could be more comfortable. This a Premium model that comes with a $3.00 radio antenna. Handling in snow, mud is superb. With proper use of the throttle it can go about 1 mile on electric at slow speeds. I have logged 45 MPG on a 12 mile run on back roads. I average 33 MPG.

Also, never, NEVER STORE THIS CAR.  Bought in '09 new from dealer; had all maintenance done by local Ford Dealer (Merc out of business) 80k miles. In 2016 followed book instructions stored for 6 months came back NO start towed to FD ""lost programing"" cost $250; ok, not so bad.  In 2017, again gone for 6 months, checked with FD what to do.  They told me to buy a trickle charger with shut off @ full; this will prevent ""lost programing"".  Got back NO start; again towed to dealer; after a weeks worth of diagnostics; this time the FHV battery wont start the car.  Now get this, they don't have a 300+ volt charger and have to RENT IT from Ford:  Est $1,650! and if it won't hold a charge $14,000 for a new battery.  Checked with Ford (Detroit) told you CAN'T STORE  this car; it has to be driven to continually recharge the FHV (sure enough on page 42 of the owners manual there's three comments that address this, in fact the Ford ""Electric Car"" guy said they tell people if they have leave for longer than 30 days you should have a ""friend"" drive it around once a week for 20 or 30 minutes)  So off to another dealer for a ""second opinion"" had it towed to another FD quoted $240 to charge it up.  Then they called said they had to rent the charger from Ford for $650 & they'll need 2 tech hours; well OK this took 3 weeks for the charger to arrive; whoops, the  battery can't be charged enough to start the car & they think the transmission may need to be replaced:  Cost new HV Battery cost $5k & if needed a new transmission $10K obviously more than the value of the car and OH the 8 year 100k warranty expired 6 months ago.  So, I have a beautiful '09 Mercury Mariner otherwise in top condition, now a very large paperweight.  If only I would have had one of my kids or neighbor just drive the car once a week for 20 minutes.  Conclusion:  the Ford Hybrids are poorly designed & costly to repair.",1

By 96k the car was dead and I'm far from an aggressive driver nor do I abuse my vehicles. A/C went at 78k as did the Idle Air Valve, timing belt went at 83k, tie rods went at 94k etc!  This was with me ensuring regular maintenance, oil/lube, tire rotations the whole lot. In the end what killed this car and my wallet along the way was build quality and bad engineering. The final nail in the coffin for this car was when it dropped a valve seat which apparently they like to do around 100k due to ""an engineering defect"".

I wanted to share my feelings, this has got to be the BEST VEHICLE that I ever purchased.  I am very proactive on maintaining my vehicle, I have changed the oil every 5k miles along with tire rotations, knock on wood that I have not really had anything major happen since buying it other than replacing the tires, front brakes, back brakes only 1X, the serpentine belt 1x, plugs 2x, the battery 1x, the windshield from a stone crack, the alternator 1x, wiper blades many times and the AC Compressor just died, no biggie ..... Also back in 2010 I got rear ended and I thought the insurance company would have considered it a total loss, they ended up paying more for repairs that the value of the vehicle, crazy !  My paint is smooth as glass and the interior is pretty much mint, I really keep it detailed all the time !  Mercury did a great job on the build on this vehicle, I would purchase another if they continued selling them, but the product line got the axe.  The engine runs awesome and the transmission is perfect !  Yes, I had the fluid drained from the tranny 2x, no pressure flush, just a drain and fill, same with radiator, no pressure flush, just drain and fill, fluids always look clean.

I had only one problem while it was still under warranty and it was the lift gate door window lock. Around the 148K mark, I had ongoing repairs list. I had the ignition coils on two cylinders go and plus the computer go bad which caused the short. This was two years ago and cost me about 2K. Along the way till now I had exhaust leak, power steering pump replacement, two ball joints and three battery replacements. This weekend, the #1 cylinder was miss-firing and took it to the mechanic for repairs. He found a low pressure reading on the cylinder head and replaced the spark-plugs. He also cleaned the valve heads and it regained compression in the cylinder. Two days later, I get the code for a bad ignition coil on number 4 and a bad computer again.

After spending time behind the wheel myself, I must admit the engine is not powerful enough for that size/weight vehicle.

We average 15-20 MPG around town, 20-25 MPG on the open road - much worse than the Escape [which allowed us to switch from 4WD to front drive to save gas].  Also the Mariner is noticeably heavier and slower than the Escape with the same engine and transmission.  Wish we had opted for the Hybrid!

She's never, ever let us down. Beyond basic maintenance (brakes, oil changes, tires) we haven't had to do anything. The gas mileage is fantastic considering it's an AWD V6 as well. Average 22.3 with ~24 on the highway and 18 in town. In the snow it's great, the AWD works as it should, and I've never felt like I'm losing control. If we need to haul anything we can put the back seats down and have acres of space. As for comfort, it's delightful. The leather heated seats keep you warm in the winter and are easy to clean and maintain, the A/C always blows cold, and the power windows and moonroof are great features.

But be warned, in 2008 they changed a design that sends the transmission fluid through the A/C condenser.  Why? Not really sure, but if you think you are leaking oil, it may be transmission fluid and it may be coming from the condenser.  This leak will drain your transmission in about 3 days.  Call Ford, they will have this $450 part in stock as they are replacing them weekly.  But, they will not admit there is a problem.  Yes, there is a TSB on this issue starting with 2008's.  Again, based on my ratings, I do love this truck.  As for the loud tire noise, trust me its the original tires.  I put new tires on and now I enjoy  my hour and half drive to and from work. ",4.875

We love our sunroof and find it functional in Florida to let the heat out.  The upolstery is the best--wipes clean easily and is very comfortable----the seats are cushy and the ride smooth and solid.

I am very impressed with the options on my Premier. Leather, rear spoiler, Sirius Radio, running boards, the wood interior trim. I was (and am) traveling from Dallas to Tulsa weekly and the roads vary in quality. I found immediately that the SUV was very comfortable, and I'm averaging 22 MPG over just less than 4000 miles now.  It is surpassing my expectations in all respects. No defects, no rattles, no hassles and tight steering.  Mercury made a good one for 2008 and I heartily recommend it to anyone who likes the economy and doesn't have a need for a huge SUV.  ",5

I traded in a 2007 Saturn Aura which was rated as North American Car of the Year, in reality, it was one of the worst, just behind a 1982 American Eagle & 1978 Chrysler Labaron. The Mariner rides smooth and solid over all road types including those classed as rough.  Fit & finish are excellent.  A bit more than I wanted to spend, but I am well pleased with its initial quality and the way it drives, it is one the easiest driving vehicles that I can recall ever driving.

I do like the visibility of the SUV styling. Gas mileage..we'll see how that goes. Too early to tell but it is a SUV. My only complaint at this time is, the noise level. Chicago streets aren't the best but when you hit a bump it sounds like the whole rear end of the vehicle is going to fall out. My old Explorer wasn't even that bad on the bumps.

Went back to the dealer who stated they had a quite a few people commenting on the weak mileage.  They stated it was because most gas had 1-10 percent ethanol added.  Did not believe it as the SUV I traded in averaged 29-30 mpg for the same trip. It had the same HP engine and weighed only 100 lbs less.  Of course there is a disclaimer on the window sticker stating the mileage may vary between 23- 33mpg.  Guess I'm stuck.  ,4.5

I fully expected to by a CRV, RAV4, or Saturn Vue, only reluctantly  looked at Ford/Mercury. Ended up with the Mariner because it was the best combination of styling, comfort, power, and features. The Saturn was my favorite styling but the seating was not comfortable - just too much smaller than the competition. The CRV had bland styling and no bluetooth or any cool features. The RAV4 had roomiest seating but cheap looking interior and the spare on the door was a minus, plus bluetooth only on fully loaded vehicles.

The gas mileage is fine and was the reason I downsized from an Explorer. But the noise level inside this car is awful. My 10 year old Explorer was a quieter ride than this vehicle. The roads I tested it on near the dealership must have been very smooth.  I will never buy another car without going over all types of roads, including bad ones. Please turn every knob to maximum level before buying. Turning heat/AC to anything above the lowest level is very noisy. The dealership says it is normal tire noise when I complain about the noise inside the vehicle. The radio has to be turned up loud to hear over the outside noise.  ",2.125

I wanted an SUV for the hauling capability, yet didn't want the mileage penalty. The 4 cylinder is quite peppy, and provides decent mileage (23-24 MPG overall in the break-in period). I can't wait to see what it finally settle into. Styling is by far the nicest of all of the SUV's on the road.  Interior is well laid out, and has plenty of room for tall individuals.  The only criticism is that the seats are a bit narrow, but at least they are forgiving and provide decent comfort.  For a base convenience, this vehicle comes well equipped.  The base CD system is very nice.  I'd recommend a test drive, you will be pleasantly surprised.",4.5

Mercury has done a VERY impressive job of tailoring the Escape platform to the tastes of those who want some style to go along with their versatility.  The interior is the best of any vehicle I have ever owned. The exterior is sharp, lots of understated elegance.  The ride is smooth and quiet, and the handling is reassuring.  It is fun to drive.  The only issues I have had with the car is that the heaters on the front seats frequently come on without being turned on, and that the offical EPA mileage estimates have so far proved unattainable.

It is a nice looking car and it drives nice, but i have had problems with it. Although it drives well, it likes to lock up and cut off on me; this is due to the full pump problems (just like the ones in its sister car the ford contour) that can't be pin-pointed. I have also had to replace the brakes shortly after purchasing it. Recently, it has been eating gas, i've put about 1000 in repairs in it in the last year, and my transmission just died on me a few days ago! Im not happy with this car and i have only had it 2 years.

V6 acceleration, handling, ABS-less 4 disc braking, everything is there exept reliability. I didn't had problem with the man. transmission, power steering and radiator. Everything else broke; I even lost a wheel!(broken studs.) Biggest repetitive problems came from the front suspension and bearings. The instrument cluster PCB failed intermittently and the infamous plastic impeller of the water pump.

1690, on 03/19/08 16:23 PM (PDT),hottdrummer ,1999 Mercury Mystique Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,IDK, I've had my Mercury Mystique for about 2 months now and I really really enjoy it. It's sporty but not too sporty. The power it has amazing (V6) and it is one great car. The only thing I don't like is the transmission slips. I got power but sometimes I can't use it all but to the rough idles and slips. I have a great system in the car and it really bangs. My friends love the car and I love it just as much.,4.625

Some repairs that were Mystique specific:  timing- belt went at 108,000...supposed to last to 120,000, transmission rebuilt at 5 yrs due to the way the drive shaft kit (?) was made, complete brake system overhaul at 6 years, oxygen sensor issues ($600) at 8 years..the list goes on.  The dash warping is ridiculous.  can barely see over it now and the defroster only works if it's on full blast for 20 minutes.

1693, on 11/21/07 06:12 AM (PST),Woody ,1999 Mercury Mystique Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,Long time owner," Having owned this V6, 5-speed, leather seated, sunroof equipped car for over 8 years, I've developed a few opinions on it. The engine was designed by a joint effort of Porsche and Cosworth, and is impressive to behold.  Normal mileage is  22 city / 28 highway, although if driven very carefully will increase to 24/32.  My previous car was an Acura Integra, and this Mystique would run rings around it.  European feel, 4 cams, 4 disc brakes, and supportive seats make for a fun driving experience.  Roughly 3000 rpm at 65 mph seems a bit high, although the engine is very smooth and quiet.  This is a European designed car, built in Kansas City.      ",4.25

The person I purchased this from was the original owner and indicated the car got 35 MPG and was maintenance free other than a brake job.  It is a 4 cyl, with 5 speed manual gearbox. My 1st MPG ck indicated 35.5 which was 80% hwy, 20% city driving. The car runs and drives great. Extremely strong and smooth for a 4 cyl.  The torque feels more like a big six which makes for easy driving. Handles like a sports car although it has more torque steer than other front wheel drives I've driven.  The top of the dash was loose but some household glue has worked holding it in place.  I highly recommend this as a used car buy. ",4.375

At the time it was the only American made sedan I could find with a manual transmission, ABS and a V-6.  I pretty much got every option; the power seat, sunroof, traction control and split folding leather seats have definitely come in handy. I always enjoy driving it, although it does have some limitations: particularly the drink holders and road noise at highway speeds. Very little has gone wrong that wasn't fixed under warranty (knock on wood) so I've been quite pleased with that.

Second Villager Estate (leather seats). Bought brand new off the showroom floor. Not cheap in 2002 dollars, but WORTH it.No kids, just need the cargo space for my work stuff. Cargo space is pretty versatile. The third row bench seat has been set to vertical pretty much since I got the vehicle. Second row seats are easy to set to vertical or click out / lift out and return as required.Only 44,000 miles. Only serious problem has been body corrosion and faded paint from the lawn sprinklers at my outdoor condo parking. Body took a sand-blast beating in Wilma hurricane; smashed side windows and windshield replaced. The van just laughed that off.Handling and driving are the best. Engine is perfect - and powerful. Great acceleration. Good visuals on all sides. I can weave through heavy city traffic more nimbly than a Ferrari. I chuckle to myself because nobody expects a car looking like this to perform like that!On long distance driving I set the cruise to 70 mph (freeway legal), crank up the CDs and enjoy the comfort. If required, the van can accelerate quickly to 85-90, no problem to get out of a tricky situation. Easy to park in a crowded lot or garage. Only repairs in 14 years: brake joints, something minor with the steering.  To be honest, I have not taken the best care of the engine in terms of oil changes and other regular maintenance, especially in our humid coastal climate.

This is my 7th year of owning it and had a previous 1995 model Villager. I love the performance and semi sporty handling, better than the other minivans I test drove. The interior is well designed, except that it has so much plastic used. The dashboard rattles when it idles, so I took it too the dealership, but of coarse they said they couldn't hear it. Had an exhaust leak at about 90k, the mechanic couldn't order the right part because they quit making it, so he had to weld the old one. It still whines a little when you accelerate, nothing big, though. Also, I can feel engine vibrations through the steering wheel. But, other than that, it's a great mini-van.",4.375

Always tends to give plenty of warning before anything breaks or gives out so you can take it in and have it fixed before you are stuck. Could use more leg room for driver. A little better acceleration ability would be very nice, however it does seem to hold its own. Very nice manuverability and drives well in any weather. It is hard to do any of the work on your own under the hood as it is all compact and squashed together making it very difficult to do it yourself.

We took this van to Yellowstone last summer, and it performed flawlessly.  I did order a used digital radio/player from a salvage yard and had it installed when the lights faded and went out on the old one.

Had thesticky throttle problem, fixed it myselfwith some carb cleaner on the throttlebody (less than $5 and 10 minutes). Replaced struts and CV boot at 112k. Only $750 in repairs in 65k miles, can'tcomplain about that, includes brakes,battery, tail lt, shocks and struts. Probably run another 30-40 before othernormal repairs are needed, at least Ihope!  It never leaks oil or anything. Don't use a cheap battery, and Irecommend the midgrade tires (not thecheapies) for a smoother ride.  Greatcar and much better price than Honda/Toyota.",4.875

I just needed something roomy and comfortable for me, my husband and our two dogs but I wanted something that got decent gas mileage. There are some issues with the front end as it says they do, the previous owner did have the tie rod done and we had to have the CV joint done and there are issues with the speedometer display just going blank like it says they do, we are going to look into getting that replaced but it is still working.

Only had to replace wear and tear items here and there. Still drives smoothly and with power.  This one American/Japanese venture did pay off only to be stopped few models later as a no money maker.  No wonder the company stopped making it.  They were losing money on it on parts. Would love for  the manufacture to start building them again. But that would never happen.

They also design engines that go in formula one cars. Pretty respectable.  -The Cougar introduced ford's new Edge design. Notable among this is that the cougar is a blend between American and European design. The hatchback styling is European, the high displacement high torque engine is american muscle. It was designed to be at home on the twisty nuburing.  -Ford discontinued it because the Cougar dances around the Mustang. Ford wanted to sell Mustangs because they're in keeping with the all american Ford image. They also sold them for $20K more, the same thing was done to the Thunderbird. Twice.",4.25

Seats are comfortable and head and shoulder room are more than adequate for me (6 feet tall, 210 lbs.)

It could beat a V6 mustang anyway (yea woo-hoo). Since then I've spent maybe $1500 on performance parts off ebay and installing them myself and it's made a world of difference. The Dual Exhaust with a couple of flowmasters and the cold air intake (about $500 for both) really add a lot of power, and a decent suspension that went for about $450 made this thing handle turns easily at 45+ mph (although it doesn't balance well).

After fixing all the problems though it's pretty reliable. I can also say it drives great and has great gas mileage for a on-the-go-teen. ",4

I have had problems since day 1, everything from the engine, transmission, sun roof, tires, brakes, catalytic converter, wheel bearings, you name it its needed fixing. I love driving it though. You can beat 90% of the people on the road and it handles like a dream. But dont get used to it. Each year I've put at least $700 into repairs and just this month I was told I have $1200 in repairs. I am currently shopping for a new car. I loved my Cougar and if you dont mind paying for repairs then 99 Cougar is the car for you. But your check engine light will forever be on!",2

The service engine light was on when I got it and after just a few hundred miles it the light started blinking and the car started acting like it was going to fall apart. Once the light stopped blinking, the car started driving right. I am going to get the car checked soon, but overall I love the car and it stills looks brand new and like some of the others say it gets looks and that is what I like.  I have a Firebird and Xterra, but would rather drive the Cougar now.  ",4.375

No you will be winning any drag races with the Cougar, but it can throw you can in your seat when in the mid RPM-band. Plenty of leg from for driver, I am 6-2 and I could not drive if seat was all the way back. Backseats are buckets, neat to sit in, hard to get out of, and hatchback provide low headroom, I still love them. Have gotten over 35 MPG on the highway. Not taxing around city either, probably 27 or 28 with built in MPG calc. Have replaced fuel pump, a few fuses, trunk actuators. Great sound, no blown speakers. No broken head or tail lights after 67000. ",4.375

I haven't had many problems with it, other than my heater core on it is broken and it sometimes leaks transmission fluid. But other than that I love this car. The engine is so much fun to listen to. It's pretty fast for a 2.5 V6. Everything works fine in the car. It has a pretty decent sound system, but I'm looking to put some 12's in it. The only problem is that I drive long distances sometimes and I worry about my engine over-heating with my transmission fluid leaking, but other than that I'm very happy with the performance and stability of this car. And I'm glad it's what I got for my first car.",4.5

Some like my 1970 XR-7 with the 4V 335hp V8 had great power but none as nimble as my 1999. I ordered it with the sports package and had some problems getting it to my location in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico since Mercury Hq was not allowing the vehicle to be exported. So my Cougar became the first new edge one to arrive in San Juan. Good Things: Performance when you turn AC off, handling in curvy mountain or country roads, looks from observers and engine sound with free flow mufflers. Many people ask you about it so patience with people who want to buy your car. Bad things: Original tires (which where great) have gone out of production.",4.625

I have put thousands of miles on this car. I have popped down the back seats and hauled more than in those toys trucks that are so popular. I have dressed up and taken my girlfriends out on the town in this sporty little car. I have saved so much on my gas bills, with my mileage ranging from 29 to 31 mpg. So I ask why did they stop making this car?",5

I totally believe in the reliability of my car. I have had very few problems with it. My A/C has always worked, Headlights have never stopped. I replaced the clutch, water pump, timing belt, the usual wear and tear parts. It has been an awesome car from day one and I  don't plan on trading it any time soon. Many memories!

I bought my car new in 1998, and 2 days after I bought it it wouldn't start. This was just the beginning of my problems. The engine light keeps coming on, no matter how much I get the car repaired. The alternator has gone out 3 times, once leaving me stranded on the freeway at 2am in a storm. I am so constricted because with 86000, this car should still have life, but I can't even drive 20 minutes on the freeway without something happening. Oh yeah, and did I mention the sunroof?

2157, on 03/21/08 19:16 PM (PDT),My2cougars ,1999 Mercury Cougar Hatchback V6 2dr Coupe,I have two Cougars!," I love to drive these cars! They can be expensive to fix and a little hard to see out of. The back seat is not a bench, so if you need room in the back, this car is not for you. You can only fit two people in the back, and it doesn't get much leg room. Both of my cup holders are broken, so I have to use the one in the back. There is a lot of trunk space, and the car has pretty good pick up too. But it makes wide turns, forget trying to make a sharp turn, it won't happen. I like the factory rims mine have on them, and I have driven them both to 150,000 miles now. They are an expensive car to fix though, the parts can be kinda hard to find and a little pricey.  ",3.625

I just traded it off 3 days ago with over 128,000 miles on it.  I loved that car.  Even with that many miles the engine and the transmission are still going strong.  The Cougar is built solid and reliable.  I traded it because my family is expanding and it is not practical with 2 car seats, but I will miss it terribly.",4.875

I now have 139,000 on it and have never had a problem. It has plenty of power except for a dull spot from 3-4000 rpms, then at 4000 she gets up and goes...its the 4 speed auto and it will do 115 in third gear at 6000 rpms...which from a 175 horse v6, is pretty impressive. Another thing is the gas mileage. I get 33mpg on a trip if I drive reasonably. Put your foot in the gas and it drops to about 24.",4.875
2160, on 01/12/08 12:31 PM (PST),cougarhater ,1999 Mercury Cougar Hatchback V6 2dr Coupe,What a lemon," Bought this car my freshman year of college after my brother totaled my beloved 1991 Lexus ES250.  Needed a car to go to and from work and make the 400 mile trek home once a month. This car has great looks, and a banging stereo.  The problem is, I have put almost the $6500 I paid for it in repairs to this car.  Beware the sunroof, parts alone to fix are $1600 :-0 Also performance wise, there seems to be a gap in the middle gears, it's great off the line but struggles to get up to freeway speeds on an onramp.   The A/C unit doesn't cool very well, and seriously hampers the engines power at freeway speeds.  Beware repair costs for this unreliable vehicle.  ",2.625

Not very many aftermarket parts available but I am doing what I can to make it a part of who I am. The 4 cylinder has next to nothing for performance upgrades. I don't have a v6, so it is a struggle to add performance. I trust the reliability to drive it anywhere. I had it for about two weeks and took a 2500 mile road trip when it had 167,000 miles on.",4.375

The transmission went out, the moonroof has never worked, the steering column only moves about an inch or so, it is uncomfortable, and does not drive smoothly at all. At this point I have put more money into this car just trying to keep it running than I paid for it. I am looking to get rid of it but the trade in value is practically nothing.

I wish I stayed practical. The alternator has been replaced 4 times. The cup holder tips. The tires wear out easily. The engine light is constantly on for a number of reasons. Ford should pay for these recalls. The stereo buzzes and short circuits, but does come back on if you hit a bump in the road just right. The car is very uncomfortable and the ride is awful.

I am a short female and if I adjust the seat so I am comfortably ready to drive I end up about an inch from the visor! Also for me there is a huge blind spot behind the rear seats, which are so uncomfortable only my dogs ride back there, at first that was fine but now I need to carry people back there and they are too tall.

The transmission comment made on your follow-up test posted 01-01-1999 hit it on the head about the car missing a low speed powerband and I would add a high-speed powerband when in fifth-gear for passing.

The only thing I would change on the vehicle is the rear view mirror.  It obstructs your view when coming down or going up a ramp and you are looking ahead.

The design is great, the interior confortable.  The storage with this hatch is amazing, just last week I took home a 7 foot long storage unit, and had the hatch shut.  The car is a Ford so it does suffer from lots of creeks and rattles, though reliablilty has so far been good.  Power is supprizingly sporty despite the slow 0-60 time.  I think its very fun to drive, main complaints being a lousy auto tranny and a large amount of body roll with spirited cornering.  I highly suggest this car to those who are looking.",4.375

2196, on 12/29/16 10:08 AM (PST),Jackson Burfitt ,2000 Mercury Cougar Hatchback V6 2dr Coupe,LENGTHY BUT INFORMATIVE," I have had this car for 2 years as of now it has 102,911 miles on it when I first got the car it had about 60,000 miles on it. So I've driven the hell out of this car, 2 months after I got the car I had to change the alternator a couple times in a row no biggie my mechanic has a 1 year warranty, so I only had to pay for one. I've had the same alternator for 2 years no problems what usually happens is that the wiring or the regulator goes out. As for ""unsporty"" acceleration blame that on the stock air box/filter and the CD4E transmission (if you have auto the manual is way better if you know your optimal shift points.) I have put a K&N cold air intake performance spark plugs/wires and reflashed my PCM. And I'm still not done with her yet and she already pulls 10 times better than when she was stock (maybe a hyperbole ;) a little.) The body is still stock and I always get compliments people think it's a Jaguar sometimes. The car handles fantastic because of it's wide wheel base and touring multi link independent suspension agile like the cat it's named after. Interior looks a bit cheap but there are ways to fix that. Steering is a bit heavier than other cars but it's because of the Euro steering styling which I'd prefer over any other because I can ""feel the road"" so to speak, and since it is FWD you will feel torque steer (better around turns.) I've had a lot of close calls with accidents because of idiots on the road. It is definitely a car that you can drive and have fun as long as you take care of and it will take care of you!!",5

As soon as I got the car I had to replace the alternator. Then after 2 months of driving it the car starts to jerk every time I drive it so I replace the fuel pump.

My Engines motor mount is bad, which causes my car to buck leaving me wonder if it will start for me. Hot weather it is TERRIBLE in, after it gets to about 80+ degrees it wont start. I have never had a problem with the cold though it has been negatives many times. It's fuel injector is going out, transmission is bad, and the RPMs get ridiculous.

This car is fun to drive, sporty, fast, yet tons of cargo space if you need it (fold-down hatchback).  I average 24 mpg city/30 highway, which is better than many new cars.  I've been trying to convince myself to trade it for a new car, but I just can't find one that matches up (considering it'll mean a car payment again + having to cross my fingers I get another good car).

The interior & exterior lights would flicker horribly. At night, I could barely see. & eventually, it got to the point where I wouldn't even drive the car at night. I would feel the car begin to sputter & shake whenever I drove uphill. I tried to help these problems but after 4 alternators, a complete rewiring, new struts & a new rear axle: I traded it in! It was so disheartening to think that I had such a hot car but I didn't feel safe in it. I hated driving it so much that in the 4 years I had the car, I only put 20,000 miles on it.

Almost everything snaps together!  You know what holds the bumper on? Plastic pins. Most everything is plastic, especially the dash. And oh, what a noisy, squeaky dash it is, too. Drives me crazy.

I have also ""run out of gas"" - completely stalled - when going up hill with 1/4 tank of gas!  Had my car towed to the shop just to have it start and run just fine, the second time I topped it up with a jerry can and it was fine. Not yet replaced a fuel pump but it's not running well and I've been told that or dirt in the fuel tank, we'll see.",4.5

So far nothing major has gone wrong with it though (crossed fingers!)  ,4.5

I can, however, tell I am in need of an alternator soon! Thank God my dad was a mechanic and I learned a lot from him. But overall, I really love this car. It is jet black, leather interior, awesome sounds stereo (CD Player Equipped), Sporty, I just love it. I did get it used, but as with any vehicle, no matter make, model, year, new or used, you are bound to have problems.

Currently have 340,000kms on the car now, and plan to keep it until I have to dig a hole and bury it. All I can say is ""take it for what it is."" It a nice inexpensive sports car that looks good.

My major problem with the car is the fuel system. Troubles started in 2003. I started running out of gas even though the gauge said there was gas in the tank. Now (2007) I can't let the car go below a 1/2 tank without worrying that I may run out of gas. I just replaced the alternator. The cupholder is dangerous.

It started with a bad alternator, one month and three alternators later, we traded the car in at a significant loss. No one could fix it, not even experts in automotive electrical systems.

I have taken good care of this car only those Ford parts have been used with them installing the parts.  I was upside down in payments after the first 3 yrs so I couldn't trade it in.

Major issue is the engine build.  Your engine light goes on for unknown reasons and after fixed comes right back on.  I've replaces the alternator once and now have had trouble with the starter and the fly-wheel.  So my engine sometimes doesn't start.  Labor on these cars is outragious due to the unaccessability to fix what should be simple things.  No other major problems accept the trunk won't unlatch with just pushing the button in your car - you have to use the keyless entry and be sure you double click that button withing 6 inches.  ",3.25

I fell in love with the way the carhandled and rode not to mention thatclassy yet sporty look. It has been thebest car I ever owned.

'16 I drove over 2 hrs. to dealer in Teterboro, NJ w/a retired Ford/Mercury mechanic who did inspection of my SUV Sedan inside, out & under. It had just over 72,000 miles on it. Dealer ended up selling to me for $5,500 because the driver's seat heater did not function. I really can live w/o a heated seat.  I really liked the looks of this black beauty, but what really sold me was it's SUV sitting height, storage sf and above all--ADJUSTABLE PEDALS!  My height is just under 5'.  I have been driving 58 years w/no accidents & no tickets so I know a thing or two about driving and cars! WHY DON'T ALL VEHICLE MAKES COME WITH ADJUSTABLE PEDALS especially with so many of our more recent immigrants also being vertically challenged? My next car WILL have those pedals! Only problem I have had is that last Nov. it turned over nicely but would not start. Had it towed to local Ford Dealer. Turned out it was not the fuel pump but the Power Control Module which it turned out was still covered on this beauty! If Ford brings back this car or makes any with a reasonable size such as the doomed Fusion, when I need another vehicle, I would buy it for  the Adjustable pedals. I suppose most car makers' engineers are closer to 6' or they would get on it. WAKE UP CAR DESIGNERS!!!!!!",5

My first and probably last experience with the Ford brand.BTW, my car has not even reached 100,000 miles.Update7-9-16:  On top of losing a couple of the cars best features, this winter my heated seats stopped working and now my a/c needs repair.  I also have a groaning noise in the front end that I have not even begun to investigate.

It's a deceptively powerful car that accelerates and handles like a dream. Could use a little more power, though. It's roomy, which is great for my lankier build.  Tons of trunk/passenger space.  It's mechanically sound and has a great factory sound system.  The fuel economy is right around 20/28 for me, which is very good for a huge V6 vehicle.  Overall, this car is a sleeper hit.

The car is good on longer trips.The exterior mirrors are good in day driving, but I seem to have my vision on the left blocked and a glare. My wife likes the high drive visibility.

While people have complained about the acceleration I think it is adequate however the CVT gives you the impression the car is not accelerating.  Interior is very comfortable for a 6' driver.

My main complaint is the area where you would rest your left foot is awkward as the wheel well comes in at that area and makes long drives very uncomfortable due to the restricted area for your left foot. My second complaint is the seats should be wider & the console narrower. The width of the seats is very restrictive. The seats could be padded a bit better as well. The CVT transmission is great & smooth, the engine lacks acceleration but is ok under normal driving. My Montego averages about 20-21 MPG which is lower than the specs state but still good. I'm not sure of the aluminum block for long life.Radio is real cheep sounding. ",2.75

As much as the previous owner babied the car, I was surprised that he had never serviced the CV transmission. After several months and a few thousand miles, I became concerned when the check engine light started coming on during long trips. I took the car to a Ford dealer and got the transmission serviced. They assured me there was no problem with the transmission. My mechanic replaced the oxygen sensor which made no difference. A second trip to another Ford dealer revealed no CVT problems, but a fuel pump that needed replacing. Ever since getting that problem fixed, the car has run like a dream. I've had many people ride with me and comment on what a nice car I have. They can't believe it's eight years old with more than 120,000 miles on it. Living in northeastern North Dakota, I really appreciate the AWD performance on snow and ice. The big, wide Michellen tires are great. The heated leather seats, excellent heating and cooling system, great all-round visibility, huge side mirrors, confident steering, ride stability, fog lights, and air bags all around give me confidence on the road during adverse driving conditions. The car provides a great, comfortable driving experience. The interior is very roomy and the trunk is huge. The interior and exterior are by no means flashy, but far from homely. The car could use a bit more horsepower, but the lack of power hasn't been a problem in the flatland where I normally drive. The audiophile sound system isn't as good as the one in my Fusion. I do wish they'd included an MP3 port on the dash. The car can become a bit of a gas hog driving into a stiff headwind. Otherwise, it's close to the mileage on the sticker.",5

The V-6 is a bit underpowered however. If it were 250-260 horses vs the 205 with the CVT tranny it would be perfect. (Nissan did this with the Murano- why can't you Ford?)

I will talk about all good and bad stuff about the car, but first let me talk about good stuff and everything I'm mentioning comes from my personal experience with this car. I love the huge trunk size you can loaded with many many stuff, The car is a full size sedan which is very rare to find a sedan with the same size as this car now, a 6.1 guy can comfortably sit in any seat, for a 2005 car the interior looks nice and so classic,wish if they had auxiliary jack but it's missing it, Xenon lights and fog lights, visibility in this car is excellent and this is so critical, the tires are big enough to give you a good traction and ride quality of this car is something you will love, back up parking sensors are very helpful and one of my favorite features in this car, even I bought this car 9 years old with 160K miles but it has been a trouble free car as of today the only thing I ever changed is oil and I had to change one of the oxygen sensors which is not a big deal, the car takes me from 0-60 mph in 7 seconds. Now let me talk about the bad stuff, Brakes! yes brakes in this car are not as good as they should be in and they are really not good even though I changed the brakes they are still not good, the rear doors collects water if you wonder how! when it rains the water goes down inside the rear door and as I was told this is the way the car was designed, so when you drive in winter after rain you can hear the water when you stop the car or turn.",5

It now has 162,000 and I took it to a shop to go through it front to back, to let me know their thoughts on if I should keep it or sell it.  I like the car SO much, I am going to spend about $3,000 on it to make it ""new"" again.  I have searched and searched for a car that I would like equally well, both new and used, and I can't find it.My wife's 2013 Ford Edge has all the new techno gadgets that I don't have, and I wish I did have, but I can add that after market.  The car is such a good car.  I take it to Ford for every service at 5,000 miles, change the transmission oil at 50,000, and what a car!  I can't think of any other car that I have looked at and researched that I am more willing to spend money on right now than the car I have.  And I have the money and or credit to buy any car I want.  Just so you know, I don't want a 7 Series BMW, I can't buy that, but I can buy a nice car.  I like this car so much, I have looked at 2009's, both Ford and Mercury, to see if I could find the right one with low miles so I could stay with basically the same car, and I can't.

Dont believe all the hype about this car. There is a reason why these cars did not sell well when new. You will see many of them with low miles for the year. Think twice before you buy. I am an actual owner for 4 years and just traded out of it yesterday. Pluses: Roomy comfortable ride. The trunk is huge and you can easily haul 3 adults in the rear of the car. The ride itself is very acceptable for a big American car.safety ratings are 5 star for the yearexcellent handling for a large carNegatives:Gas millage: Dont believe what you are told. Real world numbers are more like 17 in the city 25 on the highway. I did a 300 mile trip, all highway.. all at posted speeds of 65 to 70mph and got between 23-to 25 on the highway. Combined we were lucky to get 19mpg. Brakes: They just plain suck. Replaced the rear brakes (rotors, pads) twice on this car in 30K! Yes twice both times pads were down to the rivets. Yes the correct ""modified"" pads were used from ford the first time (lasted 14k) and the second time Raybestos pads were used. Both sets ceramic material. Sorry but that was unacceptable.Door seals: Rear doors collect water on the bottom of them due to poor design. The door is designed to let the water go through the window seal and out the bottom end of the door. The problem with this is when the door seal blocks the drain hole, water collects in the door. You dont know until you hear it as you open and close the door. This causes the door to rust from the inside out. If you see rust bubbles run. Also the seal, by the seat tends to come off the metal. The only fix is to get a new one at a higher cost. Air conditioning does not work properly. This is a common problem on the montego/five hundred/freestyle. There is a problem with the compressor that is used on these cars where when you idle you get warm air. Not fun in 90 degree humid weather. In there defense, when you run the engine above 1500 rpm the car blows out ice cold. Only fix so far from ford is a new compressor at the cost of 500 dollars. Engine stalling/stumbling when starting. Another common problem... was told to clean maf sensor and throttle body. 6 months later same issue. The engine itself is good and powerful once it is running right. Got really tired of that issue.Transmission clunks and hunts sometimes for gears.Cv axles at 56k.You may think I am being critical on this car... well yes I am. This is why foreign offerings are doing so well here.",3

The interior and exterior are durable, I'm accident prone and it stands up against me. The trunk is soo big I never worry about having enough room in it or not. It drives extremly smooth down the road and around curves, it loves the highway and get up to 33mpg, about 21-23 in town. Long car rides are what this is made for, being comfortable in it hour after hour. I love that it tells me when the oil life is low and how many miles I have until E.

At midday (high sun angle), the glare on the speedo is so bad you can't read it. Poor design foresight throughout. The information display is fairly useless and very confusing when trying to reset oil change interval. Dash board surface is bubbling. Light dash color glares horribly.

It handles just fine and has plenty enough power for my needs, although it is a bit sporty and some buyers might feel as though the car should fly for the way it looks.

The height of the seats make getting in and out of the car extremely easy.  We are both tall, so the more than ample length seats are a plus.  Like all Ford products, the car corners fantastically.

Considering the weight of the Marauder performance is excellent. Handling is predictable, and can be pushed. Tail slide in hard cornering is likely in hard cornering or slick conditions, but the long wheel base and responsive steering allows a driver to push through it. On the entertaining side, when cruising on or slightly above the legally posted speed limit on the interstate, lines of brake lights will pop up and hearts will skip a beat as police cruiser clone pops out of traffic.

So far, the only problem I had with the car was a dying car battery. In stock form, the car is slow to get up to speed and I don't care much for the stock 3.55s.  Ford could of done much more with this car. I've done a SCT xcal tune, coutersy of alternative automotive, to the car and switched the rear gears out to 4.10s and it is much faster.

When you need to get the family to church on Sunday, it has ample room for five adults.  During the week, when you are driving alone for work or pleasure, it has the same high performance the SS had.

2581, on 01/27/16 10:55 AM (PST),Rob Bost ,2002 Mercury Sable Sedan LS Premium 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 4A),ABSOLUTELY One of the Worst Money Pits EVER!," We bought this car used with 40,000 miles on it and drove it (sometimes) for nine years. I kept it simply because I am obviously poor. When I was lucky enough to trade the POS for a Civic (Yay!), I had barely managed put 148,000 miles on it. I drive nightly through five counties to work, about 62 miles or 1.25 hrs. one way. It left me walking three times in that period. Once was a broken throttle cable in the middle of a hot summer day. The next time was an electrical problem killing the lights in the middle of the night. The third and by far the worst was a failure of the computer that kills the ABS brake system. Every single seasonal weather change causes the ECM to send error signals all over the place. One of them will kill the ABS system. I put nearly a thousand dollars in the brake system over the years. This car is the only vehicle I've had in nearly 37 years that was literally dangerous to own. The plastic headlight lenses are made of cheap non-UV protected materials. They must be polished regularly to even see at night. They are $280 for one assembly if you buy new ones. If you park this car in the sun, the interior parts will eventually disintegrate. Each door panel came apart. Electrical switches failed on locks and windows. The electric mirror controls failed and fell off of the door panel, as did all the venting and A/C control knobs. The radio has the anti-friction volume control that NEVER worked. It also had a cassette drive!? Headliners break loose and fall at will. The dash and steering mechanism makes strange creaking noises from an ill fit. If there are any good points, the 3.0 V6 has plenty of power, but needs injectors constantly because of Ethanol gas. It barely got 23 mpg on the interstate. I also replaced the ignition module, and had a bad oil leak at the distributor shaft seal. When replacing a simple serpentine belt, a pulley made of cheap plastic broke and cost me another $85 to get replaced! Thankfully, the transaxle seemed ok. The seats are fully adjustable and comfortable for most adults and great if you have a couple of kids or riders. The suspension gives a smooth and quiet ride. The 16"" tires are still cheap, and that's great because the front end needs aligning every year. That's about all the good. In the end, the worst failure of all was the entire speedometer/tachometer/odometer cluster going on and off at will during cold weather. As you know, you must sign a legal liability document on the odometer mileage if you are ever lucky enough to get rid of this dose of the clap. If it goes completely out you will be stuck with nothing but a junk-valued heap that doesn't work and nobody will buy. I was so lucky to get one shiny day of sun last month. I now own two old Nissans and a 2013 Civic that are all trouble free and get great gas mileage. That's EXACTLY where my money will stay from now on.",1

But over the last year we have had in the shop 4 times for non-mechanical/non- engine failures, such as the truck hydraulics broke and it almost fell on my wife's head. Left steering linkage went bad and you could barely turn the car left while driving. The heated seat (driver's side) went out. Now currently some kind of air flow actuator motor (what directs the air flow from a/c) went bad. Not to mention the door trim molding (black rubber seal) has came loose twice and the 3 preset button of the radio is severly sticking. These are all annoying pesky things going wrong-not happy all",3.625

Only problem to occur was seat heater broke and was fixed under warranty. I'm 72 years old and have owned many cars and have driven 2-3 million miles and this car is the MOST COMFORTABLE car I've ever sat it. The higher seats make it so easy to get in and out. I've just wwore out the OEM Pirelli tires and have replaced them with new Hankook Optimo's which are like floating on air. Why would Ford stop making such a grand car? My opinion seems to be shared with 96% of those here responding. What gives? Of course the new Taurus is indeed a pretty good alternative.",5

I'm amazed and saddened that they've discontinued building it, but I guess that's the way of the world. It's not flashy, just a good quality automobile with plenty of room and so comfortable to drive.  The Sync system is very convenient and the all wheel drive and heated seats make our brutal Chicago winters bearable.  I'll keep this car as long as I can and then go back for whatever Ford/ Lincoln-Mercury offers in it's place.  This car spells Q-U-A-L-I-T-Y and reliability at an affordable price.  ",4.875

Need to use both break and gas to keep car from rolling on incline ( if in drive will roll backwards gain speed quickly, same occurs in revers if on downward incline). Ford has requested I take it to 6 different dealerships for repair. All of the dealership say they cannot duplicate the roll. I live in the mountains and this a huge problem I have nearly rolled into several cars/objects because of the rolling.

The only problem I had was leaking ATF lines. Was fixed under warranty, but the dealer kept the car for a WEEK to replace some rubber hoses! Whether the cause was a bad design or improper installation doesn't matter to me, it reflects poorly on Ford. Other than that I only have a few nit-picks. The ride IMO was stiff. It sort of bounced over bumps, didn't absorb them. The AM/FM button was too small. The seats were too hard. The transmission could be quite clunky in shifting from 1st to 2nd (esp. when cold), otherwise it was downright buttery shifting. The engine was smooth, quiet & powerful enough for me.",3.75

Only warranty service was to align one of the back doors better; if it was not for that my build quality rating would be 10.  I wanted a big and smooth car and this one has delivered.  It is a big, tall car with easy access to front and rear seating.  Performance rating of 9 takes it for what it is, a big smooth car, not a sports car.

I wanted good gas mileage without sacrificing enough power to be able to enter busy freeways or pass on a two lane highway with safety. So far we have taken it on two long trips. The ride was smooth and we made good time plus we didnt spend that much on gas. The gas gauge stays on full for an incredibly long time. My wife loves the little analog clock with the purple glow. She says it relaxes her while driving. The sound system is good. We love the style of the seats and interior.

Trunk space is huge and with both back seats folded flat we load it with banana boxes, garment bags and etc.. When we get loaded, we're heavy. Never the less at the end of the trip our information center said we averaged 29.8 MPG. Driving at interstate speeds,that's good. The ride is great, comfortable  and quiet.

I feel it was the best car for the money in my price range.  I also considered the Avalon, Fusion, Milan, and Tarus.  I've had a lot of experience with the Tarus (Sable's twin) with my job and have never had any problems with it.  One had over 135000 miles on it.

I have owned my '08 Sable for just over a year and have 41,000 miles. I've had no trouble whatsoever.  It has a much roomier interior than my Cadillac. The platform seems higher than most cars so it's easier to get into and out of and visibility is great while driving. The hands free phone through Synch is great.

I strongly suggest that if anyone wants to buy a midsize luxury car this is the one they should consider strongly. I drove a rental which was a Sable two days prior to buying mine and that's what made me decide to purchase one. I can't get over the incredible gas mileage I get on this car. It's unbelievable.

Plenty of room with very comfortable seats. It comes with the features you would expect in an American Sedan.  It has enough power to cruise smoothly and quietly down the highway. 6 speed tranny gives it extra zip when you need it. Great sightlines so it is easy to drive around town too. The Sable is easy to park. It is reasonably quiet and has a very good ride. It came off the lot with no initial quality defects which is 1st for me.

I barely test drove it, picked my color, at least got the chrome wheels, and I was off. I am so completely and totally in love with that car! It is amazing and has so many surprises; stuff my Moms Lexus doesnt even have. And it can *move* if you get on the gas pedal.

They said it was going to cost $5000 to replace (i scrapped it obviously, thats double the price of the car), because my car had a ""limited edition"" transmission.

I had a 100% chance of spending $600 for the timing belt and $300 for each tune up X 3 since I have 100,000 miles.  That is a total of $1,500 in normal maintenance that I avoided with Ford's / Mercury's 100,000 mile tune up and a timing chain that lasts the life of the vehicle - serveral hundred thousand miles.

Elderly lady let it sit most of the time and that accounts for the low mileage.  Thought this would make a good second car to drive to work.  Bad mistake.  Car has had numerous issues since the day of purchase.  Complete new brake job, including caliper, pads, and rotors.  Coil spring broke and ruptured a new tire.  Engine started leaking oil and blowing anti-freeze out recovery tank.  Found a leaking oil seal, and blown head gasket.  Transmission has a shudder when shifting either up or down.  Mechanic says it is a common problem with that make of transmission.  Heater core has to be flushed almost bi-weekly in order to have any heat in the winter time.  It seems those intelligent engineers designed a by-pass hose that allows rust and sediment to gather in the heater core and then it get stopped up and coolant will not circulate through the heater core.  To correct this issue will cost $500!  Paid $3500 for car and have now spent in excess of $2500 in repair bills.  Now have over $6000 in a car that books for $2500.   Have to go now.

With incentives, the purchase price was $16,999.  This is one of the best values anywhere.  This car is over $2,000 less than a Honda Accord (which I was getting rid of)or a Toyota Camry and has many more options than those cars. This car has leather, a power sunroof, climate control, power everything, heated mirrors and more.  The fit and finish both inside and out is good. There is plenty of room for 5 adults. The V6 gets good milage and has plenty of power.  The tranny is smooth and the ride is comfortable.  We have an '03 Mercury Mountaineer and have not had any problems with the Mercury brand.",4.625

The really big issue was when the brake lines rusted out last summer while my 19 year old son was driving.  The brakes failed and he ran into the car in front of him.  I thought the car had been well maintained, but it seems no one had checked the brake lines.  I understand rusting brake lines are a common Ford issue. ",3.25

Good drive train and suspension, rides well on all road surfaces/at all speeds.  Has a tight body but some moderate road noise.  The only issue I've had is with the rebuilt front disc brakes which is more of a parts supplier/mechanic issue than car issue.  Great handling and fun to drive car.

It can really be hard to get anything in that trunk opening and folding mirrors would be nice also.

The key is getting one with low mileage and was well maintained. The trunk space is huge, and stereo system very good.

The windshield wipers go off practically non stop without you even touching the dial.  They are especially worse whenever I use the turn signal, and they'll go off about 10 times every time I turn.  The transmission is iffy, it misses all the time, and is very jerky.  It probably needs to be fixed!  The brakes need to be serviced again, I already had them replaced once.  (I've got about 120,000 miles on it).  It's got some nice features inside.  I like the power seats, and it's got awesome AC.

It has only 70k miles on it, but it already needs major transmission work.  It slips, or neutrals out momentarily, when starting from a stop.  Ford, this is a safety issue, not just a value issue! No car should require a transmission rebuild at 70k.  Additionally, the ABS light comes on intermittently, the brake pedal groans a bit, then sinks slightly to the floor.  The dealer says his diagnostic computer can't communicate with my car's computer, so he doesn't know what's wrong or how to fix it. Makes me feel like I own a FIAT (""Fix It Again, Tony"").

Might need a tranny replacement but worth the investment since these 2 models seem to run forever. One of 3 family cars driven by one driver.Repairs and tire replacements have been what one would expect. NO major problems and Mahwah Ford has been great servicing it since Mercury dealers were killed off a few years ago.Wish they still made this model and hopefully will bring back something similar in the next few years.

It looks great inside and out, the sound system has held up well despite my playing it loud enough to shake the windows of neighboring cars. The best part is the performance, the 200 hp 3.0 still runs like a top, and sprints hard when asked.  I took a 1,600 mile road trip last summer and despite driving 90 mph I averaged 27 mpg. I'm 6'8"" and guarantee there isn't another car in the price range that is nearly as comfortable--I drove them all. ",5

It won't hold more than one person in the back seat because the wheel wells rub on the tires, and nobody is overweight! When I took it to the shop, they told me that was normal because these cars are made to ""glide""??? Why is there two seats back there then? The covers on all of the door panels have come off and keep coming off after being glued back on. Have had to replace or fix too many things to type out, that have cost me at least $4,000. Several recalls for things that I didn't have to pay for. (that's the only good thing I can say about this car) Now I think the transmission is slipping, but I'm disabled and on a fixed income and can't afford to have it checked.

Two family menbers own V6 sedans one was a Toyota Camry, the other a Sable 24V. Seeing the Sable was American made, better seating, and less bland styling, I opt'd for the Sable. Performance, handling and ride between the two cars is similiar, the Camry is slightly quicker off the line, the Sable is slightly quicker on the upper end of the tach.

A couple of minor gripes; the lack of a standard CD player is anoying. There are some blind spots with the large A and B pillars that take some getting used to.

The leather seats are nice, has a good brand name, and though not as good as some foreign cars, better than most American cars from the late 90's to early 2000's. The only problems I've endured with it so far is some suspension/wheel problems, which was an easy fix, and in the winter, when I tried to warm my car up, then leave it, it would stall a little bit.

I kept it clean, including undercarraige, and maintained the car somewhat well.  Awesome heat/AC and it was a great drive on the freeway.

I loved the two years of free oil changes that I received!  My only gripe is the brakes aren't that good, and the paint job is not up to snuff.

In terms of value for dollars spent this is the best car I've ever owned.  For the last 10 years I've felt that Ford (and GM) have tried to sell the least car for the most money.  With the Milan I feel Ford has turned a corner.  The Milan is loaded with standard features and useful optional features, very solidly built, classy inside and out.  The six-speed transmission is smooth and acceleration is powerful when I need it to be.  More than that the car is well thought out in virtually every way.  ",5

I think its better looking and so far it's been a very pleasurable experience. All city driving so far and each tank full has been better mileage, the last one went 374 miles on 16.1 gallons. It will be interesting to get a tank thru it on the highway to see how close I can get to the 29 mpg. Quiet, very roomy and comfortable even for a 6'6"" driver. The controls on the steering wheel make the radio, cruise and a/c controls a breeze, altho the temp control is on the lower right and I rest my thumb in that area when I drive--sometimes the temp gets bumped up to 80 degrees!

Absolutely no comparison.  The Milan ride, while smooth on highways, is awful on city streets.  You feel every bump and the car shakes on potholes, as if there are no shock absorbers. Urban gas mileage is about 13 mpg, much lower than the Sable.   During summer which a/c on and idling, mpg was 10.  Then there's the wide wheel base which means wide turning circle, a detriment for parking in tight spots or making U turns on city streets. You're paying more for less quality which seems minimally cheap compared to the Sable LS.    ",2.25

Milan Premier has good acceleration (not best in class, but good)Color is Satellite Silver & 2 Tone Charcoal & Tan interior. Test drove(over night) Lincoln Zephyr. Slightly better Leather/Stereo system and THX Navigation system(very nice)just don't add up to a nearly $10K increase in price. Lincoln was quieter and had a ""softer"" suspension. The Milan is definately the ""sportier"" of the 2 cars. I looked at the Ford Fusion. It was nice, but I liked the nicer touches (2 tone leather etc.)that the Milan has. I feel I made a good choice.

I've had nothing but a very excellent experience owning this car since March. Absolutely zero quality issues. It rides like silk. It handles and looks like a more expensive European sports sedan. The combonation of the 6-speed automatic and the 3.0 liter 221HP V6 provides excellent acceleration. Especially anything over 35 MPH. The interior with the comfortable two-tone leather seating and the wood-grained dash gives it a look of a higher end European model.

It blends the best of European design, Japanese ingenuity with American quality and attention to detail. Finally an American auto manufacturer shows the benefit of what multi-national auto brand ownership brings.  The ride is tight, yet smooth. The interior sounds is silent. The 6-speed auto transmission takes a little getting used to, but one you do it's great and the extra mileage you gain is very much welcome these days.  The car also looks sharp.

A tilt/telescopic steering wheel with cruise and volume control.  The gas mileage for in town is good.  The air conditioning is exceptional.  It really keeps the car nice and cool.  I really like the message center where you can get information on you oil pressure, doors closed or open, brake fluid, are just a few of the items.

It was in nearly new condition.  It has been comfortable and economical on trips. The best part about it is that it has required no repairs, only regular maintenance. It starts on the first try, even when the temp is -20F.  As a 4 cylinder, it doesn't have the acceleration of a 6, but it does very well passing on two-lane highways.  I can say honestly it might be the best car I've ever owned in terms of comfort, reliability, and economy. True, it's not a fancy or zippy car, but it's a car you can depend on. * Since I wrote that review, the moon roof jammed and wouldn't shut. After checking with the dealer and two auto body shops, I concluded that the cost of repairing/replacing it was ridiculous. So I took it apart and taped it shut. Three weeks later I traded it in on a Honda Accord Sport. However, I don't blame the car. When moon roofs go bad, they are rarely worth fixing (too expensive).

It also lacks the power to accelerate - be prepared to be passed by moms in minivans.

The ride is smooth and easy but you can ""feel the road"" for lack of better words. Not in an abrasive or annoying way, more of a sense of awareness for the road itself. It's overall a very nice car with, so far, no bullshit attached. Worth buying, but know the worth of the car before hand.Also, as a footnote: the car is quite easy and carefree to drive, which could make this a bad ""first car"" for young drivers so take that into consideration before getting this one for your 17 yr old son/daughter. Even as an experienced driver, its not hard to overshoot my speed around curves in the road. On the other hand, the car has airbags damn near everywhere inside of the car so if your gonna flip it, you'll probably be ok :D",4

However, since I purchased the car I have put 75K miles with the bulk of it being highway miles. A low level hum developed and now the dealer and my mechanic confirmed that I now need a new transmission. Ford is only willing to pay 1K of the warranty repair price which leaves me stuck paying (3K). Amazing how Ford is not willing to stand behind their products.

The leather interior is beautiful and very comfortable. The exterior design is very good looking as well. It definitely looks more expensive.

My 2010 is FWD (NOT AWD) and benefits from the extra 20 HP and the selectable transmission.  I was very happy with the previous models but the 2010 has numerous improvements and refinements - quite impressed that Ford is doing this instead of their former practice of making it cheaper (i.e., deleting content) every year.

Her biggest complaint is the turning circle, which I hope is improved in the 2010 model.  ",4.5

I don't understand the comments about power and sub-par engines. This car hums along beautifully and I get better fuel economy then the sticker states!! Half the time I can't even tell the engine is running!  To summarize - Don't spend more then you have to on a NAME - buy a great car at a great price!! ,5
3342, on 04/22/09 12:59 PM (PDT),Skeeter ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.3L 4cyl 5M),Love it!," I have had my 09 Milan for 3 months.  We have taken one long trip in it.  The rest of the time has been spent driving within 50 miles of home.  Right now I am getting 30.4 mpg with a cruising range of over 500 miles.  With employee pricing and rebates, I was able to buy this awesome vehicle for less than $20,000.  We live in the country so Sirrus radio is wonderful since we can't always pick up a good radio station.",5
3343, on 03/21/09 21:34 PM (PDT),EP1 ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (2.3L 4cyl 5A),Love the looks, The style & looks caught my attention right away my previous car was the Buick Lacross. The Milan handles better and rides tighter than the Buick and corners like its on rails but is just as quite on the inside on the highway! The looks are so much nicer than the Accord and Camry!,3.625
3344, on 03/14/09 15:50 PM (PDT),Thank's Dad ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (2.3L 4cyl 5A),Thank's Dad," I recently got moved further from home at work making my commute over an hour each way, driving an eight cylinder pick up was not very economical. I was forced into buying a car quickly with out time to research. My father had recently bought a 2008 Murcury sedan, I was amazed I was not familiar with the line of vehicles because it was such a sporty, luxurious ride. When I heard what he paid I was blown away. Needless to say I got lucky he bought that car because he did the research for me. I bought a 2009 Murcury Milan, 4 cyninder for my commute, and all the bells and whistles for the fun. I miss my truck, but unless things change alot I will be a faithfull Murcury owner in the future.",5
3345, on 03/08/09 16:12 PM (PDT),dsvetcov ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Lexus convert," I traded my Lexus es350 for a new milan.  The main reason was price.   I opted for the Merc as it addresses a more seasoned buyer (ug..age) over the ford Fusion.   Too bad LM does not heavily market this vehicle.  It is superior in many ways to the foreign competitors as well as GM.    Get the premier edition and the with Microsoft sync.  It makes driving fun, as well as a very comfortable and price savvy experience.",4.25
3346, on 03/01/09 08:09 AM (PST),Steve C ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),2009 Mercury Milan Premier," My wife and I have been looking at different make and models in this size range. We have been toyota owners for the past 30 years and let,s face it the US automakers for a while could not compete for style and reliability with the foriegn makers.Through consumer reports and Edmunds  we investigated this model and the Fusion for US models. After test driving we determined the Milan felt more tight and comfortable. Our model has the works as far as options, and everything is easy to reach within the cab.Mercury has hit a home run with this model. Perhaps the near collapse of the domestic market has spurred on this innovation and I beleive FOMOCO has turned the corner on the market.",5
3347, on 02/26/09 10:27 AM (PST),Steve ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Luxury you can afford!," Ride is wonderful, yet still tight & sporty.  Power is great with really good mileage for a V6.  Interior is classy, yet sporty with Burlwood Dash. Love SYNC, Navigation, Bluetooth Phone & Stereo all working together. Plenty of room for everyone. Best car I've owned to date. FORD Motor Company has been and always will be my CHOICE for a new car. Made 'mostly' in America, but American owned company is the only way to buy!!!!",4.875
3348, on 02/26/09 06:18 AM (PST),Flyguy313 ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (2.3L 4cyl 5A),Love this Car!," Just traded in a 2008 Accord LX, Wanted a fully loaded Fusion or Milan with Navigation. The Ford incentives with $3500 cash back was too good of a deal to pass up.The dealership was fantastic and the buying experience was a pleasure. I wanted the Milan Premier with Navigation,spoiler and rear parking assist with heated seats in Smokestone/Camel, and thats what I got. Love the Sync system and Navigation. The Navigation system was rebated off the sticker $1600 so it only cost about $200.",4.875
3349, on 02/24/09 18:58 PM (PST),GEMINILAF ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Better than the Japanese Imports," Super styling cues. I love the 17"" multi-spoke alloys. Lots of trunk space, especially when you fold flat the back and passenger front seats. Mercury has really raised the bar with quality materials. Love the Microsoft Sync, 6 disc in-dash CD changer, Sirius satellite radio, and all the bells and whistles you would pay extra for in other vehicles in its class.  ",5
3350, on 02/02/09 19:11 PM (PST),Mike7 ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Mustang to Milan," Great car, not as quick as the Mustang but has almost as much horse power as my '92 Mustang. Handles very well, build quality is great, terrific in snow. I don't get the love affair with foreign cars. I've yet to be in one that surpasses the quality of this car.",5
3351, on 01/30/09 17:18 PM (PST),srecz ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),have your airbags checked," My wife was just broad-sided by an suv traveling at 30-40 mph. The Milan's side airbags did not deploy. Fortunately,she did not suffer serious injury, but certainly could have in such a serious crash. I would suggest to anyone owning a Milan return to the dealership to have airbag system checked.",4.5

Suggest the heated seats as an option. Plays 6 cds full of mp3's, that's at least 600 or more tunes, all info shows on radio panel. The message center is all good info. Once you sync your phone you'll love the option with Microsoft Sync, all info of your phone is displayed on the radio panel, last call, phone book, play your phone MP3's etc. Excepts I-pods, USB port and more. All controls are on steering wheel. The 3.0 engine has been around for a while.",4.875

I wasn't sure I'd like a mid- size car after such a huge car, but now I know what the reviewers mean when they talk about handling.  This car handles beautifully. I've really tested the AWD this month here in Michigan, as we've gotten a lot of snow and ice, and I haven't gotten stuck yet.  My Milan rides very nicely and I love the VOGA interior: camel with black trim with camel stitching.",5
3354, on 12/28/08 06:36 AM (PST),Cristo ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.3L 4cyl 5M),Great basic sedan," Well, I turned in the lease of my 06 Lincoln Zephyr and purchased an 09 Milan Base model with auto transmission. A very good basic sedan and the 4 cyl gets great mileage. After driving a fully loaded Lincoln for 3 years it's hard to go to a base model, however, I don't do the driving I used to. The car is fine for what I need, however, the headrests are very uncomfortable! Why they changed them I'll never know! I had no problem with the ones on my Lincoln. Hopefully, I can switch them out! I've had the car for 2 weeks and I still haven't put gas in it! Great basic no frills transportation.",4
3355, on 11/18/08 20:13 PM (PST),cotto1973 ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.3L 4cyl 5M),Excellent Car," I have to admit that doubted the commercials claiming that the Milan/Fusion was preferred over the Camry and Accord. Driving is believing. You have to drive one to believe that this car is on par with the Camry and Accord. The Milan is an impressive car.  The handling is excellent.  Before the snow, I put it through some aggressive winding roads. It hugs the road gives you confidence. We received our first snows of the season here and have had no trouble on the roads. The acceleration is is good. We have about 1000 miles on the car. We average 23-24 MPG in the city. Driving more agressive, the mileage drops to about 21-22 MPG. We haven't driven any highway miles yet.    ",4.875

It has all wheel drive, which we need in our area, room for real people in the back seat, which we need, good comfort overall, a smooth ride, plenty of power, and all for a reasonable price.",5
3357, on 11/06/08 20:00 PM (PST),Ed. Oesterle ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),2009 Voga Milan," I have owned Lincolns and Mercurys for years. I was introduced to the Milan, and shown a Voga style dressed up Milan. I feel in love with just the white leather seats and all the beautiful stainless trim. This style has all the other so called best sellers put to shame. The car is black with the white leather. A head turner. The Milan is a true performer, highway driving is wonderful, the interior outstanding and comfortable and the V6 engine has a lot of get up and go. This car has already shown 24 and 25 miles per gallon and is not even broke in yet, we are a retired couple and we feel young and classy when we drive it. I'm also blown away with the sound system, sync and satellite radio. Overall the car is superior and outstanding in all aspects. ",5
3358, on 10/01/08 15:59 PM (PDT),Larry  ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),L/M is back with a high quality car," I picked up my Milan Premier (V-6 FWD) about two weeks ago and cant say enough positive things about it. The ride is very controlled and smooth with just the right amount of steering wheel tension. Turning into a parking space is controlled, easy and tight. I got 24.6 MPG on my first tank of about 65% highway travel. Both interior and exterior fit and finish is excellent. The SYNC voice command system is exceptional. All vehicles should have it to make hands free cell calling mandatory. Its just safer for everyone with your eyes on the road.  ",5
3359, on 08/05/08 21:12 PM (PDT),TT ,2009 Mercury Milan Sedan Premier 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Great Value-Great Car," Bought this car a few weeks ago. I had been shopping Honda, Hyundai, Ford, etc. This car is great looking and they did a nice job with the interior- love the contrast stitching-leather very rich looking and feels great. Sync takes some time to learn but is great once you learn how to use it. The steering is also great-heavy and accurate. This drives and looks like a much more expensive car. Sticker was 26,620 and I paid 22,900.  What a value.",4.875
