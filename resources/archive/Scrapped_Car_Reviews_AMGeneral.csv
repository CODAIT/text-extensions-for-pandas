I cant get it stuck. I love the standard 12000 pound winch. 83 mph is ""rated"" top speed but I have experienced 87. It handles great at that speed. It is a little loud though. ",5

You cannot get this thing stuck. Believe me I've tried. Top speed is rated at 83 and when you reach it you will swallow your seat cushion if you know what I mean. 0-60 in 16.9.  But thats OK cause who needs speed when you can run over anything!,5
