1, on 02/11/16 21:39 PM (PST),Gaelon Ball ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Amazing 08 Navigator," I bought my Navigator a few months ago and about a month after buying it we were in a 5 car collision  on the interstate my navigator came out of the wreck with a dented bumper that's it... IT SAVED MY FAMILY'S LIVES INCLUDING THE 8 MONTH TWINS IN THE 3RD ROW.... you could never get a better vehicle and gas mileage it pretty great considering its an SUV with a big V8.I love my navigator it's alot better than my 2000 expedition Eddie Bauer! This vehicle saved my family's lives on multiple occasions since I bought it, if you are in a position to get a Lincoln Navigator do so you will not regret it, it is a fantastic traveling and local vehicle, the best part is that you don't have to have premium fuel.... For someone who's had the LINCOLN  experience you will not regret buying...! (Update ... I have now had my 2008 Lincoln Navigator for almost 2 years now and is is the most fantastic vehicle I have ever owned I recently hit a deer a 40 mph and it only cracked the bumper and the grill which the insurance covered but I was completely shocked there wasn't ALOT more damage but that's it the brakes immediately responded it didn't slide or screach nothing it was amazing. I can go on and on at how great this car has been but to put it simply I would definitely buy another!!!)",5
2, on 11/15/15 14:16 PM (PST),Chris ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),I had this car for 10 years, This is a wonderful SUV very comfortable very comfortable and eliability is outstanding.  I would highly recommend this vehicle.,5
3, on 01/13/12 10:31 AM (PST),azt1 ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Comfortable and Roomy., I've had my Navigator for a few months now. I was leasing a 2008 GMC Yukon Denali before I decided to buy. I originally bought a 2007 Cadillac Escalade but took it back because it was too much like the Denali. The Escalade does handle better and has more power than the Nav but I do like the Navs interior a bit better. Love the 3rd row seat and the power fold feature. Denali and Escalade 3rd row was terrible. Also like that the Nav can switch from 2W to 4W drive. Denali and Escalade was AWD. Nav takes Regular Fuel while Denali and Escalade took Premium Fuel. Overall I am satisfied with the Nav though there is room to improve on it to better compete with other luxury brands.,4.5
4, on 08/24/09 11:21 AM (PDT),bal ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Nice SUV, This car is an overall good vehicle. It has room for 7 passengers which makes it convenient for families with children. The car is very large and takes a little bit to get used to if you haven't driven an SUV before. The sound system is great. Very reliable and well built. The only problem we had was an electrical one with the window which was fixed under warranty.,4.375
5, on 07/16/09 19:55 PM (PDT),kev ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Great travel vehicle, I bought this 6 months ago.  it took a few weeks to get the hang of driving it.  now I love it.  Plenty of power.  Really comfortable.  Tons of room for a 220 lb 6 footer like me.  just drove 3400 miles in two weeks on vacation with tons of gear and bicycles on the back.  made the trip very easy.  17.9 MPG on trip.  about 15 commuting to work and around town.  many really nice features,4.625
6, on 06/04/09 10:44 AM (PDT),sevenstw ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Luxury Built Ford Tough," The exterior chrome and square gauges have a retro 1960s look.  The interior is all about comfort, luxury and modern technology.  Build quality is excellent compared to the competition. For someone who drives nothing but full sized V8 trucks, I was impressed with the gas mileage and power of the Navigator. The seats are very comfortable and there is all kinds of leg, side and head room in all 3 rows.",4.625
7, on 03/21/09 10:19 AM (PDT),TRS ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Best One Yet," This is my third Navigator. All have been 2 year leases. I intend to buy this one at lease end. My first two had some electrical problems, especially with the easy exit system. This one been back once to replace the rear dvd, but other than that no problems. I love to drive this vehicle, especially on road trips. Gas mileage is low, but to be expected for a car this size. I really love the backup camera where it is in the reaeview mirror as it keeps sun glare to a minimum, whereas in dash cameras have that problem. Perfect family vehicle. The olny thing that keeps this car from being perfect is blue tooth. ",4.625
8, on 11/28/08 17:25 PM (PST),Laura ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Luv It," Love it! This is the most comfortable car I have ever been in.  When my friends and I go out their Hondas and BMWs stay home and we take my Navigator becuase it's the most comfortable of all of our cars. I love that it never goes back to the dealership. My old Mercedes G500 spent more time at the dealer than with me so this is a wonderful improvement. My husband tells me that my Navigator is based on the same vehicle as his Expedition and he puts over 150,000 miles on them with no problems. I look forward to keeping my car for a long time.",5
9, on 09/07/08 08:48 AM (PDT),jnd ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Solid in every way," This is our second Navigator and this is much better then the 2005 model we replaced. Recently towed a 7500 lb boat and had the vehicle packed for  vacation, trip was 120 miles each way and averaged 11 mpg. Handled the trailer like a champ. This model is significantly quiter then the model it replaces and seems smaller even though it is the same size. Engine and drive train are the same as the 2005 but the 2008 uses regular gas. Plenty of room for passengers and gear and the 3rd row seats are very comfortable even for large adults. The high itensity headlights are not as bright as the 2005 but the coverage is very good.

10, on 08/16/08 08:19 AM (PDT),W. Melgin ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Love my Navigator, I was going to buy an Infiniti QX56 but it was too tall for our garage. I love this Lincoln in all respects. It has almost everything I need and the comfort and drivability is unmatched.,4.625
11, on 05/06/08 14:18 PM (PDT),TroyD75826 ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),New impression, I am very happy with my new Navigator. It is very comfortable and the build quality is just as good as any other luxury vehicle.  Power is more than adequate but on paper is a little wimpy when compared to the Escalade.,4.625
12, on 02/01/08 18:53 PM (PST),bobsmall ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),My one month experience so far," I had a 2000 Expedition before that I bought new, so, I have been driving these beasts for some time. I love the Expedition. There was more leg room in the second row and more head room in the 1st and 2nd rows. I miss my big cubby hole I had in the console since the gear shifter was on the column.",4.875
13, on 10/06/07 05:21 AM (PDT),David ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Better Than Expected," This is our 2nd version of the Navigator. Our previous was a 2004 and this model is definitely improved. We have a 2007 Escalade as well and except for the larger rear view camera and more powerful engine on the Escalade, the Navigator beats it in all other areas.",4.125
14, on 09/22/07 14:56 PM (PDT),08navi ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Excellent Ride, This is our second Navigator(2004) and the best one overall that we have had. The monotone option is a must if you find the extensive chrome too much. The leather is much nicer than our '04 was and the '08 is a lot quieter.  Interior quality is significantly better than the Escalade.,4.375
15, on 07/26/07 13:48 PM (PDT),Angel  R. ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Lincoln Navigator," Rides like a cloud. Smooth ride and handling. Practically no interior noise and wind noise is minimal to none even at highway speeds. Performance is quite good for a vehicle its size. Comfort is excellent. Cup holders and compartments are well placed through out the vehicle and so on. Exterior design is not its strongest point, but overall has an excellent appeal with the 20' wheels and its unique grille design. I would definitely recomend this vehicle and would probably purchase another at some point . ",4.75
16, on 06/27/07 14:50 PM (PDT),mercedesamg17 ,2008 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),My Review, The navigator is a very sharp looking car. Thank God it doesn't look like the Expedition because that is very ugly! Overall great car that is fun to drive and is truly luxury.,4.375
17, on 06/15/18 19:36 PM (PDT),Karen Heinberg ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),My 20 year love affair with Navi’s," I cannot say enough wonderful things about this vehicle. I’ve been driving Navigators  for almost 20 years. I owned one for five years, one for three years, and this last one for 12 years (bought it in October 2006).  I hate to let it go, but my kids are now grown, and I don’t need this much vehicle any longer.  All three of my Navigators have been reliable, and service at my dealership has been fantastic. I feel like a member of the family there. The ONLY Downside is fuel economy. Terrible in the city (9-10) Slightly better on the highway (17).   2006 was the last year that the Navigator was made without an auxiliary or USB port.   That technology came out starting in 2007.",5
18, on 11/03/10 00:00 AM (PDT),Charles Robertson ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Luxury Workhorse," This beast has been a pleasure.  It has hauled our family of seven on several trips to Florida, hauled boats and jet skis, and innumerable trips to Home Depot, while making the trips to the grocery store and school functions with ease.  The 4WD/AWD makes it feel very safe in bad weather, and although we haven't needed much in the way of service it was easy to get worked on, no matter where we were (not so much with our BMW!) The power rear seat and video options made this a kid cruiser without equal.  This isn't a practical vehicle for everyone, but it was a wonderful choice for us.  40k miles, no regrets.",3.5
19, on 01/19/10 19:40 PM (PST),Mike Rawlins ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Lincoln Experience," I traded in my 2000 Navigator for a new 06.  This is my 25th year to drive Lincolns and this is my last Lincoln. The truck is nice to drive and visually appealing but the fit and finish are terrible.  (2) trips to the dealer for interior repair, (3) trips for the Sirius radio repair and finally took vehicle to Visteon retailer for repair (bad unit) (1) trip to fix.  The final deal breaker was the left power fold mirror not retracting.  The truck was 34 months old and had 36,400 miles and Ford would not provide warranty repair.  I was told by the Service Manager that if the mirror glass were broken, and I had glass coverage, they could bill my insurance company.    Unbelievable!  ",3.75
20, on 06/03/09 23:04 PM (PDT),Gary747 ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Best Vehicle I've Owned," Very comfortable to travel in, and definately noticed when on the road.  Like it or not, people sometimes DO judge you by what you drive.  Sound system, remote folding mirrors, retractable running boards, air- conditioned front seats and electric tailgate all get comments.  The third row seating is adult sized, and the electric folding seat option is worth having.  With judicious driving I get 18 mpg without much effort, but average 15 mpg.  There is a big difference between city driving and cruising with this car.  I've maxed 21.7 mpg on one perfect trip to LA.",4.875
21, on 12/31/08 03:58 AM (PST),hilnavigator ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),"2006 Navigator, my 4th"," After having a 1998, 2001, 2003, and now a 2006 Navigator, I must say the 2003 overall ride/performance  was the best. The 2006 engine noise is more on hard acceleration, the 6 speed transmission still has shift issues, especially in slow traffic, lots of clunking and ruff shifts. My 06 now has only 18,000 miles. Need for premium gas is a negative when gas was running 4 plus bucks a gallon. Could have better ride on rough roads, original Michelin tires ride not as good as Continentals. Replaced with Pirelli 20 in, as supplied on 2007's, nice riding tires, & looks great with 07 rims, but a noisy bumpy ride for first 10 minutes till they round out, but great in snow. Lower radiator hoseclamp failed",3.875
22, on 08/26/08 12:48 PM (PDT),Jennifer ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Overpriced Bucket of Bolts," So I've had my Navigator for about 2 yrs now and have had it in the shop at least 5 times. The most common issue was the plastic side plate where the seat controls are located. The drivers side has had to be replaced three times and the passenger once. Another annoying issue was the passenger side door.  he panel keeps popping off.  3 times for this. After the 1st time it was fixed the seals began leaking.  I've now had to have the seals replaced twice.  Most currently were the fan control, navigation, and transmission issues. One doesn't expect to have tranmission issues after only two yrs and paying $60K. Other minor issues include the 3rd row vent popping, and 2nd row trim pcs missing.",2.25
23, on 06/13/08 09:34 AM (PDT),Jason ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Recommended," I traded my 2000 Nav in when I purchased my new 2006 Nav and the improvement have been incredible. I've put on 45,000 miles on my 06 and it's never been in the shop once. Very reliable and comfortable. You get a lot for your money, folding 3rd row seats, automatic tailgate, TMX sounds system vs. other luxury SUVs. I would definitely recommend this vehicle for those of you reading my review. I put 98K miles on my 2000 Nav and had no problems. ",4.75
24, on 05/15/07 08:49 AM (PDT),kc ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Very nice vehicle," I really love the comfort of this car. It certainly doesn't feel like you are driving a large SUV or truck. The suspension is excellent and the seats are very comfortable. The interior detail is very nice but not great.. The tan carpet shows dirt too easily and doesn't clean up well, quality to improve here. Overall, I would recommend, especially for large families.  ",4.125
25, on 05/13/07 10:39 AM (PDT),Dragon ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Nice!, This vehicle drives like a dream. There is plenty of room for all and setable seat positions for two. I will keep this car till the wheels fall off.,4.75
26, on 12/22/06 19:29 PM (PST),Joe ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Improvement needed," My second. 1998 was a quiet, reliable vehicle with over 115,000 miles. 2006 has only 6,000 miles is very noisy up to 60 mph, leaks oil and has a navigation system that works sometimes. Quality has gone downhill. I have been to the dealer 3 times to repair the oil leak. What a disappointment from my previous Navigator.",3.25
27, on 12/11/06 22:09 PM (PST),Jennifer ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),I love my Navigator!," I bought my Lincoln a month ago and I love it.  Usually I have buyer's remorse with a large purchase, but not this time.  It's so comfortable and drives like a dream.  We almost bought the Luxury, but then upgraded to the Ultimate and I'm glad we did.  Its like a tank in snow and ice.  We drove over icy passes in two states two days after we bought it and its the best winter driving vehicle we've ever owned.",4.5
28, on 12/09/06 09:36 AM (PST),Archangel ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),A leftover 2006 Navigator w/3 dings...," The 2006 Navigator is a wide body luxury experience; however, the interior does not live up to its level of classification, as many have already mentioned.  My vehicle is a leftover and has hail damage (3 dings) that the dealership has agreed only to repair one at its cost.  The 2007 has a cleaner and leaner interior, but the button to fold the side mirrors inward is very confusing.  The drive, however, is smoother then the 2006, and you feel in control as you quickly pass on lookers, who can only look in envy.",4.5
29, on 09/05/06 20:17 PM (PDT),AJ ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),A very dissapointing experience!," After 8 months no issues with drivetrain except for poor gas milage 13.1 mpg. Interior fit and finish is horrible. Excessive wind noise from drivers window. Many rattles coming from cheap plastic components such as glove box, a/c vents, 2nd row storage console, and dvd player. Quality in leather is marginal at best. Carpets are starting to show signs of wear after 10k miles. Dealer is not geared to fix these type of quality issues at their location, very frustrating. Will not purchase any Lincoln or Cadillac product again. Very nice on the surface with 0 miles, 8 months into is a different story. Looking at MB GL450, Audi Q7, will unload this Navigator at a huge loss. I hope this will help.",3
30, on 08/03/06 15:01 PM (PDT),D Waters ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Great for a Lincoln," The Navigator is a hit with us, but now Mercedes and GM are making more economic and Luxurious SUVs, so Lincoln needs to stay int the game. The car is really noisy and (OBVIOUSLY) it's a real pain in the neck to fill it up at the pump. It's very comfortable and the third row is actually quite spacious. Overall, if you're someone who wants a luxury full size SUV, I might recommend the Audi Q7 or M-Benz GL450 a tad bit more, but if you need to haul a lot(I mean A LOT!), I'd recoomend this car a tad bit more than the GL, Q7, or Escalade (just a tad, because the design of both the exterior and interior isn't as elegant as the Mercedes or Audi).",3.875
31, on 07/31/06 19:46 PM (PDT),gallen ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Comparisons," Best luxury SUV available. Cadillac gets worse mileage and has no auto rear seats. Hummer has no a/c seats, no auto rear door and no power with poor mileage. Nothing else comes close",4.875

33, on 06/13/06 12:11 PM (PDT),Miami Vice ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),New to the Lincoln Brand," My wife and I just leased a Navigator and so far we are thrilled.  We looked at Acura, Infiniti, Nissan, Lexus, and Mercedes.   The Lincoln makes you feel ""PIMP""  It is very comfortable and the interior is very well layed out.  I never thought I would drive a Lincoln, but I am very happy I decided to go with the Navigator.  So far so good.",4.625
34, on 04/14/06 21:08 PM (PDT),Folk ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),The SUV handles well.  It is swell," Made well  this vehicle gets a lot of attention because there are not many on the  road  It is quiet, and handles well in the rain",4.875
35, on 03/14/06 07:50 AM (PST),Bob Drake ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (5.4L 8cyl 6A),My Navigator," I have owned nine saburbans and one Expidition over the years I was in business. The handling and comfort is far superior to the other vehicles. The Expidition was close. I see where Ford is building a vehical similar to the suburban, I would be interested if Lincoln would also build one similar to the Cadilac Escalade XL.",4.25
36, on 02/28/06 15:53 PM (PST),Mike ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),So-So Experience with Navigator," It was between this Navigator and a Range Rover Sport. The deals and financing Lincoln was offering was leaps and bounds better than Land Rover was offering. So far, the navigation system only works when it wants to and half the time doesn't know where the car is, or the screen won't come up. My biggest complaint is the seating. The heated/cooled seats are too firm and need to have softer filling. Beware that the Ultimate seats with the heating and cooling are stiffer than the standard luxury seats. After driving for a period of time, the seats are so stiff that my legs fatigue and become numb. The seats should be softer for a $60K vehicle and have not such a hard and unforgiving feel. ",3.75
37, on 02/01/06 09:22 AM (PST),mitzi ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Why I love my Navigator," I had a choice of any luxury SUV I would like.  I ordered this truck and had to wait as it was a special order color.  Silver Birch and with the mono tone wrap.  It is the Ultimate with every conceivable bell and whistle!!  I love it!!  It is super comfy and while the gas mileage is not a selling point, it gets within tenths of my Expedetion that preceeded it.  I did get an after market DVD as the factory one is puny i comparision.  Everyone takes a second look at this vehicle.  I'm glad I don't have a black Escalade like everyone else!!",4.625

Excellent power and take off, riding up high above smaller cars is great also feel safe in ice and snow and i have great traction with 4 wheel drive and other drive options.  Outside is sleek and i get unlimited compliments on my navy.  It's great to have the retractable running boards but the ultimate is the automatic lift gate that is wonderful in the winter when i go grocery shopping and the heated seats are the best",4.75

42, on 08/10/05 17:37 PM (PDT),Ryan ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Ultimate 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Hard for this one to disappoint," Just bought this about a month ago and have driven it about 1000 miles so far. It's a pleasure to drive and really is luxurious. My wife bought a new Lexus Rx330 last year, so I have been comparing both. On the whole, I like the Navigator better because of its size, but there are a few luxury items that the Lexus has that would be nice to have on the Navigator. Overall, I love this new Navigator, and I'm glad I chose it over the Escalade. My friend has an Escalade that I've driven, and I had serious reservations about some of it's features.  For my money, the Navigator is the best luxury full-size SUV out there, and nearly everyone I know really talks about how great it looks.",4.5
43, on 08/04/05 14:27 PM (PDT),keith foster ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),The one to buy.," My second. Put well over 100K miles on my 99 Nav. It would be nice to have a few more ponies and mileage, but that could be said of most all vehicles. Interior is on mine is black, exterior is silver. Best looking and best finished of any SUV as far as I am concerned. Handling in wet and around sweeping turns above 70mph is very good even though mine is 2wd. Braking is excellent, but with stock pads dust is horrible. You won't be disappointed with the luxury. Service at local dealer is biggest complaint. One small problem becomes many problems after they get done. Selling dealer did a great job, but to far to take it to them for service. I would buy it.",4.5

46, on 07/24/05 07:28 AM (PDT),Richard Hill ,2006 Lincoln Navigator SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (5.4L 8cyl 6A),Great design & value," Okay were do you start? The nature of the beast is she is a big SUV with 5.4. Don,t expect good MPH or blood rushing performance & because of the price you get what you pay for in terms of finish.

It's a wonderful road car, with a solid feel, good acceleration from the turbocharged V6, and a surprisingly good 18-19 mpg on the highway. The seats are comfortable and the deploying running board makes it easy to enter and exit, important since my wife has had major back surgery. The cargo space is huge; we travel with a 90 lb Lab and luggage for several weeks and have lots of space. The instrument panel is easily readable and intuitive, and the hands free operation is convenient and adds to road safety. Here's the downside: despite numerous trips to the dealer the car's electronic package still malfunctions frequently. It tells me it there's no key in the vehicle sometimes and won't start, sometimes giving the signal when the car is running and under way; the proximity sensors go off for no reason, the automatic windshield wipers turn on under perfectly dry conditions, and sometimes the Bluetooth phone connection does not recognize my phone. The problems are not constant nor have they interfered with the operation of the vehicle or it's safety, but it's annoying and undermines my confidence in the vehicle.

Obviously because of the size of the vehicle, fuel economy is not the best but really not too bad.  Comfort is amazing and so is he ride.  There is plenty of room in this vehicle for just about anything.  Towing capabilities are  wonderful and stopping if towing is above average.  If you are going to be in an area where there is snow, I truly recommend getting this vehicle with 4 wheel drive.  Have had no problems with the vehicle and I must say that with the twin turbos this large vehicle really gets up and moves.  The navigation system gets a little getting used to but pretty good once you learn how to use it.  The system was changed in 2016 witch helped.  I very highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.",5

Test drove Suburban, Mercedes GL450, Escalade, Lexus and Navigator.  I was looking for a 15' model to keep price in the high 30's to low 60's.  The one I liked best would win our regardless of price.  I ended up picking the Navigator as it's ride was so much nicer than all the others.  Now that I had the car for a week, I am enjoying other features like great sound system, easy to use panels that parse off navigation, entertainment, climate, etc.  Also key was being able to seat normal sized people in the 3rd row if we needed it.  The Lexus was so high priced, but also only a kid would be able to sit in the 3rd row as it was not deep enough for legs.  Also another great feature was the ability of the back to flatten out completely with a push of a button.  The look of the car is also very nice (black on black).

122, on 02/09/16 19:47 PM (PST),James ,2015 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl Turbo 6A),Great value great service," I have a 2015 Select Navigator L. Bought this truck in November of 2014 before the dealer had any on display in the lot and still got a great deal. Service has been very good. A year after buying the car I asked about replacing a seat cover that had a slight factory defect (wrinkle) I  noticed when new but not till after purchase and bothered me over time. They did the right thing and replaced the seat cover under warranty] to the tune of about $1200. Probably I'm lucky to have a good dealer but not all manufacturers would oblige me this way after the sale I'm sure. Like a previous review said this is a very nicely powered great riding and functional suv. I have had no issues and it tows my boat on vacations like it's not even there. Surprisingly easy to maneuver for such a large truck. It's so big I have to park it diagonally in my 3 car garage but bliss alleviates the need for hanging a tennis ball. The main thing is everything works well and I think Lincoln did a good job of updating with mature tried and true 6 speed transmission,  ecoboost engine and bug free navigation. Voice command works well and features like nearby movie theatres and show times is really nice. Not super fast and interface is a little complicated but ultimately rewarding Bluetooth and hd radio sound best on the THX audio system.The platform doesn't allow for some of the newer features like adaptive cruise but I find incrementing the speed using the steering wheel buttons works well on trips and I don't have to worry about the car slamming on the brakes when passing a semi like I've read is happening with other manufactures who have bugs in their advanced electronics. Has all the nice luxury features I need like power everything (steering column, pedals, folding seats and heated and cooled seats standard. This truck is exceptionally quick, smooth, and roomy, and CAPABLE. Fit and finish is pretty good but not as good as like and escalade but then this is much less expensive and much nicer looking than the expeditions interior in my opinion. I like to research and am glad I bought this over its domestic rivals due to all the problems they are having with their all new designs which I think are too small inside and not advanced enough in their mechanical engineering which is where I think Ford has a leg up on the competition.",5
123, on 10/09/15 16:59 PM (PDT),Phil Calendine ,2015 Lincoln Navigator SUV L 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl Turbo 6A),Traded '14 ESV for the L and loving it!," Yes, we had a brand new 2014 Cadillac ESV Platinum. It was really crap. Transmission issues, electrical issues, upgraded seats were horrible, very uncomfortable. Ride was very poor compared to our previous air suspension 2003 ESV. Engine under powered. Vented seats sounded like a jet landing in the car. Heated/cooled cup holder worked great for the two minutes before it turned itself off. Remote start worked great as far away as five feet. 2015 Cadillac is just plain ugly and ""fold flat"" seats simply sit up on floor of car...wife literally couldn't reach into car without hitting the bumper. That's not gonna work in Ohio winters. So we decided to cut our losses and try the Navigator-L. Got a fantastic deal on the outgoing 2015 which is essentially same as the new 2016. I did like the general appearance of the ESV platinum interior better, but the functionality of the Nav over the '14 or '16 ESV is way, way better. The entertainment/nav is infinitely easier and more intuitive than the grossly antiquated non Vue system we had in the '14, and I feel much better than the Vue system in the latest Caddy. Unlike the Vue, Lincoln maintains hard buttons where it makes it easier to use (volume, tuning, HVAC, etc) but still integrates those into its Sync system. The iPhone works seamlessly and intuitively. The old Nav had a grossly underpowered engine. The new ecoboost turbo rectifies that, and easily outperforms the '14 or '16 ESV. In addition, this smart 6 cylinder gets about 15% better gas mileage, which, comcined with the 33 gal tank vs 28 on the ESV, and you can go way further.  The brakes are also much improved, and better compared to Caddy. The ride (we have the upgraded Reserve edition with comparable air suspension) has 3 very useful and noticeably different ride selections. The Sport setting is great around town, resulting in a very stable, nearly sway free ride. Hit the highway and select comfort and the road bumps are nearly unnoticeable. The ESV did neither. The back of the L has much easier to use auto down third row, which, by the way is 40/60 split, which means you can actually sit someone in the middle of the back row. Caddy 50/50 split resulted in our huge ESV being reduced functionally to a six passenger! Who wants to sit in a crack? So overall, from my perspective, the '15 or '16 Nav L is an easy winner over Caddy, which gives the feel of an over confident underachiever.UPDATE: April 2017 at 22k miles. I suppose with an American car it was inevitable. What was initially a tight, smooth ride has slowly but noticeably deteriorated into a sway wagon. We had to have the reader wiper motor replaced, thank goodness right before warranty set to expire. The driver side power foot board is now angled outward, probably from an overweight service person that worked on our car, and the dealership sees nothing wrong with it. We get random beeping from the park assist all the time, and Lincoln has been zero help. Gas mileage has dropped as well, though still 1-2 mpg greater than we ever got with the ESV. It is still comfortable enough, and nothing else compares as far as gross load hauling of people and stuff, but we can't wait until we can offload this thing and get a Lexus.",4

The car has been very well maintained its entire life.  The rear air suspension was a problem, but if you convert it to a normal suspension you can bypass the ongoing problems of an air suspension once it gets older.  It is very large and comfortable and still feels like a new vehicle.  It is smooth and quite and the acceleration is good for such a large vehicle, as you would expect it does not handle like a car but I think it handles fairly well for a giant SUV.  We have the 4WD version so our MPG may not be as good as a RWD model but even still it is not bad for this size vehicle.  We average around 15 MPG in mixed driving but on highway trips it can get around 20 MPG.  It drives great on the highway in the rain.  We have never towed with it but like the fact that the tow package is cover with a plastic cover in the back bumper so you don't see the tow hitch or wires.Even though its a 2007 I still think it looks good outside and inside, the interior does not feel dated, plus it has all the features you could want, even heated and cooled front seats.

I can't say enough about it. It is exactly what I look for in a car. Very true lincolns quote from the 90s which they should still use ..Lincoln ..what a luxury car should be. Anyhow it's wonderful it's just about everything combined into one. Luxury of a sedan the towing of a pick up truck and the room of a minivan. Navigator I believe has to be the best car on the road ..aside from the rolls Royce phantom of course although it has the inspired grill so there you go. The options on the navigator are above and beyond its competitors. Love the keyless entry code pad I use that all the time . No key needed to enter the car! Love how the seats fold flat in both 2nd n 3rd row . It's comfortable no matter which seat you seat in and driving  is great with the air ride suspension. Heated and colder seatsAre one of my favorite options along with the parking sensors would not know want to do without them. The mirrors tilt down ward in reverse , can be optioned with power running boards that step out with the door opens , power third row seating folds down , powerLift gate , amazing sound system forThe radio and DVD player. I love the car. CouldNever imagine not owning one. It'sA head turner for sure everybody loves it and always have attention driving or parking it. Mine is in the pearl tri coat best color with the light ivory interior. Now forThe cons first is the gas ..i currently am getting only 12mpg however you pay for what you get the quality is unparalleled . The navigator does not have get up and go acceleration because it's so heavy so don't expect a sport car. Lastly the navigator is can be difficult I. Parking lots , drive ways. Most parking spots barely accommodate the navigator properly usually it's tight and risky. Minimum  Matniance never needed anything out of the ordinary. Dealer service is superb Anyways 5 stars !

I haven't had trouble with rattles or squeaks, and all of the trim pieces have been extremely durable. It's been very reliable, just a couple of minor fixes here and there. The driving dynamics are reminiscent of a much smaller car, and the acceleration is impressive. The air ride suspension makes Texas dirt roads feel like the Nurburgring.

Fourth, the seats don't need to be pulled out (third row).  Not only are they roomier, the fold right into the floor.  I am a large guy, the third seat is a pain to get out of a GM vehicle.

We now have 57,000 miles on it with nearly 30,000 of those miles being highway driven. We loaded the SUV down and took a trip from Florida to Yellowstone to California. We were impressed with the fuel economy for such a heavy SUV, averaging around 18-19 highway MPG. Very comfortable ride, superior performance and handling. We were disappointed in oral commands to the navigation and so when choosing a new destination you have to be at a stop. 2017 model has a very much improved command center. Recently we were told we needed new shocks ($1700.00 from the dealership) new brakes and now new calipers. We are 7,000 out of warranty so now on our own for over $2500 in repairs on this SUV. We called Lincoln Support and too bad so sad nothing they can do. Really? Not even discounted parts? Very disappointed in their ability to help out. The shocks were probably bad within the warranty period but it was never mentioned to me even though the dealership completed their multi point inspection. Dealership parts department was not at all surprised at our order of new shocks apparently they’ve sold a lot of them. Our mechanic was shocked at the amount of repairs needed on such a new vehicle as were we. Heck, the bolts weren’t even rusted on the parts removed!",4

Very capable and reliable.   I test drove a 2016 Expedition and then a Lincoln Navigator.  Navigator was superior fit, finish, ride  and very quiet in comparison.  I own a Lexus LS 460 sedan which is top of line Lexus.  My Navigator is actually quieter than the Lexus.  I was astounded.   Other large SUVs such as Tahoe, Escalade, QX 80 did not have the capacity or the ride that I wanted.  Also I had read about reliability issues on other vehicles.   I have been driving large SUVs for 19 years and found this car is just easy to drive.   So, I bought the 2wd Navigator Reserve.  I could not be happier.  No regrets.  Since I last posted this review I had a total engine failure due to EGR valve.  It was an item subject to a service bulletin.Lincoln should fix all of them before a breakdown.  I was put in a dangerous position when it failed.  Other than that, vehicle  is still a wonder.  I am now at about 19000 miles.  After 43000 miles had issue of a slight squeak  with steering colum cowel which was fixed under warranty.  To me and for me this is the best vehicle on the planet.

The 2006 Navigator had just the right headrest as it was more adjustable being able to pivot forward as well as up and down and was more cushioned.

A girlrear ended our Navigator at 70mph.  Wewere completely stopped and it pushedour truck forward the space of 2 parkedcars.  All 5 passengers in our vehiclewalked away from this accident with nobroken bones and only stiff necks andjoints.  This vehicle is more than apretty ride.  It's a steel bubble thatsaved my family from a potentially fatalaccident.  I highly reccomend the 1999Lincoln NAVIGATOR not only for security,but as well as for style, class, andreliabilty.  Two thumbs up to Lincoln ona job well built!  ",4.625

403, on 08/17/18 17:13 PM (PDT),Michael ,1998 Lincoln Navigator SUV 4dr SUV 4WD,21 years and still going strong," The 1998 Navigator went into production in June 1997.  Mine was made in August of 1997 so it truly is one of the first made.  The vehicle is 21 years old and has a few (very few) scratches and no dings or dents.  The carpets (like almost everything else) are original and look new.  The vehicle is NOT made for driving around the city and if you do, you will receive very poor mileage (like 12-14 MPG).  Take this girl out on the highway and you will get 21-25 MPG which for a 7700-pound vehicle is incredible. This is not a sports car and needs some time to get up to cruising speed, but when it does, it is smooth as glass.  Of special note: As large as she is, the vehicle has a very small turning radius. I have owned the vehicle since 2000 and with the exception of normal maintainance, the only bad luck (NOT Lincoln's fault) is that I am on my 3rd A/C compressor.  I have only had 1 tune-up, 1 brake job, 2 sets of tires and that is about it.  My Navigator has 99,000 miles, always garaged, has never seen snow and hopefully, it will be with me for another 20 years!",5

Initially thought the vehicle was too classy for an SUV. However other than replacing coils it has been fantastic.

After several hundred dollars in palliative attempts, it was recommended by a Ford garage to just replace the engine due to its reputation. Only other issues were the running boards needed serviced at about 80,000 miles, the air blender occasionally makes the rattle related to plastic teeth failure. Headlamps are pricey to replace also plan on several hundred when they fail. Another issue should be the limited illumination of the high beams. Really no better than regular headlamps.

I was 100% sure to go with the Expedition, but after seeing it last night, and test driving it, I changed my mind 100%, and bought it right a way!!  The Navigator looks much much better in person than in photos!!  I think it is not photogenic :)  The only things I dislike about it are: 1- The tail lights looks bad, and dose not match the overall nice look of the car.  I am still looking for after-market LED tail light to replace it. 2-  Exhaust pipe looks very ugly!! 3-  Bad sound system espically in the 2nd and 3rd row seats. ",4.25

I love the leather cabin and out of box styling, it like a plane flight on the ground.  This MKT Lincoln has steering shifters with this semi-manual/full automatic feature, it's wonderful... when you need the burst of performance when passing in traffic.  So far as it styling , The 1939's attributes are pure American, not Japanese or Chinese as many lost souls love to follow; MKT styling is attributed to pure USA motoring of 1930 's. Note the prominent split ventilating front grill design and wagon/caboose liftgate - pure American.   Everywhere I go, work, church or play this crossover turns heads, the complement has not stop.  I am LMC fan and my next vehicle will the SVC by Lincoln.  I am supporter of the Ford Motor Company,I know this is a bad word among those that swear their life upon anything other than American cars, trucks or SUV's, but If you don't stand for American, you'll stand for anything.",5

It was the service managers wife's car. I suppose that should have been a sign if I had known what TSBs were then. This thing has gone to a Ford or Lincoln dealership for numerous TSB (Technical Service Bulletins) so all the problems my MKT has had are well documented with Lincoln. The sunroof is working surprisingly, but for nearly 2 years it didn't. The trunk has hurt my head because it doesn't stay elevated when it's supposed to. This thing has seen at dealership shop every month since June. Yes, so once a month I have had to bring this pos in for one thing or another and since June it rattles just awful. June, July, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov!! Two of those times it went back because their mechanics did something wrong. Both times I had to fight for them to do the right thing. The first time to get them to fess up to their mistake and the 2nd one to get me a rental because they messed up and were out of rentals. I have little faith in this brand and the dealerships that sell them. About a week after one turbo was replaced the other one went out and we got stranded during hurricane Irma. Now I am on my 3rd turbo. When the turbos work it has awesome pick up and go. All and all I would not let this pretty design fool me twice. Yes, it's very comfortable but it's also very unreliable. As a single mom, I will take an uncomfortable ride over one that's going to leave us stranded.",2

I would purchase another if the model had not been discontinued.  It is comfortable, quiet, drives well, and looks good!  And it is roomy for when the grandkids travel with us.  Negatives are cheap plastic on door interiors, and dash, and a recurrent problem with the heater failing which Ford at first did not want to fix as it was only happening occasionally!

I absolutely love the car.  The down side seems to be excess tire wear and visability out the back window.  Other than those two items I love everything about the car.  Drove it home to Pennsylvania from New Jersey in a hell of a snow storm.  Freeway speed was cut to 45 mph due to the driving snow.  Car handled excellent in those conditions.  The third row seating is pretty useless except for small children.  Leg room is adequate but the head room in the third row seat is lacking.  The rest of the car is excellent for entry/exit, leg room, head room and over all comfort.  I am 6' tall at 300 pounds and drive the car in total comfort.  As far as cost for a used vehicle, I paid less for my Lincoln than a comparable Toyota Highlander, Arcadia would have cost.  They were around 2K-3K more money for comparable year and mileage.I developed a problem at around 70,000 miles.  You would be driving and the engine would just shut off and not restart.  Had to have it towed to the dealer 4 times in 6 months, dealer couldn't find the problem.  No codes!  The last time this happened they thought they had it repaired, loose wire at the fuel pump, but they had replaced the fuel pump the first time.  So why did they not find the loose wire then.Traded the car for a Lincoln MKZ and love it.",5

Some car reviewers dislike the exterior styling, but I love it.  Unlike most SUV/CUV designs today, the MKT is long, sleek with a bit lower height profile than most.  Makes it more like a big station wagon than a truck like SUV.  After four years, the MKT has been exceptionally reliable and the Lincoln dealer is awesome - great support, service and design.  Power and interior pace is plentiful and has some really great features (e.g. rear bucket seat with heating and cooling, rear fridge, automated parking assist, adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and more).  Oddly, however, it lacks front parking sensors(?!).  Other cons are that as with the older platform, the ride quality is not best-in-class.",4

Packed with technology (adaptive cruise, cooled seats front/rear) and I really like the style - it's elegant and stands out (not sure why critics don't like styling).  Some elements reveal that the platform is based on a family car (e.g. old fashioned foot operated parking brake, no front parking sensors even on top level model).

We are having no problems with Lincoln Sync and find it easy to use. The car is extremely quiet even compared to the MB. Handling is sharp, unlike the numb MB. The dual turbo do their job nicely. Gas mileage is as advertised so far. More foot room should be provided for the driver, the only real flaw so far. The safety features like blind spot warning and adaptive cruise control work great.

I was planning on getting a Flex, but after driving this I thought it was worth the difference. We own a Benz R320 and this feels the same if not better.

The LS is an amazing car.  I test drove the GS300 and the Infiniti M35.  When equally equipped, each car has a similar sticker price.

My LS Doesn't only blow dust in from the back rows, but from the front rows as well. It might attract more business if it's  called a V6, cause no one really wants a very weak V8, they want a Powerful V6. Luxury options are too pricy, and I might say the exterior is, well, ugly.

Too bad this car is going the way of the dinosaurs in a couple of years (after the '06 model year I believe).  I think the boys at Lincoln need to rethink their stand on that and continue to produce this premium luxury sports car.  I'd love to buy another Lincoln luxury sports car.

Had zero problems with the first one and am enjoying continued reliability with this one.  Handles exceptionally well although the performance of the V6 is just average. Average mileage in LA traffic is 20-22.  Great navigation system - easy to program and use.  Unbelievably good THX sound system.  Heated and cooled seats are great but I don't really use them that much.  Great road-trip car, extremely comfortable and silent, plus nearly 30 MPG highway (actual).  Design is my only complaint - dated but still very clean.  Only recommendation would be if you can afford the gas (runs premium) I'd pick up the V8/sport package for performance boost.",4.375

Overall this has been a great car. It's a V6 with 5 speed manual trans. The only problems I have had are 2 window regulators (I see this is a common problem but you can replace them yourself its not that hard) and 2 ignition coils that failed. I am still on the original clutch and have only replaced tires and brakes once - at 75,000 miles. Ride and handling are great, power is adequate, and fuel economy is good. I get about 20-22 mpg in normal city driving, and have seen high 20's on freeway trips.",4.375

Yesterday, I've bought my second LS, and I love it. Yeah, I had some trouble with it, but it's a used car with a lot miles on, so you should expect some repairs. The only problem I've had with is it was overheating in traffic, so I went to many different mechanics, and they told me it might be a radiator, or a water pump. Eventually when I changed both of them myself, the motor on the fan broke, and that was the issue. So, I think its not the car, but some mechanics are just not educated enough.Otherwise, the car is amazing, I've just got a black on black one with low miles, and I can tell you its something amazing for an 18 year old.",4.875

Gas mileage is signficantly less than advertised. There is no backseat room when the driver's seat is fully back. Trunk space is very""shallow, will  accomodate only one large suitcase.

It's just a Ford with a different emblem.  It's eaten two batteries in less than 9 months. Ford & the dealer are not standing behind this flawed product.  The thing is assembled in Mexico where Ford has quality control issues.  The interior finishings are sub-par for a ""luxury"" car, but fine if it was Ford branded. The touted 1 year maintenance plan is actually a downgrade from a 3 year plan that use to be inclusive.  The only good thing about the car is the smooth ride.

Between the money we both had to put into that car in repairs to keep it running, we paid for it at least 3 times. They are beautiful cars but they are problematic and expensive to fix.

When i went to test drive this car, I was ready to give up for the day as I had already looked/test drove 15+ other cars throughout the day. She was hidden, in the back of the car lot..like a black stallion calmly awaiting its master..it called to me. Per the usual, I asked to test drive her and was handed the keys. Once I hit the key fob, the interior lights came on as I was approaching the driver side door and I could see the interior through the light tinted windows...leather..wood grain..""Yep, its a Lincoln."" I said to myself and popped the door open to climb in. First off, the heated leather bucket seats are by far the most comfortable I have ever had the pleasure of owning....after a minute or two of taking it all in..enjoying the smell of the leather..all the fun buttons n gadgets..something magical happened..I put the key in and all of the sudden my seat is moving@! and the steering wheel moves out(tords you) and down, perfectly in front of me!!! At this point, I come back down to earth, and growing up with a mechanic, I instantly start disecting...                                                                    93k miles showed on the meter..everything worked(electronically), Oil preasure was good..Temp was holding steady, idle sounded like a cute lil kitten, purring its way through a Milo and Ottis dream..too good to be true...too goo to be true is all I kept telling myself.   I barely even got the car off the lot when I knew...I had to have it...considering the money came from my grandfather passing away, I felt like this was the car he would have wanted me to get.  So, I paid $6500 cash and drove it off the lot right then n there and haven't looked back since. As I mentioned at the beginning of this review, I bought the vehicle in 2011 with roughly 95k miles and other then common maintance, have not had any major issues with this vehicle..well other then that stupid AdvancTrac bullshit that likes to beep for like 5 minutes everytime I start the car...other then that, the car has been a tank for me and I constantly drive back and forth to/from Portland OR. to Spokane WA. and again, the comfort of this vehicle on the highway is par to none...rides very smoothly with its equal 50/50 front/back weight ratio (...hince why the battery is in the trunk!) and loves to hug corners!

The heater doesnt blow very warm, esp on the driver side and the a/c quits after getting up to about 35-40 mph and it doesnt work at all on the passenger side. The radio...well the speakers are magnificent! The cd player hasnt worked since I bought it. Lets see.. The battery is huge and its located in the trunk... had to have new breaks over the summer- which those are normal replacement parts on any vehicle. Had to have the water pump replaced.  I have recently had to replace the power steering pump and let me tell you, it was a job and a half getting that done, the location on the darned thing was horrible.. I've been having trouble with the jewel shifting out of 1st gear properly... The car started missin' after I got it... and the gas miliage has since then been horrible.. i am lucky to get 10 mpg.  Oh yeah ..there's something going on with the advance trac mode/deal.. that and the break light sometimes stay on after starting the car..I just shut off and turn it back on til they are not there.  There isnt really anything too normal about this car, but I guess thats a ""Lincoln Lesson"" for ya. Anyhow the body on the car is super cute in my opinion, and like I said the radio sounds great but only makes for an expensive looking radio... and if youre looking for a car, remember any of these that are actually left on the road today.. will only wind up being left on the road.. :-( Ive still got mine simply because right now its my only option.. too bad I dont have one in my yard I could use for parts... But then again, there wouldn't be...because they're all junk.. lemons, i tell ya... and it certainly is a heartbreaker... she aint worth a dang, but boy she's pretty.  Now i gotta go, time for me to take it and have the oil changed and a tire rod end replaced.",3

I've owned it a little over a year now, and I still like it. The fuel economy is not the best, but then again it is a V8. I average anywhere from 13-15 mpg city, and 17-22 mpg highway on 91 octane fuel. In this past year I've change all four tires, rear brakes and rotors, alternator, air filter, cabin filter, and a few bulbs. Now I have to fix both front upper control arms,spark and coil plugs,and clock-spring. I purchased this car with 167k miles, so obviously repairs were expected, but I now have 183k. That's 16k miles in one year, I like to drive a lot. I use Pennzoil Synthetic Blend 5W-30 instead of 5W-20, it runs much smoother. Overall a good car. ",3.75

I've never driven a V8 before, and boy do I love it!!! Even though it's 10 years old, plenty of people compliment how good it looks. A few things don't work like my heater, rear defroster, and horn(clock-spring). I think an engine mount is broken,because there's a slight bump into reverse. Other than that she runs/shifts smoothly.

The 252 HP V8 delivers very good acceleration and passing other cars is a breeze. Fuel economy is the car's one weak spot. The transmission is smooth shifting (nearly as smooth as my old Buick Regal) and throttle input is good. I bought the LSE trim which has a firmer suspension than the standard LS, so road imperfections are more noticable, but the ride is by no means harsh. The trunk is large enough, but fairly shallow.

Had to return the car the first week I had it cause of faulty power packs whatever replaced the spark plugs. That cost the dealer over 500 dollars.

So I took the plunge and am amazed at 30mpg at 65 mph and 24 mpg overall ( more hwy driving than city).  No quality issues so far. People compliment my color choice!

That said after driving a CT6 and This Conti, 1. Value for money ++++, 2. Confort +++, 3. I Hate Fords and gave a try when brought back a REAL car name AND they won me over with this car - THO ticks me off on a couple points, like the radio / display as mentioned above, the global windows don't open the moon roof as advertised on Lincolns site and still awaiting Ford/Lincoln exec to contact me (been 2 months), 4. Seeing mixed reviews, the target market should love this care DRIVE it with the 3.0, your mid - life crisis and need for lux AMERICAN CAR are wrapped in one.  I will agree with the mixed review on the 6 speed trans -  very poor when traveling 70 on highways / shifts erratically when need to pass, and the MPG not any where near what my v8 Northstar got, so those are also negitives, but someone in this market not gonna care about the MPG - (nor am I - that's moot).  Over all i would rate 4+ stars, and I only considered FORD because they didn't take bailout money, my original choice to replace the Caddy (as the CT6 was frankly not something i buy with the pricetag or the comfort) was a german car, but i rather own AMERICAN car, and have never owned a forigen car.

970, on 11/28/17 12:07 PM (PST),Ted ,2017 Lincoln Continental Sedan Black Label 4dr Sedan AWD (2.7L 6cyl Turbo 6A),It is not a Town Car," There is probably no suspension made that can smooth out low-profile tires. It rides like a sports car.  My Town Car rode like a boat in smooth water.  I can count the pavement strips with this car.  It takes a lot of time and manual reading to learn all of the controls. Then when you find them and do not use them, they are not intuitive. For example opening the moon roof at night at 60mph.  The controls to open the shade, the moon roof, the rear window shade, the interior lights and the rear head rest pop down ate all located in the upper center and are all slight indentations.  You can barely feel them and then there is no way to know without looking, what indentation you ate in.  The rearview mirrors are similar.  You have to feel around to find them.  Once you push the button for a mirror, then feeling for the directional control you are just as likely to push the door lock button or the button for the other mirror and now you are adjusting the wrong mirror.  I WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER LINCOLN UNTIL THEY LEARN TO HAVE LEVERS LIKE THE TOWN CAR. The seats are very comfortable and easy to adjust.  The heating/cooling controls and fan control are great. Can you believe it? My Town Car had a 5 CD changer. This car not only does not have a changer, it has no place to put CD's except to drop them in a pile under the player.  Dimming the panel lights is again clumsy with flat buttons on either side of the light switch. Again you have to feel around.  It only dims the panel lights and not the center console screen.  You have to go through a menu system to do that.  The car is peppy and handles extremely well, like a sports car.  But I wanted a comfort sedan.  I drive a lifted Jeep with 37"" tires I drive to work, so I don't want to bounce in the car when my wife and I go out in the evening.  Gas mileage with premium gas is about 20-25mpg.  But who cares when you buy an upper scale car?  Finally be prepared to learn a new language called ""Lincoln."". If you give voice commands, you must say them precisely and to do so, you must go to the manual to learn them.  There are 26 commands to control the climate.  Say List of Commands and they will appear on the console.  The automatic parking is a terror. I won't use it. It whips in so fast you had better have your foot ready on the brake to stop it. The car is very quiet at highway speeds.  With the moon roof open, it is still very quiet. Maintenance - take the car in once a year or 10,000 miles - great! The self closing doors are nice. Interior lighting is great. The instrument panel is another aggravation.  Trip 1 & trip 2 require you to go to the menu to change the panel.  Tire pressure is a big picture showing the car and the pressure on each wheel.  It takes up way too much room and you lose other panel instruments, so back to the menu. Once I had to make several turns merging onto a highway.  It told me that I was drowsy on the instrument panel. It took 5 minutes of trying everything to make it go away until I found that you are supposed to touch the instrument panel where the warning is. ZZzzzzzz.  I tried the lane activation with no traffic.  If there had been a police car behind me I would have been pulled over.  It waits until it is over the right lane line before it steers left and then shoooooots over to the left line and then back again like it is drunk The cruise control works nicely and I like the way you can adjust the following distance.  I wish it had an ""accelerate"" like my Town Car, but you have to speed up and then press the reset button again. As a Ford car company owner since 1978, I love the keypad on the side.  I have never carried my keys or fob.",2

When I drove the test model which had the 3.7L engine, I was wowed immediately by the LED instrument panel, the performance and the active noise cancelling system.   Upon delivery when I drove the car I thought that they had mistakenly put the 3.7L engine in it as I could not tell the difference in acceleration.   My previous car was a 2011 Cadillac DTS.  Comparing these two regarding ride and handling, the Cady gets the edge on smooth ride, but the Lincoln blows away the DTS on handling.  Even in the “comfort” mode the car handles really nice, but you will notice a bump more profoundly if you are use to driving more of a land yacht.The Good:   The technology is Star-Trek like.   The smart cruise, lane keeper, and emergency braking features work great.  I have a bad back and the seat massager is wonderful.  It works much better than that on the DTS.  I ordered the 13 speaker Revel sound system which blows away anything I have ever listened to in an automobile including the Bose systems.   If you are a music nut research Revel, you will be impressed.    The push button transmission is great, no clunky shifter in the middle to get in the way, and its idiot proof as you have to have your foot on the brake in order to put the car into D or R.   The backup camera system and over head profile view are very nice additions, and the on-demand front camera is great for getting into tight quarters.    The fit and finish and overall appearance are as nice as you could possible want, and I have gotten many compliments on the car since I have owned it.    The Bad:  There isn’t much to pick at, but there are a couple of things I would like to see changed.  First the console is so far back that it is extremely difficult to access from the driver’s seat.   It would nice if they could redesign the console and move it forward 4 or 5 inches.     Second the translucent top which covers the entire car looks awesome but the sun roof only opens up about 1 foot, which left me a little cold.  The Ugly:   The automatic parking feature did not work properly when the car was delivered.  The salesman and I drove the car around the lot testing it.  The system failed to identify perfectly fine parking places and then tried to back the car into a “space” about 5 foot wide – thank goodness the human driver can over-ride!   I have not had the car back yet for servicing so I don’t know what fixing it will entail.My conclusion is the car is worth every bit of a 5 star rating.  I absolutely love it and encourage anyone interesting in a full size luxury sadden to test one out.",5

It is fast enough (but not meant to be a racer with a 3.7 Litre engine), it is incredibly quiet and comfortable, it rides so soft on any road surface, and it is solid with no creeks and rattles.  The Continental is also very safe, top rated by IIHS with a safety plus rating - that was an important factor.  I also like the free concierge maintenance pick-up and return plan that comes with the Lincoln, along with a free Lincoln loaner car while my car is worked on.

The information that  the seat will only reposition back 2"" when the car was turned off, was never mentioned;  making it difficult enough to enter the seat the next time causing the wing to pull away from the plastic base to which it was secured.

Definitely best seating in any car I have owned, I have the upgraded seating.  Not like a foreign car, this car is very American.

Initially got lousy gas mileage the first week but the dealer assured me it would get better and was stunned to get 32.6 mpg driving down I95. Usually runs about 20 to 24 mpg around town which I am pleased with. The car is extremely comfortable riding and people fight over who will sit in the front seat to get massaged.  Still trying to figure out all the gadgets and functions. Love that people stop and walk around the car and always comment on it. I have the white gold color and it is stunning. Did 6 months of research on about 10 different cars, luxury, sporty, muscle cars, etc. and am very pleased with our choice.Update: I have now had the Lincoln Continental for 8 months and have almost 6,000 miles on it. I love, love, love this car! It is so comfortable, responsive and luxurious. There are no adverse comments that I can think of and I continue to have people fight over who will sit in the front seat to be spoiled by the massaging seats! Still getting great gas mileage, 32-36 mpg on the highway and 24-28 around town. It is very difficult to sit in a regular car after being in this one. I recently used a valet service for 5 days and every day who ever was parking the car commented on what a beautiful car and how they hadn't seen anything like it. My 4 grandchildren ages 6-10 always want to show their friends the car and they all have said they want to get a car like this when they are older.",5

But this new 2017 Continental has small, hard, economy car like front seats.  So this is not a comfortable long trip car like the Town Car was. The push button gear shift is dangerous because the buttons are not clearly marked or color coded - I ended up pushing Park when I reached for reverse and vice versa and once I even pushed Park when I intended to select Drive. The ultra-wide 19"" wheels with 45 series tires detract from ride comfort as compared to the previous Lincoln Town Car.   Road and tire noise is well suppressed, but exhaust noise is prominent.  At idle, engine vibration is transfered to the steering wheel - yet another economy car like characteristic of this car.  Directional stability at highway speeds is only fairly good so the driver needs to maintain attention to keep the car in his lane - yes still another economy car like feature.  After renting this car for two days, I had no desire to own one.",2

I have driven the Mercedes S class and have found this car to exhibit the same feel, and road manners as its Bavarian neighbor with out the big excessive money down, or astronomically high monthly note.  Compared to my 2013 MKZ this car drinks gas, but for the power, acceleration and poise which it exudes, I smile everytime I stand next to it.  This car is a Beast, and I mean that in a great way.  From some angles it looks like a Bentley.  I am more than pleased, I am humbled to have such an awesome ride.  The interior space is a dream come true.

Of the two MKX's and the MKZ hybrid I owned prior to this car, the new Continental is a winner.  The fit and finish inside and out are of the level of a higher priced vehicle.  I also own a 2015 SL 550 which I used as a benchmark.  I've got the 2.7L which I find to be quick and smooth for it's size and a little noisy on takeoff.  The updated Sync 3 system is solid compared to the previous ones I've owned.  All still much better than what I've got in my MB.  I've got the perfect position seats and they're pretty perfect.  These seats make this car and a must if you're considering buying one.  I got the standard radio which is disappointing for the overall price of the car.  I'll switch out the speakers with better aftermarket as a workaround.  I would have bought the Revel radio if they had one.  After I log a few thousand more miles, I'll update this review.Here's my update on the car.  Still love this car and its overall performance.  My only issue today is the entry/exit mode where the steering wheel move up and away works sometimes and other times not and the dealer can't fix it.  Just had an airbag recall that was easily fixed.  The pick-up and delivery services works well and a nice feature.  Gas mileage is excellent for a big powerful car.  It still has the showroom look, feel and smell.  I've done a couple of 4 hour plus trips and the comfort is the best I've experienced.  One of my Mercedes friends and I had a trip and he was impressed.Updat - had the car a year and still impressed. My only issue is the in/out feature as is works sometimes and not others and the dealer can’t seem to fix it.  This is more of a aggravation than anything else.",4
988, on 11/25/16 13:43 PM (PST),Eduard Emil ,2017 Lincoln Continental Sedan Reserve 4dr Sedan AWD (2.7L 6cyl Turbo 6A),Not up to date!," I think I purchased the first one sold in wisconsin.  It's a beautiful smooth car with two problems.  Using the push button shifter, its very easy to mistakenly push the Reverse button instead of the Park button.  That could cause a serious accident if you don't double check which button you pushed before taking your foot off the break. Second annoyance is that the GPS is out of date because it doesn't accept addresses that my 3 year old Tom Tom in my truck or my PC's Mapquest does. It also displays out of date speed limits i.e., I-43 in Wisconsin is 70 mph, the GPS says its the old 65 mpg changed two years ago. I noticed this on other roads too, completely not up to date.  I am sure they figured on this for a future upgrade for $400  in a year or so as they did with my old 2010 MKS.  I complained about this to the dealer and they basically told me ""what you got you got,""  I called the Lincoln company and they sent me to a website where I could have spent the next two years of my limited life trying to figure it out.  I think for $74,000  they should take care of it!",5

I still love the car and it continues to be trouble free. By far the most comfortable car for long drives.  Powerful, excellent fuel economy (24.8 mixed driving. I could get better mileage, but the engine is fun to rev.). The car is fast, quiet,  extremely comfortable and fun to drive. I highly recommend driving one before you buy any other luxury car. I bet you will be impressed. Over my lifetime I have owned many more expensive German cars but this is the nicest car I have owned to date.UPDATE: November 8, 2017.  The car continues to be flawless.  I enjoy driving it and it continues to be a luxurious, comfortable, capable and quiet ride.  The gas mileage continues to get better, despite my tendency to enjoy the feel the torque of the turbocharged engine on acceleration. I would change nothing on the car.  If I did not own this one, I would go out and buy one today. The nicest car I have ever owned.  I have not been back to the dealership for any issues.  I soon will go to the dealer and receive my free oil change service. ORIGINAL REVIEW:I continue to marvel at the comfort, quietness and performance of this car.  It is so comfortable, smooth and quiet that now my other four cars seem noisy and rough.  I just love the perfect position seats.   I  had been looking for a luxury sedan for about a year. I test drove almost every model of every luxury brand and finally decided on the Lincoln Continental.  I bought the Reserve model with the 2.7 liter twin turbo engine (380 lbs. of torque) and the perfect position seats (Extra cost, but worth every penny).  The Continental is a really high quality, fast, quiet and comfortable car.  It is perfect for long trips, where you can enjoy the extremely quiet cabin and amazingly comfortable seats.  I tried every seat on the market and the heated and cooled Lincoln Continental Perfect Position seats are the best available anywhere.    I have owned seven Mercedes S- class, several Cadillacs and Lincolns.  This Continental is by far the nicest of them all.  The quality of the leather and wood is outstanding as is the fit and finish of the entire car. The safety and convenience features of the car are wonderful.  Lincoln has invested a lot of time and money to design the new Continental and it shows.  Lincoln also has put a lot of money into their dealerships and I was pleased with how helpful the dealership and sales staff were.  I spent a lot of time driving every model to find the one I liked best and they were most accommodating.      I like the fact the Continental has six year power train warranty and a four year, 50,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty.  When the car needs an oil change or service, the dealer  will pick up the car at my home, perform the service, wash the car and return it to my home.  There is no fee for this service.  The car also comes with lifetime roadside assistance.  If needed, Lincoln will provide a loaner car.This gives me assurance Lincoln has confidence in this vehicle and backs it with a very good warranty.    There is one more thing I like about my Continental.  It is built in the USA by American workers.  If you are looking for a really nice, comfortable and well made luxury car, you should try the Lincoln Continental.",5

The pictures do it no justice, they do not capture the elegant curves that this Lincoln has. While I was waiting for it to be built, I was considering Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, Cadillac. I am SO happy I waited it out and stuck with Lincoln. There is just something special when you stand back and look it at. It has many throw backs to the classic Lincolns while also including all of today's modern technology. The ride is so quiet and smooth. The massaging seats are AMAZING! I never wanna get out of the car! The door handles are awesome, just pull and the door opens effortlessly. All I can say is go to a showroom and go see it and drive one.

This is a great vehicle for people of all ages, but unlike its counterpart Town Car, the Continental appeals a lot more to a younger man like me due to its torque and smaller size.

This car was just plain faster and handled better.  It'll run rock solid at 80 mph and still get 25 mpg.  The user adjustable air-suspension and steering are valuable because you can get very good ride control.  It won't float, bounce, or lean at speed.  The engine is red-lined at 6,500 rpm and it'll run that fast.  Low-end torque, say below 1,500 to 1,800 rpm, is somewhat slight; so, if you are used to a standard normal V8 then you're gonna have to goose it a bit more than usual off the line.

Now, there are some lil issues to watch out for:DOOR AJAR code - this can be fixed by spraying air into the rear door latches. it works for a month or two and then you had to spray again. a minor inconvenience. i kept my spray bottle under the seat.BATTREY -  strange, but if your battery is nearing its life on this car, weird things happen. for me i got a steering fault. i desalt with it for a while because the car started fine. i read about this online and someone said that old batteries do not mix well. the next day i bought a new battery and i never had the issue again. AIR SUSPENSION - every morning the rear would sit low. it would pump up fine though and work all day. i bought a bag online for i think like 80 bucks as i suspected one bag of being leaky. ill tell you what, i couldn't believe how easy it was to swap. no joke, i just jacked her up popped the old one out with a ratchet and new one in. it was a 25 minute job. i really couldn't believe it.

Despite this hiccup, the only problems I've had so far are cosmetic damage associated with having a 10+ year old car. My only complaints would be poor fuel economy and turning dynamics. It's a big car with a big engine, so I expect to pay a lot for gas though. Due to it's size, it doesn't take turns well.

1043, on 06/22/16 09:21 AM (PDT),Ray P ,2002 Lincoln Continental Sedan Luxury Appearance 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),A luxury car for the budget conscience," There's no denying that the auto industry has introduced a lot of new features on cars since 2002. Still, the Continental has all the features I could possibly ever want short of Bluetooth and an iPod interface. Some of you may long for a computerized interface such as MMI or iDrive but for me I've always found these interfaces to be highly annoying not to mention expensive to repair (they will eventually break).  The Continental is great for those who don't want to spend much money for a reliable, safe, comfortable car.  The 4.6L V8 is as solid as they come although some might find the engine a bit unrefined by today's standards. Then again, I only paid $4,500 for my car two years ago with 76K on the clock and have had zero problems! I can deal with just a bit of ""unrefinement"" which is laughable because this is a really comfortable quiet car.We love all the room, the trunk is YUUGE (yet my wife finds a way to fill it), the seats are very comfortable and the climate control system is the best of any car I've ever owned.  We appreciate the driver memory feature that adjusts the seat position for each driver.  Helps keep for a happy marriage. The car is also great in the snow being front wheel drive.  There is a bit of torque steer when you really romp on it but this is to be expected with 275 HP going to the front wheels.  MPG isn't bad for such a big, powerful car. I get about 22 on the highway (calculated) driving at 75-80 MPH while running on mid-grade. The engine doesn't object to this at all even though premium fuel is specified.  One downside you should consider is the cost to replace air suspension parts which can be an expensive proposition.  The air pump in my car now runs every time I start the car which means the rear air struts are leaking and will likely soon fail leaving the rear of my car practically dragging the pavement.  Not a great situation to be in if out of town. I will soon be replacing the struts with a conversion kit that installs standard coil springs for an out the door cost of $1,200. Once in place I won't have to worry about any other air suspension issues (such as the air pump failing).   All in all, this is a great car for a budget conscience individual who desires a comfortable, quiet car with good performance.  True, the gas mileage isn't the greatest but the overall cost of ownership (inexpensive to purchase, insure, maintain, repair) adds up to quite a comfortable bargain.",5

We almost made the mistake of purchasing a Towncar.  The car is bullet proof, although I suppose parts will fail someday, like the air ride and air conditioning, as it continues to age.  I will repair everything but the engine and will continue to drive it.  We're over 122,000 miles and going strong.  I admit we've looked at replacing it, but with what??  A heavy car with a beefed up V-6 that won't last for more than six years?  Ford needs to bring this car back with rear wheel drive and a hefty V-8.

While driving, the car is smooth and fairly quiet on even the noisiest highways.

I have been driving it for 3 years now. I hated it when I first got it, as a big, boat like sedan was not fitting for the outdoors man in me. However, it's slowly grown on me. 175,00 miles on it currently, second transmission was replaced at 105,000. The air ride suspension went out on it and replaced with struts. The engine is strong and reliable. The 4 speed transmission was a horrible implementation. It's a beast in the snow, never failed up the ski mountain, and I have nicknamed it ""The Snow Boat"".

Front seat backs have lousy lateral support. Nice inside & outside style. Suspension air bags way better than my 1990 Continental. Rear doors definitely are harder to open from outside than front doors. Compass and ""Day-night"" fluid in rear view mirror just failed. Top 1/2 of mirror is always bright & bottom 1/2 is dark.  With 140k miles, no big repairs yet, although the air bag light is on since when I reclined the driver's seat all the way down - must have pinched a wire.

Check transmission light has come a few times but vehicle had over 200,000 prior to this issue. Great car, if I can find another one when this one stops I will buy another one just like it.

1141, on 02/21/16 09:39 AM (PST),nanci ,1998 Lincoln Continental Sedan 4dr Sedan,classy looking cloud," I bought my Lincoln  5 years back.  Its a 98.  I was in need of a car asap since mine went.  I had a Lincoln twice before and a Cadillac twice.  I knew i wanted one of those.  I dont care about all the technology and bluetooth, fancy stereo etc... of a new car.  So that being said a nice car that I could afford CASH,  suited me fine.  It's all I needed.  Clean,  well built,  roomy,  Smooth, stylish,  and turns and parks easily.  People ask how I can drive such a big car and I say it's as easy to drive as any small car I've driven.  I drive to work with my coffee and as I sip it,  I can turn on a dime with one hand.  Parks into parking spaces easily.  I dont feel bumps in the road with it.  When I trade vehicles with My husband and use the Expedition I feel the bumps.  Bumps I didnt know were there until I use the Expedition.  The trunk is very roomy so long distance trips are no problem packing the trunk full.  The heat is wonderful.  Heats up fast....I have to turn it down  in a bit.  The air is cold.  The one problem I had is the windshield must have been replaced because when I bought it,  it had a bang slightly in the fender.  I didnt care, wasnt that noticable,  but I think they replaced the windshield because when it rains the floor carpeting is wet on passengers side.  Cant tell where its comming in at.  The shop said must not be a good repair and wasnt sealed good when window was put in.  Im thinking thats why it was sold.  so when it rains I had to park in the carport or stop at the car wash and vac the floor dry.  Recently the tranny light came on three times.  said to check it.  I did and fluid was good.  then one day it came on,, fluid was low.  I added it.  By night time the light came on again....this time it started bucking slightly.  No shop around me wants to mess with it because they say they think its a foreign transmission....and a pain.  With 133K  I think I am junking it tommorrow.  A sad thought.  Im sure I can call the Lincoln dealer about a new transmission,  but one mechanic said the car is at its life range so I dont want to replace that...then have the motor break. It has served me well.  There are other cars out there that have more closer to 30 mpg....at the time gas is important so Im debating do I want to go for class and comfort or gas efficiency.  Its very hard to choose.....because my Lincoln is a dream car!!",5

For having over 180,000 miles when I bought it it runs and drives great! The wife ran it into a tall median so I had to get an alignment which required replacing the lower ball joints & inner tie rods as well and new front tires as the wife's ""median job"" caused the not that old ones to prematurely wear out about 700 miles later. Great engine! The old song ""Hot Rod Lincoln"" frequently comes to mind. Turn the traction control off and it'll smoke the front tires on dry pavement, really surprises the hot rods at stoplights!

Front suspension overhaul( tie rods, sway bars) car had a clunk over bumps and never was fixed after 4 trips. I think its a design flaw as many other owners suffer this annoying noise. Alternator and battery at 110k  other than that and a few other things the car is solid, especially now you can get one dirt cheap infact cheaper that a similar year Accord or sometimes Civic.

My only beef, but a big vehicle, is the gas mileage. I get 12mpg ave. What can I expect? With gas at $4.20 a gallon it's no fun. Perfoms great, love on long trips. Step on the gas and let the horses loose! I would buy again. I will keep this truck till it dies! ",4.75

I used it as my daily driver for about a year, when I sold one car and was not sure which car I wanted to get next. This truck gets lots of looks and compliments, and it functions quite capably as a ""truck"" too! I have used it often to haul dirt, mulch, rocks, brush, trash, you name it - it does it all with style. It does a great job towing a 24 foot boat as well. Everyone who has ridden in it has commented on how nice the interior is and how comfortable it is. I haven't put a lot of miles on it (16,000) but it has not given me any problems.

The exterior is so tuff, everyone looks.The interior is incredibly comfortable, nicer than my Acura RL. We tow a boat on a tandem trailer (about 7500) pounds and you can't even tell it's there. I've driven it across state, was worried because it seems so big, and it was perfect. Comfy, roomy, tremendous stereo, all the features are on the wheel or within easy reach.

It's a great looking truck that gets a lot of compliments.  The main problem is that the seats look good but are hard as a rock and terribly uncomfortable even on short drives.  The Interior looks good but has cheap materials, and is nearly exactly the same as a Ford F150.  This is a truck with truck capabilities. I also have 4 Chevy Avalanches in my 40+ vehicle fleet and would rather drive one of them hands down. You'll get much better fuel mileage as well.

It drives like a luxury SUV with absolutely no ""trucky"" feel, making you forget  you're driving a pickup. The engine is smooth, strong, throaty. Transmission shifts seamlessly during cruising. Body fit and finish is impressive. The stereo pumps. The shortbed has generous cargo space and extends to 8-ft with the tailgate down. There's lots of plastic on dashboard, but is tastefully done and durable. The Lincoln trim makes it more mature and sophisticated than an F-150.

Probally the weakest vehicle i've ever owned. The local dealer said they just reset the computer code and all was well. Not so , the air blows cold MOST of the time but it still has NO power and the gas mileage is terrible. not really a lincoln, just a F-150 with some chrome.

Two dealers can't seem to balance the tires. CHEAP plastic abounds in the interior, and the adjustment for tilt steering is primitive.

Have been to dealership 3 times and service manager responds with ""I hate Ford;  that's as good as it's going to get"".   Would not recommend this truck or dealership. If you go over a bump, the back doors sound like they aren't completely closed, which of course means truck is not as quiet inside as you would expect.  Also, for a truck with under 10,000 miles, it idles roughly. I expected much more for the price. After meeting with owner, I expected some resolution rather than ""it drives better than my Ford 350"".",2

Plenty of horsepower and ride quality.  I have treated this truck, on quite a few occasions, like a old work horse. I have hauled a couple yards of gravel with it, it did not break a sweat. Launched jet skis in a non launch area, off road, and of course, Syracuse, NY salted roads.

I personally do not care that it is based on the 150 as that is a good truck- I view it as a luxury package on that truck. With the monochrome package and everything but rear dvd it is a great driving experience on the road, but the size, for me, makes it difficult for short shopping trips. I had an 05 tacoma that was a great truck but too basic. The looks of it are stellar, the ride height awesome, the luxury features the best available, and to me, ford is the mercedes of the truck category.

Other cars offer all the same features, some better implemented. The interior is very bland, handling (well this is a given) is very mushy, the transmission is never in the right gear always being several too low as well as very jerky, and engine sound is horrible; shifting up for yourself (which I have to do every time I drive the car) takes you away from the left hand dashboard screen where it keeps information such as fuel economy (using graphics that aren’t very good, and with awkwardly sized gauges especially for the tach). Visibility is very limited which forces a high seating position, small touches such as the missing wiper stock on the righthand side and the poor allignment of the woodpanels on the door and dash or the plastics on the center console drive me INSANE. I’m very attentive to details, for this reason the car doesn’t suit me by any means.

This is the first car I've ever had that has just about every option available, including massaging seats, but I don't use half of the things.  I am truly interested in trying out a Continental, so I guess it will depend on the deal they are will to work, as my residual at the end of the lease is highly reasonable.  I am really torn about what I'm going to do.  The brakes are very touchy on this car, and every once in a while there is a bogging when I hit the gas.  I am a fast driver, not a typical MKS driver, so I do put the pedal down.  My other car is a Mustang GT, and that car flies. I really do love this car a lot, but after 36 years in the military, and pretty much kept cars for 200,000+ miles, I feel I've reached a point where I want to spoil myself a bit.

The seats are actually more comfortable than the Town Car. On trips, the adaptive cruise control is a very impressive feature when approaching slower cars in front of you. Their is plenty of power when passing with the 3.7 engine.

So so glad I test drove the MKS in my car search.  The press bashed this car for being too similar to the Ford Tuarus, but to me that's never been a consistently applied criticism, as journalists rate the Lexus ES 350 as a better car (it isn't) letting it off the hook despite being a glorified Toyota Avalon.  The engine is from the SHO and it is bad ass.  350 ft lbs of torque that you feel the minute you push the pedal.  In comfort mode it's like driving a modern reincarnation of the Town Car.  In sport mode it's a large all wheel drive sports sedan.   You can hear yourself breath it's so quite in the cabin and the leather is butter smooth.  Just love it.

First off, anyone claiming over 25 MPG is insane unless they only drive downhill. Ecoboost does not stand for efficient. The brakes are underwhelming, and I have never seen a car go through rear brakes so quickly. I have had the brakes changed multiple times, and recently switched to a set of carbon ceramic Powerstop brakes, and are a worthwhile investment if you want them functioning properly on a day to day basis. The motor went in the steering column and the entire thing had to be replaced. The brake booster went out, which is not a huge deal but took a half dozen times in the shop for them to identify. All the while driving garbage ford loaner cars. When someone purchases an MKS, they do not want to be stuck driving a C-max or a fiesta. The timing chain was replaced, which is also a common problem with the 3.5, and a huge reason to stay clear of the F-150's with this engine. other issues: ball joints, control arm, tie rods, rattling speakers, sunroof leaks into the rear door???... the list goes on. Don't get me wrong, this car is amazingly comfortable traveling with my family of four, but please buy a lexus and stay away from  American junk.  Made in Chicago. Built like crap.",2

The leather interior far surpassesthe Ford Taurus.Only the BMW 760Li, Audi L8 and 2009 Infinity M45 were comparable...for $20-80K more!

There is absolutely no comparison between the Mercedes Benz and the Lincoln MKS.  The Lincoln MKS wins hands down.  The MKS has real leather, not ""leatherette"" vinyl on the seats as in all C Class Mercedes Benz.  In the MKS, you can actually feel the road, not so in the Mercedes.  The Mercedes is quicker 0-60, but the MKS is heads and shoulders above the Mercedes in every other category.  To me, the ride comfort is far superior to the Mercedes Benz C Class.  The electronics are much more intelligently layed out, and the menu's are logical.  The Mercedes navigation ""Becker Map Pilot"" is the German equivalent of a bad joke.  The Lincoln's premium sound system is just as good as the Harmon Kardon in the Mercedes.  Trunk room in the MKS is fantastic, and the Mercedes trunk room is horrible.  The Lincoln is a few thousand less that the Mercedes, and a much better buy, for the money, the ride, and comfort.Well, I have now owned this vehicle for over a year, and everything I said above is still true.  I probably shouldn't say this, but this Lincoln MKS easily exceeds 100 mph.  Yes, the Mercedes did too, but the MKS is certainly as stable at speed as the Mercedes was.  The other day,  I loaded 30 pieces of St. Augustine SOD in the trunk, the pieces are about 30"" x 18"", and the guy said they would never fit in the trunk ....until I open it...they fit just fine.  I still like this car, it is comfortable on trips, and nimble enough to drive comfortably in heavy traffic.  If Lincoln hadn't discontinued the MKS model, they would have sold several million if they only produced it in a convertible model.I am rapidly approaching two years of ownership and near 30,000 miles on the odometer and this MKS has not skipped a beat.  Everything is holding up well, and no visits required for maintenance.  Wash and wax, change the oil at regular intervals, and the car still looks great.

I will admit that I use the car for business and it works well with clients as far as comfort, but also as far as not being so fancy that it is offensive. I have read numerous reviews about its similarities to the Ford Taurus and while there are similarities (size, weight, overall platform), the minute you get into the driver's seat you will notice that they do not feel THAT similar after all. In terms of the MKS, it has shown itself to be a surprising comfortable and agreeable vehicle after numerous daily commutes and several 4+ hour long car rides with four good size adults. The ride is smooth and quiet, but I will tell you that over choppy pavement the ride could use some additional dampening. The handling of the vehicle is fine, but there is some body roll, although not a huge amount and you generally walk away with a good feeling about the vehicle. I have been your typical import car snob in the past, but I have to give credit where it is due. The MKS is not likely to convert the sport sedan set or those who must have a 'prestige' brand in the driveway, but if you want a good car that is full of noticeably useful features and will leave you feeling comforted, the MKS is worth a look. If Lincoln continues to build on what they have here they will re-establish themselves firmly. The vehicle is not perfect, but it has been trouble free, with good power and good overall comfort. It could use a little leg room everywhere and some hipper styling, but I am perfectly happy with it and I find myself surprised that I am even driving a vehicle like this before I have even hit 40. I'll probably go back to something sportier the next time around, but I do like this car. If Lincoln is smart, they will keep all of this vehicle's finer qualities and package it in a body to grab people in the 35 and older set.",4

I would be able to live with that but then I found out most shops will not replace the water pump on these because the engine almost has to come out to get to it under the timing chain cover and the cost by the dealership was over $2200!  I find this unacceptable!  My warning to owners of this car is to unload it before you need this repair.  Mine made it to 164,000 miles.",3

I have a 2010 for the last 3 years with all the bells and whistles you can get. It had around 50K when i got it. For the price and what you get its very nice. I love all the space and the Ecoboost has plenty of getup and go. I don't use the auto park feature very much but it works well. Now for the bad. The leather in this car has got to be the worst. I don't put a lot of miles on this car as I slug to work and travel often I would have hoped it would hold up better. I've had infiniti's that wore much better. The gears on the tilting and telescoping steering wheel stripped so I had to get that fixed at about 55k miles. I've had to take it back to the dealer for a transmission leak twice.  First at 68K they said the seals where bad and replaced them. Then again at 78K they said the PTU needed to be replaced. After snow and freezing rain I got in the car and water was pouring in from the lights above the rear view mirror. They said that the drain was clogged causing water back up and enter through these sunroof.  The water leak was not covered and i had to pay 580 bucks to get it fixed. I'm also not a fan of the way water drains through the doors. There are holes covered by a rubber flap under the door. Sometimes they get clogged causing water to build up in the door after a rain storm. You can hear it sloshing around when you drive.  You have to open the door and pull the rubber flap to allow the water to drain. Ford says this is how the designed it but having sitting water in a door I'm sure will lead to rust later.  Also I've had to get the key fob replaced once as it just stopped working.  I'm glad I got the 5 year 100k miles gold warranty on the used car. $100 deductible and they give you a loaner car. I'd suggest you make sure you have the warranty if you buy this car used. I'm going to get rid of this car as soon as the warranty runs out. Too bad because I actually like it a lot. The quality is just lacking.,3

In fact, if there is another large, luxury sedan with this kind of performance, that also delivers fuel mileage near 30 MPG on the highway, I've not found it.

It's got size over the 350E and the Infiniti M.  It has a luxury ride while remaining sporty.  You've got to give this car a serious look before buying.  It can't be beat.

1313, on 07/26/18 09:04 AM (PDT),Ladi A. ,2013 Lincoln MKS Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Sporty looking sedan, Bought my car at 3yrs old. Had it for a little over a year. My 5th Lincoln having gone through 4 Lincoln Town Cars. This car obviously is more sporty and contemporary looking than the LTC whose production was stopped in 2011. The pros of the MKS include the sporty looks. More agile and better braking responsiveness. Looks smaller but quite roomy as large as the Town Car. Taller and so more comfortable sitting position especially at the rear. The panoramic sun/moonroof adds to the luxury package. Handling is quite good especially with the large 19in alloy wheels. Cons: Too much interior noise. The LTC is a lot quieter and more silky ride. No air suspension for the MKS which is a pity. Headlamps malfunction and go out at will and requires a wholesale replacement of the complete assembly. This is weird and unacceptable for a supposed luxury flagship car. Parts are overly expensive. Reliability of this car is horrible compared to its Japanese competition like Toyota Avalon. The jury is still out on the durability of the MKS. The town car has an average of 10yrs and the engine lifespan is within the 400k miles range. Surprised that the MKS was discontinued after only two design models and less than 10yrs on the market. My overall rating is a generous 4 stars.,4

I knew I was going to be doing a lot of highway driving so I wanted something comfortable. The Lincoln is incredibly comfortable. The engine is powerful and cruising along is a breeze. For context, I am 29 years old. Not the typical car of a 29 year old. When you think Lincoln, the first thought is usually the Town Car. This isn't your grandpa's Town Car though. I really do like this car. It is beautiful. There is a big BUT, though. I didn't get all of the super fancy tech and I regret it for the sole purpose of reversing in this car. The visibility out of the rear is horrid. The backup sensors work but are incredibly slow to respond. I can't believe this car doesn't have a reversing camera. It's incredibly dangerous, if I'm honest. The base stereo sounds great, heated front and rear seats plus cooled front seats work great, Xenon headlights (non adaptive in the base form) are okay. My Hyundai's Xenon headlights seemed a lot more crisp and had better focus. Then there is the issue with storage. This car basically has 1 cup holder. The arm rest is weird because if you slide the padded sections forward, they block your cup holder. I've also learned that they must be slid forward just a touch before opening the armrest or it will catch on the back part and try to break itself. This car... I can't say I'd buy another one.

I was a bit hesitant, but with it being a one owner car, I took the chance. Boy did I make a great choice. The MKS really is an overall superb vehicle. I think I got lucky with mine, because for having over 100,000 miles, and being 9yrs old, it drives like a dream, and is a very snazzy ride. The MPG is not great, which for a boat of a car with AWD, this is to be expected. The handling is not amazing, but works for most. One thing to keep in mind is the shear size of this car; it's huge! Maneuvering into tight spaces can present a challenge, especially in cities. I'm very grateful for the front and rear parking sensors, as well as the back-up camera. The layout of the dash is simple to use, and in my opinion, is not stuffed with too many buttons. The sound system is exceptional, and the voice activated navigation is a life saver when you need it. Seats are plenty comfortable, and provide adequate support for long trips. This is a Lincoln, not a Cadillac, BMW, or a Infiniti. It's not designed for fast cornering, races down the road, or hardcore performance. It's a luxury ""tank"". It seems to appeal more to the ""older"" generation, and is designed to perform as such. The available AWD is a must for snow country, and makes all the difference with snowy or icy climates. Tires are not cheap, and are a bit tricky to come by.  My only real complaint is that my sunroof does not work, which from what I've read, is a very common issue with these Lincoln vehicles. Other than that, I give it a two thumbs up, and a steal for just over $13,000.00.",5

I had to go in 3 times to fix 2 lumbar supports. Two of the door locks fell into the door. They never properly fixed the front seat back so it is not flush to this day. I had to take the car in 12 times to finally fix the AC. The air would blow erratically rather than with a steady stream. Strangely I love this car when it is in proper working order.It's now 2018.

I drive long distances on the highway and no car would compared to MKS. AWD (and 19+ tires) gives you excellent traction on the road and in the snow. Comfortable seats, nice features, smooth handling, plenty of power. This car is not built for racing, correct. But it would not disappoint, and indeed makes you proud, when you punch it to pass foreign competitors up the hill.Not 100% pleased with the interior design.

I'd be at a stop light with no one near me for miles and the side assist warning system would starting beeping. Two months in and part of the driver's seat fell apart and a piece of the grill fell out.Gas mileage was terrible and in the rain the MKS drove skidded all over.

Now I have a new rattle in the sunroof.The rattles are so annoying you have to cut radio up to drown out, since the radio does not work half the time this is a problem.

The car has great appeal, good power, roomy, with a great nav and Sync system and overall very comfortable. However, I have to agree that the opening to the truck is small, considering the size of truck is so enormous. In addition, I have had some issues that are annoying, but do not deter me for my love of this vehicle. The transmission is a little rough around the edges and would shift harshly depending on the throttle input.  In addition, this car does not like the cold. Every time the temperature is below 20F, I am unable to get sound from my radio or the media center, until the car warms up. ",4.75

She loves the comfort, spaciousness, handling, performance, and level of luxury.  Although not a techni, she finds the Sync system a user-friendly and awesome capability.  Her car came with almost every option - it had suggested price of 45K, we paid 41K. I think the Edmunds reviewer needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  He wrote a review based on what HE expects and wants from the car.  My wife doesn't WANT his handling or performance; SHE likes ""lower-level"" handling (not crisp) and ""less"" performance (he calls it ""lackluster"").

The trunk hides all the mess that you carry and its safer to have things in trunk in comparison an SUV or crossover and it looks better too.

The letter names car manufacturers are all going over to are getting confusing. Even the saleman had to think a second when I asked to see the MKS. That aside, this car provides reasonable performance, ride comfort and room. The electronic features are worthy such as SYNC which lets you store a load of songs on board and talk hands free on the phone. The front seats are comfy and rear legroom is abundant. The dash is well laid out and looks attractive. The exterior leaves me a bit cold however with it's plain slab sides and indistinct rear end treatment.

I sold it to a friend and missed it, so I looked for another. Decent Crown Vic's are getting harder to find, but these Lincolns are quite available. I am really sold on the Panther platform, and the Lincoln is mechanically familiar to me. Durable and relatively simple.  I bought this car gently used, and I find that I like it more than the CV. It's a little bigger, a whole more comfortable, ride wise. Mine is a pewter, bluish silver color and I quite like it. The technology gap is a little behind some of my other vehicles, but they are newer. Mine has the back up beeper parking assist, which really works pretty well. It has a single CD player sound system. The sound, deep bass and crisp highs, is really good, but with no ""aux"" input, that really limits what I can listen to. That's kind of a downer, but hey, it is an older car.  One thing I love is the interior lighting. Each door has a light, each seat position has an overhead light and there's under dash floor lighting. Ten (10) lights come on when you turn on the interior lights. I like that..it looks cool. This car, like my CV, gets decent MPG's, especially for how big a car it is. It's whisper quiet inside and quiet enough that the guy at the carwash commented on it. The trunk is enormous. I play in a band, and it's got plenty of room for two electric guitars in cases, my amp, gig bag and pedalboard. I can carry all my music stuff in the trunk and not have to put any items in the passenger area. Nice. Plus, the air ride suspension keeps the car level even with a trunk load of heavy gear.  I love this car so far. The performance? It's not a drag racer and it stops like my pick up.  I don't want that kind of performance, though. I want a smooth, quiet ride.

1405, on 08/03/15 13:48 PM (PDT),Chris Hawkins ,2006 Lincoln Town Car Sedan Designer Series 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),Last of the Dinosaurs," Last of the dinosaurs because large RWD, body-on-frame luxury American cars are extinct.   Plus, mine is Black Cherry, which is almost purple.  I had never paid attention to Town Cars before, but when a friend bought a 2001 Cartier in mint condition I looked a lot closer.   I was so pleased with what I discovered that I immediately sought to get one of my own.  After a lot of research I determined that 2006-2007 is the sweet spot for these cars.  Any earlier issues had been resolved since  production began in 1998, and by 2006 they were essentially perfected and had all the upgrades.    I also discovered the Designer Series, which was only made from 2006-2007.  It is the only model in all the years through 2011 that had a unique upgraded interior - more lush than the Signature Limited, Ultimate, or Cartier models.  The shirred leather with contrast piping and adjustable rear headrests stand out.  All but three options were standard on the Designer Series and the car I found has all three:  Moonroof, HID headlights, and Navigation.   It has been such a pleasure to own.  The entire driving experience of the car brings to mind the description Rolls Royce once used for the operation of its cars:  Ball of silk.  All the controls  and its progress down the road have a quality ""ball bearing in oil"" smoothness to them.  The ride is taut, smooth, and tightly controlled and the sound levels are astonishingly low.  Best of all, it feels like a REAL car, not one of these little toy FWD things masquerading as luxury automobiles.   It has the genuine luxury of a level of silence, space and smoothness that has been largely lost in today's downsized cruisers.   Everyone who rides in it is immediately impressed with these qualities.I also bought the car because I know they are essentially bullet-proof, and easy and inexpensive to repair should something happen.  Even the air springs in the rear suspension (my one concern) are engineered to be swapped out with common hand tolls in less than an hour, and parts for it are cheap and plentiful.   I hope to keep this car for many years  - there is really nothing on the market to replace it with, except another one.  I have had little concern with problems or repairs with the car since I bought it three years ago.  The only significant repair needed was to replace the alternator,August 2016:  After two years ownership I am happy to report my initial impressions of this car remain intact.  The car continues to be a joy to own and drive.  It has also been 100% reliable, requiring only regularly scheduled maintenance.  I did have an issue with the THX/Navigation radio - more specifically the 6-CD player.  It jammed with a full load of CDs.  I discovered that is a common issue with this radio unit - every one for sale on Ebay has a dead CD player.  However, my radio recently had an ""immaculate repair"".  After several months of a whirring sound for 5 sec. whenever the unit was turned on, it apparently un-jammed itself and the CD player is now operating like new.  (The regular radio and navigation function was never affected by the jammed CD.)  Also, after two years of hand washing the car, I remain amazed by the impeccable factory paint job.   I have seen brand new Mercedes and Lexuses (Lexi?) with inexcusable orange peel in their paint jobs - this 10 year old Lincoln puts them to shame.  It has a mirror-like paint finish worthy of a high dollar show car.August 2017:  Not to be boring, but nothing new to report.  The Lincoln Town Car is still performing beautifully and has needed no repairs.  I was driving a Rolls Royce Silver Spur this weekend and a 2006 Bentley Arnage Red Label a few weekends back.  While driving both, I was noting to myself that they are no Town Car as far as smoothness, silence, and silkiness of operation is concerned.   The Lincoln is far more pleasant to drive.Auguat 2018.  Still love this car.   A significant repair recently:  replacement  of the intake manifold.  Earlier Ford 4.6 V8's had a plastic intake that was prone to fail,  It was updated with metal water passages around 2003 .  Despite the improved version on my car, it failed at 124K miles.  The part was $180 and I was able to replace it myself.  Good as new again!",5

I like especially the remote trunk and the easy to adjust clock. I have gotten up to 27 miles to a gallon, normal is 25.4. I've had Packards, Cadillacs, and Chryslers over the years.

With air ride bumps are not even a consideration. Personally I don't want a sports car feel that corners like its on a rail. I like that floaty-boaty feel! When your spending big money for  luxury car.. that's exactly what you want it to feel like, period! The engine is as storing is the day I bought it.. and the appearance is just as good. Every vehicle acts differently depending on who the owner/driver is, and mine has been somewhat pampered. With just over 191 THOUSAND ""and not stopping anytime soon"", its my daily driver. 117,000 miles out of the factory brakes before needing a change. Just bought the 3rd battery, and went the first 10 years without spending a cent. Finally at 150,000 miles the air ride shocks started to weaken, so I had them changed for another set. NO! I did not resort to coil & springs! No even an option. Other than that, I have adored this car since the day it was built. Only a very few complaints.. and not the car itself, but the design. Who's bright idea was it to make the headlights detachable (for bulb changing purposes I guess) lock in place with 3  tin clips? When hitting a hard bump, they wobble. And its noticeable to me and drivers in front of me. Secondly, the easy in/exit moving seat stopped working early on. Dealer said he's surprised I got that far. He told me.. don't last, never did, hasn't seen one work right since day one. I would have had it fixed, but it required full seat replacement.. and cost huge money. Thankfully it stopped in the exact position I use and like. Other than that, I am shooting for 250, thousand. These Town Cars last forever. Gas mileage is good. Rated at 17&25. 6 disc CD changer in the trunk. HUGE trunk. And eve  after 15 years, its still unmistakably Lincoln. People ask.. when are you going to buy a new car.

Bought ours used, 17,000 miles, for half the original price. Car does not hold value, but this is great for buying 1-year-old low mileage vehicle. Very comfortable on long trips, get up to 33 mpg on turnpike driving at moderate speeds, 21 mpg around town, both fantastic for a car this size. Great rearbackup warning system, love the 6- pack CD system. Problems: broken gas cap, broken center consule lid, lack of full-size spare (fixed by buying mag wheel with original tire and mounting in trunk!). Spare needed because took 3 days to get regular tire from dealer to replace ruined tire--imagine that out on a road trip! Car not perfect but fantastic buy bought used.",4.25

The Signature Limited is the ticket. I am only missing the moonroof, which I don't really care about anyway.  If you have to be in traffic, you will love the comfort and the dual a/c. I had 2 1997's (last year of old body style) and really had my reservations when the 98's came out, but the 2005 was pretty much redone. I agree that it needs more horsepower, maybe a 5.4 or turbo 4.6 somewhere in the range of 300 HP. The 238 HP is lacking when you got to get around a slower vehicle. The Towncar has always has been a great roadtrip vehicle. It could use less plastic in the interior...and it does use 87 octane gas. ",4.625

When we owned Cadillacs, we spent most of our time taking them to the dealer for electrical repairs.  Admittedly, Lincoln HQ needs to do something about the service dealers.

After driving Cadillacs for most of my life, they don't come close to this Pearl Blue Lincoln. It has every option that was available for the 2002 models. If you want big performance and power, look for something else. These aren't made for that. Still, at 178,000 miles, I can hit the gas and still squawk the tires.

The quality is more than adequate, nothing compares in the way of interior room and comfort. And no, it's not a rocket off the line, but it's not supposed to be.

A modern spin off of big 1950's full sized cruiser sedans. The bench seat, column shifter, V8, rear wheel drive, body on frame construction, and shear size make it feel like a more refined classic cruiser. This is something I really like about the car. This isn't a car for people who want a Mercedes or BMW, this is a car for people who want a true laid back cruiser.

1728, on 12/04/15 18:00 PM (PST),Doug Strand ,1997 Lincoln Town Car Sedan Executive 4dr Sedan,Got me a Car and she's as big as a Whale!," Bought this to replace my totaled out PT Cruiser.  What a difference!  I had wanted one of these for about the last 12 years.  I consider it the luxury version of the tried-and true Crown Vic cop car or taxi.  Happened to drive by a light blue one a guy was just putting a For Sale sign on, it had been garaged its whole life, serviced by a local dealer, and had only 97K miles.  The body, paint, and overall condition is excellent.  Got it for around 3K.  When I first got it, it needed the window washer sensor replaced, which I easily did myself, and the part was only $16.  Also, it needed the steering idler arm and pitman arm replaced, which cost $280 at a mechanic.  I also replaced the shocks, plug wires, and plugs, and changed oil and filter to Mobile 1 Extended Performance, just to get a fresh baseline.  I also changed the fuel filter and air filter with K & N parts.  It ran fine when I bought it, but runs even smoother now.  This fall, I converted the exhaust to dual exhaust with an H-pipe and eliminated the resonators.  Now, I can hear the engine and she has even more get-up-and-go.  I have been getting around 19 mpg here in town, and about 23 on the highway if I keep it around 70 mph.  I tried running at 55-60 and it was getting 25 mpg, but it is hard for me to drive that slow on the interstate, our speed limit is 80.  It has plenty of power and holds speed on our Montana grades.  It handled a brief spurt to 106 mph easily, and it did not govern out at that speed.  Just put 4 new snow tires on it (Dec '16) and it gets around fine on ice and snow with the factory posi-traction rear end.  My boys love the room in the back seat, their own reading lights, and even the ash trays!  This car rides smoother, has much more interior room, and quicker acceleration than the PT cruiser, and gets close to the same gas mileage, with 8 cylinders instead of 4!  Discovered when driving it last night that it even has little ""headlights"" that light up the road to the sides of your car when you put the blinkers on!  Yes, I have received friendly comments that it looks like an elderly person's car, that is fine with me, I am 53 and may still be driving this when I am 83!  This is a well-made American Classic, with good performance, modern electronics, efficiency, and STYLE.  This car was about $38,000 new, and I feel like I can enjoy it for at least another 100K miles, riding in comfort, safety and style at a small fraction of the new cost.  If this is what you are looking for and can find one that has been well cared for, then I say go for it.  Replacement parts are readily available and affordable.  Update, 6/14/18 - This great car was totaled out by a guy in a truck that pulled out in front of us on an icy road.  Struck his right front wheel at 30 mph.  We were all buckled in and did not get a scratch, but the car was totaled.  I replaced it with a 2000 Signature Touring Edition, which has all the features of the '97 with a more rounded shape (some like it, some don't).

It is so much more comfortable to ride in than newer compact/mid-size cars (which I found to hurt my back after a 700 mile road trip in a rental car). I am forever Lincoln Town Car fan.

I had a transmission cooler installed 2 years ago and have been towing a pop-up camper with it for the past 2 years, no problems at all. This car goes and goes and goes. I have considered trading it in for an explorer or other SUV, but considering how reliable this car is and it's low resale, I would be foolish.  I get 25MPG on the highway doing 70.  Can any other V8 do the same? This may be the last great Ford on the road.  ",4.625

Mileage was 93K, but considering it's a 1997, not bad. I'm a man in my mid 30s, and have already been teased about buying a grandpa car.  But, I am the one whose laughing because this TC will outlast their new $30K+ cars or SUVs and mine is already 8 years old!   This car will easily go 200-300K.

Had only 61,000 miles on it, was a one owner, and been carefully maintained.  Gets great gas mileage, has tons of room and the ride is fantastic.  Paid property taxes on it of only $117 annually.  Gas mileage on the interstate is in the 23-24 range.  Can't imagine a better overall value. Much better vehicle than the more bubble-shaped newer Town Cars.

I have been wanting one more of the 'Classic' style pre '98 versions and recently found another low milage (58K) at the same dealership we bought the '91.  I have never bought an eight year old car that looks and feels as  ""new"" as this does.  It is a dream to drive and in perfect condition!

The dependability of the Ford made the purchase decision an easy one as I appreciated the simple roomy reliable qualities of the panther platform.  The car is a georgeous silver metallic with a black leather interior and extremely classy.  The car drives like a dream and feels like I am sitting on my couch at home, so much room.  When you pull it up into the garage, it's that comfortable that you really don't want to get out, at least that's what the wife says. :)  I have owned it for a year and have had to replace a light bulb, $10.00, a power lift gate latch $300.00, and a relay switch $160.00.  So far I am very pleased with the car for its ride, comfort and space. The relay switch although inexpensive to replace caused havoc for a week giving the dealership fits trying to trouble shoot a mystery battery drain that appeared to come from a light control module but was actually from the air conditioner.  The dealer's customer service far exceeded any I have ever had in the years of repairing vehicles.  Kudos to Lincoln.   I know that as vehicles become more and more technologically advanced as the years progress, my car, built on 1990's technology, will seem like a dud in comparison, and that's just fine with me.  I will have a classic sedan.... dependable, comfortable, simple, with all of the creature comforts you really need.  If any upgrades were to be made, an upgraded aftermarket Bluetooth, navigation setup would be all that's required.  Anticipate keeping this one for the next 6-7 years and if it's still going strong, will push it to 10.  When it's time to replace it, will there really be a car that can match the comfort and roominess because what's on the market now pails in comparrison....we shall see.",4

It is very quiet when inside or out, you can barely hear the engine unless you step on it! My 11- year old daughter's first words after riding in it were, ""It feels so smooth, like we're floating"". All the toys and power stuff still work. I have recently replaced two front tie rods and one ball joint. Not sure what the cause was, but that has been only problem. The steering is now smooth, responsive and quiet. Fuel economy is 20.5 mpg city/highway mix. I was 31 when I bought it, which is probably too young to own one. But the ride! ",4.875

Fallon ,1999 Lincoln Town Car Sedan Signature 4dr Sedan,Lincoln / Signature Series," The vehicle drives great, it's pick up and ability to handle the road is great! Maintenance to Lincoln Town Car is a major part of owning a luxury  vehicle. The weather in New England can be absolutely brutal, not only to a vehicle, but to the roads also. These luxury vehicles aren't made for sleet and snow and especially pot holes. So one should remember to first be aware of what your vehicle (Lincoln) will be contending with when it comes to bad New England weather. You must remember, this is a luxury vehicle, not a truck. If you abuse it, it will cost you. One other thing, don't buy a used Lincoln from up North, go down South, warm climate dictates an over all better treatment of the car.",4.125

1804, on 04/10/16 13:20 PM (PDT),G ,1998 Lincoln Town Car Sedan Cartier 4dr Sedan,Don't want to sell it!!," I bought this 98 Town Car 3 yrs ago at 105,000 miles. It needed an alternator, but it was inexpensive and expected for a then 16 y.o. car. I have just been periodically doing maintenance, including a transmission flush. It still runs great with a now 118,000 miles 3 yrs later. It has not left me stranded and surprisingly starts after sitting in freezing weather for a week or more - without a jump. Technology (heated seats, climate/stereo controls on steering) is fairly par w/ current vehicles. Window regulators DO suck, but they work. I'd consider that a maintenance item for an 18 y.o. car that most people think is fairly new. Overall, if you're going to buy a 15+ year old car - this model is one to buy, as they were manufactured with having in mind that some will be used as a livery/service vehicle. Keep up w/ maintenance and it'll take care of you. These vehicles are inexpensive to maintain, due to its platform being shared w/ a Crown Vic.",5

It did need some work, an intake manifold, 2 coils, and a serpentine belt, but honestly I guess thats what to expect when you purchase an older high end car. All cars break as they age, its that fine vehicles, lincoln, mercedes etc, require more costly parts. All that work cost me $1,500 which I guess isn't horrible. I had to replace one of my front headlamps because it became yellowed and fogged over, got a new one on ebay for $90! VERY easy to replace! pretty sweet deal! My ac compressor just went only $200.

I get 24.5 mpg at 65 mph down the interstate.  I'll get almost 30 if I drive 55 down the interstate.  Trouble free and comfortable.

The TOWN CAR and it's two less expensive siblings are constructed as BODY-On-FRAME.

I have rented Town Cars in the 90's and thought I would rent a new one.  It was just built in June of 2009 with 6000 miles on it.  The engine had power but not the thrust of a Cadillac.  The air conditioning also seemed not as cold as a Cadillac.  The stereo had the Sirius satellite reception, but just had adequate sound.  The seat had lumbar, which previous versions didn't, but the seat cushion on the bottom was flat and needed more cushion.  The ride was a little harsh on bumps, I think the air suspension in the rear is to blame.",3.375

Although it is a decent car, after shopping around I realize that my decision might have been ill advised. Not too long ago I took a look at the Acura RL. Offers over 300 hp from a V6 with all wheel drive. The interior quality is far superior as are the combination of 10 airbags, independent suspension and 200 k + Honda reliability. It's hard to believe but my Towncar uses a body on frame design and a live axle which makes for handling about as agile as a lumbering elephant compared to the Acura.

The one drawback, as anyone may guess, is the fuel economy. This vehicle is fun to drive, is very comfortable, and attracts a lot of attention as the ""baby Navigator"". Dealer service is great, as the 2003 model came with an excellent warranty package. One of my favorite features of this vehicle is the steering wheel- mounted controls for the audio system, A/C, etc. I also like the second-row captain's chairs with the roomy console. The Aviator has a generous cargo capacity with the third-row seats folded flat into the floor.

Comfort is excellent.  The only thing I noticed is that at lower speeds right around 20 miles per hour there is a vibration. It seems to warm up and stop doing this after it drives a while. As you speed up it stops. I’ve read that a new rear 2 piece drive shaft will fix this issue. The 2 piece drive shaft is 433 dollars for the part. In almost all cases this has fixed the problem. Wish Lincoln would make a recall but they have not done so yet. In any event I plan on replacing the driveshaft part from this website. https://www.wholesaleimportparts.com/Lincoln_MKZ_Driveshaft.php?gclid=Cj0KCQiAnuDTBRDUARIsAL41eDrjw9QT5f1Y4eykQY6ROt8YgggtZyArrxXtCoVYsACxGu_-zne2XlcaAgwVEALw_wcB                                                  Hope this review helps. The car is really fantastic. I’m very happy with it. At 120,000 miles it still looks and rides great. I will post again when my part is replaced.Well had the part replaced for free under the used car dealers terms and could not be more happy. The drive shaft did eventually develop a loud banging you could feel and hear in the cockpit. The problem was the original 3 piece drive shaft. It was replaced with a re manufactured 2 piece drive shaft and is back running sweet again. Love the Car and the dealer PAAUTOSELECT.COM was excellent.",5

I bought the car used with 50K miles and now up to 85K. Nothing but regular maintenance at a 7,500 interval. I've owned 2 Hondas, 2 Infinitis, a Mazda, and a chevy.

Looked at all of the luxury models, domestic and import.  The MKZ offers the best value for the dollar.  Recently drove a 2010 as a loaner from the dealer; was not pleased with the recent changes, although cosmetic in most cases.  The only feature worth noting on the 2010 is the dash lighting.  It is exceptional.  But overall, not the vehicle the 2008 is. Also; fuel economy is excellent.  I am able to achieve 33 mpg on the Interstates at speeds up to 70 mph.

Was enjoying the car until we went on a 300 mile trip to Florida.  My wife was the first to say my GMC Sierra  truck rode a whole lot smother with much more comfortable seats.

The design may be bland, but other cars like the Lexus are too. The curves of an Acura are nice, but otherwise it's bland.  I actually like the design. Not elegant, but luxury and strength.

It does not have the rock solid handling of my 2004 Accord Coupe, but actually gets around turns at the same speeds. At $26.5K it was the right choice.

Thought it was time to return to domestic. This car suffers from intermittent problems, like in the 8 months of ownership, the front two windows have rolled down when unoccupied four times. In addition, the seat positioning does not work from the key all the time. Lincoln (Ford) refuses to repair problem that are not seen by the dealer. I have serious problems, the car is not secure with windows rolled down, and Ford is saying if they do not see the problem, they will not fix. I regret not purchasing a Lexus! Never again will I purchase a Ford product.",3.25

Only problem I've had is a very slight pull to the right which I'll take care of at the first service. On a trip from Dallas to Houston I got almost 32 MPG with the cruise set at about 68. Back home which is a bit uphill, and with a strong headwind got 28.5 MPG. Day to day driving which is about 80% city and 20% highway, the gauge has been sitting at 22.7 MPG for about a month. On regular gas! After living with it for a time I think the dash design needs an update (maybe like the new MKS?) but I can live with it. Engine is strong, tranny is super smooth. Trunk is large and the fold down rear seats really have been helpful. Ford has hit a grand slam on this puppy!",4.75

Finally chose MKZ for its costs, fuel (regular) and full set of options. After nearly 4k miles, I couldn't be happier. Plenty of power, comfort and impressive fuel economy. SYNC needs to be linked with correct phone but after that it is wonderful as is the THX system. Car responds better than others tested and I have had more positive comments than I have had with any other car. Great on long trips and agile in city. Trunk clicks open and I've not encountered any problem with it. Everything else has worked perfectly and dealer couldn't be more responsive. Even comparing with the MKS, I'm sure of my choice. ",5

The AWD system really helps out when taking corners or taking off the line. The dashboard is nice a bright at night and the controls are easy to use. The 6 speed shifts very smoothly and never misses a beat. I really love the 600 watt THXII sound system. Every tone is nice and clear. The seats are more than comfortable for long trips. The sync system is simply flawless. The heated and cooled seats are one of the best features on this car. The engine has a hard time getting going off the line but the power really kicks in fast.

The SYNC system is outstanding and  provides the bluetooth capability some reviewers were asking for. On the other hand there are a lot of things that say Ford/Mercury and not Lincoln. The floor mats define cheap. The seats are not comfortable for long periods. The center console is too far rearward to rest elbow when driving. Transmission sometimes gives very sudden/harsh down shifts. And worst of all, there is a very annoying powertrain vibration/resonance at 2000 rpm that produces both an audible noise and tactile feel in steering wheel/gas pedal.  ",4

I was initially drawn by the price, but when I drove it, I was hooked. I have had it 2 months (and 5k miles) and it's by far the best car I have owned insofar as initial quality and handling. The SYNC system really works and rarely misunderstands a command. Oh and get this: I bought the base model-- absolute no additional options.

Lincoln offers far more value for the money than any of the others. Exterior styling is far better than past lincoln's and the interior finally resembles the high level that lincoln of the past was noted for. This car comes with almost everything standard. In Canada where i live it is also sold with 4 year fully paid up scheduled maintenance so all i have to do is put gas in it and insure it.  THX II Certified Audio is a must have.

I researched the heck out of the market (love the actual owner reviews rather than the editors, who only like driver's cars like BMW). Looked into Taurus, Sable, Malibu, Aura, Milan, and MKZ. Got the MKZ due to incredible standard content, price, and importantly (in Texas), the standard air conditioned seats. Bought at cost less $2000 rebate. It's an unbelievable value.

Coming out of an 05 LS I was not considering another lincoln. I shopped cadillac first and also Audi A6. While the A6 was bigger and the Caddy had more awards Lincoln blew both away with the price. Fully loaded this vehicle prices 10-15K below the other two. The ride is quiet and has ample power. The 6 speed automatic transmission is as smooth as could be.

I just got out of an '04 Lincoln LS, which was great.   I wasn't pleased that Lincoln stopped making them and decided to shop the field. I test drove many.  I went with the MKZ and could not be happier. There is really no comparison.  There is nothing that comes close to the MKZ at this price point.   If you're even slightly considering the MKZ, don't hesitate. If not, you should. You will be shocked at how great this car is.

First of all this car is stunning to look at.  I have gotten nothing but great comments from people seeing this car for the first time. The inside is plush with great features at a price that rivals any entry level luxury sedan.  If you are in the market for this car make sure you get a model that has the Microsoft SYNC system built in. The earlier 2008 models did not have this.  Now it is included as a standard feature.

All controls are touch, which can be quite distracting when trying to manipulate while driving. Later year models have dispensed with much of this or have added some knobs which makes it much easier. The touch screen gets smudged with finger prints VERY easily, making it had to work with the screen in bright daylight.

I have put 2000 miles on the car since. I am pleased to find I get 27 mpg overall.  My mpg at 70 - 75 mph averages 32 which is the same as my hybrid. The engine is  very smooth - feels like a V8 - with plenty of power. The car has a very comfortable ride and has may standard features that you pay extra for on other cars. The car handles very well at both high and low speeds. It has a great warranty and service from Lincoln and the dealer. A very large power trunk, intelligent access with push button start which is very convenient. It has ten way power seats both passenger and driver with power lumbar. The driver seat has memory and they are both heated and cooled. It has heated power mirrors with security approach lamps and adaptive LED head lamps. Navigation and rear view camera.

2158, on 09/14/15 20:28 PM (PDT),Doc ,2015 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),"Looker...needs a couple of refinements inTHX, Nav."," Got the reserve trim with multi-contour (multi-inflatable, infinitely customizable, massaging) seats, Luxe Metallic, THX sound system, 10 spoke wheels with painted slots that almost match the Luxe paint.  It's a great looking car especially with the after-market 35% transmissive side and rear window tint.  Very comfortable, very quiet.  Michelin tires were unexpected.  Update:  Michelin tread lasted only 35,000 miles, though.  Ordered Barum Bravuris tires through Discount Tires which were half the price and seem every bit as good as the Michelins.  Got 40.3 mpg freeway miles back from dealer at 70-75 mph.  Been averaging 41 in all around local driving, mostly suburban.  Luxe paint I really like--goes from a pewter gray with a hint of taupe and even gold in certain light angles.  Wife not crazy about color, though.  I thought it was an interesting switch from the silvers and grays that have been out there for many years.  She wanted white, which to me says, ""fleet car"".  Interior is very modern, flat, and simplified with touch screen and finger sensitive volume and fan sliders.  Unfortunately this system has been discontinued.  Fan speed noise is well muffled except at higher settings. (the Toyota Avalon which we also test drove had much noisier fan).  The Avalon also had too European handling (stiff ride for long distance cruising) at least in the high end trim.  Controls were all very configurable.  My only complaints are two:  (1) the THX system is a waste of money in my opinion.  Yeah, it's powerful and can be set up with a booming base if you like, BUT, the THX system adds that center speaker (in addition to the traditional stereo left and right channels).  That works well in a home or movie theater, but first of all you can't get surround sound very easily because most media doesn't contain the surround channels.  Sirius satellite does not broadcast surround to automobile receivers (I called them about this).  FM HD doesn't contain it (I called 2 station engineers).  CD's generally do not have surround encoded although you supposedly can get them.  Reportedly there also are DVD recordings that contain surround sound, but who buys either of these any more?   Some MP3 downloads reportedly have surround sound so that would likely be your only chance of using this feature. You can set your THX system to chose between ""stereo"" and ""surround"".  I heard no difference in any of the media I played through it.  But this is the real killer:  The front center speaker's volume is factory fixed at 2 to 3 times the volume of the left and right speakers.  This pretty well swamps out the stereo effect that you would hear from the side speakers.  They might as well just have left out the left and right channels and had just the center speaker.  You can compensate somewhat by fading the sound mostly to the rear which diminishes the effect of that loud center front speaker.  If you read the forums you'll see that some have just disconnected the front center speaker, and others replaced the side speakers with more sensitive ones in an effort to balance out the center speaker volume.  THX is an extra $1,000 option--forget it--not worth it.  At least listen to the standard Lincoln audio system, then the THX, before you get excited about the THX ""experience"".  Don't be swayed by the demo THX theater 30 sec. playback.  They just juggle the relative volumes of all the speakers to make it sound impressive.  Doesn't pan out anything close in reality.Number (2):  The voice command Nav. system is archaic and updates are expensive. The menus are not intuitive.  Most functions are locked out except when car is stopped.  My $150 Garmin is far superior and updates are free.  Any smart phone will give you much quicker directions these days and it automatically updates.  The screen that comes with the NAV system does give you better control of station/media control and cell phone connection.  Update:  It looks like you can buy the annual Nav update SD card for about $50 from Ebay.  Much cheaper than going through dealer.Performance problem update.  At 35,000 miles in temps above 85 degrees, the gasoline engine started over revving when accelerating.  Normal at temps around 75 degrees.  Also the gasoline engine's rpm's audibly would oscillate slowly up and down a little when driving at constant hwy. speed on level road.  Will take in to dealer next week.",4
2159, on 08/23/15 19:22 PM (PDT),GM2FORD ,2015 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Stunning looks/but bland overall," Although the car presents itself beautifully on the road and is a ""real looker"", there are some things in the interior that need to be changed. I have the rust colored one (not red)  and I get compliments daily on how beautiful the color combination is on the car.  This is my first hybrid and I wanted a luxury car that looked unique and offered luxury amenities that I was used to in my Cadillac CTS and offer really good gas mileage. Well, if you are looking for 39/40mpg, don't bother with this car. I am extremely disappointed in the gas mileage, I am getting 28-30mpg overall, not even close to what Lincoln estimated that the car would get, very disappointing, since I was looking at the Lexus ES300 hybrid as well. The interior is nice, but the seats don't wrap/hug around you, although they are very comfortable and the retractable headrest doesn't adjust forward enough for me to be 100% comfortable. The console storage is awkward to say the least, it has two levels which you have to tweak your hand to get under and place phone keys, wallet, or whatever you want to put under there. It is cramped and tight!The steering for me is a bit ""boaty"", but it still handles well on the road. The pickup isn't as quick as I would like at times, but that is something I will have to live with for the next 2 - 1/2 yrs since I leased mine and that was the smartest thing I could have done!The stereo/Sirius radio is great, the retractable side view mirrors are a nice touch/sunroof/moonroof is nice too. The electric trunk is actually quite roomy considering the battery is in there, so no complaints on storage back there. The rear and front parking sensors are a must and are very helpful even with the backup camera.All in all, I would rate the car a 3.6 out of 5! If the car actually got the 39/40 mpg, I would have rated it around 4.2/5. If you are looking for a beautiful exterior design then this is the car! If you want a car that offers a bit more in the interior, then look elsewhere.",3

The car I traded in for the Lincoln was a 2008 Toyota Prius and although I loved the Prius I was totally disgusted with Toyota's Service Department and never felt they treated me as a valued customer.I had done research on the Lincoln months ago and since I wanted another Hybrid with some Luxury Lincoln fit the bill all the way around.I was impressed with its look and decided to do some hands on research.  I love the look of the BMW, Acura and Audi 5 but overall the Lincoln offered better Quality and used Regular Gas instead of Premium like its competition.",5

The fit and finish is first class and the car is very comfortable. One great feature is the choice of drive mode. If you are wanting a comfortable ride and ""every day"" style driving, then choose 'Comfort' Mode. If you are wanting more power, faster acceleration, and much more aggressive handling and steering with a stiffer ride, then choose 'Sport' Mode. And of course, you can change modes at any time. In either mode you will be very happy.",5

Picked up a low mileage used '15 for half the sticker when new. This car is fantastic. It's like a rolling sanctuary. Super quiet ride, way more power than necessary (4 cyl turbo), with the back seats down there is plenty of room for luggage.  Had several people comment what a gorgeous car this is.

Very comfortable, seats fit like a glove, everything at your fingertips. Gets lot of compliments. We have had 3 Marks and 1 Town car but this is so exquisite. Love the car but only one tiny drawback... there are no hand grips on either side and having a destroyed back they sure are needed. Otherwise Plus Ten.

There is no doubt that the Lincoln is missing the excitement factor of instant torque, but the 'fuel' economy is a negligible savings, and the  overall vehicle cost is night/day. I love the fit and finish of the Lincoln, and the overall ride quality is excellent. The car is costing me about $65/month for gas (1k miles @40mpg /$2.40-$2.50gal), a Tesla would cost about $30/month for electricity (about 250-300Kwh @.10Kwh). To compare lease payments, my numbers are about $600/month difference ($350-400 vs $900-$1k/month over 36 months 12k mile lease). I expect right now it's pretty easy to get a great deal on a hybrid, since sales are slumping. Those 15mpg SUV's are flying off the lot.For a luxury car, the Lincoln is an excellent value, and I can't really compare it to the Ford Fusion... it's simply a nicer car inside/out (I was impressed by the quality of the current Ford Fusion before looking at the MKZ). I do find it crazy how much the price of the car can balloon once you start adding features. I got the base hybrid version, which has plenty of features for me. Features I wish I had ordered:Sun Roof OR full glass roofBlind Spot indicatorsAdaptive Cruise Control",5

When I first got it, I was not too impressed, but as time went on I liked it more and more. I have a high end Lexus at home, so I was spoiled and hard to please, but now I miss the MKZ. I will exchange my Lexus for the MKZ. I was amazed that I was using regular gas and I was getting plenty of power and 32 miles on the highway with 3 people and plenty of heavy stuff in the trunk. I opened the hood, but without taking the motor cover it was not possible to figure out how many cylinder the MKZ had. I liked this car a lot, I liked the handling better than the Lexus I have, the technology, the backup camera etc were great. The driver window would only move up a little and stop, so I had to push the button several times to open or close it. I could not tell if it was malfunctioning, or if it was custom programmed inadvertently by myself, there was no manual in the glove compartment, I guess because it was rental.",5

The plastic seat support broke and had to be replaced but still catches when I get out. The left front automatic window is scraping and the dealership only lubricates it.  It  makes a noise and leaves marks when  raised and lowered. Big problem since new:  delayed AC activation...Lincoln said this is the way it was made.  The AC does not activate for 30-45 seconds.

We are considering buying the car at lease end, since we are so satisfied with it.  We also lease a 2008 Cadillac CTS, which is vastly improved over the 2004 CTS it replaced.

I tested an Acura TL, a BMW 328xi, and an Infiniti G35x.  Each vehicle was good, but none of the competitors moved me:  the TL felt like an Accord; the 3-series drives great but it's so common now; the Infiniti was nice, but it too is becoming common.  After the 1st test drive of the Lincoln, I was sold.  The exterior is subtle and classy. The interior is easily the best in its class. The car is more luxury than sport, but it's not boring.  The stereo is great. Every day I have random people stop me to compliment me on the car.  I am very pleased with this car.  It is the nicest car I've ever purchased.",4.875

The THX certified stereo has nice sound. Hours of MP3s can be loaded into the 6 disk player. I have to say, for the price, I feel you can't beat the options (standard or optional) that are available.

While the MKZ is AWD, it has less power and a smaller V6 engine.  The build quality and the materials is way below sup bar.  The hard plastics and the gaps in between the interior and exterior panels is ridiculous. The wood trim looks fake, the dashboard has this twin look going on, that seems as if you could move the steering wheel and gauges over to the other side.  Speaking of gauges, the retro looking dash is not cool, its very cheap looking!  Note to Lincoln: Hire some better designers and stop looking to the past.  This will be a long 3yr lease.",3.125

Interior is as advertised. I like the retro feel of it. The seats are a little lower and therefore a little harder to get out of when compared to our Park Avenue. Would be nice to have some way to close the trunk other than grabing the sheet metal and hoping your hand has a good grip. The trunk opens wide and the lid itself points straight up. Akward I feel.

AWD is a must if you live in a snowy region. The transmission is always in the right gear and it is extremely smooth. This is a fun to drive car for me, and at the same time has plenty of luxury and comfort features such as standard heated seats. The quality of the MKZ is up to or better than the Japanese offerings.

I purchased my car in November 2006 and received the 05 map, the new 07 map was released in December of 06.

Trying to be patriotic with my first purchase of an American car in quite a long time. The difference is shocking!  No comparison. My wife's minivan has a smaller turning radius than this car.  The transmission is primitive and pops into gear upon a medium to hard acceleration.  The car feels light with no road grip. The sound system (I got the premium THX II) is just plain awful.  The xenon headlights are only fair. This car's gas mileage is only moderately better than a full- size American SUV. The only redeeming quality about the car is the exterior appearance.

Fuel economy is still down from what I would expect, but this car blows away the competition for the price.  I love the light tan interior and light colored wood.  I was surprised that the moon roof, when closed, doesn't add interior noise as I feared it would.  I have the THX-II radio in this car and although it sounds very good, I am disappointed in the bass level, especially with two 6 X 9"" ""sub- woofers"" with that spacious trunk as an enclosure.

The MKZ is quiet, has a smooth, compliant ride and outstanding mileage. I'm averaging around 38 mpg in mostly city driving, but I don't use ECO mode because it makes the car feel too sluggish. Sync 3 is superior to MyLincoln Touch and Android Auto is helpful, but I wish Waze was accessible in the app. The driver's seat feels a little firm, but otherwise the car is very comfortable.

American cars have really improved. This is one comfortable-quiet-smooth ride. You get so much more for your money. I am averaging 40 MPG although I am a conservative driver. The only downside to this car is that the acceleration is a bit on the slow side, although that is not a problem for me personally. Its like driving with the eco on all the time. And the other downside is the very small trunk area and no spare tire. But everything else is fantastic. From the very first look and test drive I knew this was the car for me.

Overall, I remain satisfied with my Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.   In spite of some minor fit and finish issues, the styling of this sedan really stands out against a tired landscape of look-alike sedans from other car manufacturers.   Fuel economy remains rock solid between 40 and 41 mpg in mixed city/highway driving.   ADAS features for accident avoidance, parking, and maintaining driver awareness have been great.  Quiet comfort sticks out as a real differentiator compared to other vehicles in the entry level luxury sedan segment. The biggest issue with maintaining the vehicle has been the synchronization of firmware updates across the numerous vehicle subsystems within the car.   Sync 3 had a lot of bugs at first, but three firmware updates later, all of the infotainment and navigation features appear to be working normally.   Unfortunately, I had to make repeat visits to the dealership to stabilize other subsystems.  The worst problem I have encountered  was a drained battery that stranded my car in my own garage.  Lincoln corrected the battery drain issue with a firmware update to the door control module.  Although I have experienced a few warranty issues, my local Lincoln dealer and the Lincoln concierge service have done a great job of addressing my concerns.  I would still recommend the MKZ Hybrid as a solid value compared to other vehicles in its class.   However, prospective buyers should strongly consider purchasing Lincoln's extended warranty for this vehicle.ORIGINAL REVIEWI purchased a 2017 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Reserve w/ Technology package in September 2016.   Purchase price was $8k - $20k below comparable European and Japanese alternatives.   I have thus far driven the car about 2200 miles, about 80% highway driving and 20% city driving.   Average MPG is around 40 - 42 mpg.   Acceleration is adequate in most situations.    The smoothness of the powertrain, well-tuned suspension, and the quiet cabin at highway cruising speeds really attracted me to this vehicle.   Exterior appearance is impressive and fairly unique, but some of the exterior trim pieces are made of low quality plastic.  Quality of interior materials is very good - particularly the wood trim and leather upholstery.  ADAS features including adaptive cruise, accident avoidance, blindspot monitoring, backup-assist and lane-keep assist are very useful in day-to-day driving.  Lincoln's driver assistance features are unobtrusive until really needed. The on-board infotainment system is light years ahead of Toyota and BMW in terms of usability, but the Sync 3 system has bugs around IPod indexing, accuracy of on-board clock, Android Auto compatibility, and stability of mobile apps.   One bright spot in Sync 3 is Lincoln's NAV system coupled with Sirius traffic information, which is a real godsend for avoiding heavy traffic at rush hour.   Unfortunately, the stability issues I've encountered in Sync 3 appear to extend to other vehicle subsystems.  I presently suspect electrical gremlins are lurking in the interior lighting system and the sound system, although all installed equipment is performing normally for the moment.   As long as reliability holds up, backed in part by Lincoln's long base warranty, I expect I will remain satisfied with this vehicle.   I would recommend this vehicle to a friend or a family member, with reservations noted above regarding reliability.",4

The car wouldn't start 2 times and needed roadside assistance to jump the battery. The stereo sounds great, but Sirius drops channels frequently even in well populated areas with great satellite visibility. The rear cabin light has a weird flicker/pulsating condition. Every time we bring it to the dealer for service they say they can't duplicate the problem. I took a video of the flickering light and they said that's the way it works. That's the way it works???? A $55,000+ car that has lost charge twice and has a flickering interior light sure sounds like an electrical problem to me. They replaced my new car's battery yesterday, now it's a wait and see game. Other than that, Lincoln said they can't help me.  I've never had such an experience with a new car ....ever. Now, I know why so many people buy foreign cars.",2

In Midnight Sapphire Blue Metallic, it is absolutely stunning with the two-tone interior that comes with the Driver Sport Package. I really didn't see me driving a domestic car let alone a Lincoln as my most recent cars were all imports: Audi S4, Volvo S60 R-Design, Infiniti M37 Sport and Infiniti M35 Sport. Nearly went for an Audi S5 Sportback as a replacement but the change from a supercharger to turbo was a little disappointing. The MKZ intrigued me especially the shape; much like an Audi S7 but thousands of $$$ less. A test drive absolutely sold me. I wanted something a little bigger than the Audi but would still go like stink and handle well. Lincoln absolutely has this car dialed in. There have been gripes about the quality of the interior materials and coming from an Audi which I think has one of the best interiors, I really can't complain. The comfort, technology, performance and overall satisfaction with the vehicle are all there for me. The upgraded Revel sound system is a ridiculous amount of money but worth every penny if you love your music as I do. The MKZ could use a 7 or 8 speed transmission to help with the fuel economy but if I was looking for great fuel economy I'd be driving a Prius. The best sleeper luxury performance sedan on the road.

I have had 3.  A towncar in 2000, a continental in 2002 and now an MKZ. My happiness with the car will grow a lot when I learn how to use all the bells and whistles. the blue tooth and phone features are top shelf and to my surprise the garage door opened after my first try at programing it. This car feels very similar to my Continental. Even with the 4 cyl motor it performs like it too. I really like the Bentley style grill. I think I will be happy with this car.

It retailed for $45,000.  The twin turbo 4 cyl is fast and  I average 25 MPG.  It is black velvet with the optional rims.  The Revel sound system surpasses anything I have ever heard in car audio.  The technology is easy and after 6 months of use, it has worked flawlessly.  If you plug in your phone to the USB port, you never pick it up while driving...the car does everything for you including read and respond to your texts messages and play any song on Apple itunes.  All you do say the title of the song.  I have had a lot of fun going back into the 1980's and 1990's music.  Front seats are very adjustable. It lacks the comfort of the Towncar which I previously owned.   Stirring wheel is telescopic.  Ambient lighting at night is cool- kids especially love it.  When you approach the car at night, it lights up all around and shines the Lincoln welcome mat down on the ground on each side of the car.  Rain sensor and blind spot protection are great!  The cruise is interactive...and I will never go back to regular cruise control.  The pedestrian warning system as activated several times and it makes me feel safe.  People around town stop me so they can look at this beautiful car.  It gets attention.  Real wood trim too and LED lights are beautiful.  And the 2017 MKZ along with the Audi A4 are the quietest cars on the road this year.  It has noise cancellation system...so very quiet even at 80MPH.  I got the Terracotta seats and they really stand out against the black trim and enhance the walnut wood trim.",5
2263, on 11/22/17 06:32 AM (PST),BobH ,2017 Lincoln MKZ Sedan Reserve 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),GETTING CLOSER," This marks my 5th MKZ. The first one came about after having owned most of the euros like Mercedes, Jags, BMWs etc.  I was playing golf with a friend from Germany who had been here all of 3 years. When I saw him pull up in a Ford SUV I was shocked since his previous car was a BMW. His comment?  ""Well, I figured since I now live in America, I will support America."" It certainly made me think and after a couple months bought a Lincoln MKZ and never stopped. The first one I had surely was a step down in quality, comfort, bling etc. etc., but with each passing year, I kept noticing continued improvements while the price point stayed within reason. Now, this 2017 is getting closer to luxury but I DO have to point something out about SYNC 3. What HAD BEEN an easy to read TRAFFIC REPORT on Travel Link, is now absolutely ludicrous. It's near impossible to read and some of the listings even have horizontal scroll bar arrows to read the rest of the line. Try doing that while driving and you'll be the NEXT traffic incident. THAT is down right ridiculous.  HOWEVER...improvements have been made with knobs instead of sliders on the dash which makes audio and climate far easier to adjust. Seems too like there's a little more padding for the knees on either side and the interior beige color is better. After having had 4 and now my 5th, I still love things like regular gas, speed filling at the pumps, low brake dust output on wheels, (the euros are the worst for that), still a tad more quieter inside as well. The seats are generally comfortable but could probably be nudged up a click to be perfect. The angle of the NAV screen on the MKZ is nice.......BUT.....because of same, a mid-day sun can make it difficult to see. I could be wrong but it seems like they increased some lumens which helps. Also noticed the touch screen doesn't seem to leave as many fingerprints as it used to.  Finally, I can't say enough about that 4 cyl. Eco-Boost engine. I just wish my Dad were still around because he would be in shock by how smooth, quiet and fast a 4 cyl. could be. In closing, were it not for the inane nuances of the SYNC 3 and especially with Travel Link Traffic display, I'd give it a 4.5 at least. FIX IT LINCOLN....it's ludicrous!",4

Also included are the panoramic sunroof, massage seats and the $1,080 stereo system.  With a MSRP total well above $56,000, I was a bit reluctant to make the move.  Bought it anyway.  A perfectly amazing ""Hot Rod Lincoln"".  0-60 = 4.6 seconds.  Back in the day (early to mid-fifties), Lincoln ruled the stock car racing circuit; today, this car would be a major contender.  It is an amazing set of wheels.  Very quiet and peppy in ""D"", but just roars in ""S"".  Value for money is exceptional.  Out does many BMW's, Audis, and Mercedes in performance, and certainly price.  All things considered, this car is very much worthy of your consideration.  Performance is unparalleled!July 2018:  It just gets better!Further on my initial review and update:  I failed to mention that the OEM Michelin tires are awful!  Totally inadequate for the car's power and sophisticated technology.  I switched to Perelli P-Zero summer tires (slightly up-sized to 255/40R19 100V XL), and the change is remarkable; no wheel spin, and much less torque steer.  I use Perelli winter Sottozero 3 between October - March.  I chose the P-Zeros because my 2015 Mustang was delivered with them, and they are outstanding albeit expensive.  If you have the 3.0 AWD, its well worth the money to upgrade your tires!  ...and if you live where it snows, winter tires are a huge plus.",5
2268, on 07/13/17 19:31 PM (PDT),Paul ,2017 Lincoln MKZ Sedan Reserve 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Never thought I would buy a Lincoln," Great value in the MKZ.  It's a perfect size sedan that's very comfortable.  Others in his price range are noticeably smalller.  The 2.0 turbo 4 has plenty of power for normal driving.  Unlike other turbo 4's that I've driven this engine has power from a dead stop.  Very little turbo lag.  Although the 400 HP V6 was tempting, I decided to stick with the 4 because I was concerned about how bad the mileage would be in N.Y. stop and go traffic.  I was also on the fence about the  AWD but I have to admit it's nice to have zero wheel spin when pulling away from a dead stop in the rain.  If your more interested in 0-60 times or how many G's  the car pulls on a skid pad then this car probably isn't for you.  As a former muscle car guy acceleration was once very important to me.  30 years later however it's now all about comfort for me.    If you read the reviews the MKZ gets a lot of criticism because it shares the platform with the Ford Fusion (Which also happens to be a great car).  My view on this is who cares.  I never see the same criticism about Honda parts in Acura's or VW parts in Audi's.  No regrets at all.  Very happy with our choice.  Fantastic looking car that stands out from the crowd. Worth taking a look at even if you never thought about a Lincoln.Here's my update.  It's been a little over a year and we still love our MKZ.  We've only been back to the dealer one time for the first oil change.  No issues at all.  This car really doesn't get a fair shake from the reviewers.  Great value for the money.  Every other car in this price range is substantially smaller.  I don't however think a loaded or black label edition of this car is worth the money.  We got every option that we wanted and still kept it well under 40K.  A black label edition can run close to 60K.  Otherwise I would strongly recommend taking a look at the MKZ.Here's another update.  Weve owned the car over a year and a half and have about 12k on the odometer.  Still don't understand why this car gets terrible reviews.  No problems at all.  Great value for the money.  No regrets at all.",5

2270, on 04/30/17 06:47 AM (PDT),oldsnwbrdr ,2017 Lincoln MKZ Sedan Select 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Quiet Luxury," I rented a Continental recently and have driven (and just leased) an MKZ, and Lincoln is doing a great job building quiet luxury cars.  It's refreshing that they aren't chasing BMW owners intent on 0-60 times, 60-0 braking, hard cornering, etc.  This car isn't about that--if you prefer old school Lincoln, Lexus, etc. I think you will really enjoy this car.  I test drove multiple versions before finally settling on a ""basic"" Select model with the Select Plus and Climate packages, and the moonroof.  I drove the V6 and really enjoyed it, but I'm coming out of a Fusion with the 1.5 Ecoboost engine, and I find the 2.0 engine powerful and smooth enough for my needs (most importantly it doesn't sound like a whiny 4 cylinder).  I also thought I might want the Revel stereo upgrade, but the bass was so strong that it caused the driver's door to rattle annoyingly, which overrode the improved sound that the system delivered, so no go there.  I also found the multi-contour seats in one model I drove to be less comfortable than the base seats.  I really enjoy the Sync 3 system much more than MyFordTouch, but even though I have the latest version installed (2.0), the system has some bugs.  My car has Apple CarPlay but it requires the phone to be plugged in and I actually prefer the look of the Sync 3 interface anyway.  I disabled CarPlay in the system menu, which allows some apps (like Pandora) to appear on the Sync 3 app menu.  When I press Pandora to play, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  In addition, when I want to play my podcasts, I was not able to use Sync 3 to switch from one downloaded podcast to another, when I tried to play another one it wouldn't work.  Finally, even though I'm (supposedly) connected to my home wifi network, every time I manually check for a Sync 3 update the system just spins and spins, never confirming whether I have the latest version.  While I find the interior quality of the MKZ excellent, I wish I had more color choices to choose from than black or beige.  I really liked the terra-cotta color available in the Reserve models but it can't be had with the Select.  That said the interior quality standards fall short of the Germans.  All of that said, I really enjoy driving this car and all of the other Lincolns I've been in recently.  There are good deals to be had, definitely check them out!Updates at 8,500 Miles:Still loving the car for it's quiet and smoothness.  I came out of a Fusion which was an exceptional car, but the MKZ truly takes the experience on another level of luxury.  With the supremely comfortable (base) seats the car is made for relaxing long-distance drives.  I play with the driving modes once in awhile (I push ""S"" when passing"" but I've never bothered to shift manually).Mileage is about what I expected, mid to high 20's.  Should be better though, I suspect the issues are with the transmission and the weight of the car.  In 6th gear the engine is turning 2,500 rpm which is a little high.  On the freeway I drive 70-79 mph.I follow some of the MKZ discussion forums and learned how to upgrade Sync 3 to version 3.0.  I did that a couple of weeks ago and the system seems a little less buggy.  I can't figure out how to save my current position as a favorite in the GPS; if there is a way to do it, it's not intuitive.  I'm still using the Sync 3 interface exclusively and have shut off Apple Car Play, even though the Apple Maps are much improved with iOS 11.Base stereo in the MKZ... unlistenable.  Especially with Sirius radio which is even more so.  Lincoln should follow suit with Lexus and install the XM satellite receivers which sound far better.  The base MKZ stereo is the same as the base Fusion stereo.  At a minimum, Lincoln should install the Sony system from the Fusion Titanium which includes HD ratio.  I wish I had upgraded to the Revel stereo (note for 2018, the MKZ Reserve model now includes the Revel stereo as standard... good decision, Lincoln!)Tires are awful.  I've noted wheelspin and loss of grip on wet roads.Car has been completely trouble-free for the first 8,500 miles.  Despite my gripes I love the car.",5

It's an outstanding value in the entry-level luxury car field as it stands... but I purchased a dealer's service loaner with a few thousand miles on it, saving a nice chunk of change. It looks, performs and even smells like a new car.  To top it off, the 2.0 turbo runs on regular gas!  There's also the bonus of owning a vehicle made in the US by union labor.  If there's any drawback, it could use a bit more power when accelerating, but it's hardly a concern, given all the positives.  As a previous owner of foreign luxury vehicles, I'm glad I made the decision I did.   UPDATE: Six months' ownership, and nothing has changed ... great car.  The infotainment system is outstanding and very user-friendly, especially the navigation. Living in Texas, with its triple-digit summers, the air-conditioned (not just ventilated) seats are a blessing ... and not even available on much of the competition.  Generally speaking, you'd have to shell out another ten grand to own a similar vehicle ... and just about all other 2.0 turbos require premium fuel.  Yep, this one's definitely a keeper.",5

In my subjective testing of 15-30 minute test drives, each of these cars led or tied a category...The Lincoln was never a serious contender in any category. Cheap interior materials. A $1000+ top-of-the-line sound system that you swear is old fashioned boomboxes stuffed into the door panels. Significant squat upon moderate braking. Confidence un-inspiring body roll in curves. Over-boosted steering. At least they finally got the exterior styling correct as the new grill is beautiful. Significant road noise, could be the tires. I so wanted to like this car, and kept telling myself it stickered $15-$25,000 less than the others, but even at that price point I wouldn't pull the trigger as there are many other options in that price range that offer an engaging driving experience.",2

This car is a gem that puts a smile on my face every time I look at it. It makes me feel good to dive it no matter what kind of day I have had. This is truly a luxury vehicle, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Anyone looking for a vehicle in this class should give the MKZ a tryout.",5
2274, on 01/03/17 19:58 PM (PST),Joe ,2017 Lincoln MKZ Sedan Reserve 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),3.0 Hot Rod Lincoln," Hi, so the site didn't, give me the chance to enter the right model. I now have about 2,000 miles on a 2017 MKZ 3.0L V6 AWD sedan. I'm pleasantly surprised as I didn't have a chance to drive this combination when I ordered it. I drove the 4 cylinder turbo, and it was Ok, but certainly not exciting. I compared mainly against the Audi A4 and the BMW 330i. The Audi was a bit underwhelming to tell the truth. All of the reviews rave about the interior, but I just wasn't convinced. I really disliked the nav screen sitting up on top of the instrument panel. I loved the idea of ordering a 330i with a manual transmission, but realized the resale would be poor.  The BMW interior didn't really impress either, though there is a kind of throwback look to it that I liked. The two BMW dealers I visited were also less than accommodating. They pushed leasing, while I prefer to buy. Anyhow, I wound up ordering the MKZ Reserve with the big engine, and I'm very pleased.  High tech safety features, very quick acceleration, and I have yet to find a flaw side or out.Ok so with nearly 10,000 miles I have had a couple things needing repair. First was a buzzing noise from one of the speakers in the drivers door. That was repaired by the dealer to my satisfaction. The dealer claimed a clip of some sort was missing or defective. The other problem is a power window that won't properly roll up. It's as if it's sensing an object in the way. So it rolls up 80% of the way, and goes back down. The dealer had to reprogram a module of some sort to let it operate properly.  If you nudge the window up slowly, it would close, but not automatically. I'm glad that's fixed. The dealer gave me a loaner and oil change as promised.Overall, I'm still very pleased. By the way, I drive very steady and fairly conservatively on the daily freeway commute. The 27 MPG is not a mistake. That's with AC now in summer, and the occasional full throttle blast when necessary.Update as of 1/5/2018: I now have just over 19,000 miles on the car, and I'm still very pleased.  I'm still averaging 27 MPG in mostly urban freeway driving, and that's on regular unleaded.  The 3.0L V6 engine has more than enough power for me, so only on a couple occasions have I filled with premium unleaded just to see if there was a big performance increase.No reason to return the car to the dealer for any service work, as I'm now doing full synthetic oil changes elsewhere.If I was to criticize anything, it would be the rather narrow opening of the trunk lid.  The fastback design of the rear window forces a smaller opening.  Normally it shouldn't be a problem, but I was trying to transport a few of those big plastic storage bins, and had to fold the rear seats down and load through the rear doors.Overall, I'm still very pleased.July 2018 with 29,000 miles. I needed to return the car for service as the oil pan required a new seal. There was a very minor leak, but the dealer was very accommodating with free loaner and of course, oil change. So although I was somewhat inconvenienced, I realize it’s a new engine design miles of mostly highway travel is 27.2...better than expected.",5
2275, on 11/29/16 09:06 AM (PST),JohnMatt ,2017 Lincoln MKZ Sedan Premiere 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),My First Lincoln in 62 Years," I've driven many cars during that time including Acuras, BMWs and Mercedes' recently.  Their prices have risen too high for what you get, and the styling is nothing to cheer about (2017 MB  has an IPAD glued to the dashboard).  When I saw the 2017 Lincoln MKZ I was curious because the styling was fresh and the price was right.  No undesired extras that were built into my choice, keeping the price reasonable.  And the salesman I used was completely knowledgeable about the models and accessories so he could answer every question I raised, and the sales discounts happened to be available during the negotiation.    The car is just what I wanted, although with a few  negatives.  It is spacious front and back with good seating quality (I don't use leather seats).  The trunk is large and holds my golf clubs easily, or several large suitcases.  The turbo-charged 4-cylinder engine (245 HP) has adequate acceleration and highway comfort, but feels a bit strained somewhat when trying to accelerate at high speeds.  The fuel recommended is regular (87), but I use mid-grade (89) for better performance.  The car has Ford SYNC for music and other electronic adjustments, which works well.  It has several USB and 12-volt ports for the smart phone users, as well as Sirius if desired.  One issue with me is the small buttons on the bottom of the steering wheel for answering phones using Bluetooth and setting the cruise control.  Hard to select and use when driving.  Uses a smart key fob remote for starting, entering and leaving, and pushbutton gear selectors (P,D,N,R).  This car is not a sports car, so don't expect that.  The 400 HP V6 may satisfy the power, but handling might not be there. I hope this description helps with your decision to buy or not.",4
2276, on 10/25/16 09:45 AM (PDT),Mrpushrod ,2017 Lincoln MKZ Sedan Reserve 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Should help the Lincoln brand," I test drove many vehicles. When it came down to it I liked the interior, ride and comfort better in the MKZ. And for $55k it is hard to find a creamy smooth 400HP engine. The other midsized luxury vehicles felt inferior. As if the Lincoln had a higher-end quality interior. Multicontour seats well thought out, leather and padded surfaces felt soft and supple. It feels like the Lincoln brand is trying harder since they have to thwart off the sport of American brand bashing that is constantly read in publications such as Consumer Reports. Furthermore, I test drove and ordered a MKZ with the Drivers Package that has dynamic torque vectoring which intelligently applies power to the rear wheels when driving aggressively. With the package on a test ride (not pushing to limits) I did not feel any torque steer or that much understeer typically associated with FWD and some AWD vehicles. And to boot in my opinion the road isolation & ride felt better in the Lincoln than a Caddy, Mercedes or BMW. Looking for true compromise, I passed on the summer only tires this time around. So if there is some impact from having AWD vs RWD it will most likely only be noticed at the track or by very aggressive drivers. That said 99.999999% of the audience buying these vehicles today are not going to the race track. They are looking for stable good grip on a variety of road conditions along with easy control and sure footed steering feel. That’s what the average Joe wants behind the wheel and Lincoln delivers. The AWD with torque vectoring does its job and keeps torque steer under control and steering feel is precise; easy to thread the car through a needle. BTW, I am not an ignorant just looking to be the expert and to hear myself speak. I know the difference between the Lincoln and a true sport sedan and opted for the Lincoln. My other vehicles are; a Corvette, Pontiac G8 GT (RWD 6 liter), F150 and Road Glide. The only cons besides the Lincoln name: scant rear head room, smaller rear seat than some, and weight distribution with AWD (not 50-50% front and rear like a RWD sedan). One more comment. Consumer Reports issue with the push button gear selector is really a joke. Anyone that is off the baby bottle will not mind the change. I actually think it makes a lot of sense to free up the console. Hope other brands do the same. A common solution amongst brands through committee would be best",5

Not cheap at $3300 but oh so worth it.  With the 400hp engine and AWD this thing is an Audi/BMW clone for tens of thousands less.  Spent over an hour test driving it.  Came back to the dealership and ordered my own.  Left out the luxury package ($4400) and some other stuff.  MSRP came in at just under $50K.  Not an Audi or a BMW but certainly close enough especially when factoring in the MSRP differential.  Service costs will be dramatically less than with the Germans cars (I had 4 Audis over the course of 30 years).  For 2017 Lincoln is offering to pick up your car at your home or place of business for service and return it to you.  A nice touch.  Nothing I will take advantage of as my local dealer is less than 4 miles from my house.  My local Audi dealer was 30 miles away.  The car is fast, quiet, comfortable, well put together, no wind noise, etc.  Seems to be a great alternative to its German and Japanese counterparts.",5

2288, on 01/17/16 17:40 PM (PST),Steve ,2012 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Best Used Value On the Market," I bought the car six months ago with 30,000 miles on it,  still under warranty.  I had a new, long commute and wanted something comfy that wouldn't use a ton of fuel.  It was obviously very well cared for, and equipped with every available option, including the dealer added remote start.  The ride is quiet, and very solid, not as luxurious as the MKS I had a few years ago, but very nice for its size.  BTW-this is not a big car.  I drove the 2016 MKZ as a loaner car and is noticeably larger.I changed out the original Michelins for Continentals due to a road hazard problem; the Conti's have been great.  It's enjoyable to drive, but if you get aggressive on a curve you're reminded that this car was built for cruising.  Not a problem, just a characteristic.Couple  annoyances : the driver's seat has required constant adjustment trying to find a comfortable seating position, but I've finally found it.  Headroom is at a premium due to the sunroof.  That's about it for limitations.  It runs smooth as can be, looks good and delivers outstanding mileage.  SYNC is just fine when you learn to use it.; I had an MB and the COMAND system wasn't better, just different.  While I wouldn't have bought this new at $40++, as a used car this was a great choice.Update after 18 months: : headroom issue didn't change  Otherwise this has been a great car. Over 41 mpg in warm weather, minus 10% in winter.",4
2289, on 11/18/15 20:16 PM (PST),tuko ,2012 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Still Nice Hybrid," Purchased 2012 MKZ Hybrid with around 30,000 miles off lease. Certified pre-owned with extended Lincoln warranty. Pros: Great gas mileage averaging 40.5mpg since purchase. Will get upwards of 50+mpg strictly city but ""only"" high 30s on the highway. Goes down in winter or with A/C on. Crystal white exterior with beige interior makes this a nice looking car but hard to keep clean.  Ok ride on smooth roads but a little choppy on rough roads but I've been spoiled with my old Town Car. Main advantage over a 2013 or newer MKZ Hybrid is the size of the gas tank. 2012 was last year for a 17.5 gallon tank which means I maybe fill it up once a month. Previously owned a 2013 Fusion Hybrid with only a 13 gallon tank so needed to fill up more often despite similar gas mileage. Cons: Battery does intrude on trunk space. No indicator on dash to tell you if head lights are on which is weird. Nav option, sun-roof and rear camera are nice options. Overall, wife and I like the car. If I need to haul lots of stuff, there's always my Town Car. Would buy another one if they still made them.",4

The drive train is near flawless and does what you want it to do.  It accelerates, holds 80 if you set the speed control for that, and glides at any speed relatively quietly and very smoothly.  The Synch system was clearly designed by people who knew they'd never have to drive the car and put up with it.  In every case, it defaults to the worst possible option.  Most screens are so user hostile, even with the Owner's Manual in front of you, you won't easily set whatever you want to do.  There are endless buttons and screen prompts to push.  I still can't figure out what happens when you push the phone button on the steering wheel, but it's near useless.  Ditto the navigation system.  I use a stick to the windshield GPS, but to the amazement of every passenger.  The real issue is the climate control system.  It performed flawlessly all winter, then when summer arrived, I discovered that whoever designed the vents is 5'2"" tall and really does not like people.  The vents are stopped at mid level, they cannot be raised to your face or over you.  The same with right left adjustment, very limited travel.  The real amazement is there is no way to throttle down airflow.  Ford should have looked at any other car on the planet to learn how to make vents.  This may sound insignificant, but on a really hot day, you'll be fighting with them non stop to get air where you want it, and failing every time.  Each of my Toyotas, Prius and Solara before that, had outstanding climate control. Car was comfortable in all weather conditions.  That a Lincoln is so uncomfortable in hot weather is a true amazement.  Test drive the car on a 95 degree day before you write out a check for one.",3

It does not excel at anything and is very predictable.   The exception is the Sync infotainment.   Specifically the Applink function is hit or miss each day.   I can blame my cellphone as it updates itself weekly or monthly, and Sync never updates.  However, it always fixes itself when you disconnect the battery and reconnect.   Other than that,  I recommend you get this model used as it somehow depreciates to a lower amount than the same year Fusion, which it is based on.    Maintain it and keep it clean.   Lastly, use all the money you save with zero repairs and get a nice sports car, motorcycle, or boat you can have fun with on the weekends.Update 9-11-16:  It is still a great car.  Sync is a dud - at least Bluetooth works.  Can't be bothered with disconnecting battery cable.  Paint and interior holding up perfectly.  Very quiet, very comfortable. Handling not as great as a BMW but did not pay alot for the car.   No repairs - definitely a keeper.Update 9-12-17:  Still a very good car.  Sync is better since I installed a software update.

I decided I like the way Ford did it, and I found a good deal on a used Mercury Milan. I liked that car so much, when it came time for another one I decided I wanted another Ford - with features. Adaptive cruise was important, rear camera, blind spot monitoring, parking sensors, lane keep assist - these were all things I knew I wanted. Oh, and leather upholstery. And a good stereo system. I looked and Ford didn't have it, at least under the Ford badge. But Lincoln did. After a few months of searching I found an off-lease Lincoln MKZ with Reserve package, Technology package, THX sound system, and for good measure the seats with Active Motion (a massage feature). As a 2016, buying in 2017, I paid about half the price new, and I got it as a Lincoln CPO, which extended the warranty to 100K miles. I've had it for several weeks now, and I love this car. It's rated at 41mpg, I'm getting about 43 on my commute. It's comfortable, it makes my drive less stressful, the ride is smooth enough to relax, yet taut enough to give handling confidence, and I'm so glad I bought it. I've only played with the seat massage a few times, but on long trips when my legs start to cramp up, this will be exactly what I need. Good job, Lincoln.",5

Total luxury top to bottom , lumbar seat adjustable, which is key now that I'm in my 50s and the back has gotten weaker over the years. I used to be in pain from the Prius seats with this long commute, not any more!  I'm really enjoying this car. It's way more car then I could've afforded in a mercedes, Audi or Lexus. I had an Audi.

Its been in the 80's - 90's this summer, so the cooled seats and ac have come in handy and work great. There are plenty of cup holders and places for storage.

2318, on 01/04/16 14:45 PM (PST),Hickabilly ,2016 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),A step up from my 530xi," I did a month of research selecting a car to trade from my 2007 530xi.  The 530 was a nice car of its time but the maintenance was an absolute wallet breaker.  I had not even considered a Lincoln and was down to a fully loaded Fusion Hybrid, Lexus Hybrid, or GM.  I test drove them all and really liked the layout of the Fusion.  I negotiated price on the Fusion online and would have had one except the sales person at the closest dealer ruined the experience.  So, I took the 530 to Carmax and stumbled on the Lincoln.Holy cow, I didn't even stumble on a Lincoln Hybrid when researching so I went back to the internet and started reading the reviews.  Most were good.  One fellow had rented a MKZ and had nothing but bad to say.  So, I almost passed on Lincoln.  But I am glad I didn't.The ride of the MKZ is better than the 530, the interior is really sharp, the road noise is minimal, and it has more power than a Prius that I test drove.  Not much power by comparison to the 530, but more than enough for a stylish commuter car.  The price for the decked out MKZ was about $6k more than a fully decked out Titanium Fusion.  But that $6k really makes a difference.  Comparing the cars, the MKZ is a Fusion with a different console layout, heated rear seats, and different audio system.  But the additional Lincoln drive train warranty, extended hybrid warranty and 3 years of bumper-to-bumper maintenance really make that $6k seem like a big win.  The Fusion seemed more like fitting into a space with the car wrapped around you.  It felt a little cramped.  The MKZ's layout with the low center console that doesn't have a shift lever makes the car feel larger and roomier.  The touch controls for the console are also a very nice difference.  I was comparing a decked out Fusion Titanium Hybrid with the MKZ so the differences were small otherwise. On the road, it is a bit of a turnaround in mental processes to realize I get better mileage in my commute to work than I get on the interstate.  I get why, technically, but it reverses my way of driving.  I won't fall into that trap of trying to maximize mileage at the detriment of all of the other drivers around me.  When there is no-one on the road, I let the car advise me on maximizing efficiency.  But when in traffic, I drive it like my truck.  The MKZ has plenty of power for getting off the starting line and keeping up with traffic.  Handling is tight and it hugs the road.  The various settings for the comfort of the ride are nice but I spend most of my time in the sport mode which still feels softer than the 530 and yet hugs the curves and corners exceptionally well.  I never drove the 530 in a way that took advantage of its handling so my point of comparison is limited.  With the way I drive, the MKZ is as good as the 530.  And, by the way, the comfort mode is soft and has that floating feeling like a larger car.  I am 6'1"" and I have a few inches of headroom.  I didn't get the crazy Lincoln retracting roof as I didn't like the look of it.  I almost never opened the moon roof on the 530 (mainly because of the wind noise) so I sought out one with just a moon roof instead of that panoramic thing.  And I must say... the MKZ is far quieter when the cover to the moon roof is open.  The 530 had sound insulation on the moon roof because even when closed it was like sticking your ear to the window of a jet airplane.  But the MKZ is pretty much silent even when the sliding cover is open.I have had the car for a month.  The only negative that I have identified is that it has a pull to the left when accelerating.  But otherwise, I consider this purchase a big step up from the 2007 530xi for a lot less in initial cost and ongoing maintenance. I read the reviews indicating that the Fusions computer reported gas mileage is different than real-world experience.  But so far, measured by the mile and measured gallons used to fill it, the computer reported mileage is spot on with what I calculate.",5

Quality of interior materials still not up to the Lexus ES standard. Very quiet when cruising, but unpleasant engine noise on acceleration, and does not accelerate nearly as well as the Lexus ES hybrid. Electronics do all the things you'd like, if you can figure out how to use them. Excessively non-intuituve inputs for simple commands. The drivetrain and the design of the electronics interface need work. What's wrong with simple buttons and knobs? Back seat is hard. Still a tempting car with it's comfort and appearance.",4

I've owned everything from recent Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, model cars. Overall, the 2016 Lincoln MKZ is the best value. Here's why: Unlike Mercedes, Lincoln's don't cost an arm and a leg to fix. I also want to be DIFFERENT and not drive the stereotypical ""Mercedes"". Compared to the BLAND styling of current Lexus models, this car is a killer! Beautiful lines, design, and interior. Sure, the 2.0 Hybrid model doesn't perform like a BMW, but the MKZ will get 40MPG, take 87 octane, and rides more luxuriously IMO. I am very proud that our country makes a luxury car that goes toe-to-toe with imports! Great job Lincoln. The 2016 MKZ is a winner.",5
2321, on 12/13/15 20:17 PM (PST),Benjamin Jones ,2016 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),2016 MKZ Hybrid - NOT worth the money!," 1. MKZ Hybrid is advertised as getting 40+ mpg city/highway. I promise you it will never, ever do that. The best my wife and I ever get is 36.6. Our average is between 30 and 35. So don't be fooled by the salesman.2. The style is actually incredible. We both love the look and feel of the interior. The outside is pretty sleek as well, but the ""white"" version is not a true white - more of a pearlescent white.3. At a full tank the dash reads 500 miles to empty, give or take some. We get maybe 350 miles before we have to actually fill up, so do not be fooled into thinking that a brand new car is any more advanced than its predecessors. My old pickup truck is more accurate in fuel estimation.4. Here's the biggest freaking problem we had with this car: It has had 2 mechanical repairs and 1 fuel efficiency evaluation done on it since we drove it off the lot a few months ago. The dealership in Stockton put up a huge fuss about how this couldn't be really happening, it never happens to these cars, and we must be mistaken. Well we were not mistaken. A fuel fumes leak was repaired, a purge valve was replaced, and we insisted they give us an extra 10,000 miles on the lease because of the incredible disappointment this car has been for us.It will not get the amazing gas mileage promised, it has a very slow and low performing engine, there is minimal trunk space, and our dealership (even though they make it seem like Lincoln owners get treated SO much better) treated us like trash. I am not kidding when I say that I had to call them countless time to even get an answer on our problems. It was a full-scale disaster.My suggestion: buy Ford Fusion hybrid if you want the American made car. It's the same engine system as the MKZ Hybrid and its like 30% cheaper! Don't fork out big money for something that doesn't deserve it and won't earn it.",3

It has a great ride, a very attractive design and lots of features.  The My Sync feature is very information, I specially link the FREE My Sync - SERVICE option, which you need to register every year for online, but it's free.  I also like the Lincoln App, it provides lots of information on the vehicle and the Support Section provides videos on ""How - To"" use all the vehicle features.

I'VE HAD 4 MKZs now.," I have had 4 MKZ's in a row and that should tell you that ""overall"" I was pretty pleased with the car.  As they continued to improved, I continued to try the next version.        First, the good stuff!       1//// Runs on regular gas.          2//// I can't say enough about that 4 cyl. ecoboost engine. My previous 3 had v6 3.7, so I was expecting an egg beater similar to some 4 cyl Volvo's I had tried. THAT ENGINE is incredibly quiet, quick and smooth.  I can be going 70 and kick it and be at 95 in a flash. Really a marvelous engine.      3//// The quick fill gas tank that has no cap to unscrew...you'll LOVE it.      4///// Seats are better-than-average-comfortable but still not to die for like some of the Euro's.     5/////// Unlike the heavy iron Euros I've had in the past from Germany and England (at the time), the wheels don't get black from brake dust.      6//////  The fold down rear seats have come in handy many times.     7/////////  A lot of car people trashed the split wing grill but I'll tell ya, I've had more than a few tell me they like it a lot. HELL, if ya wanna trash a front end, look at whatever it is LEXUS is doing!  Downright UGLY. I don't mind it all but if it were true chrome it may have added some sparkle.  I DO like it better than the 2017 grill because that grill looks more like an old time heating regulator you'd find in old houses to let heat rise up from below. HOWEVER, from a 45 degree angle it looks REALLY good, head-on though, it's just doesn't look ""refined"". Surprised they didn't dress it up more in the Continental.   8/// The 4 cyl is pretty fuel efficient and I don't miss the 6 cyl at all and yes, I do have a heavy foot at times.   9///// It just runs well and drives just fine for a sedan.  OKAY NOW FOR SOME OF THE BAD STUFF.   1///// The look of the dash etc. is just fine and kinda cool as well......BUT............THE NAV SCREEN (et al.) needs to be set in and angled to prevent sunlight glare. Mid-Day in Florida where the sun shines 350 days a year?  Forget about it, you can barely see it at max lumination settings.  Also, by sticking out at the angle it's on, it shows ALL FINGERPRINTS and you'll be wiping that screen continuously.  Looks crappy.  It needs to be set back with a hood and maybe angled more vertically.   2//////They did away with sync for life of car so it expires after 6 months.  It's nice to have but not worth the extra money in my opinion.   They're my two biggest gripes and that screen the biggest.  I'm told there might be some interesting changes coming in 2018 and if some issues are addressed then, I'll probably get another. Otherwise, it's off to Europe again.",4

I love the technology features such as lane assist, active cruise control, reversing camera, lane departure warning, and (surprisingly) rain sensing wipers.  I love the multi contour active motion seats.  My only two complaints are one major, the electric power steering is well weighted, has good turn in, etc. but does not have enough road feel.  I understand this is true of all EPS including the cars I have driven that have it.  (It is much better than a 2015 Toyota Camry that I rented this year.)  The second is less of a problem and that is there needs to be more non-touch screen controls for the HVAC.  Finally, I have been very impressed with Lincoln Motor Company.  They are very responsive and after I brought to their attention that I thought the car took much longer to build than I think it should have, they gave me a 100,000 mile warranty.  I have found that “company care” is very important for an expensive and complex device such as this one.

I bought the car pre-owned (almost new, with 8k miles) and saved almost $20,000 in the process. My first impressions were very negative, but I've reconsidered them after living with the vehicle a couple of weeks. 1. The ergonomics are OK even though I'd like to see less of a drop from the seat level to the feet space. 2. Electronic controls were a pain in the beginning, and it takes a while to get used to them. They are not as responsive as manual controls, and sometimes they're over-responsive, depending on their mood. Why do manufacturers think that everything high-tech and automated is better when it's not? However, once you set everything up according to your preference, you can forget about them.3. The car flies, especially in the sport mode. It has effortless acceleration and a beautiful V-6 sound. 4. I drained the battery when I first brought it home since I didn't know how to properly lock the car. You press the lock sign twice until you hear the sound. That kills all the lights after a few seconds. Make sure you check visually that all the light are off. I will probably consider buying another MKZ in a couple of years since the 2017 V-6 versions have 350 and 400 hp respectively and since both have twin-turbos. The 400 hp version is AWD to boot. Of course, it depends on whether I can get as good a deal on a pre-owned one as my current MKZ.",3

Six cylinder engine does not have massive torque and it is thirsty. Transmission is not particularly smooth and holds high RPM at highway speeds, which contributes to a high fuel consumption. Steering is not intuitive and steering wheel is hard to turn. Headlights are LED, but lighting perimeter is short and dark. Touch sensitive screen controls are slow to respond. Navigation screen has 2-4 seconds delay, while changing scenes. Though I just drove 1100 miles, I've been in the dealership multiple times for rattles and vibrations. Quality of interior materials are left to be desired. Leather on the seats bubbles and finger prints are easily shown everywhere, including navigation screen.

It is delightful; the experience at the dealership, the car itself, the little touches that provide an experience of specialness combine to deliver the most impressive auto ownership experience I have had in nearly forty years of new car ownership. The MkZ is not a BMW, it is an American luxury experience that brings forward design and experiential elements going back more than forty years. The MkZ is unique in that it can be calibrated to ride and handle like a classic Town Car, or a responsive mid-sized car, or something in between. My MkZ is a Black Label, which is probably the best luxury/premium value in the marketplace between the unique trim like the Mark IV and V series of the late 1970s and additional services that no other luxury brand offers. Those few reviews that I've seen complain about the MkZ that it isn't a BMW - what a boring place this would be if every choice were the same. The MkZ gives the buyer who finds its qualities to be pleasing a blend of traditional American luxury, handling, and unique styling. Fully loaded, it's an absolute bargain as compared to its entire field of competition and the dealer experience is the best in the industry.My car has the 3.7L V6 FWD - Edmunds didn't offer that combination",5

I decided on the 2.0 turbo and it's quick. The car acts like a stallion that wants to run fast....and it often takes restraint on my part to watch my speed. You don't realize how fast you are going since the car is quiet and so smooth. (Just read that the National Highway Patrol approved this engine for pursuit) . I particularly love the Push Button Shift selection, which eliminates the cumbersome shifter all other vehicles have. Also love the sliding volume and temperature controls. After driving the Dodge Charger and it's obstructed front view I was so impressed with the MKZ panoramic front view. I also love the cool LED taillights...much more suttle than the GLARING Dodge Charger rear lights. Lincoln sold me on this car. It's a car that makes you want to drive it all the time. In closing,  I highly recommend shoppers to test drive this car. Ignore critics who don't live day to day with a car but instead toss personal opinions on the limited time they have to drive it. Outstanding car to drive/own.",5

The MKZ outclasses the C class.  I test drove the Mercedes E class and the Cadillac CTS. I chose the Lincoln MKZ for comfort and value.  The MKZ has more than expected standard equipment and amazing options in reasonably priced packages. The 2.0 w/turbo engine is all I will ever need. I drove 2200 miles round trip in three days, both my passenger and I have never been more comfortable.                           Still pleased with my MKZ.  I stand by my original review",5

I cannot express how wonderful this car rides and performs. I turn heads in my neighborhood (full of foreign cars) and are often asked who makes this car. I cannot think of one thing negative about this car. I did notice this car wants to run fast and often realize I'm driving faster than it seems. Kudos to Lincoln on a superior ride.

I was a BMW FAN until now. My wife and I went to the BMW dealer to buy a 328i or a 528i and we test drove both and touched a felt everything about the car. We just were not that impressed. The 328i was just to small and cramped inside. The 528i was much better but just did not seem to be the quality interior we expected.So we went to our local Lincoln dealer and test drove the MKZ. Wow the interior was all upholstered and soft, the sleek design was very impressive and the ride was just what we were looking for.We got the technology package with ours and I highly recommend it. The ride in this car in comfort mode was absolutely luxurious. The car also has two other modes that are also impressive if you want a car that connects to the road and gives you the feel of a BMW. I like these options. There are so many features in this car I cannot even begin to tell you all of them.All I know is whether you own this car for one week or three years you will never get tired of it and you will be very proud to own it.I wish I had more time to write more about this car, however take it from this very happy owner you owe it to yourself to test drive this baby it is a head turner.",5

Take a little time and the 4 quads of My Lincoln Touch... is NOT the bad thing that the critics complain about..  Overall this car is fun to drive and a  nice looking vehicle..

2347, on 07/22/15 07:26 AM (PDT),Chris Healey ,2016 Lincoln MKZ Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Run Away!," I was 'upgraded' to the 2016 MKZ 3.7L (Edmunds won't let me select the 3.7L engine option), as a rental car this week and I've been driving it all week.  And I have to day this is the worst car in this class I have driven in a very long time.First off it is UGLY.  I mean really ugly.  At the front it is channelling a PT Cruiser and the back reminds me of some French car from years ago.  In other words the great looks of the Fusion it is based upon have been kicked to the curb in favor of a monstrosity that no one could possibly find attractive.The interior looks like it might be premium in some aspects, but upon closer inspection, they disappoint.  Edmunds was generous giving it a C.It feels lively enough off the line, but stomp the right foot and expect some disturbing torque steer.  Ford engineers need to buy a VW GTI and figure out why a car that costs $10K less has solved the problem of torque steer, and they seemingly cannot.I enjoyed no aspect of driving this car.  The handling sucks, it is not especially quick, although feels quicker because you are dealing with the torque steer drama.  The interior lacks any kind of premium features one would expect of a car in the mid $30s.  The car before the car I own now was a CPO Mercedes C Class.  Given the choice between a 9 month old CPO fully loaded Mercedes, and this junker, it's a no brainer.Don't like used cars, even CPO?  Well heck, you can buy a Mercedes CLA or BMW 320 for the same price as this Lincoln.  And the latter includes four years of free servicing, along with a ride and handling that will put this MKZ to shame.When the price tag tips past $30K there are a wealth of cars available from great very young CPO offerings, to excellent new choices.  You have top of the line regular cars, and entry level luxury cars.  And the bottom line; this car simply doesn't compete.  It doesn't bring enough to the table to stand out, or even be noticed.  I honestly can't think of a single match up with any $35K car, that this comes close to winning.To me the only buyer for this car would be someone who is a die hard Lincoln fan and someone who has never driven any other $35K car.  Because trust me I have shopped this segment extensively and driven dozens of rentals in a similar price point, and everything trounces this car.The sad thing is, I actually have a soft spot for the Fusion.  The most recent makeover that borrowed from Aston Martin styling cues was a huge upgrade on the old dated Fusion.  So to give the Fusion the fugly make over, charge $15K more, and not even offer basics like an adjustable steering column or sunroof is kind of a joke.Make a list of cars priced $30K - $40K stick a pin in it, and you'll have a better car than this.  Edmunds says C, I say F.",1

The car was in great condition and has continued to be a problem free vehicle, which is such a pleasure. I have only replaced the battery and changed the oil regularly. Everything works as it should. The only nitpick I would have is that the MPG isn't that great around town, which is much of my driving and averages about 19 or a little better.Edit: The car is nearly seven years old, almost 86K, and I have recently done rear brakes and the battery was replaced a few years ago as noted above.

Base model comes very well equipped with virtually everything you would hope to have in a entry level premium sedan. As a technology junkie, the Microsoft-powered Sync interface (standard), is absolutely top shelf. The ride is quiet and supple, with the V6 supplying plenty of power as well as fuel economy. Handling is a tad underwhelming, but that is really my only beef. The cabin is well laid out, and both fit and finish and interior materials are very good.I find the seats to be very comfortable, and rear legroom is satisfactory.

First was a 2010 Ford Fusion (great vehicle), Second, a 2012 Lincoln MKZ (another great vehicle) and this one, a 2014 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid.  I purchased the 2014 Lincoln solely because it has ""killer"" looks, very eye-catching and the newest battery technology.  I've had no problems with ANY of the hybrids and the gas mileage is fantastic.  I really like Ford's hybrids because they look like ""real"" cars, not like ""insects"" as in the Toyota Prius.  There's only a couple of things I would change, one is the CVT transmission (I don't care for the ""drone"" sound it makes under hard acceleration {although it does perform well at all highway speeds}), the second is a larger fuel tank and the third is the many touch screen prompts (I prefer buttons/switches and knobs).   Dealer service is great, showrooms are high class and personnel are very friendly.  Additionally, Lincoln does not charge extra for the hybrid edition.  A nice feature is when sitting in traffic, the battery pack heats and cools the interior of the car without running the engine and only comes on temporarily when the battery pack needs to be recharged and that only takes a few minutes.  Can't buy a better vehicle.  One other issue I'm concerned about is the premature wear of the Michelin tires, although the tires are not a Lincoln issue, these tires do not wear as well as other Michelin tires I've had.  The tires are rotated and balanced every 5 thousand  miles.  I purchased a set of Vogue tires and although they are not ""easy rollers"", they perform much better than the Michelins.  I have noticed a slight reduction in gas mileage (MPG) with these tires however, the extended miles of wear and road-feel is a good trade-off.",5

2376, on 04/30/14 21:56 PM (PDT),xeroblu ,2014 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Great milage," Ive had some premium cars in my life and I've never received so many complements on this ride by all age groups. In its reserve trim with the upgraded wheels and roof it looks slick. The car was a first year production run and if you recall Lincoln had production problems with the MKZ meeting quality standards holding up release several months. Its said Maulally then CEO of Ford was ready to scrap the brand because of it. I say this because the car has interior issues. Ive had several panels fall off, and squeaks and rattles have been a chore for me and my Lincoln dealership to iron out. That said, Ive driven the new ones and I'm confident all those issues have been resolved so buying a new Lincoln is a safe choice and a wise one if you like the look. In fact the new hybrids have been re worked and tuned to use more EV than my 2014 resulting in a quieter more buttoned up ride.  Huge strides have been made in the material quality from my 2014 to the current 2016's in leather and interior panels. All that said I'm planning on leasing a new continental when this lease is up. Lincoln has won me over in their customer service. Beats BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Lexus hands down. Lincoln picks up the car for service leaving me with a Lincoln loaner returning my car where ever I am. Essentially you never have to see the dealership for service and if you buy Black Label you just never need to go to the dealer even to purchase.

Definately not a family car but very stylish and comfortable for front seat passengers.

The car has a sleek aerodynamic design that can create a bit of a challenge for a larger person getting in and out of the car... definately something to consider.  The interior of the car overall is very nice. Not a ton of compartment space but enough for daily use. The quality and workmanship is exceptional. Definitely what I've come to expect from Lincoln. It comes with plenty of bells, whistles and technology to peak your interest for the long haul. It's good on gas and performs well when you need to hop out in traffic quickly. The interior lights on the doors, ceiling, floor and exterior light on the rear add another level of wow to the car.

But there were few annoying problems I have to mention.  Dashboard rattle. I had it on fusion with which mkz shares many   parts. But the most annoying thing my local ford dealer couldn't fix was the outside rattle at high speed. On addition, a number started to show a discoloration just after 2 years of use.

We purposely looked at Ford and Lincoln because they did not take the bail out money; and because my old Buick was the best riding car I ever owned. Two weeks ago we traded that car in on a 2014 MKZ with 22,000 miles on it. There are a lot of things I like about the 2014 over the 2012... It's much sportier looking, accessing the climate, phone, and media is much easier. Gas mileage is about the same on both cars. But that's all the good stuff I have to say.  It rides like a wagon. Honestly I can't believe it has the Lincoln name on it. When I test drove the car it had General tires on it. The dealership offered to put new Michelin's on the car, but only after I made the purchase. While I didn't love the look of my 2012 Lincoln, but I sure liked how it rode. In the settings I have changed the setting from sport to comfort and I don't think it made any difference. One problem is probably the low profile tires, but I am not a fan.

I love the I4 ecoboost engine gives you the power when you need it I feel like I'm still in my V6 and when you go into sport mode it is really phenomenal on how it handles the technology package is not for everybody but I love it some of the older people don't like it they want knots and you'll see the 2017 MKZ they went back to knobs but I prefer the Sleek styling that they have an in MKZ.

Last winter I had few issues with the power decklid not opening and closing automatically. It would still pop the trunk but my auto closing switches didn't work so i had to open and close it manually. No big deal. This winter, it wont even pop the trunk. I am locked out of the trunk of my vehicle unless I fold down the back seats and pull the emergency release. Then I had a dead battery....Once I got the vehicle started, it displayed several warnings (Service TPS, hill start not available, Service steering system) but the car was running. I realized i had a problem when I was unable to turn the steering wheel. If you live in cold climates, this is a terrible car. Everything is electric. Other than this issue, its a great car to spend time in and drive. I absolutely love it during the summer when everything works. *UPDATE* after taking the vehicle in to figure out the problem, they told me the trunk module was the cause of the draining battery. $400 to fix. After that was fixed the car hasn't had any other issues. *update 06/27/18* Car is still running great! Keep up on regular maintenance and it runs and drives great.

As this was the most expensive car I've ever bought or leased, I expect ZERO defects. My MB and 2012 Taurus were perfect during my entire ownership experience. I expect the same from what was America's luxury car leader for so many years. remains they are left to clean up the issues caused by mother Ford/Lincoln by farming assembly to Mexico to save costs, but still charge a big price for their vehicles. *****************Update after 3 years of ownership:Quality of the interior controls - cheap plastic.  Push button transmission selector is cheap plastic. The ""ok"" buttons on the steering wheel are the worst. Contacts require you press firmly to engage the contacts underneath. Seats: Comfortable on long trips but they do wear you down after 400 miles.MPG:  On interstate at 75 mph I average 32-33 mpg. Around town between 23-25.  Engine: Built in Spain. The 2.0L EcoBoost has some nads! Value:  For what you pay, it's not worth the price. You can pick up a 1-2 year old E350 or 5 Series CPO for the price paid new for the MKZ.  Maybe the redesign of 2017 has taken care of the ""cheapness"" of the interior finish. I've ordered a new F150 King Ranch. I'm spoiled but the F150 is built in the USA by American workers.

Acceleration is brisk enough, but remember, this is NOT meant to be a Mustang for Lincoln; rather, a luxurious performance cruiser, and it fits the bill nicely.

Opted for the MKZ and decided to give Ford (1st time ford buyer) a chance.  No regrets yet.  MKZ is very good value for mid size luxury car.  ,4.875

Overall I am relatively happy with my new MKZ -  performance, handeling, and ride have all improved, and the cosmetic changes for the most part are an improvement.  I can however see where Ford has cut some costs in producing the '10 vs. '07 while adding $5,000 to the base price in just 3 years. My biggest disappointment is in the poor audio unit now standard in the base MKZ, the same unit that comes in a Ford Escape, Fusion or other Ford/Mercury vehicle. While the whistles and bells such as Sync, USB, and Bluetooth Audio are all great, the most important aspect of any audio system - sound quality - is very disappointing.",4.125

I traded in my Lexus SC430 on the MKZ because I needed a sedan, so a Lexus IS and GS was my first test drive.  Both were great, but were lacking in trunk space/storage space.  I loved the Acura TL, but it didn't fit in my small garage, and the Caddy CTS and BMW 528ix didn't have a rear camera and were pricey.  Now that I own my MKZ, I know I selected the right car.

Lets start with the good: Everyone that got in the car would go gaga over the interior, the lighting, and other various features. My car has every option.  It parks itself but only on the right side, has a ridiculous backup camera, and a panoramic roof that is to die for.  I'm not dying but it's very nice.  The gas mileage is great and i average over 40MPG during the spring and fall and 38ish in the summer and winter when running A/C or heat.  The comfort level is unmatched.  The bad: Never buy new or else the depreciation will make you cry unless it's an SUV or a Lexus. 3 years ago i paid 38 before taxes and such and now dealers will barely give me 20,000.  Interior moldings came detached on a couple of occasions and my bumper to bumper warranty came in handy every time. My regular battery died within weeks of buying the car and was replaced, there is an under car cover that ripped on two separate occasions and dragged on the road. I had it removed. I'm on my third set of tires but i can't figure whose fault it is.  The hybrid is very light so tire spin happens with ease as the weight over the wheels is drastically reduced. My navigation system reboots randomly and sometimes it takes ten minutes of driving before my route will set.The Ugly:  Recalls, I've had at least four. If I wasn't under the used car extended warranty my cost of ownership would be way higher than how low it is now.",4

Lincoln finally admitted to this error under government order and I got a free pair of sunglasses. I have never gotten more than 35.5 overall average mpg. Sticker originally said 48 mpg. I have had five recalls in two years. Now with less than 30,000 miles I have recently experienced, on two occasions, on 2 occasions, an involuntary transmission shift from drive to reverse when stopped. I have researched this to see if anybody else has had a problem or has noticed this but I have been unable to find this same issue. Scary! Thankfully, I have another vehicle, have stopped driving the Lincoln and will be taking the Lincoln back to the dealer this week.The drivers side has a terrible blind spot due to structural post size and placement.. On screen LCD touch controls for just about everything from entertainment to climate, can be just a little bit distracting unless you learn the very specific commands for voice control which doesn't always respond to your request. On the positive side, the car is quite roomy for all, front and back. Including this 6 foot owner/primary driver. It looks great and the white pearl paint is very catchy.",3
2440, on 04/05/15 13:25 PM (PDT),ajayla ,2013 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid Hybrid 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),"Great Balance of Style, Substance, and Economy"," I bought this car certified when it came off lease. There was simply no other models offering the combination this one did. I considered Fusion hybrids, which are obviously similar, but found no price difference.The ""lifetime"" fuel use over 20,000 miles is just under 39 mpg. Considering the level of luxury, this is pretty great. Coupled with a solid ride, responsive handling, and all the systems it provides, the Lincoln makes a compelling case.The changes between hybrid and engine modes are very subtle. The start-stop system on even BMWs is rough in comparison. Power is not a high point, but it's there when needed. UPDATETwo years later, the car is still going strong. I've had a few minor issues -- automatic lights (finally fixed on third attempt) and juddering panoramic sunroof operation when baking in the sun (still not resolved after four attempts). While the dealer has been excellent in providing loaner cars, thus minimizing inconvenience to me, I see a tendency to update software rather than look deeper. (For example, the automatic lights needed a new sensor.)I remain very impressed by the technology, though the learning curve was pretty steep. The main disappointment, which I knew going in, has to do with the power output of the engine, the tendency for the CVT to drone when accelerating hard, and the general harshness, vibration, and sound of the gas engine. These are imperceptible when driving moderately, but definitely detract from the smoothness of the driving experience when, for example, accelerating on a grade. But these are the traits of a hybrid. I continue to average between 37 and 38 MPG in hilly urban terrain. That's more than twice the efficiency of my prior car, which had nowhere near the level of sophistication and was smaller and lighter. While I don't drive a lot, I feel good to be doing my part, and doing it discretely.  Yes, there is a slight lack of polish in the drive train, but it's not significant in the overall picture.As for value, I took advantage of heavy depreciation when I bought the car as it was coming off lease. I imagine that the depreciation has continued, though at a slower pace. I appreciate that the car design did not change in any significant way in four years. Now the front is different, but the rest of the car is the same, so it still looks current., Would I buy this car again? If it were 2015 again, yes. In the past two years, though, there have been major technological advances and a broadening of options, so I might give consideration to other cars.",5

The Fusion was great, and we really liked that car. I absolutely love this Lincoln.It has everything in it except for the seat massagers, which won't be out for a few more months.The car is beautiful, comfortable and nicely made. The panoramic roof is really cool, and the electric shade is a neat touch.I got every major option, but you haven't experienced anything until you let the car parallel park itself. This is an option you might find on more expensive luxury cars. Watching the steering wheel turn itself as you gently work the brake and ease back - and forward - is amazing.",5

It is difficult to view the navigation system at times becauseof the sun.The navigation/my-Lincoln touch system console tends to hold fingerprints more than the my-Ford touch system.

The car had the larger engine and AWD. I took it back to the shop twice in one month. When the car hit 50 mph it shook and vibrated. All four tires needed balanced not aligned balanced. The wipers were really bad and needed replaced. The volume on the best stereo system they offer would not work from time to time. When the ac was activated I would hear a noise that resonated into the car. Very annoying. I owned the car for a little over a month. The Certified 160 point check is a joke. Lincoln wanted me to pay for the balancing of the wheels and replacing the wipers. My argument was by me paying for the service it goes against the 160 point check. If they took it for a ride they would have noticed the shaking of the car at 50 mph. Just a bunch of check marks. This car was a Lincoln Certified Vehicle.  I traded it in just one month later and bought a Toyota Camry. The Camry road so much better. I bought a lemon and took a beating on the trade and the deposit I put down on the Lincoln. Now I feel safe and not worried about taking my car into the shop more than necessary.  I had candy eyes when I bought the Lincoln MKZ because it is a beautiful looking car.   Stay clear.,1

My previous '11 MKZ had the 3.7 and I see little difference performance-wise, yet I'm getting 8-10 mpg better mileage. The MyLincolnTouch system is not perfect, but it's not nearly as frustrating as it's made out to be.

I am certain they are building new cars with another non Takata airbag supplier. As you can imagine, the resale value with those airbags has diminished. While I am a safe driver, I still fear penetrating injuries from the ""safety"" feature, many in the face. If Ford can build new cars with airbags, why the long delay in repairing the problem for its established customers?

I went with the MKZ and I have not regretted it. I love my car, I feel like I finally have a real car for the first time. I already drove it in the snow and ice and it handled beautifully. I would recommend getting the brushed nickel interior- it looks awesome and much better than the tacky fake wood that is standard. Also love the bluetooth & the heated seats. There is also little to no road noise and gas mileage is okay- I get about 21mpg with a mix of highway and local driving.   ",4.875

Comfortable ride that handles well in ice and snow. Not very good gas mileage, but I expected that. Heated driver's seat stopped functioning about 6 months after 4-year warranty ran out and would have been very expensive to repair.

2503, on 04/14/18 19:52 PM (PDT),Vince ,2008 Lincoln MKX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),The Year Report," I bought this car a little later in its life, got it used in 2017 with 58,000 miles on it. Man, it’s still in the race though with luxury cars that have came out years ahead and even in to now. I think the vehicle even in 2018 looks very stylish and up to date, the features it has are also still very current and practical. The sync system works well even with my iPhone 8 and the navigation system has always been able to direct me to any place I needed to go. I feel like Lincoln as a brand has gotten a lot of negative attention in terms of not being a “real” luxury brand. Honestly I feel like this vehicle was miles ahead of any Cadillac that came out in 2008 or even in to today. The only feature I wish I had was a reverse camera but the parking sensors help out nicely. I have about 69,000 miles on it now and have had no problems at all. I think this car is for sure one that is worth a look, especially pre-owned.",4
2504, on 02/08/18 23:00 PM (PST),John ,2008 Lincoln MKX SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Takata Airbag recall.," Back in July 2016 I received a recall notice for my 2008 Lincoln MKX regarding a Takata airbag issue. The recall notice indicated this issue could result in death and/or great bodily harm or serious injury. For a year and a half I've been trying to get this issue addressed with negative results with my local Lincoln dealership (Island Lincoln), finally prompting me to contact Lincoln corporate in Dearborn, Michigan. So I wrote to Lincoln's CEO expressing my concern for this recall, the possibility of death or serious harm per the recall notice, my continued email correspondence with my local Lincoln dealership, and seeking some type of assurance regarding this issue.What I received was a response from Lincoln advising me not to use the front passenger seat of my vehicle to preclude any issue. Mind you I've been using the front seat of my Lincoln MKX for the past year and a half, where my wife sits, and this is the first time I've been informed not to use the front passenger seat of my own automobile. In addition, the recall notice says nothing about not using the front passenger seat and Lincoln's website indicates the issue of the airbag isn't a safety issue and can be used safely until repaired. So which is it? If my wife and I go out to eat with another couple, does she have to squeeze into the back seat with the other couple for safety reasons, as per Lincoln and I drive by myself, or can she ride up front in safety according to Lincoln's website? Is Lincoln lying or misleading?  This June is 2 years waiting.  Beware this vehicle and recall.  Injuries from exploding Takata airbags can be downright gruesome.Police responding to the scene of a minor car accident in California believed the driver had been shot in the face. At another crash site in Georgia, police thought the female driver was a murder victim because of the wounds on her throat. In both cases, the drivers died. The cause of their injuries: a Takata airbag.  The recall notice says nothing about not using the front passenger seat.  However, Lincoln wrote me not to use it!  Beware!!Ford provided me a rental vehicle that I've been using the past 6 months, a 2017 Ford Escape, at no charge.  It's now August 2018 and the recall notice I received on my Lincoln MKX was July 2016.  That's two years running!!  Ford had me sign some affidavit that I wouldn't use, or allow to be used by anyone else, my Lincoln MKX.  Now my Lincoln MKX sits parked in my condo parking lot for 6 months straight, unable to be used or driven, in a harsh salt water environment on the ocean.  The worst thing you can do is allow a vehicle to sit long term without being used.  The Ford Escape is an okay car but it's no Lincoln MKX in terms of driving experience, comfort, features, etc..  If I go another 6 months in this rental Ford Escape, with consideration of the trade in value of my Lincoln MKX, Lincoln would or should find a way to see fit to place me in a brand new Lincoln MKC with what they're paying Hertz long term for the Escape combined with my MKX trade in value..., which would seem or appear to be the right and proper thing to do in terms of customer service and customer satisfaction; not to mention convenience for me.  I have to renew the contract with Hertz every month, one month by phone, and the next month by physically visiting Hertz with the Ford Escape to complete the rental paperwork.  Hertz is not right around the corner. I should add Lincoln has been responsive and accommodating but the truth and hard fact is my family and I were put at risk, and in possible jeopardy, for nothing more than the monetary bottom line in my opinion.  Google the phrase ""Takata airbag recall"" and read about the severe injuries and death.  That alone tells the whole story.  Lincoln has an opportunity here like no other, an opportunity to really do the right thing in terms of true customer satisfaction.  This experience has been a true paroxysmal cephalalgia for me.  And the migraine persists with little to no abatement in sight.",1

I like to be low to the ground and have a grip of where all my tires are. The idea of an SUV has never really intrigued me... that is until I test drove the MKX. It was small enough that I felt like I still had control of it and large enough to handle any extra storage we may need. I loved the black interior with natural colored wood grain trim. It's the perfect combination in my opinion. On top of the black exterior. For an '08 the features are pretty outstanding. The white dash lights are very nice as opposed to the green or amber I've been so accustomed to. The ride is very comfortable and the cooled/heated seats make it even more comfortable. The interior lighting is bright, but it's not annoying to the driver. The only thing we had come up with it is the speed sensor went out 1500 miles after owning it. Fortunately, the dealer put a 3000 mile warranty on it, pretty surprising for an 8 year old vehicle, and it was covered. Otherwise, it was about an $800 expense. Regardless, I love this SUV. I'm very glad we held out and went with Lincoln. Even though I'm a Toyota guy, I have always liked Ford, and I figured Lincoln was the way to go if I wanted all the features.",5

Nothing, it has 54,000 miles on it and they told me to contact Lincoln. No help there either. About a year later, I receive safety recalls, rust corrosion because the 2008 was not sealed properly.  So check your gas tank straps and cooling system for excessive corrosion. Took it for inspection, even the covering on my shocks are ate off by rust. The entire frame is extensively rusted. Lincoln said to have it inspected. I did. Yes it's extensive Ms dumbass for buying this vehicle, but no safety issues so nothing will be done. I call bullshit!!

Cooled seats in Texas set it apart from all the others.  I really like the Ipod hookup, satellite radio, nav system, and hands free phone functions.  And they are all integrated & work perfectly.  I averaged 19 mpg for the 36k miles I had it; and the 6 cyl had plenty of zip.

Mine has been back 4 times with leaking seals.  Ford has no idea how to correct the problem.  I am very disappointed with the company.

Looked at the Edge, looked at GM products, as I was a GM loyalist, but nothing compared to the MKX. Great styling, superb comfort, cool features, all rolled into one little sharp CUV. I could go on and on about this vehicle. We usually change cars it seems like every couple of years. I don't see us giving up the MKX. Oh I almost forgot, zero interest as well.

We took it on a long trip the week after Christmas that involved roughly 2,000 miles of driving.  FL to NC to VA and back to FL. The driving was a good mix of interstate, around town and curvy mountain roads.  I could not be happier with the performance and handling! We averaged roughly 24 MPG on the highway, 18 around town.

And the features have it over the Lexus by a mile.  Don't have to pay an extra $3500 either for blue tooth as in Lexus. Lincoln's phone sync is great.  Gas mileage is better than Lexus at 24mpg on road, and the sun roof is fantastic. I love this crossover and will get one myself at the end of 2009.",5

Engine/transmission powerful and smooth.  Comparing my Limited with any competitor was not even close from a value perspective. This was a great buy.  Mileage better than I thought - 19 around town and 22+ on the highway.  Handles equally well in town or on the highway - a true pleasure to drive.

Our last car, a Montego, performed excellently with a CVT. It lacked power and was noisy so we wanted the same car with a Lincoln trim. The MKX seemed like the best answer and they market the 6 speed transmission as barely perceptable shifting. The CVT is no longer available. Since all of the Lincoln dealers shut down near our house we bought this 50 miles away without a test drive on our hill. Big mistake! It is truly wonderful as all other reviewers say on normal roads but the transmission hunts horribly on our hill.

I considered other crossovers, but they came off to me as either a station wagon or a small truck. Performace is better in the Lexus and couple of others which was nice but not important as the MKX is better priced. The MKX will get out of the way and run with any of them.

The paint is beautiful and wears like steel. I have driven this on multiple long distance cross country adventures and she has performed like a champ. Never a hiccup for 110,000 miles. Would keep her forever and continue to pamper and enjoy her if I could. A rare 2007  with Nav. and Sirius plus plus plus. A joy to own and drive. Update Nov. 2017 - MKX is 10 years old, looks brand new ( I baby it), now has 155,000 miles on it  and still runs like a top. It has lasted longer and been more reliable than my last 2 marriages. ha ha True.. With the exception on one dead battery, there has never been a day in the past 7 years that I have gone out and turned the ignition and it has failed to start.. It's the absolute best, most reliable, most functional vehicle, I have ever owned.  How can I buy anything but another... it would have to be one heck of a vehicle at one heck of a great price and check out fully with Mark at my Lincoln Dealership before I would even consider it.. Mileage still outstanding.. checked out at 23 mpg this past month highway driving.. beat that!!",5

Its not like the protypical tail lights on cars. The Long straight bar lights look great and can you can easily tell this car apart even from the sister MKT from the rear.

Great leg room in all seating positions... and this is coming from a 6'1"" guy. Also, from a maintenance standpoint, Ford finally got the oil filter location right.

It was a toss-up between the Caddy SRX and the Lincoln. My wife liked the visibility out of the Lincoln better so we went with it. The MKX interior is not as refined as the Caddy and the exterior design is pretty generic, except for that beautiful front grille.  Would like to see softer seats and more leather inside and a bit more classic lines outside. Fuel mileage has been less than I had hoped for, the best I have gotten on the highway is 22.9.

The quietness of the interior, performance, people/cargo hauling capability, park-ability, fuel economy (24 hwy), and beautiful lines are all a treat.  I'm biased maybe, but I really like how this vehicle looks.  The lines are simple, unique, elegant.  That and the size is just perfect, being easy to park, yet taking 4 people in roomy luxury pretty much anywhere.  On top of that, the base model has all the creature comforts I want and a few more.  With bluetooth connectivity that is pretty seamless (phone, Pandora, google-maps), nice leather heated seats, remote start, and comfortable roomy rear seats.  Flip the button and the rear seats go down and you have a great cargo cavern to load up with whatever.  From a winter/capability standpoint, the AWD system seems to just always get traction...where my prior RWD 4x4 would fishtail or delay pulling out of the subdivision the torque and engine weight up front w/ an assist from the back wheels seems much more stable/capable for 99% of my needs.  That, and it's really hard to get stuck (especially if you shut off traction control, which was not obvious at first) when you need engine rev's to get out.  I've also towed a good size trailer with it and it was rock solid. All in all, a very nice package with many creature comforts at a high value.",5

This car is a fantastic driver, especially in sport mode...it is very quick and agile.   In comfort setting, it is great on the road as well.   I upgraded to the better seats with cool air venting and the massages.   The massage feature are more like a parlor trick to amuse your friends, but for me not used often.   Still cool though.   Best things about the car:  quiet, great handling, audio/radio, connectivity with apple phone, seats are very comfortable, head lights are great, automatic wipers, heated steering wheel (in MN this is a very appreciated), panoramic sunroof, and being able to start it with my phone from anywhere (when I land at the airport, can start up to have it heated before I get to my car).  Also, it is a very beautiful design.....I think better looking that the Audi Q5 and Merc GLC (which were the ones I considered along with the MKX).   What I would change/shortcomings:   I have rattles in the dash that I need to get fixed, the transmission in normal mode is a little hinky on downshifts, the radio takes a few seconds to dial in the stations when you change them, and the gas mileage is lower than hoped for (I usually get between 22 and 24 depending on the how much highway.)

The dealer even picks up and delivers the car for maintenance and leaves us a loaner, all included in the price. Lots of little things add to the experience like the best Bluetooth phone I’ve ever heard. The other party has no idea I’m calling through the car even at highway speeds.

The only problem is that the seats are made of poor quality materials and are not comfortable. Headrests on front seats tilt too far forward, causing neck pain. Seat cushions do not have enough support and they are very narrow (flat part is only 11 inches wide!) and bolsters on side make sitting surface more like a U shape than a normal seat. Back of seat is too bucket-like so I end up sinking into bottom and back of seat. Even went back to dealer for assistance with adjustments but no luck. Second row seats are flatter but still not comfortable. I am a 5'7"" female and slim. MKX is now parked  in garage because I get neck and back pain when I drive it.

The 2015 was taller and more like a true SUV. The 2017 is lower and slightly wider. We opted for the 2.7L turbocharged model. The turbocharger is loud on acceleration and very annoying. Dealer said all is well and nothing wrong. Took an identical car for a test drive and its turbo also was very loud on acceleration. Test drove several other Ford vehicles that  were turbocharged and could not hear any noise upon acceleration.

It has all the safety features including backup camera, warning on cars in other lanes, collision alert, and even will call 911 if the airbags deploy.   Since it is push button start and push button transmission a lot of space was made available for storage between the front seats including two ""pass thru"" storage bins.  The Sync 3 entertainment is excellent and is also voice activated as is the navigation system.   I really appreciate the radar weather maps which give ""in the moment"" maps of the local radar--very useful.  In summary, the Lincoln MKX is a joy to drive and extremely quiet in city traffic or on the road. Everything works perfectly including the liftgate which has multiple ways of opening it(including waging your foot under the bumper).   The 2017 Lincoln MKX is a true winner.

Computer would freeze unpredictably even when driving. 5. I have been a driver of many different cars and I know how to defrost a windshield. It was impossible to get the defrost to actually do its job. Did not matter setting,heat,AC,windows open, windows closed, recycle. Nothing worked. I had to literally use my hand to wipe the condensation to avoid getting into an accident. 6. Heating system is not balanced regardless of setting..

My last two leases were MKZ's, they were awesome! I thought I'd try the MKX as a change from last two MKZ's. This is proving to be a huge disappointment. I have most every option you can get and that still does not change things. My MKX is 8 months old with only 5,000 miles on it. I have had nothing but quirky and annoying problems. While driving at night the ""Service Headlamps Light"" came on and then they quit working minutes later. I drove home with only the parking lamps on. The dealer reset the computer and they worked again. Since then that warning light has come on briefly and then gone back off. I've taken it back and they can find any fault codes stored in the computer. The carpeting has pulled away from the sills on two of the four doors. I had a very annoying rattle in the all glass moon roof. It took the dealer a week to pinpoint and repair. Also I will get exhaust fumes in the cabin when I need to accelerate quickly. The dealer changed the cabin air filter, that did nothing. The most annoying thing and something they are aware of is that hood flexes while driving on the highway. You can actually see it moving. I am afraid it's going to weaken the latch and come loose while driving. They said the flexing is because the hood is fiberglass?? I've owned many cars, expensive and inexpensive ones. Not one of them ever had a hood that flexed. The dealer has assured me that the hood will not come open, I am not convinced. An almost $60,000 vehicle should not have this issue or any other issues like I've experienced. For those of you who own a 2016/2017 MKX watch your hood as you go down the highway and you'll see what I am talking about. Hopefully the 2018 MKX went back to the drawing board before they began production?",2

It's been a year in so I have an informed knowledge of this vehicle. The positives: It's super quiet. It has an excellent ride yet takes a corner well. The overall look is nice though I will not miss the mustache grill. Power from the base engine is adequate. The kick open for the hatch works well. Sync 3 is an improvement and the Sirius works better than previously. Value for lease price is excellent. The negatives: The shifter on the stack should have haptic feedback. More than once I was in the wrong gear from not touching it hard enough. The interior still lacks a luxurious, high-quality feel. The buttons look Ford-esque. If you want to play in this league it takes more. I recently tried charging my phone and couldn't find the port. I know they are there but not in a convenient place.

Infotainment is better with Sync3 but still not on par with the competition by any means.  It SCARES me to think that with such poor electronics now, Ford is actually considering driverless vehicles in the future.  We will all perish!    The interior has cheap materials that are not very well thought through.  There is no sliding rear seat and for the money their should be.  The front is cramped with their huge console and the cargo area is chopped by the sloping hatch and drooping roofline.  The 2.7L engine has good pull but terrible fuel economy and only a 6 speed auto transmission.  Options are expensive on this vehicle.

Also the 360 camera system is useful in parking so you avoid scratching up those rims. Sound options are nice as well and If you equip it right you get lots of other features such as lane departure.

2695, on 09/09/16 16:46 PM (PDT),David ,2016 Lincoln MKX SUV Reserve 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Ups and downs," The upsides to the car: Handles and accelerates beautifully.  I have the 2.7L ecoboost and the 21 inch rims.  Power if plentiful, ride is smooth, and it handles like a much smaller sedan.   Its a driver's vehicle and oozes competence on the road. I like most of the tech features a lot, and after my last vehicle (A BMW), I'm glad to be looking at a sensibly laid-out touchscreen.  All the parking aids and such are wonderful and the stereo sounds great.  Lincoln has also been great, and I've been really happy with the dealer support.  The downsides: Even with the 22-way adjustable seat (which actually only adjusts in 7 or 8 different ways), I just can't get comfortable.  The seats crane my neck forward and the bottom seat bolsters dig into my thighs.  The ergonomics of the car are kind of a mess - as an example, the seat controls are silly complex, with multiple pull down menus and four or five different buttons.  The transmission controls are on the dash, but that doesn't wind up freeing up any usable space - you get this goofy under console shelf that is barely usable. And, too bad if you want to power your phone - the power source is at the bottom of the dash and certainly impossible to reach unless you stop the car and bend down low.   Some of the features just don't work very well: waving your foot under the back bumper rarely opens the back the first time, and the air cooled seats aren't really very cool.   MPG is abysmal (although nobody lied to me about that one - I knew that going in) and the visibility out back is atrocious.  Somewhere in the middle:  The fit and finish overall is very good, and the materials are mostly nice.  For example, the leather on the seats is high quality.  But, there are some hard cheap plastics in the interior.  Feels real upscale to me, but I never owned a Lexus or Mercedes.  I'm not entirely sure Lincoln has hit the lofty objective of competing with Lexus.",3

All the previously mentioned vehicle's are very nice but found the MKX much quieter, a joy to drive and the REVEL sound system may be better then the Mark Levinson sound system found in the RX. The REVEL blew my mind at the pure sound.  We were also very pleased with the softer ride and rarely any engine noise which were very noticeable in the RX, Mercedes and most especially the Infinit (QX50, JX60 and the small Infiniti SUV). The MKX is the most wonderful ride we have ever experienced. I rarely hear any rode noise or the sound of vehicle right next to us...due to the noise cancellation found thru-out the MKX.

The back seat is quite roomy as is the cargo area. We have the new SYNC 3 which is very easy to operate and I find it easy to figure out and operate.

Drove the Lexus RX 350 Sport & Premium.  Drove all lines of the Jaguar F-Pace.  Drove the Ford Edge Sport.   Drove Audi's line.  Drove Acura MDX.........I bought the 2.7L MKX.   Frankly, I like every one of various manufacturers offerings.  Honestly, you can't go wrong no matter what, we all live in the age of cool factor and quality overall.  But what I wanted was the blend of comfort and dead quiet cabin, with a serious engine, and the 2.7L MKX fits the bill the best of everything I drove.   The 3.7 MKX is fine, but seems a bit under powered to me.  The 2.7, is a serious motor and for a car guy/gal, this will be worth the extra bucks.  It just hauls when you need it, there is zero turbo lag, it's there, it's on, this is one very fast vehicle when the moment dictates.    We have a fully loaded vehicle, you can't put a single option more on it.   But if I could do it all again, I'd opt for the 20's, rather than the 21 inch rims, I'm just too nervous I'll scrape them when parallel parking, but the cameras all around, surely help in all aspects.   Some niggly items that are a bit hard to get used to for me, I continue to phantom on the parking break with my left leg, the pull the button break thing will take some more getting used too.   And the ""push matic"" gear selection, it's just a bit laggy between gear changes.   Some things I've learned quickly in ownership here is that most folks probably will back off on some of the safety settings, otherwise you'll fight the car for control.  It'll beep at you, flash at you, and literally steer for you, which is all good, for some, not for me.  I've dialed back the settings to suit my needs.   The steering wheel thing in full safety mode is a bit disconcerting if you even drift a hair from dead center in your lane.   My favorite part of all though is the gas pedal and the 2.7 Turbo, I can just accelerate to match anything on the road, at any speed. Favorite  part for my wife is the massaging seats, she's happy, I'm happy, and we cruise down the road in style, only 50 years young, and chuckling that my grandparents in their 70's had a Lincoln!Update.........fit and finish still excellent, nothing further to report at this time.

2699, on 08/09/16 21:36 PM (PDT),cfmillette ,2016 Lincoln MKX SUV Reserve 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Brand new Purchase: updated," OK: After researching on the Internet, and having my wife look at/drive other competitors: she decided to buy a 2016 MKX - yesterday.  So this review is very early on indeed. However: the car rides very capably and the cabin is very quiet. [I drive a sports sedan aggressively, but here the standard 3.7L V6 is fine] - we opted instead of the 2.7L Turbo engine for both the Driver Assistance and the Technology packages. Forget  the earlier Ford ""My Touch"" - the newer SCYN3 interface seems pretty intuitive. Does this car warrant the added cost compared to its ""parent"" the lower cost Ford Edge? Do not know yet, obviously. But the ambience of the driver's cabin is entirely comparable to the Lexus RX-350, the new Cadillac XT5 et.al. We decided that, yep, the cachet of the Lincoln ""name"" was worth the cost. Note please: we are an older couple with disposable income, at least to a degree. Pure economy or ecological ""Green"" thinking issues are not highly weighted in our household.Regarding my comment regarding ""Green"" thinking! Yes, if my wife and I valued this aspect to the exclusion of all else - we would both be driving a Toyota Yaris or something akin. Nope, not going to happen at this point. Plus, I have made the following calculation: 18 mpg/driving 10,000 mpy (our situation) equates to something like 556 gallons of gasoline per year. Buying instead a car with predicted 22 mpg and driving the same 10,000 may, but using premium gas? In our neighborhood based upon local gasoline pricing, this means that we SAVE about $50/year. In other words totally inconsequential.Now with 500 miles driven - we love this car. Optional safety features work exactly as advertised and already have been appreciated.Do not need a third row? Less interested in sports car experience (I get that elsewhere!)? Want comfort and safety? Willing to buy American? Consider the newest version of the Lincoln MKX.UPDATE: Now about 6 months later, still very few miles driven, but we remain entirely pleased. While there have been two recalls, but both of these were for very minor issues, nothing at all substantive. Dealership completely responsive.Interior space very conveniently organized. We very much like the front console ""pass-through""storage space created by the push button gear selector. Gas milage exactly as predicted. Many positive comments from passengers. SYNC-3 easy to use. 360 degree camera system excellent. Oh yeah, that night-time illuminated Lincoln logo Welcome Mat? While simply pure fluff and decadence, we never fail to use it when chaperoning new guests at night! Starts the conversation going immediately.Overall, my initial rating remains unchanged. This has been an excellent choice for us.Most recent update. Now with another 6 months or so experience? Our review remains unaltered. Excellent driving machine for our needs. Good engine performance, superb comfort and internal ambience (SYNC3 system), good storage capacity , not at all missing a third row seating which we did NOT need initially, safety bells /whistles have indeed been helpful. My wife and I recommend this vehicle without reservation.",5

We have not owned an American car in decades.  We test drove the usual suspects, the RX350, Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, but kept coming back to the MDX because of its powerful 2.7L Ecoboost engine, generous cabin space,  Sync 3 (Do not get the older version of Sync), as the Sync  3 is fantastic and quite intuitive.  The 4 year warranty made us feel better about buying American.  We have had our MDX for a month now and love it!  We will be taking it on a long road trip soon and we will report back about how the MDX performed. Cons: Gulps down fuel and seem to always be filling it up.",4
2702, on 07/22/16 04:59 AM (PDT),Dan H ,2016 Lincoln MKX SUV Reserve 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Happy Wife / Happy Life," My wife didn't like the exterior/interior combinations on dealer lots so we ordered our MKX and waited 7 weeks for delivery. We ordered Allure Blue w/ cappuccino interior. We are glad we waited. We drove Acura and Lexus before selecting Lincoln. We loved both the Acura RDX and MKX. Not so much for the Lexus 350. We selected the Lincoln based on two bad experiences with Honda products. My daughter hopped a curb while pulling away from a bank ATM and did $3500 damage to her Accord and my son totaled his RL without hitting anything by running off a highway into the median. I've done similar things with Ford products without any damage to suspension systems. My wife is driving the MKX and I have taken her 2001 Toyota Sienna and made it my work car. Our MKX is fairly tricked-out. The features I especially love are: adaptive cruise control (won't buy another car without it), 360 degree backup camera (Toyota calls this bird's eye view and I won't buy another car without it), rain sensing wipers, automatic on/off-high/low headlights, 2.7L engine (very smooth at moderate acceleration). My wife loves the power tailgate, seat adjustment capability (we have premium seats that allow increasing/decreasing the length of the lower cushion that allows adjustment to shorter/taller people) and the automatic synchronization with her iPhone that plays her playlist music (she is a classical pianist) anytime she enters the car rather than defaulting to the radio. We recently drove from Charleston, SC to Baton Rouge, LA. I historically hate drives longer than 10 hours. That drive, I think I could have continued to Houston. We will be taking the car in for its 5000 mile service next week. My wife and I typically expect 250,000 miles from a car so we'll be driving this one for a while. The only option that I didn't get that I might consider next time is the adaptive steering - I have to hold the steering wheel with two hands when nailing the throttle. Either the adaptive steering or AWD might help with the torque steer.",5
2703, on 07/20/16 18:28 PM (PDT),JE ,2016 Lincoln MKX SUV Select 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Just Perfect, The MKX has performed flawlessly in every facet of driving. Dependable in cold and snow to desert heart. I tried a Navigator (which is a great vehicle) but it was a bit too big for my needs. I am a big fan of distilled water and run it in the radiator (with about 20% coolant) in all my vehicles and my tractor this has worked excellent in the MKX.,5
2704, on 07/04/16 13:12 PM (PDT),Rick ,2016 Lincoln MKX SUV Reserve 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Lincoln's Luxury with small issues, I still am experiencing some small issues with some of the electronic components of the MKX that require continued service attention.  They are not major issues and are done while getting regular routine service.  I have had several problems with the heated seats and most recently my key less entry system that just went out for some reason.  The dealership has finally solved the heated seats issue and I have to admit that I still absolutely love this vehicle.  We just purchased an 2018 Audi A6 sedan for my wife and it was priced significantly higher that the Lincoln and doesn't have half of the safety features that the MKX has.  The comfort and quietness of the cabin on the Lincoln is much more than that of the Audi.  We currently average approximately 24 mpg while traveling the interstate and 19 mpg around town.  I would still recommend that people check out the Lincoln and they may be pleasantly surprised.,4
2705, on 07/03/16 15:30 PM (PDT),carled63 ,2016 Lincoln MKX SUV Reserve 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),X Marks the Spot," I love my 2016 Lincoln MKX Reserve.  I looked a lot for a compact SUV that would have pedestrian alert and a 5-star IIHS safety rating.  I also preferred one that had a lot of American content.  I just could not find one that met my needs, and the ones that came closest--TBH--felt kind of cramped.  I almost went with the MKC--a little concerned on size and very disappointed it did not have pedestrian alert.  Then the salesman pointed out that the MKX had the 5-star rating with top-of-the-line pedestrian alert.  In 5 minutes I decided to go for it, and I have not been disappointed!  The car looks great--inside and out.  I think the materials and look of the inside, in particular, are very high end.  I also love driving the car; it is super quiet and smooth with very competent handling.  I went with Reserve but skipped the Revel stereo, the 2.7 L turbo and the 22-position seats.  Those all sound nice, but they add a lot to the price, and I am not that picky.  I don't regret those choices.  The premium (i.e., standard) stereo is fine.  I did find that setting the option to adjust the volume with your speed helps a lot.  I also think the 3.7 L base engine has plenty of power and is very smooth.  Also, the standard seats are super comfortable with plenty of adjustments--recline, height, lumbar, thigh support, etc.  I also like the extra space of the mid-size SUV vs. a compact.  There are so many times I would cram stuff in the back of my last compact SUV, and I am finding it a surprising relief to have the extra space that a mid-size provides.   Lincoln has also delighted me once or twice.  For example, the cooled front seats are great on hot days.  The power steering wheel adjustment made me smile too.  And I enjoyed how simple the technology has been to set up.  My car has Sync 3, and it is both easy to set up and is very intuitive to operate.  My only slight disappointment is the gas mileage.  It is more or less as advertised--and that is lower than with most compacts.  That is the price you pay for space.",5

BUT do not let them sell you on the My Touch navigation system.  They are moving all this year to Sync 3 which is great but are still selling early 2016 models with My Touch - It is frustrating, slow and will leave you stranded. I had a loaner with the Sync 3 and it was night and day.  I love this car but I bet I will get rid of it within 3 years due to the navigation system....It takes forever to compute and randomly the keyboard just disappears. I have taken it in and they can't do anything about it... I would recommend this car to anyone as long as you don't get suckered into the old nav system.I do have to say that the service folks and Gwinnett Lincoln have been a pleasure to deal with. I do wish the Lincoln dealership/Service was  completely separate from Ford due to it is very busy but the staff does go above and beyond.12/26/16 updated review - the car has been in the shop 7 time in less than 9K mile  for various forms of issues. Twice for throttle rod where the car just dies in traffic and then will only go 5 mph which is extremely dangerous in ATL traffic.  The computer is this car is buggy - errors show up on the dash and I take pics with my cell and then Lincoln can not replicate it. The lift gate sensors are unpredictable and come down on you for no reason.  I would never purchase this car again due to the computer system...It is great when it wants to work. The navigation system still blacks out for no reason.  It still drives like a dream and is very comfortable, I love all the cameras to park, back up etc. The other think I absolutely hate is since I spend so much time at the Lincoln service center is that it is also mixed with the Gwinnett ford dealership and therefore it is always chaotic. If you want to buy a luxury car then my advice is to avoid this car and also go with someone that has a stand alone dealership and is has a longer time in the marketplace - Maybe 2017 they will get the bugs worked out. I did not pay 50K plus for a car that I have to drive 45 min each way to the dealership every other week to drive a loaner.",3

We had rented a full-size sedan, but were offered the MKX instead. We agreed and fell in love. I had rented suvs in the past, but had never owned one and never thought I would. I've always been a luxury car guy.  We drove the MKX around town for 9 days and were very reluctant to turn it in. My wife and I joked about driving it back to Florida instead of flying. We could find no faults. When we returned home, I began my quest for a new suv since we had become believers. I considered Lincoln, BMW, Jaguar, Range Rover and Cadillac. We researched and test drove all. Everything considered, we easily chose the MKX, not only for best value, but we also just liked it better than the others. We ended up with one identical to the one we had rented - white with cappuccino interior, 3.7 liter, Reserve level.  We recently returned from a 1,500-mile road trip, had no problems and are even more pleased.  After 1 1/2 months and a total of 1,650 miles, we know we made the right decision.",5

The vehicle is stunning having cooled seats, heated seats and one of the best quality stereo systems I have ever heard. My wife has a ML350 Mercedes and she pays more per month than I do and my MKX has significantly more features and; better quality features. The back seats are significantly larger and roomier than my prior 2014 Lincoln MKX. The driving is superior and my favorite feature of this vehicle is the extremely quiet cabin. Going 80 mph on the highway, you can hear a pin drop. I am a Trial Attorney in Miami and I am constantly driving all throughout town. This vehicle is nothing but exceptional. I will continue buying Lincoln forever so long as they keep the great job.

Lincoln hit it out of the park with this vehicle. My MKX Reserve is a blast to drive.  It is very fast (2.7 twin turbo option) and nimble (in sport mode). The vehicle is also a show stopper! I ordered the 21"" tires and optional rims and it is a striking look.   The optional massaging seats makes any long drive a pleasure.  Be sure to order this option.  It is worth every penny.   The vehicle is super quiet but in sport mode, you can hear the exhaust kick in when you punch it.  People that have ridden in the vehicle with me comment on how quiet the ride is.  The vehicle is great in the snow!  The build quality is phenomenal!  The fit and finish is first rate.  Ignore any comments to the contrary that you made read online.  They are not accurate.  Just listen to the doors when you close them.  Solid build quality.  I road tested a 2016 BMW X3 M with twin turbos, Porsche Cayenne S, Mercedes Benz GLE 350, Acura MDX and the based on road tests and pricing, the Lincoln wins hands down.  My personal favorite was the Porsche Cayenne S.  However, with similar options to the Lincoln, I was looking at 90k.  I custom ordered the MKX from the factory with the options I wanted and the Lincoln dealer discounted the MSRP by 10% which you won't find on the BMW, Porsche, or Mercedes Benz. There were also additional rebates available from the manufacturer.  The Revel sound system (basic Revel upgrade, not the 4k upgrade) is phenomenal and better than my prior Bose system.  I am averaging 29 mph on the highway and 23 overall with 800 miles on the odometer.  Did I mention how fast this vehicle is?  Zoom Zoom.   I never would have even considered a Lincoln till I read a review on Edmunds so I decided to take it for a test drive.   Boy, am I glad I did.    Note that the vehicle came from the factory with the Sync 3 system.  There are a lot of complaints in reviews I read online since the MKXs that were test driven had the old SYNC system.  The new Sync 3 system is quick, intuitive, easy to use, and offers unbelievable possibilities.  The vehicle is synced to the Wi Fi at my house and downloads app updates when it is parked at night!  I can also access SIRI through the hands free feature and have her read and reply to my texts!  If you are looking at any of the high end imports, I strongly recommend that you test drive an MKX Reserve with the 2.7 twin turbos.  You will not be disappointed.",5

Less than 50,000 miles later, and it is now September 2017;  and the engine needs to be replaced... $7,100 - $7,200.   Are you kidding???  That is unacceptable.   Oh, and the dealership never heard of this problem happening!!!  Really ????   After reading numerous articles through various forums about Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX engines, I see that this is a huge problem.  There is  NO  way that any Ford or Lincoln dealership is not aware of this happening.   I purchased this Lincoln after having owned a 1999 Mercury Mountaineer Premier which was a terrific vehicle.   It seemed like a good idea even though it was extremely disappointing that the Mercury brand dissolved.  Shame on the salesman who took me on that trade-in and then sold me a junky MKX --- no quality.Update:  3/31/18 - So, ever since the engine was replaced(October), there has been a rattle ( a sound like a wire rattling around ), mostly above 65 mph, which is why I did not hear it until traveling on the interstate. The mechanic shop that I had the engine replaced is a 1 to 1/2. hr. drive, and I work full-time, so going back to that shop was a mistake to begin with and something I am unable to do now.  I went to the local Lincoln dealer where I had originally purchased my car to have an oil change and check this noise.  Of course they saw nothing, and said to come back if it continues.  I had told them that you do not hear the noise until going over 65 mph.  And I cannot spend another couple of hundred dollars on yet another car rental for mine to be in the shop and ""hope"" they find the rattle.  So my rating of this vehicle continues to be poor.   When I finish paying it off, I will certainly be getting another vehicle and it will not be a Lincoln or a Ford.",1
2725, on 05/22/17 06:48 AM (PDT),FrankC ,2011 Lincoln MKX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),"Unreliable, expensive, poor ride quality."," People should know that the MKX is not a good car. This is not my first Lincoln. I had a 90 Town Car that I drove a quarter million miles before trading it to the dealer for a Navigator that I drove for 385,000 miles. I still own my 1998 Mark VIII and that car is incredibly reliable. Not incredibly reliable for a 20 year old car, but just plain reliable; it's as good as a new car, and far better than the MKX. The MKX has problems that are well-known with the touch screen. The software is poor. The hardware is unreliable, though ford extended the warranty for the FCP. But it's not just the navigation and entertainment system that's awful. I had an oil pressure problem that cost $500 to fix. The PTU went bad, which costs $2,200 to replace. There are articles on all of the Edge/MKX forums about people having problems with PTUs that fail anywhere from 50,0000 to 80,000. The panoramic sunroof sticks. The dealer says that it's normal but there have been times that I've had to pull it closed while holding the close button. I just don't use that expensive option anymore. I've been seeing a lot of people complaining about water pump problems. In ford's genius, they put the water pump BEHIND the timing chain cover so that when the seals fail, the coolant goes straight into the oil pan, displaces the engine oil, and destroys the engine. If you get lucky and look very carefully at a small hole near the alternator, you may see the start of coolant weeping and have the water pump replaces ($2,300) before it fails. Or, like most people, not see any signs of problems until the pump fails. New engine $7,000. Google is your friend, look for yourself and see how many people are having problems. The problem with these issues is that the PTU is used on all the all wheel drive fords, the water pump is in the same place on all of ford's V6 engines. The scope of the problem is massive. Just buy something else.",1

Excellent support service department at mcdavid dealership.  Bought at end of model year and think i paid toi much.  Probably will get another one.  Navigation too complicated,5
2727, on 12/05/16 12:33 PM (PST),Walt ,2011 Lincoln MKX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Pros and Cons," Pros. . . Very comfortable heated and cooled memory front seats. Especially comfortable and workable for my handicapped wife. Looks good, people often comment on what a ""nice looking vehicle"" it is. Cruise control is very good; will keep you within a few mph of setting whether going up or down grades. Back up camera is very helpful. Cons. . .GPS is a disaster. It will not respond to owner manual instructions to set up destinations, whether by voice or touch. Plus the route it takes you on to get somewhere is very often miles out of the way. Not even a close match to a simple Garmin. Has expensive to fix quirks like check engine light. Even though we have the ""full"" warranty, the dealership charges us $100 to use the warranty, and repairs are often ""not covered."" A simple 100K check up cost me almost $1,000 because a little problem (their words) was not fully covered under the warranty. We bought the vehicle used and got the full extended bumper to bumper warranty (so we were told). Guess they are not dealers of their word. Touch screen has its issues as well. If I touch the Navigation screen to look ahead for turns it will respond and jump ahead, however when I touch to return to where we are on the route, it tells me that it will not respond when the vehicle is moving. Really? It just did respond, but now it will not and it leaves me lost for the moment. There is a setting in the electronic section that says it will memorize certain of your settings. Sometimes it loses its memory. Example, you are supposed to set a temperature you like and by touching ""My Temp"" on the dash, it is supposed to go to that setting. It will not keep that setting, no matter how many times I follow the due process. Since first posting this, more electronic problems have arisen. Presently in the midst of having the passenger door handle replaced. Getting ""Passenger Door Ajar"" warning light, even though the door is not ajar. This replacement will cost approx $500. I understand it is a common problem. Shouldn't Lincoln cover this with a call back? And the list goes on. . .",3

Tt drives great and would be a terrific commuter if not for the MyLincoln Touch system.  Which is awful!  It is enough to make me dislike the entire car and I regret buying it.  It's not responsive, the buttons are too small, the screens are busy, and even the physical volume and fan swipe controls often don't respond.  It's a worse hazard than using a smartphone while driving, I am amazed that vehicles are allowed to use this design.  I have set a rule for myself that I do not use it except for very minimal commands while driving because it's such a distraction from the road.  And since I commute 2 hours a day, that's a lot of time to spend with a junky system.  I'm disappointed and embarrassed that I spent a lot of money on this car.  I will probably trade it in on something else.  This is the first time I've ever contemplated doing that, I've kept all my other cars for over 10 years and enjoyed them.  This one was a mistake.",3

The engine/trans has a decided lag between pressing the pedal and when it actually starts to accelerate. The steering has a 'notch' at its neutral position, wherever that may be at the time, where reversing input on the wheel causes it to skip about 2 degrees before the power unit kicks over, then it's reasonably smooth. The instrument panel appears very plain and poorly-designed, with several functions such as outside air temp and time only displayed far down on the center console; too much info the driver needs is not within the driver's most important view. For a car of its size, it has poor head- and legroom for a 6'2 driver, especially with the panoramic sunroof; there is no place to put one's left foot comfortably, and the driver's knees invariably end up against very hard plastic corners on both the door-mounted armrest and the center console. There is not enough rearward travel on the seat, and raising the seat also moves it forward, so there is nothing gained there; the seat is comfortable around town, but after a long highway trip, the driver's legs, hips and back can be very stiff and sore. The SYNC system is easily the worst infotainment system on the market (this is the 201 version - it has been upgraded several times since then); not only does it not sync at all with some mass-market phones (i.e. this reviewer's Samsung Galaxy Note 3), it often gets stuck in the connection mode and will not switch to any other using any of the buttons, and the car has to be shut off to reset it. The manual tuning knob has no detents, so changing a station requires both finesse and the driver's eyes far to the right and down - a small turn usually skips through 2 stations, yet trying to move through several stations rapidly is a chore worse than trying to use a corkscrew - after several turns, you find you've only gone through 7 or 8 stations. The USB port does not have enough power to charge a phone.

This vehicle is replacing a BMW that I had for 3 years and the car was wonderful so the MKX needed to fill big shoes and it did.

This SUV does everything I want. The cargo space if perfect for Costco runs, small items of furniture and similar. With the rear seats folded down there is more room, but because they don't lay flat, the extra room acquired is flattened since the lowest point is closer to the ceiling.  So, a bicycle, 2x4s, but nothing bulky.                                                                          The seats are comfortable, the car is responsive and quick enough to get out of hazardous situations. Braking is good (although apparently it takes 10 feet longer to stop than others SUVs in this class) I have had no maintenance/recall issues and I am at 55,000 miles.  Mileage is OK. If I drove in the city I would assuredly have bought a different vehicle, since it's hard to see, the mileage really declines in the city,  and the frame is essentially a giant box on wheels, which makes parking an adventure. The cons: mediocre sound system and poor visibility sides and rear. I even bought an aftermarket system, but it still isn't quite what I wanted. (My MKX is the standard model, and so had the low end sound system). Because the last thing you want to do is take out the factory unit, you have to add and tinker with components until you get the sound you want.",4

I did purchase pre-owned with over 60,000 miles but I love the 3.7 V6 and transmission pairing. My mom has a 2013 as well, both of us enjoy it a lot. You can sit back and ride along with traffic comfortably, but when you need to get up and go or maneuver though traffic, the transmission and 3.7 V6 are quick and power you through what you need. It handles great around corners and through town. It's not too big but just big enough, anytime  I have rear passengers they always compliment the room they have and the heated seats.  My only complaint is the shifter, sometimes it doesn't know it's in Park and you have to jiggle the button a little, and after turning a corner when it's going into 2nd gear it's a tiny clunky, but my last car (Mazda) has the same issue, so I'm light with the gas pedal after turning corners.",5

I had a Jeep prior to the Lincoln and could hear and feel every pebble and crack in the road.  The heated steering wheel is a god-send here in New Hampshire.  I bought this vehicle used with only 12,000 miles and what a deal!  The gas mileage isn't the greatest at about 22mpg but thankfully gas is fairly cheap right now.

It feels like something is loose in the steering system. We am getting that looked at today. Other that that we am not quite used to the dash controls yet. Our verdict is still out on the dash controls, change always takes some getting used to. We like the reliability and performance so far. We average 3 to 4 more MPG than our old Nissan with much better performance. The Interior is very comfortable, easy to get into and out of.

I have since replaced the rotors at 35k miles.  Yes I ""still"" have the car - hauls kids hockey equipment well.At one year, my battery needed replacing after many complaints of odd electrical malfunctions.My wipers still go on for no reason, on a completely sunny day sitting at a stop light.My radio features sometimes go awry, not going to preset channel or displaying two different stations on the dash compared to instrument cluster screen.Acceleration is sluggish, once you're going ride is comfortable.Absolutely hate the blinker.Every time I use it I think its going to break and sometimes I flash my brights just using it.Too hard to operate - what we're they thinking?!?  Wasn't it tested?All weather tires are terrible in the snow/rain.  Hate to spend extra $ on winter tires although many do, but I have one tire that's sounding out of round and need a new set (even though they have half tread left).Road noise is overwhelming and more than I should have for a ""luxury"" vehicle.Once it turned past 50k and out of b2b warranty, started having issues with shifter and car recognizing its in ""P"" or park.  I have to fiddle with the shifter trigger every time until P is orange, then message goes away.New issue at 68k miles - common to Edge / MKX - Door ajar, sensor issue.  Cost appears to be $375+.  Drivers door appears to be ajar, open/close and hope it goes away.  However one night after getting dash message to disappear I was driving down the road and system thought door was open, dash indicator appeared and all cabin lights came on making it very difficult to see.  Had to pull over and open/close door until message went away.Also new issue:  Driving home, car just killed.  Lost power steering, power brakes.  Put it in park and started it again.  Really!?!  No codes appeared - well of course not!  Tech said its very hard to determine but did advise me not to leave key fob in the car or vicinity of the car.  It tries to make contact with the computer and may drain fob battery.  Thinks ""maybe"" day it killed there was a contact loss between fob and car and it didn't detect car was being driven with a key in it so it killed the engine.  I get the ""No Key Detected"" all the time, even with key in cup holder, my pocket, purse.  Doesn't matter.  I did purchase winter tires for this car and what a world of difference it makes.  Bluetooth speaker is slightly behind the visor, making it hard for others to hear you.70k mile update - Traded.Dealer said door sensor is a $4-500 fix.  Part alone is $180.  Common for driver and passenger front doors.  Sadly, no Ford recall on the issue currently.  I could try the contact spray fix first, but many say it doesn't fix the problem.  I'm opening/closing my door 4-8 times each time I open it just to get the sensor to realize it's really closed.  This car has too many electrical issues for me to deem it reliable enough to repair and fix it.  Other than that, I did like the vehicle and would have rather kept it.  Electrical issues can be a hit/miss fix and end up costing thousands.  Hopefully someone else enjoys it, it lasts awhile and they don't get stalled somewhere.",3

2803, on 12/18/13 08:30 AM (PST),sloanbj ,2013 Lincoln MKX SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Excrescence," Lincoln was once a proud brand and builder of significant American luxury cars. The brand died altogether more than 20 years ago but Ford has not yet caught on to this news.The MKX is an appalling vehicle. The exterior and interior design are both revolting and non-functional. This is Ford Edge remodeled by Stevie Wonder. It is beyond me how, in 2013, a carmaker could offer such a poor design. For example, none of the buttons or switches inside are logically placed or obvious to use. Buttons on the steering wheel require removing your hands to access. Buttons are the dash are microscopically small and usually take many attempts to operate. The touch screen is just a mess. ",1.875

2806, on 07/26/13 22:55 PM (PDT),aaayron ,2013 Lincoln MKX SUV 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 6A),Never Lease From Lincoln," It's a bad idea to lease anything from Lincoln. Did you know that at the end of your lincoln lease, if you want to trade in your lincoln to anyone else but Lincoln, they will not release the car to anyone but you (the lessee) or a Lincoln dealer. I found this out the hard way today when i went to trade my leased Lincoln in for a cadilac. The cadilac dealership was giving me a good price that would have covered the payoff and the last 3 payments on my lease, but they would not allow cadillac to buy the car. being over my mileage, I could have avoided the mileage fees, excess wear and the last 3 payments. Now i have to use half my down payment i set asside just to get out of my lease.",3.75

All the reviews that said that scared me away - finally a friend talked me into driving one, and then I was sold.  Much smoother ride, nicer appointments, better warranty, quieter interior, and trans shifts better than the Edge.

Lincoln's so called premium product is very ordinary. The doors were misaligned by almost 5"" , windows didnt close properly and the door handle was not properly secured to the door. There were loose screws everywhere and 1 week after taking it home the rattle was unbearable. Then came the gear shifter, they changed the sequence for safety reasons for which I had to take it back to the dealership. The mechanic didnt know how to change it as he wasnt trained, so i had to wait 2 weeks before i got the car back.  Once back the a/c stopped working and it took another 2 weeks to get that fixed. In my 3 years of driving this car there were 5 recalls, none of which the dealer informed me about. Everytime I asked they said there werent any parts or the recall wasnt serious enough. Final straw against EVER buying another Lincoln was the transmission, after year #2 it would jerk, stop and go and painfully you could feel the teeth meshing and shifting into gear. I informed the dealer of this and they quickly brushed it aside. The leather was plush, the instrumentation top class but the rear seat was a torture to get in and get out of. I wont buy another Lincoln ever again. For the same price you can get a Lexus or Acura, there is no way the MKC even comes close to competing with top class luxury.",2

He sent me to look at the MKC.  After a five minute test drive I bought it.  I live in West Virginia in a rural area on a mountain top.  It handles the twist and turns and ruff roads with ease.  It has never left me stuck on the snow or ice.  It climbed up the mountain during a winter storm without slipping once.  It's beautiful to look at (much better than the boring Honda CRV) and fun to drive.  When traveling I can take it out of Sport mode (I use this on the twisty back roads I drive daily) and place it in Comfort mode.  I have two small issues with it; cargo area and SYNC.  It has half the storage area of my old Grand Cherokee and I have the first edition of the SYNC and it has a couple of bugs that have been worked out in the second edition.  All in all I love it.  It's beautiful to look, comfortable for my 5'9 middle aged body, and easy and fun to drive.",5
2821, on 04/10/18 13:38 PM (PDT),Ben ,2015 Lincoln MKC SUV Black Label 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Good car but VERY ford!," My family has a lot of cars; this one is perfect for my Mom. While technology, safety, and ease of use is exceptional this car lacks refinement. While quieter than many other cars, once you hit 70mph you will hear road noises, this is masked by having an amazing sound system (better than most cars). The drive is generally soft and smooth, and the first time you drive it it’s a good amount of fun; but after the 14th-1000th drive it feels artificial. Electric steering has no feeling, acceleration is all or nothing with a touchy throttle, the car handles well but only because of torque vectoring (safety feature where some of the will wheels brake indpendently as determined by computer), and the engine has a very annoying grinding sound especially at high revs. Braking; however, is very smooth and much better than any previous ford I’ve been in. There’s a very unrefined jerk the car gives when you shift into drive, or when you take your foot off the gas. Interior is good, it’s very attractive with customizable lights and attractive gauges but again like a Ford it gets small details done exceptionally well but massively drops the ball on large quality details. Steering wheel feels cheaper than what you’d expect on a nissan, there are gaps underneath the cover with the lincoln badge big enough for a finger. The plastic bits on major areas you make contact with everyday feel poorly held together, and the key is just chrome covered plastic.        Alright all that out of the way, why do I say car is 4/5 stars over all? It’s more reliable than similar cars and a better value. Although I personally dislike it and notice all the small issues (and left several out) the cars only major flaws are a lack of refinement. If you’re looking for a crossover suv that looks really nice and is loaded with features that drive the car for you, you’re in luck. While driving you won’t even notice the lack of refinement if you haven’t driven a hundred other cars. Most of it is superficial, and the sound system is so good you might just not care anyway. All in all the low information gauges (which I haven’t previously mentioned) are much more annoying than the cost cutting feel of the car. Because of this 3 or 4 out of 5 stars is the most accurate way to describe the car.",4

2823, on 12/26/17 08:49 AM (PST),Katrina ,2015 Lincoln MKC SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Overall a nice car.., It's a fun ride with all the bells and whistles that you would expect when buying a luxury car. The heated steering wheel is probably my favorite feature. The blind spot sensors are nice as well. Great acceleration and a quiet engine.. sleek interior and exterior. It's a beautiful car. I've only owned my MKC for a month and the major con thus far is the gas milage. I'm averaging 20mph and seem to be running the to gas station more frequently than I would have expected. The trunk space is a little tight as well. My 20 lb dog's crate hardly fit in the trunk and left little room for anything else. I guess this is to be expected for a smaller SUV.. the MKX would be a little more spacious.,4
2824, on 12/19/17 07:49 AM (PST),Bill'nJohn ,2015 Lincoln MKC SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Better than the Q5," I was shopping for a used late model Audi Q5 but didnt want the black leather interior, which eliminates about 80% of the Q5s on the road.  We went to five different Audi dealers when we found used models with low miles and light colored interiors, and all five times we found out someone beat us to the purchase.  Meanwhile, we had driven the MKC and really liked it, but had our hearts set on the Audi.  After the 5th time of getting the door slammed in our face, we circled back to the MKC and bought it, it was a dealer demo model with the Reserve trim and all the bells and whistles.  I'm so glad we bought the MKC.  Performance wise, its very similar to the Q5, but it costs less and has more features.  I particularly like the way the SYNC3 system works so flawlessly.  I also like some of the ""little touches"" Lincoln added such as the illuminated welcome mat at night, the speedometer showing a small icon with the posted speed limit on it, and the multiple ports for device connectivity (which the Audi didn't offer).  The MKC looks great inside and out, is quiet and smooth behind the wheel, and our limited dealership experiences have been terrific.  Do yourself a favor and test drive this car before you buy an SUV from Audi, Acura, Volvo or BMW.",5

I've got 20K miles on it now, and it is the best car I've ever owned. The only issue I had was that this car sat on the lot for about 13 months, and the tires were ""flat"" from not being driven very much. I got such a great trade-in deal that I didn't mind taking those tires, and after 3K miles they rounded out and I've very satisfied.

There is room for improvement in the seat controls and lumbar support, but otherwise it is the most comfortable car I have ever had for long trips. It was also better than every other luxury car I test drove at cancelling out noise from the outside. MPG is not as great as it could be, and some of the interior finishes are made of junky plastic that can break or scratch easily, the storage compartment that exists in lieu of a traditional shift gear is poorly designed for ideal use, and it is easy to inadvertently hit the shift gear buttons---luckily my dogs can't reach the break pedal at the same time to shift from park, but they do often turn on the hazard lights if I leave them alone!",5

2829, on 01/29/17 14:58 PM (PST),Sabomnim ,2015 Lincoln MKC SUV 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Lincoln MKC- I had no idea I would like it so much," I bought my 2015 Lincoln MKC used and have owned it 2 weeks and put approximately 1,000 miles on it including a round trip road trip and daily commuting to and from work. I really like this little SUV and wish I had test driven one earlier. I found an almost completely loaded “Reserve” model with lots of nice options including a Technology Package. Mine has the 2.0 eco boost engine and is FWD. I’m 54, 6’ and 190#’s – I just give this as reference so you know who is reviewing the vehicle. I have owned many vehicles from domestics, imports, sedans, coupes, and full size SUVs. I have owned several of the newer iteration Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit’s – I really loved my 2013 but was not as impressed with my 2015 so I sold it and began my search for another vehicle. Recently, I test drove (all used but newer) Mercedes GLK, Audi Q5, and a Cadillac SRX. I really wanted to like all of these cars but for one reason or another did not feel right in them. I realize that there are lots of personal preferences that go into a car decision- that’s why there are so many choices! So I was searching and found the Lincoln MKC at a dealership and decided to check it out – I really didn’t think I was going to like it.First impression, the exterior styling and fit and finish on the MKC is very good; it is a very solid looking vehicle. The interior- very nice. Again, fit and finish and materials used are very good. Not only do they look good, the interior is very attractive – it looks much better in person than in pictures. Driver and front passenger’s seats – very comfortable and contouring to the body. The leather is very supple and feels like very good quality. I did not think I would like the ‘push button’ gear selector but if frees up for more storage space and it’s actually kind of cool. Took the MKC for a road test and again, super impressed. So, I bought it!Here are the things I really like about this car: 1) The fit and finish and materials used are all very good. The MKC I bought had 21,000 miles on it and I hear no creaks, squeaks, or unwanted noises! 2) the vehicle is very comfortable and quiet 3) The ride is very nice and smooth- it feels like you are in a much bigger vehicle. If you want a little more responsiveness, however, the ‘sport’ mode gives you just that – the sport mode is definitely more fun to drive in. 4) acceleration for this vehicle is amazing to have a 2.0 turbo engine – the engine is refined and quiet 5) in the short time I have owned it, with a combo of around town and interstate driving, I am averaging right at 27 miles per gallon 6) Lots of nice features, great stereo, pano roof, lots of tech stuff, voice activated tech, heated and cooled seats  7) decent utility for a small SUVSome things you may not like: 1) this is an overall fairly small SUV – I’m 6’ and find it plenty accommodating for me. 2) The back seat space is fairly limited – if you are car pooling or taking adult size children around, it may be too small. 3) If you truly need and SUV for hauling some cargo and lots of stuff in the back, again, this one is on the small side. 4) The tech and navigation takes a little bit to get used to, but it is not bad. If you are in the market for a smaller SUV, I highly recommend you test drive a Lincoln MKC; I have been pleasantly surprised.",5
2830, on 10/14/16 16:51 PM (PDT),E. Prescott ,2015 Lincoln MKC SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),2015 Rust after 1 year," The car is fun to drive, and is comfortable. However it's like putting lipstick on a pig. I have been in and out of service for the last year, and a half. Is it great I get a rental each time. Sure is. At would have been worse without it. The amount of trips I have had to the dealer planning around my family is not something I expected in owning a brand new luxury vehicle. I was in for a broken amp 4 times. Headline did not fit from the factory, it took four attempts to fix. My automatic mirrors went on the fritz, and that is common in these vehicles. I was back and forth to the dealer during rush hour which was a far drive. Then there is the rust, at around a year in my husband found it. Now my husband washes and waxes my vehicle regularly. I have never had a vehicle rust in the first year. Yes Lincoln removed the rust. So far twice at two different dealers. These are both on the front drivers doors on the bottom along the wedge. We started wondering why our vehicle rusted after a year. Then I started noticing that after a hard rain, when I would open the door water would gush out. My husband noticed he could put his thumbnail in the seam right below where the rust was. Clearly this was the cause. Lincoln however and their service departments refuse to recognize this as a problem, or rectify the issue. We found a site where the GMC Terrains and Equinox's have the same water issue, and they suggested replacing the  weather seal around the frame of the door. Lincoln's response was GM's doors are engineered differently, and ""the doors are doing what they are engineered to do"" At this point I started doing reviews on Lincoln's Facebook page. Slowly my links are being deleted, and I found others who had the same thing happen. Lincoln is not a reputable company. Also if you look up Ford Rust, or Look up Ford Escape Rust it is all over in the same spot on the doors on the Escapes. Sounds like an engineering defect. I would caution anyone from buying any products from Ford/Lincoln. I know I won't be buying on in my lifetime.",2

They both had many of the same features, but we like the more luxurious interior and eye catching exterior of the MKC.  The RDX just looks like another Honda on the road and we wanted something else.  We have the 2.0 and find it has plenty of power.  The transmission shifts smoothly and we love the Sport mode.  At night the car has so many great lighting features including the welcome mat, lighted outside and inside door handles and the ambient interior lighting (with 6 color choices).  Our only negative feedback is the back seat room when the front seats are pushed all the way back - a little snug.  However, our car has the heated back seats and that makes up for it in the winter time!  I would recommend this car to anyone that wants to feel like they are driving a European car but wants to by American.",5

Boy - what a weekend that was...Phew!! I test drove Lincoln MKc twice - both the 2.0 and 2.3L version. The ride was amazing. So smooth - so elegant and luxurious. Definitely won my heart and purchased it. The customer care at my dealership was amazing and I should give the 5+ start for that. Very helpful and patient. The ride remained smooth only for a month or so and the rattling and vibration, road noise started slowly filtering in. If I am parked and talking on my Bluetooth - it can easily heard from outside - no privacy. My music is also heard as if the windows are open. Same with the wind noise the air tight noise control lasted a limited time. I have 50K + miles on my odometer and the highway mileage is 90% of it and still my avg mpg is 20.3. And I do no drive on traffic highways or rush hours times. The roof material tucked into the door on the drivers side ias already out of the tucking and looks so trashy - happened with few months of purchase. Sure the car is amazing on test drives and even when you maintain it well and treat it gently and drive mostly highways the roughness and brittle start showing fast. The quality is the issue. The other thing that really bather me the bother me the fact the pick up - I am definitely OK is slow pick for a 4 cylinder, but the ecoboost - it just jerks your head if you accelerate really slow during stop and go traffic(thankfully not request for)",3

Contacted the Dealership and was told this chip was from 2014 and no update until 2017. Was told to look up the address on my computer or phone then input it into the Nav system.

I came from a 2013 Ford Escape SEL leather heated seats etc. with the 1.6 engine front wheel drive. That vehicle was wonderful and enjoyed it very much.  I wanted to have a little bit of bling in my life, so when my lease was up I went over to the Lincoln store and leased a MKC front wheel drive with the 2.0 engine. All I can say is WOW! leather heated seats, (and the seats are super comfortable), the new SYNC 3 is great user friendly,& remote start a big plus and it even comes in the base Model Lincoln. I live in Minnesota and went with the front wheel drive again. This vehicle rides nice and smooth, very quiet inside the cabin, heats up very well nice and toasty inside the vehicle. It must be do to the bigger engine going from a 1.6 eco boost to a 2.0 eco boost. Only Ford and Lincoln offer the eco boost engines another one of their trade marks fun and zippy and great fuel economy.  I love the remote start, the head lights are bright at night another WOW factor,  sync 3 the sound quality when making a hands free calls the clarity is outstanding, the seats are super comfortable. You never have to reach for your keys walk up to the door the vehicle knows you are approaching it and on the ground is the puddle light with the big Lincoln logo greeting upon entering your vehicle glowing at night time. Price point this starts where the Ford Escape Titanium ends. Fords do make Lincolns and this is their premier line up in addition to the Ford family. I love it so much I have had it for less than a week and have already put 170 miles on it. I could go on and on about how great of a vehicle this is from the ride, to the features to the comfort.

We really linked the appearance and feel of the Limited, but I've had more than my share of problem vehicles and it was clear from the 5 for, 43 against, owner reviews that we should avoid that SUV like the plague.  In the end, we feel in love with the Lincoln MKC and so far we have not regretted the purchase.  It's amazingly smooth riding and quiet -- it's even better than my 2006 Mercedes E500 -- and yet very peppy.  We wanted the 2.0L engine, but wound up with a loaded model which came with the 2.3L ecoboost.  Interestingly enough, however, on a recent trip home from Williamsburg, VA we found we were getting 28 mph rather than the advertised 26 mph for the AWD model.  What we really love about it is it's quite responsive and great on gas for a luxury SUV, but runs on regular, and I'm not talking 89, but 87 octane fuel.  The dealer told is it's designed to use the regular 87 octane and to not be afraid to do so.  Amazing and it uses considerably less fuel than my wife's previous vehicle, an Infinity G37 coupe, which ran on premium only.",5

The first being, I am a empty nester, 2nd I am retiring soon, and lastly I wanted to own a vehicle that would be fully equipped with all of the bells and whistles. I deserve it! Having the vehicle for one year, I could not be more pleased.  This vehicle is worth every penny that I spent. It is a very good looking car, and holds itself quite nicely compared to other small luxury cuvs. I have been getting exceptional gas mileage in the city. This vehicle handles quite nicely and is very quiet. I have read reviews where some critics argue that it does not handle like some other sport cuvs. If I wanted a sporty car, I would by a ""sports car."" I want a smooth, quiet, soft ride. The safety features, the technology, real leather heated and cooled seats, you cannot beat it for the price. European vehicles would cost a lot more with the same packages. I know this for a fact!

Admittedly, the only reason I thought about this car was those silly commercials.  But still, I took a look and was surprised.  For the sticker price on the lot, you cannot compare this to some of the cars mentioned in Edmunds review.  I put $45k as a top on what I wanted to pay.  My local dealers did not have an MB GLK or Audi Q5 for less than $47k on the lot.  And the only BMW X3 I found under $50k didn't even have nav!  Really?   Yes, there was a Volvo XC60 or two that fit in my range.  But not as loaded as I was able to get my MKC.  I got the upgrade 2.3l engine, awd, the nav package, and several other options, including the incredible panoramic roof for $44k before any haggling or rebates.  I would say this model straddles segments as it more directly competed in price with the MB GLA class, BMW X1, Infiniti QX50, Audi Q3, and Volvo XC70, all of which I'd call tall wagons.  None had the ride height of the MKC.  The only vehicle I would say directly competes is the Acura RDX.  It did have more space and otherwise had similar features for the price, topping out at $44k.  But, honestly, the 3.5l V-6 in the Acura felt gutless compared to the 2.3l turbo 4 in the MKC.  That was probably my deciding factor.  In all, I'm thrilled w/ my purchase.",5

The exceptions are typically the BMW X3 or Audi Q5. I test drove those 2, the Rogue, Mazda and Escape (Ford) and the Lincoln MKC was superior to them all. The drive, comfort, seats, technology, ease of getting in/out and styling were all awesome. I have owned my MKC since the beginning of the year and it is truly a car that appeals to men, thus Lincoln's reputation of being a men's auto line. The car is muscular in style and smooth in ride. Several people have commented on how sharp the car is and asked ""what is that car""? It is actually nice owning such a nice luxury car that is not owned by everyone on the street. This is a winner for Lincoln. Love the welcome lights, ambient lighting, comfortable seats and climate control. I would opt for the dramatic panoramic sunroof.

If you are looking for a roomy backseat this may not be for you. It’s a little tight but for us it’s fine. We have taken it on trips and the seats are very comfortable. The only issue we find sometimes is when using the voice command there is problems understanding my command. Probably due to my southern accent. The navigation is great. It handles curves very well and is fun to drive. Ours was a bigger engine and it is noticeable. A lot of power and excellent acceleration.

I ended up trading in that car because I had a similar issue with the air conditioner that I'm having with my black label trim car right now. so the problem is that the AC will randomly blow hot air on the driver side and cold air on the passenger side. I end up having to close the vents on the driver side to keep the hot air from blowing in my face. Again the 2015 MKC that I had did the same thing so I traded it. To have this problem in a $56, 000 car is completely unacceptable. this is the second chance that I have given to Lincoln and I regret it. I traded in a 2017 CX-5 fully loaded and now I feel like I made a mistake. I hope that someone from Lincoln will hear this read this and address this issue.

Since the MKC's were released, my husband had his eye on them... he loved the exterior styling. We considered the BMW X3, Audi Q3 and Lexus NX, and were completely and pleasantly surprised when we test drove the MKC. Official reviews touted that the MKC was just a ""re-badged Ford Escape"" and I can tell you, this is nothing like an Escape. Far, far from it. We purchased the 2017 MKC Reserve AWD with the Tow, Technology and Climate Packages. The technology in this is amazing - we're in our mid-30's and were just shocked as to all it can do! The Sync3 system is intuitive and responsive, and we love that it works with our Android and iPhones. All of the safety features like BLIS with cross-traffic alert, lane keep assist, radar cruise control, ect, is a huge help, but some of those annoying features can be turned off (which we liked). One thing we didn't think we'd appreciate as much as we do is the comfort. I love the BMW and Audi's performance, but the MKC is so, so quiet and comfortable without really sacrificing responsiveness. The noise and roughness is one thing I really didn't like in the BMW. The heated/cooled seats, and heated steering wheel are a huge plus. We live in the Northeast, and can say this has been excellent and solid when driving in the snow or poor weather conditions. The panoramic sunroof is great too; probably the nicest feature, I'd say. My father even like the sleek design and the interior quality... and he's owned nothing but BMW and Lexus for ages. The sounds system could be a little better; seems a little ""blah"" to me. But I would say that so far, this is my only complaint.

2865, on 07/27/17 09:03 AM (PDT),SYFer ,2017 Lincoln MKC SUV Select 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Very Pleased," I wanted a luxury crossover with great tech (Apple Car Play was a must-have), a comfortable, quiet ride for my brutal Silicon Valley commutes and great design (other musts: leather, camera, large format sunroof). I also wanted a reasonable value for all that. My finalists were the BMW X series (probably X1 or X3), the Mercedes GLA and the MKC. In the end, it's obvious that if I wanted the German nameplate cache, it was going to cost significantly more (5-10K) to get what I could get in a the far more reasonably priced Lincoln. I took the savings and extended the warranty (which I always do on a new car) and I purchased the Premium Maintenance Package (which I've never done) because Lincoln's Concierge/Valet service (which is standard--not part of the pkg) makes ongoing maintenance and service an incredible value. All I need to do is contact the  Lincoln concierge via the App, web or call and on the day of my service appt, the valet comes out to my home or office with an equal or better Lincoln and brings mine back when its done. This is not only insanely convenient (I got to try it recently when Lincoln corrected a minor part issue I identified at purchase), but it will ensure that I am punctual and on schedule for my regular service which is always challenging with my work, doing the dealer shuttle, etc. I won't likely even set foot in the dealership for a few years now. As for the ride, performance, comfort, etc., I'm completely satisfied on all counts and I really do love the lines, stance and overall design of this car. In fact, it's kind of funny, now that I'm out there in the Lincoln amidst all the other people driving exactly the same 4 or 5 Germans (and the ubiquitous suburban moms in Subarus), I'm kind of liking the contrarian Lincoln luxury SUV statement. I've never been more satisfied with a new car purchase.

2867, on 04/03/17 19:23 PM (PDT),Craig ,2017 Lincoln MKC SUV Reserve 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),A Good Alternative to German and Japanese Models," Coming out of an Audi Q5, the MKC is a pleasant surprise.  Professional reviews of it have been mixed.  While some of the criticisms are valid, most are not.  On the plus side, the interior materials are every bit as good as the Germans and Japanese.  MKC's leather is superior to the Q5's base leather.  If anything is lacking inside, it's not the materials, it's the aesthetic design.  Lincoln needs to get a bit more creative in that regard to match the Europeans.  I'm not crazy about the center stack design, though it's better in person that in pics. The exterior design is best in class except arguably the Macan in my opinion.  Many reviews claim the MKC is slow compared to competitors, but it certainly doesn't feel it.  My 2.0 MKC feels just as fast as my Q5 2.0 did.  Ultimately, the MKC is let down by its downmarket 6 speed transmission, which results in acceleration and mileage disadvantages compared to the 7, 8, and 9 speeds common in the class (RSX & NX still make due with 6 speeds as well).  A transmission with 2 more gears would even up the score.  The AWD model will pull .83g on a skidpad.  That's right there with the Benz's .83g & Audi's .85g, so handling is competitive.  If you want a small SUV that drives like a sports car, the BMX X3 or Porsche Macan are for you.  Most people don't need that though.  The features for the money is incredible.  On the minus side, the backseat is uninhabitable by anyone with legs if you're sitting behind a 6 footer like me.  Lincoln has to do a better job on the packaging. Also the driver left footrest is oddly shaped and not big enough for someone with larger feet.  The view out the back is also not so great, but that's common in these newer designs with higher beltlines.  Lastly, the optional 2.3 engine didn't feel any quicker than the 2.0, making it not worth its $1k cost in my opinion.  Other than the tight rear seat, these are minor quibbles.  Try to option up a X5,  Q5 or GLC similarly to a Reserve MKC and you'll spend about $6k more - same goes for the Black Label.  One could argue these German vehicles are better - but certainly none are $6k better.  And some of them don't offer all the tech the MKC has at any price.  The RSX is blah and soulless, the Macan and Evoque are horribly overpriced, and the NX is just plain ugly with underwhelming equipment options.  That all adds up to Lincoln having a credible competitor in this class.  Final thought for all those complaining about poor mileage.  New cars typically have poor mileage during the engine break in period - especially turbo engines.  It'll get better after the first few hundred miles.",4

2872, on 01/18/17 21:25 PM (PST),Charles W ,2017 Lincoln MKC SUV Reserve 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great Addition to the Lincoln Line," As another reviewer's title says, ""This is not your grandpa's Lincoln.""  I thought that when I first test drove one, and I would have used the title here if it hadn't already been used.  I have been a Ford product owner since my first new car, and this is my eighth new car.  I traded in my 2002 Eddie Bauer Explorer with almost 250,000 miles on it for the MKC.  I wanted something a bit smaller with better gas mileage while offering quality.  I will say that I always said I'd never spend more than $35,000 on a car, but the MKC Reserve certainly stickered for substantially more.  However, I believe that for the price and from a comparison standpoint, the MSRP is not out of line.  The fit and finish on the vehicle is outstanding, and I've had a number of compliments on the car from passersby.  People really like to comment on my kicking under the rear to open the rear hatch.  People also love the welcome lighting in the car.  I've had the car for one year and 4 months, and I can honestly say it has exceeded my expectations.  I've read reviews from individuals and ratings companies (e.g., magazine editors) that the mileage estimates are way off.  I have to say that is not my experience.  Other ratings I've seen in some reviewers were actually lower than I expected.  At speeds from 65 to 73 on the highway, I've actually hit 34+ mpg.  That's better than the highway mpg on the window sticker.  So, this is definitely good mileage.  And with over 19,000 miles on the car now, the average mileage since I've owned it has averaged 24.6 miles.  I love BLIS, adaptive cruise control, the heated and cooled seats (cooled are going to be very important in the southern heat), the My Lincoln app, extremely comfortable seats, active park assist and other options.  I joke that I actually had to read the manual to learn how to use the car.  Oh, and I can't forget the push button start and remote functions, including starting from my phone.  And speaking of the phone, my iPhone works great with SYNC 3.  Bluetooth works well, voice recognition is great, and the nav system is handy - I had no desire to get the nav system, but it came with the package, and I actually use it to see what traffic is like when going to and from work.  And the THX optional sound system is outstanding - it's a new way to listen to my music!  After 1 year and 4 months and 19,000 miles, I still find no negative issues with the car.  Burgundy velvet with the ebony interior is a great combination, too.",5
2873, on 01/05/17 18:17 PM (PST),Ken ,2017 Lincoln MKC SUV Reserve 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Ok first we leased 2 of them both Reserves," First a background on what was being replaced and current driven vehicles. 2015 CTS coupe (lease coming to an end), 640 BMW convert. (lease coming to an end) and a 328 4 door. My background on vehicles driven primarily in the last few years involves a H2 Hummer, and the above vehicles with daily drivers usually being a coupe. I started to test drive many new vehicles and was not set on a small SUV. I have recently had 2 Infiniti coupe leases a convertible and a plain coupe (loved both) Then I test drove the new ""red sport"" coupe with twin turbos can I just say WOW! Perfect car for me but they quotes were insane for a car in that class at just under 800 a month so it was off list. Drove the Porsche Macan S and can I say right here and now it was hands down one of the best cars I have ever driven. I have owned a Cayman S and a Ferrari recently (yep love cars) and the Macan S was as fun and tight as anything I could compare it to, it beat! However the reality check came when the lease quote was at 1150 Mo for a 74k car and it seemed of by a long shot since I paid the same on a 98k 640 convert (made no sense to me) So what the heck I drove the Infiniti SUV's and ended up in a Lincoln showroom after reading some reviews. Turns out my daughter was also thinking of what car to get next and she wanted a bit more room like a small SUV could provide. I do not want to drive a  car without the latest safety and tech features since I really enjoy them. The MKC size seemed to be right for both of us and ended up ordering 2 of them both Reserves in white. Very pleased overall in vehicles. Quiet (not as quiet as many would have you believe) Nice look and features. Fast for a tiny 4 cyl turbo. BUT and a big but here, this was my first front wheel drive car for both of us other than rentals. Huge change when you step on the gas and have to hold the wheel when passing to keep control, it feels like driving a go cart. Love all the features on the car and still have not had been brave enough to test the self parking assist. Ok now the down side of this nice lil SUV. Both cars for us are getting HORRIBLE mileage (worse than my caddi and everything but my Hummer H2! I would have never ever got two of these if I knew the mileage numbers were going to be this bad! 17-19 combined driving for both vehicles! I was conservatively estimating 22 combined, nope, nada no way. The next very irritating thing to me is the rear and front bumper proximity alarms, they suck! You cannot adjust sensitivity and are basically useless since you have to be very close to get the beep. (cross traffic alert works great) Next irritating thing to me is the Apple car play, you really cannot use any apps you want ( I use only WAZE for navigation and it will not work on the car system. Next is the navigation, just plain difficult to set to make it easy to read and the worst out of any system I currently have or have had. Next the voice commands seem to have too many steps to get to where you want to be. Overall the vehicle is good, motor and transmission have been bullet proof and has many nice features but I was deeply disappointed in the MPG and irritated with the crash avoidance system (completely useless at low speeds)but will alert you at higher speeds (but not stop the car). Even though we are located in Miami I am glad I got the heated rear seats it is great when someone is use to it. All of the small features have been reviewed many times such as the hands free lift gate something you don't think about until your hands are full! My eldest daughter drives a Rover and saw that feature and now she wants a SUV with it (makes sense for moms with kids and all the accessories)  For me when I get another vehicle I feel anything out there now should get over 20MPG and as I get older I felt it was going to be my benchmark and I would never buy a car that averaged under 20 (hopefully 24) MPG not as an economic issue buy more like supporting companies that are progressive and responsible and this is why I was very disappointed on the mileage issue. I do not see how you could go wrong with this vehicle when you compare vehicles based on quality and price.",4

It makes you use your Maps on your phone. The SIRI is horrible for the phone. If you are trying to call someone it doesn't always work correctly. So all in all, you cannot use your phone for a phone call if you want to use the autos navigation. Also, there isn't a heat vent near the driver's door. When the heat is on, it's freezing on that side of your legs. This is literally the worst car I have ever leased. The car does not have a great turn radius. All of my other vehicles, and I have had some very nice vehicles, they can turn on a dime. This one, no chance. The AWD is terrible in the snow and slides all over the place. The gas mileage is the worst I have ever had. I cannot get over 20 mpg. I am so disappointing with this SUV. If I wanted something this cheap, I would have gone with the regular Edge.",3

I owned an Acura RDX and was in the market for a new SUV.  I was actually planning to buy another RDX, but the MKC on display in the Ford/Lincoln section begged a closer look. Lincoln offered a $75.00 gift card to schedule a test drive at a later date, so that's exactly what I did.  I was sold on the Lincoln once I drove the model with the continuous dampening control drive system. I'll admit it took a little while to get past the ""old fogey"" label associated with Lincoln. Once I did, however, it became a matter of finding the right color combination in a Reserve trim level WITH the drive control system.  Three months later, I bought my new MKC.  It rides like a dream and is absolutely gorgeous, both inside and out.  The only true annoyance is the lack of a real tire pressure monitoring system (you know, the one that tells you the tire pressure in each tire).  The indicator light recently flashed a low tire pressure warning, but unlike my RDX (and recent Hyundai rental), that was all the information I got. No fun trying to locate my tire pressure gauge and figure out which tire had the problem IN THE DARK. Hopefully Ford will consider adding a true TPMS to its vehicles in the future.",5

We have the 2.0 engine, which provides great acceleration and good fuel economy (21.1 mpg).  The interior is totally quiet and interior touches like the real wood trim, leather seats, and the stitching on the steering wheel and dash add to the elegant feel.

Having owned 4 Audis and 5 Porsches over the last 40+ years, our first stops were to look at the Audi Q5 and Porsche Macan.  Fine vehicles by any standard and no doubt, worth their price.  But my closest P/A dealerships are 30+ miles away. And then there is the cost of routine maintenance.  Even if it is only once or twice a year the bills do add up. Stopped by our local Lincoln dealer.  Family-owned operation, not a mega-dealer.Drove a 2016 MkX and a 2017 MkC.  Bought the C.  AWD, 2.3 liter turbo 4, 19"" wheels and a whole bunch of other stuff. More technology than I will ever need or want.  Quiet, solid.  No wind noise at 75mph.  The 2.3 liter has more than enough low end grunt and can run all day at 80mph.Lincoln is certainly trying to up their game.  Call for service and the dealer comes to your house or place of business, drops off a loaner and takes your vehicle in for service.  Your vehicle gets, serviced, washed and returned to you.  Not a bad deal.  Is the MkC comparable to a Q5 or Macan?  Not really.  But I have an extremely competent smaller SUV that cost between $10k and $20k less than its German counterparts, not counting the service cost differential.  My one complaint is that those 19"" diameter 45 series tires are not the friendliest on the oxen trails that pass for roads in my state.",5

This is a very nice car for the money.  I was looking for a dampening of road noise. Wife was looking for comfortable front seat, ease of access to features, and a fun drive.  She believes she got them all!  We owned 6 Lincolns in the past and quit the brand when Ford forgot to build luxury in.  Think they FINALLY figured it out with this MKC.  We found great, knowledgeable, salespeople but, if I have a complaint, it is that their dealership does not reflect the ""high end"" ownership experience of a Mercedes or even an Audi dealership.  Found this to be true at other Lincoln dealers we also visited, so must assume that it it the marque that does not recognize the value of a ""high end"" experience when you are trying represent your vehicle as an alternative to Mercedes, BMW, etc.UPDATE:  one year and 6000 miles on - this vehicle is very noisy on the road for an expensive luxury car!  My F 150 has less road noise.  Dealer looked at it - said it was in specs.  Had a local car upholstery shop add more insulation to doors and floor - BIG help.  So why can THEY do it and Lincoln cannot? UPDATE 2: two years on 9500 miles - vehicle still too noisy for me - wife says it's OK (and it IS her car!)

2892, on 08/13/16 08:48 AM (PDT),Iowa Driver ,2016 Lincoln MKC SUV Reserve 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Very Solid Luxury Crossover with a Few Quirks," I researched my purchase very carefully and test drove many comparable options, including BMW, Audi, Infinity, and Lexus.  Of those, I think this was very similar to the Audi Q5 in terms of feel, performance, styling, and quality.  Ultimately, I chose the MKC because I was able to order it with the colors and options I preferred, and Lincoln offered a number of incentives.  I not only got discounts on the purchase price, but also 0% financing!  It was a much better value (a steal really) compared to the foreign options.  And most of the foreign options all come in the same boring colors:  Black, white, silver, gray and red.  It is great to be able to go online, build your own car, and take those specs to the dealer.  I took these specs to several dealers and asked each for their best price.  I ordered my MKC in burgundy with the large spoke wheels...it is stunning!  I get a lot of compliments about this vehicle.  I will say however, that the bigger the wheels, the rougher the ride.  So far, no major complaints during my first 5000 miles.  Lincoln provides your initial service visits for free (2 years/24K miles).   My mileage is very consistently 20 mpg in town and 25 mpg on the highway (my driving style is middle of the road).  I was initially disappointed that they didn't offer a 6 cylinder, but I have found the 2.3 L turbo to be very responsive and powerful; certainly in the same wheelhouse with many of the 6 cylinders I drove.  I love the Sync 3 system; it's very easy to use and completely intuitive.  I also enjoy the modem in my car (comes with the Reserve package); it allows me to start my car remotely from any distance.  I can even set up an automatic start every day at a given time.  The car has a very upscale feel to it.  Very solid all the way through.  It has noise-canceling technology inside that makes it more quiet.  The push-button shifter is a little weird, but you quickly get used to it and it does allow more space in the console.  I really like the backup camera and side sensors that warn me if there is something in my blind spot.  Now...for the negatives:  My number one complaint is that I don't like the cruise control.  I'm assuming that this is a standard Ford product, but I've always been a Toyota guy and love their cruise control because it can be set easily with a flick of your middle finger without looking away from the road.  This Ford cruise control is awkward and always requires me to look down to use it.  Also, the wiper controls are upside down compared to Toyota.  And sometimes when you drive with windows or sunroof open, you can get a lot of unpleasant wind pressure and vibration inside.  The back seat is tight for bigger people, but this is partly due to styling (sloped roof).    The process for closing the hood is (unnecessarily) tricky; I had to practice it several times to get it to work.  Also, had a couple of minor quality issues:  Some passengers claim they hear air whistling by the window on the highway (I'm deaf to higher pitch noise, and don't hear it).  The glove compartment is coated with a fuzzy material that sheds and sticks to the owner's manual.    The leather and wood on the inside is great, but some of the chrome buttons/dials seem a little cheap.  I like having body side moldings to prevent door dings, but Lincoln doesn't offer it (as Toyota does).  However, I did find an aftermarket product that looks great and works well.   Lastly, I am proud to be driving a vehicle that is made right here in the USA!   NOTE:  The review's drop-down box did not offer me the option of 2.3 liter turbo, but that is my engine size.UPDATE:  I’m now at 16k miles and two years.   Overall, I’m happy with the vehicle. However, I’ve had a couple issues with the interior:  First, there is a rattle in the speaker cover on the dash that the dealer can’t seem to fix. Secondly, my drivers seat heater/cooler doesn’t work in spite of dealer changing it out. Also, have started to realize that back seat is really cramped, partly due to panoramic moonroof.  You have to be pretty small to fit back there. Lastly, my front air vent came apart but was fixed under warranty.  Mechanically, it has been excellent.  I do wish the vehicle had a bigger gas tank, especially on long trips.",5

As a long time Audi and Prosche driver I looked at a Q5 and a Macan.  My local Lincoln dealer has always treated me fair so I decided to price an MkC.  The Lincoln dealership is less than 3 miles from my house.  The Porsche and Audi dealers are 35 miles away.Today there is a 2017 MkC AWD with the 2.3liter turbo 4 engine, 19"" wheels.  Is it an Audi or a Porsche?  No way, but it is close enough especially given the 5 figure price differences between and among them.The MkC is solid, scoots along rather well, runs on regular fuel, 4 year warranty.  First service is free and the dealer will come pick up the car, leave me a loaner, and return my serviced vehicle to me.  The fit and finish are first rate. The car has more technology than I will ever use.  Outward visibility front and to the sides is excellent.  Rear window is too small but that is how all these modern vehicles are designed.  Air bags everywhere.  No wind noise on the freeway.  All in all I am very satisfied with the MkC.",5
2896, on 06/23/16 03:07 AM (PDT),Dan ,2016 Lincoln MKC SUV Select 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great Ride," We were considering a 2017 Escape and then saw the MKC.  Great exterior styling that sets it aside from many of the other luxury brands that all tend to look alike. When we first drove the vehicle with the standard 2.0 Ecoboost, it felt like there was a V8 under the hood.  The interior is well laid out and has plenty of features.  Love the memory seats and mirrors and the power driver and passenger seating.   The touchscreen audio and climate controls work great.   I really was not sure we would care for the pushbutton tranny but it has turned out to be great and you lose the shifter.    The vehicle has some nice finishes and we opted for the expresso/sand interior with the zebra wood.   Plenty of storage room in the rear and the rear seats recline.  The only complaint would be the lack of leg room in the rear seat if he driver is tall.   The ride is firm and very quiet.   One surprise and delight feature was the Lincoln Welcome Mat.   When you unlock the doors, the Lincoln emblem and insignia is projected on both sides of the vehicle.   Clever!    We would definitely recommend this vehicle in the luxury SUV segment.",5

Have had very few issues with this car with the exception of finding tires that work and don't make a ton of noise, and tires for snow. This car does not do well in the snow without snow tires.

I know we are comparing apples and oranges but Lincoln really missed the mark if trying to retain customers who came to the brand for mid performance. LS was tight and confident. Zephyr is not even close. Zephyer is luxury inside while the vehile is in park. Awesome interior, no mechanical issues, great looks and finish. Step on the gas and it ends here. Loud unrefined engine noise, unremarkable ride, major torque steer. This is a Fusion at best with a better interior. Nothing wrong with this except why pay for luxury and get a common auto mobile.

Most claimed that the Zephyr is just a dressed up Milan, and some are critical of the performance or the interior styling.  I studied these reviews before buying the car, but then I took a couple of test drives to decide for myself.  I compared it to competing cars from Lexus, Infiniti, Acura, and Audi, and decided that FOR ME the Zephyr is the best choice. It handles well, looks great, and has been extremely reliable.

It's such a classy-looking car, ESPECIALLY in black, which mine is. Unfortunately, being black, the birds seem to enjoy hanging out above it... often.  It's very fun to drive, though as has been pointed out repeatedly, the gas mileage leaves something to be desired.  I live pretty close to work and don't drive a whole lot otherwise, so I'm getting about 17mpg regular.  But on the highway, I have gotten 30mpg, so that's something. I've read reviews saying the acceleration is bad, but I haven't really experienced that, if you drive it intelligently (don't slam the gas/squeal tires).",4.875

I have driven it all over and on two long trips (5K miles) since then and still like it a lot. This US car is better than any Toyota or Honda and is comparable to the Lexus. It drives great, gets good MPG (26-30 hwy), runs very quiet and is very reliable. It is great car for a couple or a small family with lots of trunk room and a big back seat for extra junk or two kids or two friends as needed.

The Lincoln, with front- wheel drive, proved to have a more appealing interior design and layout and caused me to re-think my original plan. The Lincoln offers a stylish dash and cabin and sporty exterior looks. It is definitely not a Town Car and is a nice replacement for the Lincoln LS.

Hard to find good front seats.  The Lincoln has them and offers power adjustments for driver AND passenger.  The car is relatively quiet.  I like the handling, trunk space, and ride. Oh, and the analog clock is a neat touch. You'd expect to run this on premium.  Guess again. Only a couple minor gripes.  The plastic in the gear box is cheap feeling, and I'd expect a locking fuel door.  Some, I suspect will not like the moving center console deck. It's well padded, but moves fore and aft and can't be locked in place. Overall, a fine car.  Glad to be back with Ford.",4.25

I have the standard sound system that seems adequate for FM but is outstanding with CD's. It is embarrassing to get so many stares of approval as I drive around. The trunk is large enough to hold an entire order from Costco with room to spare.  The air conditioned seat makes me feel like my pants are wet, but is quite effective.

Have only had to replace a serpentine belt, a coil pack for cylinder #6 and a driver's side low beam HID headlight bulb ($170.00 even with a healthy discount) in 15,000 miles.

The back seating is non-existant. I use it for storage. Gass mileage I get is 24 city 27 highway even in winter months. Excellent highway driving. Came with 10CD changer and JBL stereo which is nice but not great. Handling is very ggod for such a large car. I'd opt for a 98 instead of 97.

Go on line under haedlight conversion hits. There is one out there at $51 and change.  Kit is for all four headlights. Is add imple bulb replacement. New bulbs have attached cooler fan with a pigtail connector. Connector is needed because new lamps are longer and  there is no room to connect the old wires to the new lamps. Pigtail works great and connects easily to old wires. The difference in lighting performance is astounding. If you have a Mark 8 get this kit. Hurry these are not being manufactured anymore.",4

Powertrain control module went at 155K ($2000).  Ran fine until 175K at which point the PCM went out again.  Can't and won't replace it a second time.  Despite having to put some real money into the car to keep it running I have enjoyed almost every minute of driving.  Its design is centered around the driver and a responsive driving experience.

In fact, I kept the last one 'til the end was in sight because, for me, the MkVIII was just too big to be a coupe. Finally, in 1998, I realized that the car wasn't going to get any smaller. Even worse, it was about to disappear forever. I bought a black/black '98 LSC. For a personal/luxury car, it's still too big for my preference. However, there is no greater luxury/performance car combo for the price available anywhere in the world.  Even the gas mileage is good considering it's 305HP and 4K+ pounds.  ",4.5

The acceleration and ride are fantastic, and the pure fun of driving her are just fantastic.  Power behind the 32 valve V8 is incredible. I could never have afforded one of these when new, and feel very lucky to have found this one in as great a condition as she is in. I'm going to have much fun driving around as long as I am able.

It's a wonderfully smooth ride around town or on the highway, soaking up potholes with ease.  The V8 provides effortless power at any legal speed. Gas mileage is usually around 25 on the highway, though I've gotten it as low as 22 (fast into a headwind) and as high as 27 (65 w/ a tailwind?) If you're having traction problems in rain or snow, it's your tires.  The first set I had were lousy in rain and snow.  I've since switched to 2 sets of tires- snows for winter and a set of summer performance tires. Repairs since the warranty ran out have averaged about $800/yr, which I'd consider well worth it to drive a Mark. ",4.875
