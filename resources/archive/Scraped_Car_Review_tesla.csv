0, on 08/30/18 15:36 PM (PDT),TN ,2018 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Not for everyone," Model X is unique. Either you like be it or hate it. To me, it is like buying your first iPhone. You won’t find the key pad. Things may be working today but won’t tomorrow due to the latest patch. You won’t be happy if you think you are buying a car. You will be very happy if you want to buy a technology. It is a toy that can be driven and it is fun.",5
1, on 07/04/18 17:15 PM (PDT),Ryan W ,2018 Tesla Model X SUV 100D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),"Crazy good, despite many small flaws"," A lot of the existing reviews online, including the 2017 and 2018 Edmunds reviews here are a little out of date due to the continuous improvements that Tesla makes to their production process as well as the after production updates via Tesla's amazing over the air update system. For example, the latest navigation and autopilot updates as of July 2018 make this car vastly superior to anything else on the road in these areas.  Also, based on my model that was built in late 2017, the fit and finish seems to be slowly improving as well. PROS: - As noted by many others, the handling and acceleration are better than any other SUV on the market. Driving a Model X feels like magic.- Utility is excellent due to the huge amount of interior space, thanks in large part to the lack of engine and gas tank. Yes, there are no roof racks, but most of what you would put up on the roof can be stowed inside the cabin or in the fronk with much more convenience. For towing, the auto leveling air suspension, included tow hitch, and the vast torque allow the model X to easily tow just about anything. (Quantis just towed a 787 Dreamliner with a Tesla Model X for publicity). Technically though, the X is legally rated to 5,000 lbs and towing will reduce your range by roughly 20% depending on various factors, so you have to take that into account. - Range provided by the 100D is fantastic at around 300 miles. That along with the Tesla charging network, road trips have been a dream. - My favorite feature is Autopilot, which has gotten so good that I no longer want to drive without it. It feels a lot safer and easier to have both yourself and the car reacting to situations in real time. For example, if you look down for a moment and someone slams on the breaks in front of you, Autopilot will automatically slow down. I've also noticed that in dark, rainy conditions, Autopilot seems to be better at seeing the road ahead than I can due to the array of sensors, which was really surprising. - The built-in Navigation is the best I've seen in any car by a wide margin. It's just like using Google maps on your phone, but built-in and easily visible on the huge display. The voice recognition works amazingly well too, meaning you can just say; ""navigate to home depot"", and it just works. CONS: - The falcon wing doors are great to show off to your friends, but they are not practical. In a normal garage for instance, they can't open fully so you have to crawl under them to get into the car. - Tesla's push button door handles require a lot of force to activate and are irritating. I'd personally prefer the 3% hit to range to get back regular door handles. - My Model X was built in late 2017 and the build quality is clearly improving, but I did have a couple of small fit and finish issues that required me to drop my X off for repair immediately after pickup. - The X is not an off-road capable SUV. - The worst thing about the model X in my opinion are the seats. The Model X seats don't even compare to a top trim 2018 Honda CRV. My wife has a 2017 Lexus RX 450h which is half the cost, and the Lexus seats and about twice as comfortable and are much more luxurious than the throw away vinyl seats you get in the Tesla Model X. Since nicer seats can be be procured from the same vendors that make seats for the other car brands, it seems criminal to me that the Tesla Model X is so badly lacking in this area.  If you get a Tesla, you will have the best car on the planet, except you will probably have the worst seats of any car in the $40K+ price range. The included ""vegan leather"" seats, seem to be there to placate PETA and other environmentalists that don't like leather being used in cars. I get that, but at the very least, vinyl should be standard and real, perforated leather, similar to what you find in every other nice car, should be an option. Overall, the Tesla Model X is such a vast improvement over every other SUV on the market, it's definitely worth putting up with the small flaws to own one.",4
2, on 06/21/18 05:22 AM (PDT),Bamboo ,2017 Tesla Model X SUV 100D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),If only my X can fly," Like most consumers, I've owned five different cars and wanted to try something different but also environmentally friendly.  As with anything new there's a transition period but in all honesty, I will never go back to gas cars!  Beside the supercharging and little to no maintenance, my X is just an incredible work of innovative technology matched with style, efficiency, and green consciousness!  The only issue is that for back seat riders you do feel the bumps a bit more because there's not a whole lot of cushion/shock absorption but let's just say given the all-around luxury features, my riders got over it quick.  Just love my ride and highly recommended!",5
3, on 04/07/18 15:01 PM (PDT),Mel ,2017 Tesla Model X SUV 100D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Little disappointed.," Owned car for three more months and it had to be towed to service center, already. Problems with electronics. Love car but have had a couple of issues with it already.",4
4, on 12/30/17 21:45 PM (PST),Dallen Ormond  ,2017 Tesla Model X SUV P100D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Fantastic ," In the past 12 years I have owned 18 different vehicles. I purchased the model X 100D 2 months ago. It accelerates faster than my Golf R, Nismo 350 Z, or Infinity M class. The car is as luxurious as my MB E63 AMG and rides as well as my Cadillac CTS-V. Recently I had to take it off-road. I live in the mountains and had to pick up a sick child. The roads were unplowed and recommended chains only. I simply raised the suspension and easily drove miles and miles in 2 feet of snow. It handles as well off road as my Toyota Tacoma. Then driving down the canyon I didn’t have to hit my brakes once because of how the vehicle torque charging works. The canyon is a 65 mph 5-6% grade for 20 miles. Finally, because of the torque charging my battery charged on the way down the canyon. I can’t express how impressive this vehicle is. Elan Musk not only built a competitor he built a game changer.

5, on 12/29/17 08:46 AM (PST),Tiger Driver ,2017 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),The best crossover SUV ever," The front end cost can be reduced by state and federal tax credits if you buy fairly soon, depending on the state.  You will also save about $10,000 in the first 4 years based on current gas prices.  BTW, all currently new 2017 Tesla Model X vehicles and presumably the 2018 models come with fold-down back seats to add to the storage capacity of the vehicle, and the 4,000 lb. hitch is standard. In 2018, if you get a referral from an existing owner of a Model S or X, you can still get lifetime free charging at Tesla stations (2018).  Otherwise, there will be a charge at the Tesla charging stations to charge up. Model 3 owners get charged as well. Now have 13,000 miles on the vehicle without any problems.",5
6, on 08/03/18 04:59 AM (PDT),Brian K ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Still amazed!," We went to Tesla in 2016 to place our $1,000 deposit for a Model 3 but ended up buying this Model X 60D which was not on our radar before we test drove it. Compared to other candidates for replacing my wife's Mercedes GL the X seemed to come from 20 years in the future, In particular we loved the airy cabin with enormous windshield, the silent propulsion, the amazing off-the-line acceleration, and the lack of exhaust emissions. Autopilot 1.0 fairly blew us away. Two years and 35k miles later we still love all those features and we have been very happy with the support and service from Tesla where the repair center still feels like a fun garage with friendly helpful people. Not many downsides. I never liked the falcon wing doors and they are indeed a minor pain especially if someone is getting into the front seat and someone else into the back at the same time. They do however get a lot of oohs and ahhs even now. Build quality is fine, but not as solid as the best in class Lexus or Mercedes. Supercharging is awesome - I can go anywhere in teh country with my puny 60 kWhr battery. Still amazed!",5
7, on 12/29/17 07:22 AM (PST),Alan Savenor ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV P90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Go Electric!, EV range is great. Easy to refuel at superchargers.,5
8, on 12/15/17 21:31 PM (PST),bgp ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Model X is fun to drive but has glitches," My Model X has konked out twice and had to be towed.  It has also had numerous other glitches such as the dirver's door refusing to open (causing me to have to crawl in from the passenger's side).  The falcon wing doors are great for loading and carrying big stuff, but they are confusing for guests to operate, they are slow, and they sometimes fail to open all the way.  passengers have to squeeze under or they bump their heads. The Falcon doors are not cool, they are annoying.  The front cup holders are too close together to accommodate two medium coffee cups.  One of us has to hold our cup. Annoying.  Auto pilot on the highway feels very very unsafe.  I use it only in slow traffic under 30mph.  The black glass roof keeps the car very hot (outside temps over 68 require interior a/c) and the tint of the glass is not enough to block glare of the sun.  Form over function.  Hate the black glass roof.  Teslas are FUN to drive, but the X is seriously over-engineered and interior is not nearly as comfortable, convenient or intuitive as my Lexus SUV.  Soon as Lexus or Mercedes come out with an electric SUV I’m switching.",4
9, on 11/26/17 05:17 AM (PST),P90D Test Driver ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV P90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),"If you want quick acceleration, buy this car!!!"," Yes it's all electric, and yes, it's pricey around $90-100K for a ""used"" car, but if you can find a low mileage Model X P90D in excellent condition, then it's certainly worth looking at.  Most people will find the 2017 75D or 100D regular version (not the ""P"" version) to have about the same look & feel as I didn't see that many changes from the 2016 to 2017 for both the ""P"" and ""non-P"" versions, but the one option on the P90D X that I test drove had ""Ludicrous Mode"".   For those who don't know what that is, it's basically taking a very fast car and making it ridiculously faster.  Other than on a race track, I'm not sure how beneficial that option really is to the average driver, but at around 3.0 seconds from 0-60, you certainly can get a jump on others at the stop light or merge onto the freeway very quickly.   I guess it's one of those ""nice to haves"" but probably not used that often in a commuter car.  Best thing to do is test drive both the ""P"" and ""non-P"" cars at a Tesla dealer and see for yourself.  Keep in mind a ""new"" 2017 P100D with Ludicrous mode will probably set you back over $140,000.  So for a (1) year old car with under 10K miles, at a price of around $90K, a 2016 Model X P90D is a substantial $(50,000) savings, or on the other hand a huge loss if you bought it ""new"" in 2016.  By the way, I saw the sticker price of the car I test drove to add ""Ludicrous Mode"" was $10,000, and the total price of the car was $147,000.  Both have Tesla's 50,000 mile 4 year warranty and the 8 year on the battery & motors, but check with the Tesla dealer to confirm these numbers.  The only drawback was my test car had Autopilot v 1.0, and not the latest v 2.0 Autopilot, so the 2016 I drove could not eventually be a 100% self-driving car.",4
10, on 10/24/17 06:48 AM (PDT),Johnny ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Best vehicle on this planet," Attention! If you have problems navigating your smart phone (with the exception of anything apple) then this car is probably NOT for you. On a positive note, this car has changed my life! I have owned my 2017 X for 6 months and managed to put 21,000+ trouble free miles so far. I've taken this car up and down the mountains, everglades, dirt, rock, middle of nowhere and I loved every bit of it. The view from inside is better then my convertible! The cooling seats are great in the summer plus you can cool or heat the car from the tesla app on your phone before you enter + lock/ unlock doors + even move it forward and backward for tight parking etc. Adjustable suspension knows what to do on bad terrain. Autopilot sure helps in traffic or long trips just be alert since bad drivers are everywhere and construction or roads with no lines or faded lines can confuse the car periodically. I have the 5 seat configuration and my rear seat folds down. I heard all the new models do that now too. Charging is super easy and fast compared to stopping multiple times to fill up and the navigation is so spot on it has signal even when my phone didn't! I've heard of some people having issues with their cars I'm def not one of them and it's actually pretty rare. Again please read my first sentence and that should explain everything. Upon delivery you are treated with excellent service and a full introduction of the vehicle. It will take a few days to soak in all the amazing stuff this SUV (that drives like a lotus) can do!",5
11, on 09/28/17 11:32 AM (PDT),Aug ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),"Unsafe autopilot, poor door operation"," If you get ANY tesla's, DO NOT purchase autopilot.  As great as they market it to be, it's unsafe and it's seriously a matter of time before someone, whether it be a tesla owner, or another driver on the same road as a tesla, gets seriously hurt due to autopilot.  What's ironic is that Elon is using consumers to collect data so it can work out the problems with it's autopilot.  Autopilot is sold as a ""beta"" version. I bet no one knows about this before purchasing the car or autopilot.  It's a huge fraud what he's doing, and hopefully one of the lawsuits will nail him for it.  The doors suck and the sensors to detect how much space the doors have to open are placed incorrectly and are faulty. Have already had it replaced twice in less than 10 months of owning the car.  The sensors to open the front doors are placed where any normal person would stand to open the door.  This causes the door to not open fully, and requires extra effort and time to get into the car unnecessarily.  This, hands down is the most regrettable purchase I have ever made.",1
12, on 05/18/17 11:39 AM (PDT),ONEANGRYMO ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Tesla is changing everything.," I got my Model X delivered Dec 30th to my home at 10:00pm. Probably the most exciting new car purchase I have ever made.  It is fast, smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  Its range is excellent.  It is truly the future of transportation.  I have had only minor issues, Tesla customer service is first class. Much better than my piece of crap BMW x5.  That thing broke down all the time, and the service center locally was a pain to deal with.  I am very happy with my purchase.1 year later update.  Awesome car. Some minor issues that Tesla swiftly took care of.  Best customer service on the planet. I am still happy with my vehicle. Smooth, quiet, fast, looks great, feels great.",5

15, on 05/02/17 13:16 PM (PDT),Lorraine ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Wow to the tenth power!, Breaking is not only breaking but it is also recharging the battery. And you really don't have to break. You just take your foot off the gas. It almost stopped by itself. But it's so fluid you really don't even notice it. Getting in and out was great for my parents who are older as the doors just lift up and all they had to do for swing their feet out. It was a little bit more of a drama or get it out of the third row but not too much hassle as the seat aisle is very large. I am in love with a car display option for GPS. My parents could see all of the information from the second row. There were no questions as to if I knew where I was going. So in love with his car!,5
16, on 04/21/17 16:56 PM (PDT),Johny5 ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),BEST SUV / Crossover vehicle EVER!, Hello I have owned my 2017 Tesla model X 90D for 22 days I have over 4000+ miles on it already and driven every terrain except for snow.  This vehicle continues to impress and outperforms all other competition (Including my neighbors Lamborghini Gallardo!!!!) I have had zero problems locating superchargers along my route which are totally free! I thought having this car in my apartment on the beach would be a problem but it's totally not since I only have to charge it every other few days and charging is pretty quick. I have autopilot version 8.1 installed and I can honestly say that autopilot is a serious step into the future. 90% of my long term driving now uses autopilot with me only fully driving in construction zones or bad roads or city driving. Its so amazing it probably saved my life! I dozed off one late night driving back from Washington DC to Miami. Autopilot sensed my hands weren't on the wheel and woke me up with a chime all while the car was safely maneuvering thru traffic! This is hands-down the best and safest vehicle that has ever been produced for the public! It compliments aerodynamics and ingenuity so well that the feeling can only be similar to the shock and awe of the Citroen DS of 1955 that paved the way for safer more efficient quality cars. By the way the Tesla has no engine so say goodbye to gas and hello more trunk space! 😱🤗👌,5

18, on 01/27/17 05:30 AM (PST),Patrick ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Reviews seem fake. See for yourself.," Took delivery a few weeks ago prepared for misaligned body panels, falcon wing doors that wouldn't work, and poor service. That's what you would expect reading all these reviews. I have had a great delivery experience without any car issues and now I have most incredible car I have ever been in let alone owned. I have two kids in car seats and I can tell you Elon's ""over engineered"" pain with the falcon wing doors is my gain. Makes me smile every time I place my kids in their seats thinking of all the times I had to tilt their bodies, squeeze through narrow door openings, and bump their heads on the ceiling while straining my back to get them in my sedan. When my wife is driving the kids I feel safe knowing they are in one of the safest vehicles on the road. The serenity of driving without engine noise will blow your mind. Other favorite features: enormous windscreen, touchscreen controls that make every other car seem 10 years out of date, waking up with a ""full tank"" every morning and therefore never having to stand out in the cold and pump gas, warming up car with the app. Only downside so far: I have to drive my gas car when my wife takes the kids.Update:A year and a half later after purchase remain very happy with my decision. In fact, I do not plan to ever buy another gas car again. Just got a Model 3 so I no longer have to drive a gas car to work :) . Convinced electric is the future (and its a better future), but not many people know it or can afford it yet. One of the falcon wing doors developed a brief squeak during opening or closing that Tesla service made go away by adjusting the seals. Took our first real road trip to a Great Wolf lodge about 2 hours away. Stopped at a Supercharger for 20 minutes or so and got a cup of coffee and a donut at a bakery nearby. Car was charged up beyond what we needed by the time we returned. Long distance travel takes longer, but is a breeze with the in car app telling you where to charge and for how long. Charging at your destination if there is no supercharger takes some planning.",5

20, on 01/01/17 20:45 PM (PST),Ed ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),You love it and hate it, I love the car then again I dislike it.  The car is techy in every way but it seems the reliability does not back it up yes it's a very fast car and Uber techy but when your constantly in the service department it's not very pleasant I thought my Land Rover was unreliable this is on a different level. But it was expected buying an electric vehicle when the technology isn't very mature. But seriously that could of made the interior quality much better! This car feels like a cheap American car. But we know why we paid those expensive price tags! But tax savings plus the incentives that California gives and the potential gas savings! (I own a Landrover and a silverado 3500) it makes the car not that expensive! Overall an 3 star rating,3
21, on 12/22/16 19:23 PM (PST),DRD ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Too many problems and poor service," I really love the concept of a car built by a start-up from the ground up. However, I am not happy that I spent so much money for a car that has had so many issues plus a service center that schedules repairs 3-weeks out. I am getting used to my Enterprise Ford rental while I wait weeks for backordered parts. I would turn my car in for a full refund if I could.",1
22, on 12/12/16 07:46 AM (PST),OG ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV P90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Test Driving a Model X P90D," About the car: aside the electric part (which it is good or the best in itself) the price range with options (100-120 K) that makes Tesla desirable is not competitive with other cars in that range and same style. Cabin is not sealed at 65-70 m/h, tires are noisy too at that speed. Auto Pilot feature is misleading (I am sure it will get better) but just now it is nothing else than a dynamic cruise control.  Acceleration is very sensitive which it is likely to please certain group of people, but it is not practical for an everyday commuting car, making Model X a toy to enjoy and impress friends once in a while. Bottom line: Too much money for a good battery and decently good looking car.About the service: it is not clear how maintenance would be handled. In case of having the car serviced for a reason different from scheduled maintenance, it seems there is a LONG waiting list to get hands on a dealer loaner. The alternative would be a gas operated car from a rent-a-car company. This is not acceptable, not for that price.Summary: For more than it is innovative and cute, the model X is not ready to compete in the price range it has being marketed.Suggestion to consumers: sleep on it until it develops in a better choice. It will for sure!",2

24, on 10/30/16 08:35 AM (PDT),Bel Day ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Best SUV ever," If you have children, this is the best, safety, SUV around. Third row access is easy thanks to the Falcon wings, while middle row child seats can be accessed without hitting your head on the roof, or killing your back while hunching over. Add solar on your house and you can power it with sunshine. Amazing.Update 6 months later - had a great 3,000 mile road trip. There's nothing this vehicle can't do. The husband and I fight over who gets to drive it.",5
25, on 10/27/16 18:09 PM (PDT),DFE ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 75D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Not Ready for Prime Time," I ordered a Tesla X in June of 2105.  It arrived in September of 2016.  All of the amazing things it does well have been described by others.  The electronics, sleek profile, lack of engine noise, acceleration, and easy to understand controls are all great.  But its not ready for prime time by a long shot.  The lack of engine noise is totally outweighed by a noisy, choppy, and rattle filled interior.  The tires are incredibly noisy. The suspension is downright awful and cannot be adjusted even with the air suspension option.  Only the ride HEIGHT can be controlled not the stiffness. I bought it for my wife to replace her midsize Mercedes SUV. So that was her baseline.  Her very first reaction upon entering the X was where do things go. The cop holders are awkward to say the least, the storage is minimal, the second row seats do not fold flat, and there is NO PLACE to hang clothes or even lay them flat. A bright sun is bothersome as it shines through the huge windshield and the visors are amusingly toy-like. The rear view mirror is tiny and the rear window small. Unsafe in my book.  The gull wing doors were fun for 15 minutes and then an inconvenient pain. The back seats are small and narrow and all the talk about legroom is just not true in the real world.  In short, it is not a workaday vehicle.Update at 9000 miles. The vehicle has not gotten better with time. It’s ride is still harsh and the rattles are worse. I learned after one Midwest winter that an electric vehicle range is dramatically affected by temperatures below 40F. The range is reduced by at least 40% as are the regenerative brakes. The heater cannot keep up with the cold. The gull wing doors are especially annoying in rain or snow. I’ve had flat tires and learned they are a bit rare and quite expensive to replace. The local Tesla service center is good.",2
26, on 10/24/16 08:50 AM (PDT),Travis W ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),"Amazing EV, but Quality & Longevity Are Questioned"," Purchased an X in September 2016, coming out of a Model S.  The X is more comfortable overall, easier to get in/out of, ride height is better if you like that over a shorter car, etc.  The interior is nice, comfortable, and luxurious, but not as fit and finished as other luxury brands on materials (Audi, BMW, Mercedes) - just not quite there yet.  The car looks great overall on exterior and the large amounts of chrome do get dirty easily, etc.  Decent amount of black molding on car but improvements appearance overall.  On quality, ours was delivered with a number of misalignment of panels, doors, and the rear hatch was so bad it had to be disassembled and then replaced to be aligned well.  We've had a couple seals the protrude and also severe wind noise from the frameless windows and their seal design a few times.  Our car was delivered with an unbolted loose rocking/squeaking driver seat which was unacceptable and fixed.  Service with Tesla is very good but is getting less responsive as more cars are produced and on the road.  We do also have a few paint issues that are appearing on rear of car and will need to address potentially.  Overall, Tesla quality isn't quite there just yet compared to some luxury brands as these issues seem common on many of the Xs out there - but perhaps some new builds are improving as ours was a VIN 8000ish.  Having said all that, the car is awesome, drives wonderful, is faster than you need (even as a regular 90D), range is great 99.9% of the time more than you need, and the technology in the car is leagues above other cars as well as just easy to use due to lack of oddly labeled buttons, knobs, etc.  The X is an expensive car but saving on gas, the overall utility of it, and comfort do put it up there with other luxury SUVs that are not far off.  Our main concern is the quality (mostly resolved now) and longevity that goes along with that.  The first 4 years of warranty will be valuable it seems, and Tesla hasn't offered an extended 4 years just yet (but probably will at a cost soon).  After 8 years though, will have to see how well the car is holding up, FWDs holding up, etc.",3
27, on 10/23/16 12:44 PM (PDT),Jules ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Why I went back to Tesla," After writing a bad review about my first Model X and trading it in on an X5 I ended up going back to a newer Model X. I think they have improved quality a lot since my first Model X and I love it. I cannot go back to a gas car anytime soon. Now, in Pennsylvania road trips can be a bit time consuming and you have to plan out your trips more compared to states like California where Superchargers are everywhere, but it's a small price to pay for never having to buy gas again.",5
28, on 10/20/16 16:06 PM (PDT),Andrew ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Wait until quality improves," I purchased this car and am so disappointed with the quality of the build. The 2nd day of ownership the drivers door didn't open. The door latch needed to be replaced. They damaged the door when repairing the latch. Another service call.  The wipers make noise,there is excessive wind noise, road noise, moisture in the rear tail lights and other problems.  There are so many other cars that are more quality and less problems. Forget about getting a service appointment especially if you want a Tesla loaner. That would be well over a months wait.",2
29, on 10/16/16 16:16 PM (PDT),MHC ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),The model x is years ahead of the competition," I have only had the car a few weeks so I can't attest to reliability but everything else is fantastic.  The car is quicker ( without Ludicrous) than my GL 63 AMG Mercedes that I traded in for the car. It handles and rides more comfortably as well.   Not to mention 90MPG equivalent versus the 16mpg I used to get.  The car is a technical phenomenon-- Teslas driver assistance autopilot is way ahead of Mercedes, Audi and Porsche.  Automatic doors are great.  The ability to control the car from your phone is best in class.  The helicopter bubble windshield has the visibility my wife loved when we test drove the Range Rover but the the tesla drives ten times better than the Rover.  There are a few quirky things that are different but clearly the future is here and the model x is it.",5
30, on 08/30/16 15:59 PM (PDT),L P ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV P90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),not sure if worth the money," We loved Tesla Model X when we test drove it.  The sales girl told us that the car would be ready in 2 month.  We ordered it!  when delivery specialist contacted us after that, he said that actually the car will be ready in October.  We said -OK, what can you do?  2 month later we got a call the the car is ready, (2 month earlier then promised),   we must come and accept delivery for it.  The time slots for delivery appointments are limited, and so we have to adjust out busy schedule to receive the car.  We have scramble to get loan-since we were told that we had 2 extra month before, also the charger is not installed, so that becoming  a pain. The car drove fine, fast p90d with ludicrous mode, comfy however; it started to fall apart on day 2-little parts on inside (decorative) things started to fall off.  The on day 5 the car shut down, with all warning lights on, and we took it back to service.  That's where the crappy service began.  First we could not get hold of the service person, -he was with other customers.  Now when i get a 160K car -I expect service person available, period!  Then they said that replacement car would come from Enterprise?! who promised me Chevy Impala.  of course i said that will not happen and after discussing this issue with service representative they somehow got fully charged Model S they could loan us.  It has been almost a week and car still not repaired, parts are ordered from somewhere...... no time estimates given.  So after owning Tesla Model X for 2 weeks, I am less then impressed.  I understand that things can malfunction, but lack of service is just that.....",1
31, on 08/29/16 08:38 AM (PDT),Chris G. ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Great vehicle for anywhere that isn't hot," I was super excited to drive this car. All the hype and hoopla, the superlatives written in the reviews really sold me. I was ready to buy it just looking at it. I live in Texas and test drove the car at around 10:00 AM. The car had been cooling for 5 minutes before I got in so I was immediately disappointed to get in to an overly warm vehicle. I figured we could crank up the A/C and we would be set, no big deal. The only problem was it had already been set to its highest setting. It just could not keep up with the August morning heat in Texas. Read that again. The morning heat. If this vehicle had been sitting in the sun all afternoon it would be unbearable. Actually, it would be nightmarish to me knowing that it would not cool off. To be fair, the car got comfortable at the end of my test drive 30 minutes later. It looks as if they put the same small vents from the Model S in the X which doesn't make sense. If you have a larger volume of area, you need a larger volume of air. Other than this one glaring issue, the car really seemed perfect. I loved the acceleration, the handling, and the interior was amazing. The windshield/panoramic roof is phenomenal. I have children and the second row seats that can slide and tilt forward for third row access was great also.",2
32, on 07/28/16 16:22 PM (PDT),Aleksander ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),"What do you get from Tesla when you spend $113,000"," First, you will get a whole lot of excitement by watching pictures and videos on the Tesla website, while you are waiting for your car to arrive at the dealer. Then, for the first few weeks, you will think and tell everybody that you have the best car in the world… and then, reality sets in. You start realizing that many of those high tech gizmos simply don’t work. But, you understand, that this is a fresh concept car and you almost expect that. So far so good, but then you are going to get seriously shocked when you try to get through the service department appointment desk and eventually the service manager. Honestly, I never, ever, experienced such a bad service in any other cars I have owned, or am currently possessing now, even when the cars were worth a fraction of the $113,000 which I have spent on my Model X 4 months ago. I know that nobody will believe me if I will tell you that today, July 25, I called the Tesla Service Department in Burbank to request another follow up appointment to fix a list of problems (some of them serious safety issues) and was told, that if I was to waive my rights for a loaner car (per my contract) the fastest open appointment is August 25...basically in one month! How many issues does Tesla Model X have for the service department to have to wait for one full month?  It didn’t help to get over my disappointment with the car when I had a very unfriendly and rude conversation with the service manager Mr. Mines. I explained to this gentleman my problems and the reason why I asked for the service manager and I got interrupted with “Are you done yet? May I talk now?” Wow!      People! For your information...if I called the Maserati dealership (true story), with any problem, I will have an appointment the next day, and I will drive out in a brand new loaner car. That’s service!     I wish I never leased my Tesla Model X, simply because I don’t believe that anybody deserves service and should be treated that way.",3
33, on 06/07/16 09:55 AM (PDT),George Hawley ,2016 Tesla Model X SUV 90D 4dr SUV AWD (electric DD),Model X-Near Perfection after 2 years," The Model X is a crossover with up to three rows of seats, seven in all, built on the frame of the Model S sedan.  It is about 2"" longer and 10"" higher than the Model S.  It inherits the battery-powered drive units from the Model S with three all-wheel-drive configurations:  75D, 90D, and P100D.  The number indicates the kilowatt hour rating of the big battery pack, the D stands for dual motors and the P indicates the performance model.  Like the Model S the X is very quick 0-60, leaving all other comparable SUVs behind.  I have the seven seat, 90 kWh option.  With the two third row seats folded flat there is a reasonable amount of storage space.  There would be more had the second row seats been designed to fold, which they now do in newer versions.The controls and Autopilot systems are inherited from the Model S work quite well, though still in Beta release form.     Because of its height the X is much easier to get in and out of than the S, especially the second row via the iconic Falcon Wing Doors.  The third row has limited legroom, okay for kids.  The self-presenting front doors and spectacular rear doors have sensors to minimize the chance of banging into people or objects.  The windshield rises overhead to provide a spectacular vista for the driver.  The rear view mirror is somewhat blocked by the second row middle seat head rest.  This is not a problem for taller drivers or the five and six seat configurations.  The Model X is a very comfortable car to drive on road trips, although it uses about 15% more energy per mile, depending on speed, than the Model S because it pushes more air and is 10% heavier.  Driving 600 miles a day takes about an hour longer than the S due to added charging time at the Tesla Superchargers.If the idea of an ultra-safe, super-quick, up to seven passenger car that can park and practically drive itself for $100,000+/- appeals to you, go for it.  You will be sporting the Tesla grin every time you get into it.  After 2 years and 20,00 miles, I'm still delighted with the car, not to mention the only things needed at annual service visits are cabin filter, windshield wipers and windshield washer fluid.",4
34, on 08/07/18 08:39 AM (PDT),Alan Storch ,2018 Tesla Model 3 Sedan 4dr Sedan (electric),Range anxioity. Not anymore., My thoughts before owning a Tesla M3 was always the range and the availability of charging on the road. All of that was for naught. I live in South east Florida and there are Super Chargers all around me. The car I purchased has extended range of 310 miles (more if you drive conservatively and use the regenerative braking). Every night the car goes in the garage and gets plugged in. Every morning it is fully charged to go 310 miles. My average daily trip is 50-75 miles. My ICE car is almost never filled and has considerably less range. Elon Musk has started the future of automobile travel. Luxury performance at a comparable price with 1/6th the fuel cost and with safety galore.,5
35, on 08/06/18 20:19 PM (PDT),SKP ,2018 Tesla Model 3 Sedan 4dr Sedan (electric),Futuristic," Met expectations.  Driven 1000 miles, so far all looks good.  On long trips where most of the distance is highway miles with speed limit of 75mph ... range is reduced from 310 to something like 265.  So will need more frequent super-charging.  If I had know this earlier, I would have opted for the 18"" wheels instead of the 19"".  It would have given an extra 30 mile range.  Also if your daily commute is 20 miles each way to work ... no need to spend money on fast charging at home.  On regular outlet I get 5miles/hr and usually can get 60 miles of charge in the night.  Things to like:  acceleration, no engine sound, regenerative braking, a/c vents, headlights, sound system, navigation.",5
36, on 08/03/18 15:36 PM (PDT),dave ,2018 Tesla Model 3 Sedan 4dr Sedan (electric),Driving the Future," Sold my C series MB to purchase this car.  As my first EV I didn't know exactly what to expect, but after waiting for 2 years without ever even having driven the car, it has exceeded my expectations.  The interior is unlike a traditional car as are some of the driving characteristics - most particularly the regenerative braking.  The acceleration is stellar and the suspension and steering above average.  It's hard to compare to any other car since - in many respects - you are driving an iPad.  Nearly every control routes through the center screen.  I'm old (50's) but it still didn't take very long to adapt to the lack of instrument cluster, etc.  Driving visibility is quite good.  Despite the fact that I've only had it 5 months, nearly every feature has improved through periodic over-the-air software updates.  This is revolutionary and someday will be the standard.  Right now, it just really cool to receive updates that improve the interface and driving experience.  Very happy to have this car and would buy it again and again.",5
37, on 06/12/18 21:23 PM (PDT),Matt W.M. ,2018 Tesla Model 3 Sedan 4dr Sedan (electric),First month from a former sports car owner," I really like this car now. My first test drive was the day I purchased on faith about a month back. On that day I expected more out of it. My last car was a 350hp german sports car. While this has plenty of torque off the line, I thought it would be quicker. Now that I have driven this a few weeks I do really like the power, balance, and handling overall. It has grown on me. The stereo is great, but I end up using my phone or TuneIn, I hope there will be more popular options integrated into the car (Pandora or Spotify).  The tech is amazing in the car, the sensors, remote access, HVAC, and interior design all are great value. The build quality is better now than a few months back, I have a few minor items that seam cheap or misaligned. I'd prefer stiffer suspension. Autopilot needs to improve, which it will, but part of that is my own comfort using in urban freeways. Does it have minor issues? Sure, but that has been true with every car I have purchased, German, Japanese, and American. I prefer this over any EV or hybrid I have driven. This is truly a fantastic and futuristic car.",5

Our car was every bit as well put together as a high end German or Japanese luxury car.  It is more aerodynamic than the Model S and 20% lighter.  The drive unit in the rear wheel drive version is about 10% more efficient than those in the S.  As a result, the 75 kwh Model 3 has the same EPA-rated range of 334 miles as the 100 kwh Model S (not the 310 that Tesla advertises).  But, because it achieves this with a 25% smaller battery, its charge time is proportionately shorter.  Put these together and you can get from point A to point B about 20% faster than with a Model S.  This with a nice car that costs about 30% less!  Battery powered cars have truly arrived.",5

The control panel in the middel of the car is intuitive, and once set-up the need to use it is minimal.  Trunk and front trunk (frunk) give the car plenty of luggage and storage space.

The Tesla Model S was a home run, certainly for the driver. Only notable down side was spartan interior, especially for back seat guest.  As for the Model 3, this would be a very nice $40k auto.  But let's be realistic, this is a $56,000-70,000 car and at that realistic price you have some stiff competition.  Many offer a fob, Leather seating with heat and cooling, Apple and Android Auto and a few other oversight like a simple driver side button to adjust the side view mirrors.  The door handles are annoying.  Both the flush exterior handles designed for either 2 hand entry or only left handers and the interior tiny button release are needlessly troublesome.  My corvette has the button- but much easier to reach and execute.  The biggest deal breaker is the constant need to look away from the road and search the center screen.  As someone who drives over 30,000 miles a year i am always keeping an eye out for distracted texting drivers now i have to be away of M-3 drivers trying to change their music or xm radio station as they reach across the dash.

As beautiful as the car is on the outside, it is an absolute joy to drive.  Even my wife, a non-techie, love driving the car.  Virtually all the adjustments to climate control, seats, mirrors, steering wheel and other options are via the very well organized centrally mounted touchscreen.  Though smaller than the Model S sedan with a smallish 75 kWh battery pack, the Model 3 has plenty of leg room for 6 footers.  Tesla says 0-60 in 5.1 seconds.  It is more like 4.6.  Tesla rates the range at 310 miles.  The EPA says 334.  It is a great car on a road trip because of the efficiency with which it uses electricity from the battery pack and the rapidity of charging since there is less energy to replace.  Around town it is very agile in traffic and parks itself, if you like, parallel and perpendicular.  On the road the Traffic Aware cruise control and auto steering are easy to use and work pretty well, though the driver must be alert at all times.  A bonus is that the car has all the hardware that Tesla claims is needed for self-driving with only a software addition in the future, downloaded over the air.",5

Controls, buttons etc, or the lack thereoff, are vastly different from what you might be used to. But basically you can still drive the model 3 like any other car, except it’s whisper quiet and super fast. Runs like on rails, hugs the road like no other. It’s lighter, smaller, and perkier than the model S or X, but still feels rock solid. Has plenty of space for a family of four, and road trips are no problem with a range of 310 miles and the super charger network. Charging at home overnight is so much more convenient than getting gas. Car gets better every month with ‘over the air’ software updates, autopilot keeps evolving. Would not trade the model 3 for any other car in the world! :)",5

There were plenty of snafus, but the final result is stunning. Incredible acceleration.  Not much impulse to go excessively fast if you can make a 911-owning passenger white-knuckled going from 0 to 45.  It's so effortless. Learned to drive without much braking - regenerative throttle behavior makes rotor wear obsolete. Driving: very low stance, and doesn't like rough roads. Ownership: the company works hard to make its owners happy, but living far from a company-owned store is tough. Early bugs and glitches were immediately fixed, even if Tesla had to fly a technician out to the car. ",4.625

There were a lot of unknown factors in the Model 3 including cost, wait time, availability of federal tax incentive and inability to test drive the car. Additionally, since there haven't yet been enough resales of Model 3's, leasing is not an option. After looking at a Model 3 in one of the Tesla showrooms, I still plunked down my $1,000 reservation and explored the Tesla website learning about the cars. On the website I found a list of used Teslas including the 2015 Model S 85 that I ultimately purchased. The car is in flawless condition and is trimmed with deep blue paint, deluxe leather seats, sunroof, front console, Tech Package with Autopilot and Audio Package. It also came with what appears to be a new charger cable pack, warranty, unlimited Supercharging and AT&T connectivity. My loaded 2015 Model S 85 was roughly the same price as a new, well trimmed, long range Model 3 (before tax incentive for which I may or may not have been eligible). One downside is that the 2015 does not have the hardware to add autonomous driving capability when it becomes available. The driving experience of the Model S is like no other car I have ever driven and I am extremely pleased with my purchase decision.",5

It is a dream to drive on the highway.  Its effortless and the technology is very cool.  I love the big screen. THE BAD:  The mileage available is about 1/4-1/3 less then what it says when you get into the car.  If your driving was strictly local it wouldn't be much of a problem, but for any trip over 200 miles, it is a big problem .  The heat and AC is very weak and inefficient.  You have to crank the heat to 80 and the fan on at max is blowing lukewarm air at best.  The car never gets comfortable temperature wise.  The heated seats and steering wheel also are not very strong.  For the price of the car, I think the interior is cheap looking.  Besides the awesome screen, the leather seats are mediocre and not the most comfortable  and the rest of the dashboard is just okay.  I wish I loved everything about this car, but its not quite ready for ""prime time"" in my opinion.",4

I've had BMW 3,5,7 z4, and X5 series as well as several Mercedes S and the tens of thousand$$$ in maintenance bills that go along with them and they don't begin to compare.  I've cancelled my subscription to several car magazines because Tesla is the only manufacturer that interests me anymore for less then $100k...nothing beats a Ferrari in my mind but don't get me started on Italian maintence.   Tesla service has been excellent with me and although there have been a few items that had to be repaired under warranty (glue on window and a loose screw on the armrest) its no where near the list that's gone wrong on several ""new"" cars.  The Bimmers/Mercedes spent so much time in the shop eating money looking nice on the shop floor(because they didn't work) and that's no fun😢  So basically if you can afford one, get a Tesla.  If you can't afford one, sell your kidney... I promise you won't be disappointed.",5

So I sold the Mercedes.  Tesla has amazing performance and is the most practical car I have owned in a long time.  Autopilot is a whole new level of luxury.  The ride on my car with the sport air suspension and staggered 21 in rims is still quite good.  I think this car is an amazing value and I would recommend it to anyone.,5

It is because this car far out performs every other car on the market.  Seeing is believing.  There is a reason that the car in a few short years has become the best selling luxury car on the planet.  there is a reason Angela Merkel has publicly stated that the German car industry has to double down and be more competitive with Tesla.  The car innovates in everything they do.From self holding breaks when you stop at a stop light, to down loading upgrades, to the best user interface by far, virtually no maintenance, to batteries that still have 95% of original range at 200,000 miles on average.

66, on 02/01/16 05:04 AM (PST),hmp10 ,2015 Tesla Model S Sedan P85D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Zapped and Glad," I'm a ""car guy"" and have owned 3 Audi R8's, a Mercedes SL55 AMG, a Corvette, and a Jaguar.  I traded in an R8 V10 Spyder for this car and haven't looked back.  This Tesla is significantly faster, just as sure-footed, far more practical (at least for local driving) and, in its own way, just as cool.  It is also has the structural solidity of a bank vault and the handling tautness and tactile feel of the best cars I have owned.I thought I would miss the roar of the V10.  Instead, I find the barely audible whine and whoosh of the electric drive train just as appealing.  I thought I would miss the manual gear shifting of the R8.  Instead, I find the eerie silkiness of the Tesla drivetrain addictive to the point that driving my internal-combustion cars is now vaguely annoying.  I thought the regenerative braking would take some getting used to.  It took me about 30 seconds to adapt, and I now find it one of the best features of electric driving.  I thought the 17-inch screen would be distracting.  Instead, I find it the best driver interface I have ever seen in a car.My biggest worry in buying the car was range.  Unfortunately, this is not a car I would take on a long road trip, as the supercharger network still requires too much bobbing and weaving off ideal routes to keep the car charged.  However, there is no amount of local driving that has left me anywhere near the end of the battery range.  I picked the car up at a dealer on the east coast of Florida and drove it home to the west coast.  I was driving well above the speed on which the range claims are based, I did some hard acceleration runs (this car requires no break-in), and I made a couple of detours for errands.  The car still had 103 miles of indicated range remaining when I got home.  Since then I have used the car for long days of running errands and lengthy pleasure drives and have yet to return home with less than 138 miles of indicated range remaining.The downsides:It's absurd to build a car with so little interior storage space, despite there obviously being room.  (This is the one area where Elon Musk's attempts to be stylistically chic backfire.)  Fortunately, EVannex makes a center console that matches the interior perfectly and helps with storage.  But I still miss door pockets.  On the other hand, the front and rear trunks offer immense trunk space for things you don't need to reach while driving.Despite the car's large exterior dimensions, the rear seat is a bit cramped and difficult of entry and exit for adults.  Also, the rear seat backs (at least in the Executive Seating option) are not raked back quite enough due to the low roof line.  However, the upgraded Recaro front seats and the front seat accommodations in general are absolutely best in class.Reliability and Service:In 6 months of ownership the car has only needed service once, due to the failure of the door handles to retract.  I called Tesla service at 9:30 p.m. the evening it happened and, to my surprise, got an answer.  I was a bit aggravated at the prospect of having to take the car 100 miles to the nearest service shop.  But then I found out that Tesla had a service tech who works out of a truck in my town and who keeps a supply of parts in a local storage unit.  He was at my house before 9:00 a.m. the next morning and fixed the problem right in my driveway.  In short, it was most convenient and quickest repair I've ever had done on a car.  (It also turned out that the service tech was Buddy, the mechanic who worked on my R8 at the Audi dealer.  He had just moved to Tesla and was loving it.)Since then there have been a few software glitches with the car, seemingly related to bugs in updates.  However, they have all disappeared of their own accord, probably as a result of correction downloads that came in overnight when the car is programmed to receive automatic updates.Would I buy a Tesla again?  In a second . . . as long as it's not my only car (at least until there are more superchargers).",4
67, on 01/07/16 21:09 PM (PST),Armand Mintanciyan ,2015 Tesla Model S Sedan P85D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),So far so good.....," I went from a 2013 Mercedes SL550 to the 2015 Tesla P90D Ludicrous. I purchased (Dec 2015) all the options except for the extra seats and the winter package. Wish there was more options for exterior color, seat color, and trim. I chose Obsidian Black exterior , Black next gen seats, and piano black trim with white Alcantara Headliner. I was hesitant until I got the car but having driving in the car a few weeks now I am glad I chose the color combination I did.I used to have Lunar Blue for the SL550 and burl wood trim and tan interior. I miss the wood/leather steering wheel (not available in Tesla).Right before I committed to the car news came out about potential reliability issues. This did not help my nerves. No major issues (one minor one) but again only a few weeks driving.The car is a beast. Super performance. Much better acceleration that the SL550 and much better transmission (Ludicrous mode). Smooth as silk. Alot more trunk space then the SL550.Have had the car only a few weeks so I cannot compare reliability at this point. So far so good.Things that I have notices as negatives from the SL550:1. Headlights. In the SL550 when I made turns the headlights turned with the car. Doesn't seem that the P90D does this.2. Windshield wipers look alittle ""cheap"" compared to the SL550. In fairness there have been pretty strong storms the last few days and they seemed to work well.3. Sirius radio reception. I have been having problems with this. In the SL550 never had a problem with the Sirius radio. Have an appointment to have it looked at.4. Front center console. I think this should have been standard in the P90D. I ordered this.Had a 220V outlet installed in the garage. No issues charging. Have the car charge at 11pm at night with my tiered electric rates. Takes about 3 hours for a 60 mile round trip.Would I do it all over again. Absolutely. This car is awesome.",5
68, on 01/03/16 21:26 PM (PST),V500 ,2015 Tesla Model S Sedan 70D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Love/Hate relationship with a 3 months old car," Too many quality issues - our heating system did not work in our brand new car - we had to take it to the dealership twice (not a fun experience!!). We took the car for our Ski trip - the snow chains literally cut the car  - we haven’t found other cars having this issue. As per Tesla this happened because we did not use Tesla recommended snow chains but the Tesla recommended snow chains were out of stock. There was really no other option.Repair/Dealership issues - Tesla takes too much time for any repairs because it takes too long for service centers to get parts and also service centers are really busy because there are so many issues with Tesla cars. Also from our experience the service centers guys don’t care much - you are locked in once you have bought the car as there is no competition (Tesla only sends parts to their own service centers). The service centers also have a long waiting line for loaner cars - again because they have too much work because of all the car issues. Battery Range Issues - Don’t believe the range that Tesla advertises or shows in the car. It never gives you as much miles as advertised and in our experience it could dropped down to as little as 55-60% of the listed range (happened to us because we had to go through a traffic jam)  Interior Design Issues - In the interior the storage space is an issue - there is no storage on the doors (which other cars have). They have a big space next to the control screen but it is difficult to use as there are no compartments (Tesla sells you a console for $600 for that). The cup holders in the car are placed at a very inconvenient place - it is very difficult to put the cups there or take cups outBig car with Good acceleration/Good for the Environment - Very nice cosmetic features which includes a nice screen with all controls, handles etc. It has a very good acceleration and fun to drive car.  It looks good from outside and it is good for environment. It is also pretty big with a lot of storage space (Frunk provides additional storage)Overall it is a good car but if you are switching from a regular Gas car - you will definitely feel some pain on long trips and also with the current quality issues you probably need an extra car at home to drive around while your car is at the service center!",3
69, on 12/05/15 12:31 PM (PST),Nicholas Devaud ,2015 Tesla Model S Sedan 85 4dr Sedan (electric DD),Best vehicle I've owned," 1. Driving an all electric vehicle takes a little adjusting as compared to gasoline. Once you get there, you'll never want a traditional gasoline/ICE car again.2. Damage/repairs- an important factor in decision that is often not factored. This car has mostly aluminum vs steel constructions. It keeps car light, but it can cost more to repair. I would also caution buying if you are far (>75miles) from a service center. Services and repairs could be a hassle.3. If you hate or can't adjust to new things - this car is not for you. 4. Safety. My wife was recently hit by another driver who ran through a red light (estimated impacted was about 40-50mph). The Tesla was declared a total loss, but my wife survived the accident. In most other cars, I'm not sure she would have survived such an impact.   5. No more dirty fuel (assuming your local utility provides you with clean energy)6. Proactive service. The car communicates back with Tesla all the time. If it thinks there's a problem, Tesla service will proactively contact you to pick-up the car to have it checked and provide you with a loaner. When my wife was in accident, the first news of that accident I received was from Tesla service.7. Remote monitoring. If you have kids... you can see where they are, how fast they are driving, lock/unlock car, pre-cool/heat the car before you use it, etc...8. Charging - It's really easy at home and free while you travel out of your city using their supercharger network. By the time you finish your meal, the battery (which will give you realistically at least 240 miles range vs 265 EPA range) is nearly full again. We drive about 1,500 miles/month and electic bill is up about 30-40 / mth9. No pesky dealerships, no negotiating. Buy online. Ask for help from sales or service centers. Just great modern service. Seems like most reviews complain about minor things in their cars. I've always found Tesla very accommodating to fix defects and make their customers happy.About me - I've owned Lexus, Toyota, Nissan, Audi in past. I liked most of my cars, but never truly loved them. Tesla team - you guys are awesome.* update 18months into ownership: love the car just as much than when I got it.",5

Being able to pull into my garage and plug in rather than touching snotty gas candles has been my favorite.  I have never had to have it serviced. No oil changes. No engine to dips.

77, on 04/08/18 06:53 AM (PDT),Stephen ,2018 Tesla Model S Sedan 75D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Truly Special," The 75D Model S is more than a car — it’s a movement and Tesla found a way for us all to become part of the automotive transformation with zero sacrifices.  There is something for everyone in this car.  It’s fast, clean, classy, high tech, and it drives itself.  I have not owned my car long enough to speak to reliability but so far so good.  Customer service (Springfield NJ) has been excellent.  The Model S is pricey (even with incentives applied) but never buyer’s remorse.   In fact, every time I drive this car I am amazed by how much technology is at my fingertips.  Autopilot is by far my favorite feature.  The ability of the car to park itself into the garage is a major convenience.  My garage is tight.  Seeing the car perfectly position itself between walls and columns is impressive to say the least.  As much as I love the 75D, there is room for improvement.  Tesla needs to refine the operation of the Fronk door.  No need to simulate a classic car hood.  It’s a storage area not an engine compartment.  As it stands, the Fronk is not set up for high volume use.  The lack of Apple Car Play is a disappointment.  And although the bright white seats are a highlight (stunning in fact), the seats in form, control, and sophistication lag most high-end luxury cars.  In short, the value of this car is far greater than the cost.  Elon Musk created something very special with the Model S and the 2018 Model demonstrates Tesla’s commitment to excellence.  ",5

This car is a real testament to practical technology. During the year we have had the car we have received several updates that added thousands of dollars worth of ""accessories"" that would have to be purchased upfront with other vehicles. When new technology is available it is simply sent with an over the air update. My wife and I both love the car and thoroughly enjoy the totally different driving experience from an ICE (internal combustion engine) car. The one petal driving (because of regenerative breaking) and the true sports car handling are truly exceptional. The car (ours is a 90D) is blazing fast (zero to 60 in appx. 3.7 or 8 seconds). We like this car far better than any we have ever owned including Lexus, Infinity, Audi and Cadillac. Due for its first annual inspection in a few weeks and so far we have had zero problems (as well as emissions).

Just in 6 months the problems started with the mechanical and electronics.they were addressed several times and the service did not take care of them. They rather reply you back telling “we have not seen it. “ Meaning you are lying. The issue still exists. I have a maintenance plan but the vehicle was never taken care correctly. I had the issue with the central console right from the first service and was never adresssed. Finally it shut down excately after my 4 the service and now they say I have to pay for it because I am out of warrenty. They make you pay for the service and maintenance plans but the service is not at all justified. I have spend $150K on the care so far. It’s great as long as it runs with no issue. But running with no issues is impossible. I might spend so much on the care to drive it for 8+ years and now driving it for 2 years had been literally miserable. My order for Model 3 is in progress and now I am cancelling them also. I feel bad that I have referee many of my friends and now they have the same bad experience. The cost and maintenance of my P90D is more that BMW 7 series and Mercedes S Class. This is spending more money rather that saving. This review is coming after I have talked to several owners. The car was behaving weird and I was scared to drive it after after a week of my recent service.i had it in drive mode and it just reversed and hit the garage. The console was shut down and Tesla says they see that I reversed and hit the garage. This car is not reliable and not safe at all when it malfunctions like this.

That range did not even come close to the estimation of 335 miles that Tesla advertised.  We were barely able to make a round trip between New York City and Philadelphia which is a little over 200 miles.  And if the remaining available power was in the area of 10% at the end of our trip, it would take 12 hours or more to fully recharge the battery with our home unit.  After owning the car for four months, we were forced to sell it at a significant loss primarily because of my wife's fear that she would run out of power and become stranded.  If you do not do a lot of high speed, open road driving such as on turnpikes and parkways, this would be a great car for you.  It's performance is like nothing else I have ever experienced, including the Porsche 911 that I own.  But if you drive distances, and especially if you like to put the pedal down which this car practically begs you to do, my advice is to STAY AWAY.",4
83, on 04/24/18 09:30 AM (PDT),RJ ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 90D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Thinking about a Model S?  JUST WAIT," The Model S is in many ways a great car...just don't expect all the functions to work all of the time. I've owned a Model S for 7 months. My salesperson told me that most Tesla buyers had never paid more than $40,000 on a vehicle. I was in that same boat. So, I expected a lot. Also, prior to the Model S, I owned Toyotas and Hondas, so I was used to reliability. But, two days after I took delivery, there was a computer glitch that prevented my car from moving and stranded me at work. Since then, I've had to call for service probably a dozen times.  Most recently, my touchscreen will just blank out while I'm driving. Tesla has reviewed my car logs several times, but has been unable to fix this problem. The navigation system has frozen a few times, my streaming radio does not always work and my bluetooth audio just stopped working yesterday. Every few weeks, you'll get an update that purports to fix the recent problems, but in my experience, seems to cause a number of new problems. I have memorized how to reboot the touchscreen just like I used to do with my Pentium computer in the 90s. It may be that I just received a ""bad apple."" On the bright side, the car is stylish, the acceleration is very quick and the customer service reps are polite (even if they can't fix the problems). Tesla is like a new computer-company - they still have to work out the glitches.",3
84, on 02/14/18 10:56 AM (PST),Pete V. ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 75D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Just an Amazing Car!," I custom ordered my car on Sept 1, from the factory and it was delivered on Sep 30, 2017. I have researched and saved up for the last 3 years to purchase this car. After owning it for the last 4 months, I enjoy every time I drive it, it's truly an AMAZING car! The power (0 to 60mph = 4.2 seconds for 75D), interactive functions, safety and the ride quality is unmatched for this starting price point (80k, with other options 90k) and ZERO emissions and Free Supercharging for life! That free supercharging alone can save you about $15k (100k miles @ $3.30/g super in CA), also no oil/filter changes. I also own a Jaguar, love to drive it UNTIL I purchased the Tesla, now I can't / don't want to drive it as it seems so outdated in all aspects. I would recommend anyone to test drive this car and see for yourself!",5
85, on 01/09/18 14:48 PM (PST),Don Lathrop ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 100D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Impossible to compare to other cars," I read some of these other reviews on Edmunds. Some people miss the point. Comparing my Tesla S100D to a Mercedes or BMW is like comparing a horse to a bicycle. It makes no sense to me. I have owned expensive cars from all those companies. Since driving off in my Tesla I hope I never have to listen to a turbo, dual clutch, 9 speed, piston driven ANYTHING ever again. Period. To me, that would be like going back to a '52 Edsel. Electric is better than any of that. There is no ICE that is as smooth. Spare me the ""Interior wasn't quite up to the standards of $100k car"" lines - my white (vegan) leather interior is gorgeous. I will take the Tesla over anything offered on any other car lot because it is the best electric car on the market. With solar panels on my roof I pass the gas station and laugh at the electric company. When I tromp on the skinny pedal I have no guilt because I didn't just burn a half gallon of gas for a little thrill. It's all good. With all-wheel drive I can drive slick roads without a single worry about grip, it holds on like glue. What about the life-span of the vehicle? Nobody wants a 4 year old BMW with 50k miles because there are a million parts that can wear out or break and they cost a fortune to replace. That's why the resale sucks. Tesla's resale is superior because there are a fraction of the parts to go wrong. They estimate the battery pack will still have 80% or more of its power over 300k miles. Simpler can be better, and in this case it is. As I stated, you can't compare an electric car to one with pistons and transmissions and a tailpipe. Electric is better and it has nothing to do with overly complex luxury cars trying to stack up to what an electric car does best: Go fast smoothly and effeciently. Porche can't match Tesla's low center of gravity, not at any price. Rolls Royce can't make a smoother engine. Toyota can't make a piston car as energy efficient. Cadillac can't make a car quieter. THAT is why I love my Tesla and I don't find it comparable to other $100k luxury sedans. I will consider them in the future when they offer me something without the archaic pistons.",5
86, on 11/02/17 00:29 AM (PDT),James Malarkey ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 75D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),I've owned a lot of cars," At an early age I had an unquenchable thirst from performance, reading virtually every single R&D from 1996 to 2017.  I pursued power buying the best options available or testing it on the track.  Having owned over 52 cars, and peddle time, behing the  Ferrari, 458 F40, Acura NSX, and Porsche 993 GT3RS I thought I'd hit the pinnacle, but none compares to the Tesla...  The Tesla to a car guy is a stealth bomber to the airforce, anything on the road expect a nuclear explosion. There's nothing like it!  in standard form it seats 5, has class leading technology, and weighs 4500 lbs, yet will shred 0-60 in 4.2 seconds.  It's so quite that when you speed people don't know how to react?  There is no way to justify the speed as there's no noise, it's quite, like a mouse farting... no-one hears it. Speed isn't it's only game, utilization is off the charts! The car has two trunks, front and rear. The front alone is enough to store the groceries, the rear is large enough to put your living room in it. It's literally that big, and seems to have endless room.  For me, and really the reason why I bought it was the enhanced autopilot, which allows me to dart down the road while answering emails and making follow up conversations, which gives me a leading edge over my competitors, and sets me apart from the heard. Bottom line I love it, and I hope it continues to impress.",5
87, on 09/29/17 14:24 PM (PDT),W.A. ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 90D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),I love it.....but not perfect," Things I love: styling, performance, large info center, smooth acceleration, no gas stations, low maintenance costs, incredible sound system, frunk and sub-trunk, rear cargo space, HOV lane, federal tax credit, summons feature, replacement parts seem nicely priced, my first Service Center experience was excellent, my first body shop experience was very good, many people think you are ""cool"" and environmentally friendly (and you are).          Things I wish were better: fit and finish of body parts (not up to premium car standard), auto pilot still not a wow...needs more development, blind spot monitor is below expectations for such an advance vehicle, difficulty getting in and out of front seat...if you are tall, the front seat goes behind the ""B"" pillar too far thus the entering and exiting is more difficult. Final Verdict. I love the car. I doubt I would ever buy an ICE car again.",5
88, on 07/23/17 02:16 AM (PDT),Roger Peng ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 75 4dr Sedan (electric DD),Never seizes to amaze," I read a lot of rave reviews prior to purchase, and I come from a Porsche. Yet, this car still exceeds expectations and amazes me to no end. Power delivery is so instant and smooth that you almost feel like you're floating through air. After driving this car, any gas car now feels outdated. People say the car is expensive, but you get so much for your money, and you get stuff money can't buy elsewhere, such as the amazing auto pilot with lane change capability, parallel and perpendicular self parking, over the air software updates, free LTE web surfing and music streaming etc. Operational convenience and user experience is off the charts. I never use my key. Just go to the car; door handle opens automatically; sit down and drive. Some people say the fit and finish doesn't measure up to other high end marques.  That's not so much the case after the 2016 refresh with Model X style seats. The fact is that the interior is extremely comfortable. After a long drive you are guaranteed to feel more pampered than in a Rolls Royce, because most of the coachwork stuff is just visual, and doesn't really provide additional comfort. I drove a Jaguar sedan for many years when that was considered the magic carpet ride. Compared to a Model S it's not even in the same league. Besides the attributes of the car itself, there are just so many benefits to ownership, like never having to go to the gas station, never having to take the car to get a smog check, never having to get an oil change, reduced need for brake service due to regen, car pool lane privilege, etc.. As far as I can see, this car has no competition, and I can't see how anyone would opt to spend similar money on a Mercedes, BMW or Lexus.",5
89, on 07/12/17 20:06 PM (PDT),Dan F ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 75D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Overpriced gadget," This car was so different from anything else I drove in the past that I had to have it. It accelerates effortlessly. It's quiet. It's comfortable. It feels like a spaceship inside. It has that wow factor. But after only a few weeks of driving it, a lot of the novelty has worn off and now I'm not sure it was worth the hefty price. Tesla has done an outstanding job of taking all of the gas savings you get from an electric car and all of the government tax incentives and including them in the MSRP. So you end up paying all of those savings upfront to Tesla. You also need to plan to pay for an EV charger in your home or somehow have one available. I also quickly learned that the 259 EPA rated range doesn't apply if you want to have fun driving the car. You are also only supposed to charge the car to 90% or lower unless you want to ruin the battery long term. How does it drive? The acceleration is really fun, but it's a very heavy large car that drives like one. The handling and steering are unimpressive compared to a BMW or Porsche that you can buy in this price range. Don't get me wrong. It's a great car. But you are paying a king's ransom for it and if I had to do it over again I would spend more time considering the alternatives rather than being awestruck by my initial Tesla test drive. Keep in mind also that Tesla can introduce a massive change to your car the day after you take delivery so resale value in a few years or even after a few weeks will be terrible.",2
90, on 06/22/17 06:36 AM (PDT),Bill F ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 75D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Very Cool but not Cushy - 14 Months Later," Original Review -Purchased a 75D that has far exceeded my expectations! The 75D is not the quickest of the Tesla bunch but I find it plenty fast for my needs. The acceleration is impressive, quick, and quiet. Compared to a similarly priced Mercedes or Lexus, however,  the seats on a long trip do not provide the same level of comfort. Everything else about the car is just plain cool and technologically advanced. The view out the glass roof is amazing for rear passengers. On the pricey side, but it's no longer on my bucket list.Update - After 14 months of ownership I still find it impressive and fun to drive.  The visibility out the rear-view mirror isn't great so I always drive with the rear camera on and viewed on the top half of the iPad-like display - love this feature. Original navigation system had flaws but a recent software upgrade improved it - now powered by Google Maps. Occasional free software upgrades continue to improve the vehicle. Nice to have free supercharging on long trips. When using nav system the computer calculates if there is enough charge to get to your destination. If not, it will direct you to supercharging locations along the way. So, would I buy it again? Definitely!",5
91, on 05/07/17 19:35 PM (PDT),DT ,2017 Tesla Model S Sedan 75D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),NO LOOKING BACK," I looked at everything. Went to Mercedes, BMW, Audi, VW, Volvo,etc. They really live in the 20th century. While I gave them a chance, all dressed in suits and ties in their fancy showrooms, they really don't want to give you the time of day if you don't want to drop 50k or more on a fossil fuel burner. They put down the Tesla where ever you go, but after asking them, none of them have ever gotten of their butts to even test one.well I tested model S's over 3 years. Right now, I can't afford to buy this car, so it's the only reason why I'm not in it . It would be really nice if you could drive one for a weekend. The salesmen don't push you at all. There is such an excitement among the people, buyers, and customers in the showroom. We went for a long test ride, and it's just phenomenal. The car will actually back into a space too. It takes a while to get used to, but after 3 tests I realized how things worked, and even though I hate touch screens, they showed me how to turn it off during driving. I actually over the years wrote Elon Musk to change a few things, and 3 ideas I thought of actually happened. Imagine me writing GM in the 1970's to put a 2 liter engine with a turbo in their cars, and 40 years later Saab helped them, after they killed Saab. So, after the test is the let down. You have to get back in your car where the engine was invented over 100 years ago. It's sad. You feel like you are getting into a horse and buggy. So now GM will build 10 electric cars in China, but Tesla, the worlds greatest American car can't be sold in 5 states including Connecticut. But we are allowed to have nuclear subs made in CT. Back to the test. What the other car dealers try to scare you, they don't know the Tesla will guide your trip through the charging stations for free, and so what if you have to stop for 20 minutes. Wouldn't you stop in a gas car every 300 miles to take a pee? So forget about the new auto systems on the car. Get it without now, it's cheaper. You can add them on later when the bugs are worked out. But it's hard to consider another car after testing this car. Image a guy coming from South Africa , Elon Musk, and building the best car in our country. That's the American dream. Support this company. We are on top again with this product. If you can't afford it, look for the model 3 to come later this year. There are around 400,000 orders in for this for about 38,000 dollars.and to conclude, I worked for the oil industry for years, I saw the pollution, and while we do need oil for planes, and plastics, but not for cars much longer.",5

The car looks awesome, is quiet because it's an EV, and offers great range - up to 300 miles @ 55 mph with the largest battery pack option. It performs extremely well. Acceleration is immediately available on demand, and the 0-60 times range from 6.5 secs to 4.4(!), top speed 110-130 mph, depending on model. I also spent a half hour playing with the 17"" touchscreen at a Tesla store. It offers streaming music to Google maps and everything in between.The car has the most storage space in its class, with a ""frunk"" (front trunk) where the noisy, polluting gas engine would be in an old-fashioned car.

The car is lightning fast, thrilling to drive, fun to share and just a great experience every day I get into it. Tesla service is incredible, they've taken care of so much without even charging for it as I've brought the car in a few times for other services. Only minor glitches over time that were fixed very quickly. I highly recommend this to anyone who can afford it and live without the noise of an engine, replacing fluids, breaks etc. Seriously the only real maintenance is windshield wipers, rotate tires, alignment (if you're clumsy) and possibly breaks.",5

It also moved me up on the Model 3 waiting list so that was my plan.  I decided I didn't want a Model 3 two years later for several reasons so cancelled my place in line.

I hear there are only about 4 moving parts in the entire drive train, including the pedal, and the wheels, vs. 100s of moving, breaking parts in an ICE car.

Then the limitation of 35mph on back roads ! So there is no point A to B self drive yet. That was a con in the videos. Whole AP tech is still in beta mode. Self park was a joke. It just went half-way and then the dealer says he doesnt want it to hit bushes so self-parks it. Car essentially needs data and they give you 4 years for free after which you have to pay for it.

It is even better than my 2013 Tesla S which was sold to a Washington State car dealer who is very happy with it! I especially like the 4-wheel drive of the Tesla S 90, the Autopilot capabilities including the self-driving capability which I use for most of my driving (simply superb!), the HEPA air filtration system, the adaptive lighting, and the extended driving range (300 miles). Still the best looking car around! No wonder more and more car companies are imitating the Tesla S looks, but even Mercedes, Audi, and BMW cannot come close to the styling of Tesla S and X! Tesla S continues to be the best car I have driven so far. It is absolutely reliable with not a single repair bill for over 100,000 miles of driving. I reserved a Tesla 3, and cannot wait for it to arrive.Earlier review (for my 2013 Tesla S):My 2013 Tesla S 85 reached 90,000 miles last week! So far, the total repair bill for it was $29,00 for a flat tire. Unbelievable, my Tesla S still has its first brakes, and I just just replaced its second set of tires! I drove it over 8,000 miles to the East Coast and back (free-of-charge, using super chargers) with not a single problem. My batteries (at 90,000 miles) are at 95%! In comparison, my Mercedes S-Class had cost me about $10,000 in repairs at the same mileage, not to speak of the very high maintenance cost! There is no other car on the market that is so good-looking, practical, and reliable as the Tesla S! I just traded in my Tesla S 85 for a 90 D. What a different (pleasant) experience dealing with Tesla staff in comparison to the high pressure gas-guzzler-dealer-vultures! I felt like a valued customer and not like a persecuted victim! Taking my first trips in a new 90 D, I was in awe with all the improvement and technical refinement! My son owns a high-end AUDI, and his new car has been in the repair shop repeatedly for a total of 3 weeks due to problems with the software. My neighbor had so many problems with the software of his new high-end BMW that his dealer finally gave him a brand new replacement car. They both will switch to Tesla S cars in the near future because of my excellent experience with Tesla cars. No wonder the European high-end car manufacturers are utmost disturbed, to say the least, and are trying to catch up! But look at their first EV products so far: Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen E-cars without fast charge ports, allowing just pitiful 85 miles of range. Expensive and pathetic!

Really wanted to get the lastest model a and and she wouldn't trade her's for the world. So i broke down and gave up my beloved F355 and my BMW convertibles for the model s . Granted the P85 was faster than the F355 and the model S on day one . Would the 60d match up . The car is amazing . It keeps all the great aspects of our super reliable P85 while adding the surprisingly helpful even in Florida  all wheel drive . My first impression were the next generation leather seats that feel as good as the Ferrari and an improvement on the 2013 p85 . The 2nd is the new premium interior . Although the stock model s is nice the premium interior adds to already beautiful cabin . The 3rd has been the performance . The car with the All wheel drive has amazing acceleration and stunning efficiency . The number of miles per charge is much improved on an already very good number . With the super charger network here in Florida can't even imagine range ever being a problem .  Love this car although I admit I miss my Ferrari a little .,5

108, on 11/07/16 18:08 PM (PST),Tony Barre ,2016 Tesla Model S Sedan 70 4dr Sedan (electric DD),Unavailable Repair Parts Tarnishes Tesla Image," When I bought my new Tesla Model S in May 2016 and for months before I was proud to be part of “accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy.”  I talked it up with my friends and family and even with strangers I met at Starbucks.  I got 2 of my kids to pre-order the Model 3.Then I ran over a truck tire tread on the freeway, causing $6k of damage to the bumper and undercarriage.  Since then, the car has been at Kniesl's Repair Shop in Roseville, CA, a Tesla-authorized repair shop.  It has been there for 6 weeks now awaiting repair parts, with no ETA for those parts.  In fact, Kniesl's tells me that they have 3 other Teslas in their shop in similar condition awaiting parts for as much as 3 months.  After 4 weeks, I contacted Tesla using the form on their web site.  No response.  At all.If “the world's transition....” involves no repair parts, I want no part of it, and neither should you.  If “the world's transition....” includes the inability to forecast a delivery date for repair parts, I am ashamed to be a part of it.  If “the world's transition....” entails a complete lack of interest in post-sales customer service, I am afraid of it.What would you do if your car was unavailable for 6 weeks with no forecast for when it would be available again?  Would you feel like you were accelerating the world's transition to sustainable energy?",3
109, on 10/19/16 05:35 AM (PDT),Tim L ,2016 Tesla Model S Sedan 70D 4dr Sedan AWD (electric DD),Still Revolutionary," Electric cars are here to stay.  Amazing range, acceleration and handling.  If you can afford the hefty price tag, these cars have little to no maintenance so the actual cost during ownership is small in comparison to non-electric cars.  The autopilot feature is a game changer for folks who drive daily in traffic.  Your right foot will be bored and your blood pressure will drop.  It takes the stress out of driving while being stuck for hours in traffic.  That alone is worth the hefty entry price for these cars!  Beware of any body shop work that may be required because it takes forever to get basic parts from Tesla and when it's in stock they ship using slow ground transport from a warehouse far far away.Tesla customer service is terrible! The product is exceptional but they do not care about how they treat loyal customers when they are repeat buyers. For Texas residents, they have the audacity to charge you for the right to fully pay for your car before shipping it which takes 10 days to arrive. So in conclusion, closing costs are higher and you get to wait 10 days for delivery. Win/win for Tesla but not for their customers!",4
110, on 10/04/16 21:53 PM (PDT),Peter ,2016 Tesla Model S Sedan 70 4dr Sedan (electric DD),I'll never go back to ICE after having a Tesla, I've had my Model S60 for three months now and its great. I have the smallest battery pack and its still plenty of range. The one time I went beyond its range I was able to quickly charge up with the free superchargers. You might knock it for the weight and size but the pickup is crazy for a car this size and the weight is all down low in the battery pack. The Autopilot is amazing for Bay Area freeway congestion. The only small knock is the lack of door storage. I have seen the Model X does much better here and I suspect in time they will add this to the S. I rented one on Turo for a long weekend and it really helped me decide to go for it.,5
111, on 08/30/16 03:32 AM (PDT),Mark Levin ,2016 Tesla Model S Sedan 70 4dr Sedan (electric DD),We own 2 of the orginal Tesla Model S," We have 2 MS. The first one I ordered a smaller battery 60, with only 2 options, leather interior and pano roof. We received the car in May 2013. That car now has over 85k miles and has only been in the shop for one repair very early. Some guide clips on the Pano roof broke. It was quickly repaired and I was given a new MS to drive while the repair was being done. The car looks and runs like it did new and we have only lost 3 miles of range in the battery! We are told to charge the car 90% every night, and when new it totaled 185 miles and now it charges to 182 miles at 90%. My wife drives that car about 90 miles per day, round trip to work. I purchased a used one in Nov 2014, with 15k miles. It is a MS P85, at that time it was just about the most powerful car in the lineup. Today they offer 90D and P100D models. But I don't think they have anything on mine. The car charges to 230 miles each night at 90%. Realistically when driving at or above normal highway speeds you will only get about 80% of the range, so need to be careful when doing long distance trips. But around town, you never need to be concerned with range. The only weak point about the car is that it is rather plain on the interior. I don't mind it is nice enough for me. And the advanced technology over rides the lack of pizzaz. Like many people who own this car, I doubt I would ever go back to a gas car as my primary vehicle. Overall it is an amazing car.",5

In fact, as I learn more and more about the operation characteristics and computer downloads the autopilot function is getting even better in ""beta"" mode.  I've just figured out how the 360 degree camera while in reverse works and along with the rear view camera.  Truly makes backing up a breeze.However, there still is no true emergency stop capability (will slow before impact, but will not prevent it from happening) ... I know there could be and there should be.This is a 2018 update to my last review.  Took a trip to from Louisville, Ky to Niagara Falls, New York and back ... no problems.  Supercharger stations along the Interstate's spaced about 120 to 150 miles apart (stopped at each one to see how easy they were to get to and use going to, on the way back only stopped twice using both Google and Garmin navigation  app's. - no problems); adaptive cruise control and autopilot worked perfectly; the ride was comfortable, but firm, i.e., just right for my taste.  Computer updates and downloads executed flawlessly. Well pleased, very well pleased indeed.       Traded in a '09 CTS-V.  Very similar in handling and performance ... S probably a bit faster.  But, with much better mpg and silently sucks the headlights off the competition.   Love the body style and British Racing Green W/Grey Nappa leather interior color too.Now that we have a Supercharger in Louisville, Ky.  The title of my review needs to be changed to FREE Green Lightning.  Autopilot, parking,  and summon updates work as good, or better, (once you learn how to use them) as advertised.",5

Although the vehicle is incredibly fast and fun to drive the car is a disappointment. The front seats are very uncomfortable. We were promised new seats in February, didn't happen. The navigation system is the worst I have ever used except for the BMW.  Mr. Musk told us all the wonderful thing that the New D will do so I bought one. The car does none of these.

Faster than Ferrari performance, AWD, and every stomp of the accelerator doesn't burn a gallon of gas.  Flex your foot and your face and body are thrown back with nearly no accompanying noise.  The silence makes the acceleration somehow more rocket like, as if some unseen force is hurtling you toward the horizon.  This car is the future of powertrains.  ",4.5

I drive a lot and hate driving hybrids with CVTs.  So when I could get an all electric performance car I took the plunge.  I usually prefer coupes to sedans, but since Tesla no longer made the Roadster, I went with the Model S.  I couldn't be happier.  The service is excellent, especially compared with my wife's Lexus.  If there's ever a problem, Tesla sends a valet out to get my car, leaves me a brand new loaner, fixes and washes it, and then brings it back to my house, all for free.  The car is big, but it still gets close to double Prius efficiency, all while I drive it as fast as I want.  Charging at home is also very convenient compared to stopping for gas.  The only drawback for me is it is slightly more prone to interior rattles than my past vehicles.  This could be because it doesn't make any engine noise, but overall it's still much quieter.",5
