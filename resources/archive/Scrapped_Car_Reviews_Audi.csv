I've owned BMW 3, 5, and 7 series, Porsche 911, and Mercedes SL 55 and a Honda Pilot.  The SQ5  is a combination of all of them.  Its rides very comfortably, very stable, and quiet, sporty and with a lot of power and torque. Its a get up and go car, great to drive anywhere in the city or country.  I love the quality and the very advanced technology I feel like I'm in a spaceship.  I've tested the Volvo XC90, it had a very bouncy air suspension and I didn't quite trust their NAV system. I also test drove the RX 350, but again the ride was not as smooth and it just didn't absorb the bumps well, plus it was quite boring to drive. I've never test drove an Audi before until my wife wanted to look at the Audi Q7. After we bought the Q7, I just fell in love with it and had to have one just like it.  The SQ5 is a combination of sports car and comfortable SUV, very adaptable to all my different driving needs.",5

4, on 10/25/17 15:54 PM (PDT),Al ,2018 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Best luxury SUV w/ perfect comfort/sport balance," Very happy with choosing the 2018 Audi SQ5 prestige. Before buying, I compared it to the new F -Pace S, XC60 T8, 43 AMG, and upcoming redesigned  X3 M40i. With Audi SQ5's standard adaptive dampers, you get the best comfort, but also great sportiness when desired. The volvo is for my taste too soft and floaty, while the others are too harsh for a daily driver even with adaptive dampers. Even when driving back-to-back the Lexus RX and the SQ5 on my backroads, I found the SQ5 quieter and soaking up bumps much better than the Lexus RX while being faster at the same time. The virtual cockpit and the modern entertainment system are truly the best and most updated in their class, ahead of other competitors. Having google maps in a 12.3"" screen in front of you w/ live traffic info is unbeatable. The XC 60 T8 comes close, but its infotainment system is rather laggy and ergonomics are not well though-out as everything, incl. heater, are adjusted w/ the main screen. So if that main screen does not boot up quickly or correctly you are basically left in the dark not being able to adjust anything. As confirmed by the recent reliability survey from consumer-reports, Audis are very reliable particularly compared to other luxury brands. Volvo and Jag are the bottom brands in this respect. All in all, it is the best grocery getter I have owned that pertains a dual-personality of keeping the rest of the family comfortable driving from A to B, but yet having the option of embracing windy and twisty roads with speed.",5

6, on 07/16/17 08:19 AM (PDT),Aspen SQ5 ,2018 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Exceptionally balanced vehicle," Ive owned alot of cars since the late 70's, mostly BMW and Porsche. Ive owned 5 M3's, 2 M5's, 4 911's and more recently X5's, a Cayenne and even an X3M. Then I bought a 2012 Audi A8L and fell in love with the brand. Bought wife an Audi allroad and wanted something a little sportier. Wen to the dealer intending to look at the S4/S6/7 line and was considering the S5 sportback. All of the aforementioned is only for context. Im an older guy who appreciates performance and yet I have a perspective of how much performance a person can actually use on the street. I also enjoy a modicum of practicality and so many new cars today offer both that could only be dreamed of 10 or 15 years ago. The SQ5 is without a doubt the best balance of both comfort and performance I have encountered to date in an easy to live with package. Simply amazing the choices we consumers enjoy today. I considered a Macan but the usual Porsche buying experience is a turnoff. Additionally, my local Audi dealer was terrific to deal with and frankly, the SQ5 technology embarrases the Macan as well as the driving dynamics of the 2018 SQ5 feel far superior to the older platform that underpins the Macan. You can't go wrong with the SQ5 and be sure to get the virtual cockpit option.",5
7, on 04/22/18 20:44 PM (PDT),Ajay ,2017 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),A rare find!," I have owned a 2006 BMW X5, 4.4V8, 2009 Mercedes ML350, 3.5V6, and now this supercharged German beast! I have driven over 4000 mi. in about 6 weeks mainly urban commuting. The SQ5 by far has outshined my previous makes and models in almost every aspects, from interior quality, to performance, agility, steering precision, and nimbleness in maneuvering. I truly enjoy this new found, near instant acceleration, very useful in overtaking slow-pokes on Houston freeways, and ingressing from ramps to freeways. Also the braking is quite impressive too with its massive front rotors and pads.  Interior fit and finish oozes quality, and attention to detail, from knurled knobs to beautifully contoured dash and center console, and a smooth metal and leather round gearshift knob. All controls are quite logical. However adjusting the fan speed is a two step process, and speaker volume control not in its usual location. Lack of USB port makes up by having WIFI & media bluetooth connection, and two SD card slots. I just copied my entire music collection on one SD slot, all at my fingertips. Though the front seats are beautifully made, they are narrow for the north american ass. I am just over 200lbs, but wish the seats were a bit wider for drives longer than an hour. The view out the front, sides, and up is great, except for the massive blindspots from the two side view mirrors. Not exactly ""Mickey Mouse ears"" mirrors, they still block your view of the curb you are turning into. Very careful, not to hit the curb with those awesome 21"" wheels. I truly enjoy driving the SQ5, every chance I get. It sure feels like a refreshing change from  the Merc, and the BMW, which seem to have become such mainstream, with the soccer moms. The styling, lines, curves are mild, understated, unlike the crazy and faddish Japanese exterior designs lately. I am hoping the SQ5 will be as durable as well it performs.",4
8, on 03/21/17 18:25 PM (PDT),Tom ,2017 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),What a Cayenne Turbo driver thinks of this car," This will surprise you. Forget the BMW X3 and Mercedes GLC. The only real competitor to the SQ5 is the Macan S. If you've had fun in your previous car, expect twice as much in the SQ5. The supercharged engine is far superior to any turbo. The power is instant and gratifying, complemented with the best engine tune in class. The transmission is composed and civilized in traffic and fast during spirited driving. The SQ5 beats its competitors hands down on gratification. If you like a softer ride, go with the 20"" wheels on the SQ5 or a Macan with air suspension. The X3 and GLC suspension can also be dialed down into comfort but those two will never escape their mommy wagon stigma. The other area where the SQ5 outshines all its competitors is practicality: much more interior space than the Macan, much bigger windows than the Merc and BMW, much better sound insulation (laminated windows standard) and much better access through rear doors than the Macan. The flat-bottom steering wheel is great for getting in and out, especially for bigger people. The SQ5 is not perfect: its only USB port is located in the passenger glove box and its adaptive cruise control does not go all the way to stop. But it stands for Stealth Wealth - people who want to drive the best without spilling the beans. I still can't believe the sleeper status of this car. If you can find one, get one with optional diamond stitching inside! This car looks best in Daytona Gray and Sepang Blue.",5

13, on 12/23/15 15:37 PM (PST),Bart Andeer ,2015 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),What a dissapointment," If interested, you may want to read my reviews on the 2002 Audi S8 (massive engine failure despite excellent service history), 2014 Q5 TDI (Expensive Vibrator).  I also have a 2008 S5 Coupe (so far, so good but it's going soon).  So, this review is not in a vacuum, but with some real Audi ownership experience.  OK, cut to the chase - in Florida Lemon Law circus at present.  It was disappointing with delivery of the car.  The interior is made as cheaply as possible and it shows.  This is not the el cheapo standard seating.  Buzzers going off, alarms going off all the time.  Sport Utility Vehicle.  Well, utility is a joke.  Doors lock when you don't want them to, alarms and warnings going off.  Between Health & Safety and the accountants, the car is pathetic.  Can't even turn the radio off without shutting off the Navigation.   These are but annoyances really.  The real joy began on a long road trip, right after the 5,000 mile service.  About 300 miles into the trip the add oil light came on.  Pulled off into a service station and could not find the oil dip stick.  Called the dealer (Reeves of Tampa, of whom I've been dealing with with the other Audi's and Porsche and think highly of) and informed that they don't have dip sticks.  Well, the upshot of the trip was that I would add maybe 1/3 of a quart every 500 miles.  The day I got home I brought it in and they had it for about a week, said it was fixed and within 110 miles it was telling me to add oil again.  They then had it for two weeks (Total 15 days for Lemon Law) and again the light came on.  Now the purpose of the car is my commute to work, from Tampa, FL to outside New Orleans, LA.  I can't be late looking for Audi dealers to see if I really need oil or not.  So, I then started the Lemon Law process.  Audi had 10 days to respond, but took 14 days.  I took the car back to Reeve for the final repair attempt.  They are allowed 10 days, but took 15 days.  I was told it was fixed, but the lights are on again.  The Better Business Bureau that one must go through stated today that Audi considers the car fixed.  Funny, I just took it to the dealer again today to have them manually check the oil before my next road trip.I'm totally disgusted with Audi Engineering (which seems to be run by accounting these days) and their customer support.  I have not ever had anyone from Audi give a courtesy call and sincerely state that they are sorry for my situation.  Rather, they just basically ignore the timelines set forth by the State of Florida.  Now whether that is due to arrogance, incompetence or being understaffed (due to more accountant management) I can't say, but it is not very impressive what ever the case is.  I requested that this be resolved by 23 December as I have to travel for business again, but that request was not acknowledged.""Truth in Engineering""???  maybe they should revise to ""Truth is, it's Value Engineering"".  Just a suggestion....Update.  While waiting for the arbitration hearing I took it in for the 15,000 mile service with the agreement that there would be no tampering or repair attempts.  After the service the yellow oil idiot light does not come on.  Fixed, well, not exactly.  I took it to another mechanic, had him drain about 2 qts of oil out and that yellow oil light still won't come on, and the computer screen is now different.  Hmmm, change the oil and these things magically change as well.  I'm letting the Federal Trade Commission & FL Attorney General's Office figure that out.  The complaint is under Unfair & Deceptive Business Practices. Finally had the Florida Arbitration Hearing, they ruled in my favor (3-0) but the law is so lame that the settlement was not acceptable to me.  Again attempted to settle this with Audi & Reeves Tampa Audi to no avail.  Now waiting for a court date under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.  Nearly one year sense the problem started.**Update**  One week prior to the pre trial hearing we went to mediation.  Volkswagen decided after a very brief negotiation to give me essentially what I had been asking for for over a year and pay my attorney's fees as well, and of course that the poorly engineered and overpriced piece of junk (my opinion) back.  I am actually getting rid of my other Audi, an S5 coupe this week.  I want nothing to do with Volkswagen or the local dealership (Reeves Audi of Tampa) in the future due to the way I've been treated.  I have been a gentleman through this entire process, but was bullied, lied to and had the dealership play games which have been reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Florida Attorney General's office for unfair & deceptive business practices.  Used that dealership for 15 years with Porsche & Audi.  No more!Just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing more to add, other than I can't imagine myself ever purchasing another product under VW.Again, I just received an email from Edmunds to update the review.  Nothing to edit",1

But the MMI system is the pits.  Too many buttons, levers, dials, etc. to search for and too many actions with them before what you want to happen does happen and too much time looking away from the road while searching for what you want.  But it is fun to drive, good size, fairly comfortable, too expensive, visibility not the best, and, considering cost,  behind somewhat in technology.",4

Had been shopping around for Audi Q3 and also Porsche Macan S.  Test drove the SQ5 one day and new this was the Audi for me.  The performance for a mid-size CUV is impressive.  Great acceleration and stopping power for a performance vehicle.  The quality of craftsmanship/materials is outstanding.  Love the interior design and seats...very comfortable and have great support. The carbon-fiber trim and matte chrome trim in the dash and doors add a very nice and elegant touch.  Love the Google maps feature and wifi hotspot feature.  The Bang and Oulfsen sound system is first rate in a vehicle in this price category.  While many have complained of no USB ports, this can be easily remedied by the USB plug adapter which so far has worked just fine.  Overall I'm very impressed and pleased with the Audi SQ5.  I smile every time I get behind the wheel.  I'm definitely an Audi fan!",5

Only had the car 2 weeks but just completed a trip to Canada and it is just a pleasure to drive. I've had other sports cars before and we just traded a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee for the Audi. No Comparison. Besides the original price the Audi is in another league. Hopefully I'll be saying the same in a few years.,5

So much more fun than a Macan, save the $$, express some individuality and retain some credibility.It's the thinkers' choice. Now 2 years later and still very pleased, has the same, if not better, well proven real life performance as a Macan Turbo or AMG GLC without the obvious overtones or questionable Korean Car Show looks.",5

Traded a 2013 335i sport line which was an amazing car.   Acceleration is less in SQ5 than the Bimmer, but everything else is extremely comparable.   Handling tightly the curvy NC mountain roads, crushing light to light performance on the straight roads of Florida, limo like feel for the date nights with my wife, and of course Quattro safety.   Cannot say enough great things.   My wife is a hard sell on my sports car addiction, but this car  is now her daily driver passing by our corvettes, BMW M4, and others including a Hummer that she calls ""too slow"" (and it is).  Accolades to Audi.   We keep coming back, and have had A6 4.2, S4 Cabrio, but this is our best Audi yet.",5
20, on 09/30/15 08:28 AM (PDT),Jim ,2016 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),What a sleeper of a CUV! This vehicle scoots!," I love my SQ5!I really thought I wanted the Porsche Macan S, which similarly configured would have cost me about $2 grand more. It had a better interior, certainly more head turning appeal and better steering. The practical side of me thought the Audi will net fewer tickets if for no other reason than the police wouldn’t get as big of a thrill writing a ticket on an Audi. Besides, this is my daily driver and bottom line was the best “practical” choice of the two.Now the pros/cons: The good – Wow! What a fun driving experience! It sits up high and accelerates like an S4/S6, even besting the hp output. I can’t say enough about how much fun this vehicle is to drive! It stops quickly and has a solid feeling stance as it hugs the road. The WiFi and Google maps round out a very nice technology package (I will always want Google Maps from here on in every vehicle). So the bad: no USB ports (really!?!) and a small 7.5” screen in a car today seems tiny. Rounding out my dislikes is storage space is not great and the steering, although tight is not what I would expect from a German-made premium vehicle.The overall sporty drive, understated classy looks, ride comfort and technology make this one of my favorite cars to own. I look for reasons to run out for something just to drive it!Lastly, golf clubs will fit fore to aft if you slide the rear seats forward a couple inches.",5

Welchel ,2014 Audi SQ5 SUV 3.0 Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),A spectacular failure," I see great reviews here for this vehicle and I'd add my name to the list of praise. Great vehicle. Fast. Well-made. Roomy. In fact the only complaint I have is how 'worthless' the car was after I'd driven it 50K plus. The disastrous resale was shockingly terrible. It makes you look at the SQ5 in a whole new light. Brutal. Worse than you'd expect. Did I say terrible? But owning this vehicle has been flawless. It delivered everything I expected. I wished the ride wasn't so hard and seats so unforgiving. But that's the tight ride quality sacrifice, it is a wickedly fast beast and can handle itself easily with all that going on. With room for whole family and much more. A really expensive reality of owning this car is the tires. 2K per 25-30K mi. Kinda eye-opening. Strangely, the MPG never bothered me, it was very good for a beast like this. Final opinion: a bummer of toxic-level bad resale value and operating costs-- yet a brilliant, awesome vehicle.",4

I loved the way it looked, made heads turn, the power, and fuel mileage.  Bought certified lease return because they come with a 100,000 mile warranty.  Made me feel safe.  The car started using a lot of oil. Audi refills for free. The car started using 1/2 every 1000 miles.  I was told normal. It still ran like scalded dag.  I finally complained enough at the dealership that they ""marked"" my engine and did an oil consumption test at 78,000 miles.  The engine was shot.  It needed new pistons and rings.

I maintained my Audi religiously through the dealership, all recalls were done when notified. At 80,000, (2010?)suddenly I had to start adding oil b4 the next oil change service. I questioned the dealership and was told that was to be expected because of the age of the vehicle & to keep adding oil. This continued for 2 1/2 years, and being continually reassured by the dealership. The oil light was coming on more frequently, I kept adding more oil. 2 months ago I went to a different dealership-(the original dealer is no longer dealing in Audi). They told me my pistons were bad, something had been manufactured incorrectly and there had been an issue that Audi knew of. To rectify the problem would cost me $6000. - again the dealer told me to just keep adding oil.  I checked into it on the internet- class action suit years 2008-2011. My car is an early 2012-manufacturered 02/12. Contacted Audi told me to pay 4 an oil compression test, which didn't happened in time. My car is currently sitting in my driveway,@ 109,000 miles, undriveable and awaiting a tow truck because it suddenly does no more than 23 miles an hour.  Audi's not sure what my out come will be!? AND that I should prepared myself for the outcome.  WOW talk about stabbing loyal owners in the back. Get a Mercedes, BMW or Volvo.",3

It needed brakes again at 35000 miles, including rotor replacement.  At 38500 it had to have major engine repair--too much carbon build in the engine. It was over three years old, so the warranty was gone.  Big $$$ to repair. Fuel injectors needed replacement at 42000 miles. In summary, I would describe this high dollar car as poor quality, unreliable, very expensive to maintain and very overrated. The local Audi dealer is good, but with labor rates at $135.00 per Hr. well it just is not worth it. I would not recommend an Audi nor will I purchase one in the future",2

I chose the 3.2 engine because when I test drove the 2.0, I couldn't stand the way the turbo charger whined every time the car shifted. I love the way it hugs the road. I have driven in snow and ice without chains or studded tires and never had a problem. The back seats are not that comfortable for long trips though. It really should be considered a four seater unless the center seat in the back is occupied by a car seat.  The biggest complaint I have about this vehicle are the oversized side view mirrors. I have to make a point of looking all around them. A couple of times I could not see the people in the crosswalk because the driver side mirror was blocking them completely. I once cut off a motorcycle because he was behind the passenger side mirror. I need to look into after-market smaller side mirrors. The cargo room with the rear seats in the upright position could be a little larger. Great turning radius. Handles really well. Best car for teenager to learn to drive. Quiet. Working the navigation system is confusing.  Not a great paint job. My dog's nails left a deep scratch in the bumper while he was getting into the cargo area.",4

Four years later the engine died, and the dealership wanted to charge me $6,100 to essentially replace the entire top half of the engine, due to a timing chain defect, and they refused to pay anything toward it. Absolutely unacceptable for a car that's basically new, with only approximately 75,000 miles on it. I made sure that I took it for an oil change every 3,000 miles and regularly scheduled service. If you are planning on purchasing an Audi Q5, DON'T DO IT! Do your online research (timing chain/transmission/etc.) and you'll see how poorly made these vehicles are.",1

So my husband and I came across the Audi Q5 and was like no way because of the name, maintenance costs associated and the funky controls but when we test drove it plus the low mileage (off of a lease), I fell in love.  I think my husband more so.  It was sporty, luxurious (black w/brown leather interior), not too big.  I was not crazy about getting a 4cyl coming from a Lexus RX300 6cyl because I like a little pedal power but the sport mode seemed to have enough get up and go.  Now that I have had the car almost 9 months I can adequately give an informed review on my first Audi, albeit used and extensive.  PROS:   It is definitely a sporty, luxurious SUV, love the look of the interior and exterior especially the inside lights at night; nice sound system, great gas mileage, roomy trunk, roof etc.  Interior quality is nice and for a 4cyl it has nice power in turbo/sport mode.  CONS:  I felt like I needed a Ph.D. in Audi.  It is not intuitive, e.g. sunroof.  Like other reviewers, the multimedia system can be confusing and is disappointing especially the location because although I use the wheel controls I still find myself looking down and that is dangerous.  I feel like I'm controlling an aircraft or an ultrasound machine with the rotary dial, push, turn, push turn dial; some of my FM stations don't always come in unless I hit my presets.  My 20 yr old son and I cannot believe I have to buy several adapters in order to listen to  music on our iphones.  Other cars have easier bluetooth hookups than this car.   Putting the adapter in the glove box was just idiotic. Radio text should be automatic.  The Navigation is old and useless because Audi wants you to buy a cd for updated maps...not.  Let's not even talk about the brake dust every two seconds.  The backseat is a little tight but even tighter for 3 people as the hump takes up leg room.  I am coming up on 30k and the maintenance schedule says to change spark plugs at 35k???  Really?  Spark plugs should last 75k-100k!?  Overall I love the look and feel of the Q5 but I paid for the name and look.  The maintenance costs are too high at Audi.  Although I did my research which had many good reviews, but at this price ($35k), I do not think I would ever buy a used 4cyl again (despite turbo) at this price point with so many issues or lack of certain things as stated above. I will keep this car for a few more years and probably give it to my son and hope it lasts 10-15 years like my Lexus but will go back to a 6cyl SUV that is sporty with easier ""touch"" controls and less issues.",3

I finally purchased one after test driving all other vehicles in its class just to be sure. Only 35k miles when I purchased and was a lease return (keep in mind I made sure they put new rotors and break pads on the vehicle when I purchased it). I have owned this car less than one year and put 20k miles on it. I had completed the 45k mile service no problem. Just took it in for the 55k service and was told it needed new brake pads and rotors along with brake fluid flush, oil pressure valve replacement and of course that's on top of the $399 price tag for the 'normal' maintenance at 55k miles. All of that totalling $2,300!! And I haven't even owned the vehicle for a year. I knew that audi's were expensive to fix but did not realize the poor quality of the factory parts such as brake pads and rotors. I'm not a crazy driver and take pride in driving my car gently only occasionally speeding and braking when needed. On a side note the blue tooth is horrible and the navigation is useless. After this experience I have lost faith in Audi. I definitely will not be purchasing one again. I do not feel that this car is worth the price tag...disappointing altogether.",2

There has never been a time that I’ve driven this car that I haven’t gotten aggravated to no end with its stupidity. Let me paint a picture about their pre-Sense anti collision assistance. Driving down the New Jersey Turnpike I proceed to pass another car. Turn signal on, drift in the left, start to accelerate and BAM! ABS is activated intent on stoping this car. Well. needless to say I get the sign a peace from the gentleman behind and and really Obnoxious horn beeping. Rightfully so.I look like an idiot that pulled out and tried to stop.  That happen twice. The dealer tells me they’re aware their pre sense  is very sensitive and it’s for my protection. really there wasn’t even a car in front of me.   Issue number two. The transmission.  When I start out from a stop  The transmission has to decide what gear it supposed to be in before we go, clunking and banging . OK off we go. the transmission  is interested in doing one thing and that’s getting into the highest gear Possible before you go 15 feet no matter what your input is. You would think? being a perceived highline German car Audi would’ve engineered out this unsophisticated jolting and horrible mapping of a transmission.  The paddle shifters are a toy. the car will override your imput whenever it feels like. Even in manual mode.   Let’s talk about Aceleration. Better yet here’s an exercise if you’re so inclined to test drive one. On ramp simulation. Bring the car down to about 5 miles an hour, now there’s room to Merge in. Consider allTraffic is doing 60 to 70 miles an hour. so punch the Pedel  to the floor. I guarantee there will be a three second delay before that car moves. pretty scary with your nose out in traffic.  There are other issues but I think you get my point .I would seriously think long and hard and test drive the hell out of this car if you decide to consider. From experience your dealership will be no help. Audi corporate could care Less and will send you back to the dealer telling you that all is normal.All that being said I will say that once the car gets moving it’s comfortable, it’s not quiet and you need to pay attention to keep it straight. Mine likes to continually try to drift Left.Again Audi tells me all is good, And typical of all wheel drive cars that are front wheel drive biased... Wrong! Thanks for reading.

I made the switch to the 2018 Audi Q5 from a 2013 Lexus RX350. This Audi is definitely a beautiful luxury vehicle, and I love bells and whistles in my car so I got the Prestige version. If you have any personal padding in your backside, you will hate these hard seats. I just could not get comfortable no matter what I adjusted, it cut me in the back of the thigh. Driving for any period of time was painful.  It drove beautifully, and was responsive, but I just didn't click with this car. Technology wise,  I love the heads up display that kept me informed of the local speed limit, and how fast I was going right next to each other. But, I found the center console technology had to get used to, dial this, push that, if there a 3 lines on one side there's another menu, a plus on the other side of the screen meant another menu. Dial, menu, dial, menu. There is NO room in the console, no place to put your phone, very hard to reach cup holders, and a center console box that is so small it wouldn't hold a small box of Kleenex. The shifter moves back and forth for reverse, neutral, and drive pressing one button, but there was a separate button to push for park... and no noise alerting you to being in park. The car is so quiet,  and the radio is still on until you open a door, half the time I didn't remember if I turned the car off. And the worst thing I could not get used to was no memory seats that side back when you get out of the vehicle, and no remote start. Remote start is not available in any Audi. I traded it in after only 2 months, and  it lost $10,000 in value! I absolutely would have gone back to a new Lexus if I liked the grill on the last few years versions, if they change that it a few years, I will go back to Lexus.

It sat in the shop for 4 days while they replaced both headlight assemblies.  Then last week, with just 2500 miles on the car, the engine failed which landed me broken-down on the side of the road with my 90-year-old Grandpa on a short road trip.

I decided the Audi was a superior ride and overall a better price point equipped with the features I wanted. I custom ordered my Q5 and waited 4 months for delivery. My first week with the vehicle I had two problems, a popping/clicking sound behind the dash (they said was normal) and a metal/clicking sound when you release the brake pedal. 4 months later the brake pedal just got fixed (replaced brake booster assembly). Overall the ride and drive (especially on the freeway) and interior quiet are superior. The custom wrap-around warm weather package seats took some getting used to; I ordered as I found the standard seats too short. They make it difficult sliding in and out of the vehicle, and they're hard. And overall, the car doesn't fit me very well (I'm 5'11 and 190#). The interior quality of materials are cheap; I feel as if I'm in a Toyota or Suburu. Plasticy doors, thresholds, etc. Nothing compared to my former BMW.

The Audi seat doesn't adjust to a low enough position for my taste, and while it has way more than enough legroom and seat travel, my left shoulder and left arm have nowhere to go once the seat is positioned because the B-pillar is really awkward.

Operating the yacht handle shifter is weird too. I own a 2014 S5 with the 7 speed DSG and this Q5 7-speed is not the DSG, but it is extremely smooth and quiet and fun to shift the paddles. On the highway, seventh gear will get you good mileage, but it's worthless for accelerating. Sixth gear though, is perfect and dropping to 4th at 75 mph really wakes things up.

I have always had at least one model of BMW in my stable since 1969 and was ready to buy an X3. However, the Q5 was more to my liking due to a smoother ride ( hate stiff run flat tires) and superior performance from the 2 liter engine and technology that sets Audi apart from the competition. I also tested the Mercedes and Volvo and found them lacking compared to the Audi. First, the ride is firm but compliant and the point and shoot handling is magnificent. Secondly, the adaptive cruise control is on a par with the Subaru eyesight system and easy to use. Thirdly, the cabin is serenely quiet and beautifully appointed. I opted for the warm weather package which includes heated and ventilated sport seats which are very comfortable on long trips. Also the B&O sound system just blows away the others in sound quality. Apple Car Play is great and intuitive. The controls for all the technology takes a bit of getting used to but becomes intuitive after a while. Acceleration is excellent for an SUV and the WOW factor of the mapping display is addictive. For an old BMW enthusiast, I am extremely satisfied with my first Audi.

End 6/18 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Comfort Seats are “Discomfort Seats”," Had a loaner 2017 premium plus for 3 weeks waiting for an ordered 2017 A6 to arrived. Loved the A6 Prestige so much I ordered a 2018 Q5 for my wife as soon as the adaptive cruise and other packages were available. It was equipped with comfort seats and everything else except warm weather package because the 2017 comfort seats were comfortable and the 2017 sports were very hard, narrow and less comfortable. The initial release cars were not fully equipped and the dealer did not have but 1 or 2 demos to test, not were we told the 2018 Q5?seats were being redesigned. From what others now say, the vented warm weather sports seats of the 2018 were made more comfortable,  though the seat bottoms and back still are very narrow with stiff plastic at the edge of the bottom and narrow upper bolsters. We waited 3 months to receive car and drove on short trips around town for a month. Then, took 2 hour trip ( 4 hours round trip) with spouse.  Both of us could hardly walk when it was over, and it took a couple days to get back to normal. From that point on, every time we sat in the Q5, our backs and bottoms began to hurt so much we couldn’t drive it any longer. The 8-way seats do not provided enough adjustments to fine a sweet spot and we could not live with the narrow seat bottom with hard sides, the lacked lumbar support for the passenger/limited height adjustment for driver, and very little upper back support. Plus the rear of the seat bottom cupped our bottoms in such a way as to cause pressure on our lower back. The dealer offered to buy it back as a used car and we took about a $10k hit, which was a bit better than if I had trued to trade. In hindsight, we should not have rushed to buy the 2018 Q5 just because we liked my 2017 A6, though it was a very cool looking, well engineered and popular vehicle around here. I personally loved the Infotainment and vehicle technology systems because they were so easy to use and were controlled from the center console, not on a touch screen. Plus, I got 31+ mpg on the one trip using the adaptive cruise/lane keeping to control the car. Only after we had to go looking for a substitute did we learn that the 2018 Volvo XC60 Inscription which came out after we ordered the Q5 offers all that the Q5 offers with great comfort and just a bit less mileage. The Bottom Line: If comfort is something important, better test drive a Q5 with both kinds of seat configurations on a trip of at least an hour or so before buying. The comfort seats are anything but comfortable. They could bring on back troubles that never were anticipated.

While we agreee with what others have written about the new 2018 Q5, the initial quality issues that we've encountered around the steering wheel and driver side mirror are extremely disappointing.  While we pointed out both issues on initial delivery of the car, both have unfortunately become long drawn out issues with service and then corporate Audi got involved.  The driver mirror had some unexplained heavy caking on inside, sides and bottom (almost like paint primer) that service rushed to clean, which they only got about 1/3 off.  Then left us with the car, so that they could work on it again when we brought back to replace the steering wheel that had a 1"" slit in the leather wheel at delivery.  Now the LED 1/8"" strip on that side view mirror is popping out, along with moisture seeping in and service is saying it's not covered!  Would be interested in hearing from any other consumers with similar problem on the driver mirror and how you are resolving it, as replacing an entire side view mirror is quite expensive.",2

It was a 3 year lease.   The pro. Better cabin material,  technology was very advance, cabin noise is low during cruising, car handing was good, technology is not intuitive.The Bad.ABS activation at 24/25 MPH produce 2-3 clicks that driver can feel thru the gas pedal and can be heard by passenger.  Pre-sense is way too sensitive for NYC.  On numerous occasions,  while parallel parking.  The car breaks itself for no reason.  I was going less than 5 MPH with absolutely nothing behind or on the side.   This wouldn't be a problem if it can be permanently disabled but this requires going thru the 5-6 steps in the menu system to disable it every time the car starts.The RMP/throttle seems low when car is in reverse.   While releasing the break in reverse (without stepping on the gas) you can feel the car vibrate as it was going to cut out.  Obviously it doesn't cut out but surely it shouldn't vibrate.Honestly, I felt my switch over from the X3 to Q5 was a bad choice.   I end up paying more on a monthly basis thinking the 2018 Q5 was a step up.  In technology sense it was a step up, but my expectation of the basic car functions was missed.   Bottom line.  New isn't always better.  I think Audi rush the release for the major model change.",2

I was concerned about ""trading down"" to a 6-cylinder engine, having owned a MB ML55 AMG, far and away the best vehicle I'd ever owned.  The Q5 is definitely a match, stride-for-stride, much to my surprise.  My two first impressions in the vehicle were ""fit and finish"" in the interior and the sound system by Bang and Olafsen---they were my ""deciders.""  Now, after 4 years of Audi ownership, I'd again cite the fit and finish, the sound system, but would add the quiet ride, the confidence I have in the vehicle, and the support I have received from the dealership's service department.  Owning the Q5 has been a very positive experience.  On the negative side of the ledger has been, of course, the tremendous depreciation, which I suppose is common to all highline vehicles.  I experienced that with the Mercedes, and am so doing with the Q5, despite the excellent care it has received from both the dealership and me.  Whether I get another Audi or something else depends on the deal when I go looking----lots of badges are good, but this has been a good experience.

I've driven many different types of cars, trucks and SUVs in my lifetime (I'm in my fifties) and have never really owned a vehicle that I would say hit the ideal sweet spot or did just about everything.  But the Q5 does just that for me. Interior: beautifully laid out with comfortable seats for the long ride and leather surfaces where the leather looks new all the time with no cracks because Audi does not stretch the leather. Electronics take awhile to learn but are fairly intuitive. Exterior: very German, very nice lines, turns heads. Ride:  smooth and comfortable. Ignore all those reviews that talk about the suspension being overly stiff. I wouldn't even use the word ""stiff"" to describe it. Yes, it is firmer than a Lexus or a Buick but those cars are just too soft and feel like minivans to me. The Audi feels sportier and absorbs the bumps nicely but you are still connected to the road. Handling: steering is precise or sloppy and cornering is very good unlike other SUVs with some body roll when entering an interchange which is not unusual for the height of this car or class. I have not driven in the snow yet so cannot comment but rain was very good. Power: very responsive and great acceleration off the block and at passing speeds. More power than you would ever need. Can tow up to 4,400 pounds which is very good. Safety: Excellent ratings by the government and top safety pick by IIHS. The blind spot indicators on large mirrors are very helpful. Disappointments: the lumbar seating adjustment could be a bit firmer for me, but not too bad. Could have more storage for spare change (I use the ash try which is very small). The phone charging takes place in the glove compartment so your phone is not handy although it is connected through bluetooth. I know, safer that way but I like to be able to grab my phone when I need to.",5

Of course, when you're driving long distances (on highways) is when you want to listen to music!  There is also a hesitancy when trying to enter a highway from a stop or slow speed - you jam the gas pedal to the floor and the engine takes a couple seconds to respond.  Like it's saying to itself, ""I think he wants us to go now, so let's get going.""  Not good.  Once engaged by the transmission, the 2.0 has enough pickup, so it's not the engine.  It's the transmission engagement that is slow. Lastly, it used hi-test gas (91 octane or higher), which makes it more expensive to run, as it only gets around 15+mpg combined.    That all said, it is a very well built automobile in materials, construction, and detail.  Most certainly better quality automobile than ANY of the Asian imports.

It has been about a year now, and I have less than 9000 miles on it, but I have slowly become less fond of the vehicle. I have had a rattle in the driver's side door fixed once already, but it has come back. I have another rattle coming from the cargo space cover, that makes noise every time I go over a bump, such as speed bump or when pulling into driveways. There also seems to be another rattle coming from the seat belt mount on the driver side. The sun visors will not stay up when moved up to the windshield. Living in Florida, I use the visors daily, but the quickly fall about 2 inches when put them up, which Audi has told me is ""normal.""  I have owned Chevy, GMC, Mitsubishi, Kia and Jeep, and have never encountered a problem with the sun visors staying in place.     It also seems that Audi has gone out of its way to ensure that the base model ($42,000) has as few features as possible IE: radio and electronics. Radio presets can only be operated from the dashboard, not on the steering wheel, and no back-up camera, which is basically standard on all vehicles in this day and age.

This Audi does have all the upgrades including the 20 inch wheels and handles extremely well for a smallish 4500 pound SUV.  The acceleration of 6.5 seconds to 60 is amazing for a diesel that has ranged between 30 and 39 miles per gallon so far. I have noticed that the temperature conditions affect the mileage which must be a diesel thing but recently I got 39.5 MPG driving to Chicago on a 70 degree day going Northbound maybe I had a tail wind who knows.   In summary the handling, acceleration , and mileage are ABSOLUTELy splendid.  Certainly some of the 500 HP sport model SUV's are faster but who wants to own a vehicle that gets 15MPG average?I have not had one issue after four months and 9000 miles and  the car is extremely quiet under highway driving conditions.My only complaints are the short warranty period of 50000 miles accompanied by 2600 in ""regular maintanence""  costs  and the center console which impedes the movement of my right leg a bit. The lack of a few  electronic options is really nothing I can not live without like I need more distractions while I am whipping down the highway.  I will let you know if anything goes wrong I am hoping to actually be able to drive a German vehicle for 150K carefree miles which was impossible with a BMW. I can not imagine an Acura or Lexus handling anywhere near as well so if you like performance with economy the TDI is the wave of the future.",5

At first drove like charm.  Within 2 months, front grille peeled requiring replacement.  Three months later, needed another grille due to peeling.  After this repair visit noticed shuddering and bucking with acceleration on inclines.  Took car in and was told needed a new fuel injector.  The car had less than 15000 miles.  Injector replaced.  Took car from dealer and before I could get home, problem started again.  After exam was told was fuel related and should try different stations.  A month later, after trying every station in my city, problem still existed and took car back to dealer for closer look.  After several days of exam, car was diagnosed with severe carbon build up in engine.  A shame such a nice car has so many issues. I'm done with Audi.",3

The Audi is beautifully finished, and an extremely comfortable vehicle.   I have had minor issues with rattles and noises, including having to change the hinges on the rear passenger door.   In also long for some of the technology that I had in my 2009 Acura, like knowing the tire pressure in each tire.  I also find the blue-tooth entertainment system unfriendly to use, and the audio response quite poor.   Frequently, the numbers are wrong.  You can say ""six"" and end up with a seven in the number.  Handling is good, though the electronic steering takes some time to get used to.  I miss the tightness (& lower body roll ) of the Acura, but over time have gotten to where I really like my Audi.Last, for a 2015 model, the interface with your mobile phone is horrid.   The Hyundai Sonata  unfortunately has a better interface than the Audi.   If you are looking for a good, comfortable car, this one is for you.

The ride is sort of smooth but the tires don't seem to provide much in the way of comfort than you would expect. For the price point of this car, the stereo system is abysmal.

When I took it in to find out if there is anything  I was so much is told that it can't compare.   So I took it to an expert who told me it would cost me no less than 1500 to make it sound halfway decent.  The whole navigation system seems OK just a bit complicated.

She handles lovely around the windy road corners. Things I notice this time of year are: she's quick to defrost, the seat warmers are a godsend, she heats up nicely - gets toasty warm inside. Gas mileage is great. She's easy to park.

We had a huge snow storm here and I live at the bottom of a serious hill; downhill assist got me home safely. It kind of takes over the braking and all you have to do is steer.

Of course you should purchase ANY luxury/GERMAN vehicle with concerns regarding maintenance and price, because it will happen eventual on any make/model at any time.  Having said that, Audi's are by far the best value in class.  they are more sporty than their counterparts with a younger more sleek feeling.  The 2010 Q5 drive smooth and easy at low speeds, and is tight and responsive at high speeds.  the car feels as good to drive as it looks going down the road for thousands less than its competitors, or a new model for that matter.  buy one with a few miles for under 20K and you will have a good car for years to come, so long as you get the maintenance plan as well! very well put together, inside and out.",5

Sure my car had 91,000 miles on it and had Carfax Service records.  So far after owning it for only 6 months, it's already has had to have a complete front end re-done,  hoses replaced, they still can't figure out what's wrong with the steering that 'chatters' when you turn to the left that was $3,000 worth of work.  But what has happened now is that I was noticing the anti-freeze disappearing but no leaking.  The oil cap was milky which meant the antifreeze was leaking into the engine and you could watch it disappearing.  I had the car towed to the Audi mechanic.  The warranty I bought for $3,000 isn't worth the paper it's written on, they have loop holes in it so they don't have to fix it.  Basically the engine needs to be replaced.  According to the mechanic the engine is so difficult to disassemble and tons of man hours and dollars, it's easier to replace than taking it apart.  So now I have no car to drive.  I have over the years owned used cars from Mercedes to BMW's and have never had a problem with high miles.  This car is a joke.  My only resolve is to turn it back into the bank and then I will be stuck with the residual to pay for years.  Anyone have any ideas? Or heard of this kind of car tragedy? Update:  The dealership refuses to do anything about it.  The credit union can't do anything about it.  How can they in all consciousness sell you a car that is a lemon?UPDATE:The car ended up having $7k worth of work to get the thing running again.  It then started to over heat.  I had to turn the car back into my bank and I had to take a hit on my credit because of it.  I wasn't about to pay over $25k for a car that kept breaking down.  I called the Audi Corporate office, of course nothing they could or would do so Audi lovers beware, there are bad cars out there that will break you!  Other Audi owners of this model and make have made the same comments to me (I ask when I see one) no good engines in these cars.  I loved the look of it, the way it handled etc.  but their engines suck!  Thanks Audi for ruining my credit!!",1

I only had oneproblem with it and that was three weeks ago. The water pump went while I was driving. My husband came and had the suv towed on a flat bed to the dealer we bought it from. They told him they had no idea why the water pump went (not common on 3.2 engines). They told my husband to wait and fixed it right then and there.Now that is service. It is great on the road it hugs it. Great miles on the highway driving. I would buy another one in a heart beat. No regrets.,5

I do have some observations: my wife, who is 5' 2"" drove my car one time and really disliked the oversize side mirrors as they obscured her view; I am 6'1"" and haven't had that problem so maybe it's an issue only for smaller stature folks. If I could change one thing it still would be opting for all-season radials instead of the summer performance tires. Also, a minor beef: the rear view camera takes a few moments to initialize so I find I'm having to wait after hopping in and cranking the ignition before I can begin to back up.

I love that I can make and take phone calls, navigate through the onscreen menu, adjust climate, etc, without having to ""reach"" for any controls. Complaints?

The diesel power is very different to the 3.2 version. It comes as more of of a  surge, rather than the instant zippy power of a petrol motor, but when it surges, it just seems to keep producing more and more power! I chose this over the 3.2 because it is more economical and has even faster acceleration. (0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds.

Shifting smooth all the way up; sport mode is RESPONSIVE. Interior is beautiful. MMI and voice work, but there is a learning curve: reading instruction book helps!

I bought a Meteor Gray (great color) Premium Plus and added 19"" wheels and the B&O stereo. I'm looking forward to driving this vehicle for a long time. Test drive one of these and you'll see that Audi has it all over Mercedes, BMW & Lexus. ",4.875

I drive it most days and just love it. It's not too high, so I don't feel like I have to step up to get in to it.  It's so fun to drive, I'm getting in to work early because I can't wait to drive it.  I can't find anything about it I would change.  The mileage is great!  Where has this vehicle been all these years!  I'm sold! I'm quite sure I'll never drive anything else.",5

The Q5 was worth the wait! Get the S-line pkg. The 20 inch chrome wheels put the finishing touch on this black beauty.  This is a great looking SUV with the best handling, ride, and appearance of all the mid-size SUVs (BMW/Lexus etc). Try the Q5 if you're tired of seeing yourself at every traffic-light and/or parking space. My wife loves the way it handles and rides and the engine has enough power to satisfy her driving habits. I've owned other Audi's making us qualified for a $1K loyalty discount. It has a first class dynamic 505 watt sound system. The Q5's Quattro suspension system is like nothing you have ever driven.",5

My previous car was a 1997 Honda SUV that was handed down to me by my parents in 1997 when I was a teenager.    Interior: A+  Amazing.  Largest panoramic roof in its class.  Great finish compared to other luxury SUVs.   Audio: A+  The MMI interface allows you to control your Ipod on the MMI 6.5'' (I think) screen.  Very useful.   There are also 2 more speakers, 2 more than other luxury SUVs.  Performance:  Drives like a sports-sedan.  A+  Uniqueness:  Hardest car to get in North America (Forbers article).  Day-time running LED lights.  Design and style is different than other ""BOX"" SUVs.  Beats comparable SUVs like Lexus, X5, X3, Acuras, etc.",4.875

Performance transmission gear sends you off like a rocket, tight handling like a sports model and a great exterior make this price the deal of the year.  My family of 5 fits comfortably.  Not a lot of cargo room, hopefully future designs will take that into consideration.

Was shopping for several xovers and fell in love with this vehicle immediately. DO NOT test drive this beast, otherwise you will love it. Handles like a sedan and I haven't yet broken in, so I've only touched the surface of this Q5's potential.

Drove everything in the class, X3, VW Toureg, Nissan Murano, Toyota Highlander Mercedes etc and nothing at all comes even close to the level of refinement, exterior looks, interior (Audi sets the bench mark here). 270 Bhp, stunning LED daytime running lights, adequate usable space with the seats folded down. My wife absolutely loves it and made quick work of her first Costco run in the Q5 easily loading everything into the back with a smile on her face. (happy wife, happy life).

McCarthy ,2016 Audi Q5 SUV 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Big Bang for the Buck," While not inexpensive or as technologically advanced as some other offerings in this car-size segment, the 2016 Q5 is well worth the investment. The seating and access are very comfortable; the ride is sure-footed and quiet and provides feedback from the road. The experience encapsulates what German mean when they speak of ""Fahrtvergnügen"" (joy of driving = control + security + responsiveness). The cumbersome navigation system in this model and the lack of a full range of passive safety features detract from the overall score. I would have given it five stars otherwise. I bought the SUV as a certified pre-owned vehicle with 11k miles on it and a six-year warranty. Not bad. The gas mileage has been better than anticipated (22 around town, up to 29 on the highway doing about 75mph. Best car I have ever owned.",4

Great design inside and out, comfortable, quick, economical, reliable, stylish.  A small thing but please put a plate on the rear bumper underneath the hatch so it's not so easy to scratch.  Please catch up quick to technology; Japanese and American tech is better especially regarding the voice control.  Audi's is too frustrating to bother with.  I had better in a rented KIA 7 years ago.  Also, adaptive cruise control and surround cameras should be standard in this day and age.  One of the major reasons I leased was I knew there'd be better tech on future models.  I guess you could say I'm exclusively dating the Q5 but ain't going to get married !",4

232, on 12/26/16 16:58 PM (PST),Linda Nuckolls ,2016 Audi Q5 SUV 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),I left my Lexus for an Audi Q5," After 15 years with my beloved Lexus RX300, which I passed to my daughter, it was time for a new ride.  I obviously adored my Lexus, but the new RX is huge, and the NX was a good size but had nasty yellowish pleather interior, boring handling and that awful spindle grill.   Instead I chose the Audi Q5 in Cuvee silver with Chestnut interior.  Gorgeous! It's appearance makes my heart go pitter-pat, and it is SO much fun to drive.  My only complaint is the infotainment stuff.  Too granny sounding on the voice, and not intuitive enough overall.  But, I can forgive that part because I am in love with the classy looks, and the ride that is the perfect combination of buttery smooth and sporty/peppy.  So far, I'm proud to be an Audi Q5 owner.  I considered an X3 too, but the Audi is just so much better looking.UPDATE, 12/27/2017, 1.5 years of ownership:I still love the looks and ride of my Q5.  There are things I don't love, though.  The mirrors are too big and block my view a lot, and the sun visors don't extend and aren't long enough for me (I'm 5'3"").  Voice control 'granny' is pretty slow.  The bluetooth connection with my iphone is quite variable, and the voice with google maps only works about 50% of the time (the built in navigation I don't even use, I'd much rather use my phone apps).  The a/c is not as good as the one on my 15 year old Lexus).  My windshield wiper sometimes takes a random trip across the window.  The doors are very heavy and tend to close when I don't want them to if I'm entering or exiting the car in a parking spot that isn't level.   Stuff in the back cargo area consistently shifts around a lot more than it ever did in my RX, though I'm not sure why, and I really don't like that I can't close the back cargo door with an interior button.  These are all relatively minor drawbacks, though there are many.  However, I really do love the way the car rides and handles, and it's still one of the classiest looking SUVs on the road.6/2018 UPDATE: Still love my Audi except for the MMI (controls all infomation electronics), which is has gone dead twice in 1.5 years.",4

When the car was 2 days old the backup warning system failed and I backed into a mailbox   The dealer told me the system sensors needed a deep cleaning, which they did, but would not repair a small dent.  I complained to Audi, they said it is up to the dealer because that would be covered under the warranty.  The dealer said Audi refuses to pay for the damage.  During the next six months the GPS would freeze and the MMS system would simply not turn on at times.  I complained to the dealer again this times they told me there was an update to the software due to problems that Audi was having.  The dealer and Audi Still refused to take responsibility for a failed system.  This will be my last Audi not because the Q5 isn't a good car but because Audi does not back their vehicles like other companies I have dealt with in the past.It’s been over two years now and the car has been flawless.",4

In over 30 years of leasing vehicles I've NEVER leased the same vehicle twice as every one of them seemed to have some quirk or flaw that made me want to try something different.   However, in this case I ended up leasing the a newer version of the exact same Q5.  Why? because I test drove everything else out there and could not bear to part with the Q5.   Superb all around car and hands down the best engines on the road today.   After 36K miles on the 2014, zero flaws and the exterior and interior still look it came off the showroom.

The 2011 535i was a thoroughly competent vehicle.  It had an excellent engine.  Everything else was just vanilla.  It simply was not the type of car you looked forward to driving.  I bought a 2016 Q5 3.0T.  Its great to drive a true German car again.  The steering in this car allows you to feel the road.

It is heavier then the 2.0 and better in ice and snow. The 3.0 liter is very quick and really goes when you need it. It is quiet with windows up and the sun roof is huge with no vibration with Windows up. A first for me. Voice command could be better and that's my only complaint.

I have chosen the S-Line model, which has some of the nicest body lines that compliment the Black Optics over Ibis white color scheme. Equipped with the Tech package and 21"" wheels, the Q5 is pure enjoyment! The black leather interior is practical, functional and very comfortable. I do have the Sport Interior, which gives you the flat bottom steering wheel and firmer sport seats with thigh supports. The Bang and Olefsen stereo is a superb sounding, enriching pleasure every time I play it a little on the loud side. With a well laid out display, the MMI response could be more responsive, but it is not burdensome. Satisfaction and contentment are equally matched with adrenaline and excitement whenever you need the supercharged V6 engine to come to life. Excellent throttle response leads to spirited acceleration, seat planting torque and miles of smiles as you allow this performance SUV to stretch it's legs. Audi has put forth a nicely balanced, visually and sensory pleasing vehicle at a very affordable price. I highly recommend this drivetrain package over the 2.0T level, as you get a firmer suspension, larger brakes, dual outlet exhaust and a horsepower/torque range that will put enjoyment at your finger tips!",5

Gas mileage is ok for 4 cylinder turbo and large gas tank gives you great driving range.  Gas mileage should be much higher on highway.  I get 26/27 at best on highway. Radio sound is excellent and easy media interface but no USB port.  The Navigation system works well and it's great to be able to send your directions to the car from Google or my cell. Overall the Nav is easy and accurate to set.  Voice controls works as well as any of them but could use work.  The push button start works well and the best feature is the side mirror closure when the locks and alarm are set.  Works great and all automatic on closure and on open.  The Audi grille and overall look is special and there's plenty of room in the rear compartment.  I also like that you can roll the rear seats forward for more cargo room, very nice.

262, on 01/26/16 07:06 AM (PST),Bill ,2016 Audi Q5 Diesel TDI Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),Not so Great SUV!," We bought the 2016 3.0 TDI prestige package with all options and initial we are very happy with the choice we made.  Fuel economy is still very good and the handling is excellent.  The only minor inconveniences are that it lacks USB ports and the color navigation screen is not touch screen which makes it somewhat cumbersome.   This model year does not come with apple iPhone interface.   This technology is available in much less expensive American and Chinese made SUV's.   The steering wheel media/phone controls are very limited in their functions.  In order to lower the volume or change audio tracks you need to reach down to the knob that is located on the  center counsel making you have to momentarily remove your eyes from the road.  The location of the cruise control is also very bad.  Again you need to remove your eyes from the road in order to not confuse it with the turn signal switch which is located above the CC switch.   The VW Golf that I own has much better steering wheel media and CC equipment integration management.  Other then that it has a very confrontable ride for an SUV.  All in all compared to other USA brand SUVs in the same luxury category, the 2016 Audi Q5 falls short on the attention to details in the ergonomic/technology department.  In my opinion ""Made in Germany"" is not that good anymore.  Its paid for so I have to keep it for a while.",5
263, on 11/26/15 05:32 AM (PST),Q5 TDI driver ,2016 Audi Q5 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),Early impression of a 2016 Q5 TDI," I've become a big fan of diesels for their driving characteristics and efficiency.  The Q5 TDI does not disappoint.  This SUV is very quick with little turbo lag, which gives a lot of confidence pulling out into traffic and merging, whether from a stop or at highway speeds.  The engine is very refined.  For a family of 4 I felt the Q5 was the right size.  I also liked the 3L TDI over the 2L offerings in BMW and MB.  There is not much of a hit in mugs going with the 3L, since I have been getting around 30 mpg around town and mid 30s on the highway.  The seats are comfortable, although they could be softer.  The lumbar support is good.  The sound quality of the Bang and Olufsen sound system is very good.  The MMI infotainment system takes time to get the hang of, but is logical once you learn your way around.  Most selections are made using the center console, since there are not many buttons on the steering wheel.  I'm enjoying the panoramic roof more than I expected since it fills the interior with light and makes the car feel even roomier.  I have the 20 inch wheels and I'm pleased that this does not make the ride harsh.  This SUV has a firm ride and handles more like a sedan.  Even on a 6 hour drive I did not feel fatigued and felt confident driving in a torrential rainstorm.  Looking forward to seeing how it handles the snow, once I put the 17 inch blizzaks on.  So far, very satisfied with my purchase.",5

The owners before us were very meticulous, and they had very few issues, and we have now put 6,000 miles on it and still have had no problems. The review that complains about having to replace the brakes at 30k is driving in the city constantly, I can tell because they also had to have the carbon build-up cleaned. Carbon build-up is a fact of life for direct injected engines, but when the car is driven at highway speed, the combustion chamber gets hot enough to burn off the carbon. Also, take care of your car. Change the oil with VW 502 00 approved oil every 5,000 miles, and keep up on scheduled maintenance. ",4.625

Had to pay MSRP because the car is so popular right now - actually had to wait for almost 1 month to get the color I want.

The handling is great and the interior is far superior than the X3 or the GLK.  Love the LED lights and the huge side mirrors.

I'm glad to see others here also getting MORE gas mileage than Audi disclosed. I am getting 23/28 vs. the Audi claim of 18/23.  The better mileage + the larger fuel tank = less stops at the pump & a happy driver.  The Q5 handles and drives like a state- of-the-art German sports car.

Smooth, linear acceleration, balanced steering, and grips the road like a sports car.  Our favorite drives are over the twisty canyon roads.  MPG is around 17 so far (vs. avg. of 13 with the X3), which is better than expected considering almost 100% city driving.

My dealership finally took it in and called me initially to repair it for $1,800, which they said if I don't take care of will cost 8K worth of damage. They were not able to give me a cause for it and I told them to give me the quote and details and I will take it and fix it for cheaper elsewhere. Then they said they will contact Audi and call me back if anything can be done. After a few hours they called and said Audi would cover the entire cost and they repaired it within 24 hrs for no cost. I am happy they did that, but I am sure this has affected the value of my car and my fear of something else going wrong with it. I bought this car brand new thinking I will not have to deal will damages from low quality build and not including the regular maintenance I take it for, I have had to go to the dealership many more times for fixing recalls and other minor sensor issues.

I loved the car then and I still do today, despite Audi's diesel fiasco.Pros:1. This is a very comfortable car to sit in on the commute and long hauls. The front seats are great unless you want to pretend it's a sports car, in which case they lack a bit of lateral support. The Q5 does its suburban transport function perfectly well and the panoramic roof glass gives it an airy feeling.  Like all the Audis in my experience, the driver's sight lines are excellent.2. The fuel economy has gone from outstanding to somewhat higher than that.  In the same mixed driving pattern since purchase, I'm now averaging 31-33 mpg measured at the tank (the low end of that range in winter).  High 30s with pure highway driving.  For a 4400 pound truck with a 5000 pound towing capacity, that's supernatural. 3. About that towing capacity; I still haven't hauled any really heavy loads but the Q5 tows 1000 pounds of motorcycle plus trailer with barely any hit on fuel consumption.4. Driving dynamics are very good within limits.  Body roll is minimal for an SUV, the steering is reasonably quick and accurate without being nervous, braking effort is linear and absolute stopping power is good but not stellar.  Ride quality is quite good, striking an excellent balance of composed cornering without too stiff damping.  While I usually don't ask much of the engine and rarely spin it above 1800 rpm, when acceleration is called for at any speed that initial torque surge is amazing.5. The Q5 is good in winter, particularly since I put on Nokian Hakkapeliitta winter tires (probably not needed but they provide more braking performance in snow).  Excellent ground clearance, the wheel wells don't get packed up with snow and the traction control is effective without being intrusive.  It would be nice to have a locking center diff but the Quattro is perfectly fine for most snow conditions.  The defroster does a good job but it would help to have a windshield option as it does get packed up with snow and ice at the base and left side of the window.6. VWAG finally has a plan to deal with the 3.0 liter diesel scam and it looks good.  Last year I got a $500 debit card for any purchase and another $500 card to use exclusively at Audi dealerships.  Now they're on the verge of recall the car to implement the fix, which appears to be limited to ECU reprogramming.  We will have to see if this adversely affects performance or fuel economy with no third party reports yet, as far as I know.  One cause for optimism is that a friend of mine with a Golf Sportwagen TDI had no degradation of mileage or performance after recent fix of his 2.0 liter I-4.  Audi will also evidently give me something in the range of $7000 compensation with a smaller amount coming from Bosch.  That will have a significant impact in cost of ownership (and might put me in a new Porsche Cayman or Corvette Grand Sport when I trade in my other car next year!).Cons:1. The steering has poor on-center feel which is a bit irritating when I set out on highway driving although after a bit of time I stop noticing it.2. While the stopping power is adequate, the initial brake feel is spongy.  I much prefer brakes that have a strong initial bite and linear rise in stopping power, like those on my Audi S4. 3. The defroster is adequate but in very snowy conditions it would be nice to have a heated windshield base or heated washer fluid.4. I would prefer to have engine stop start switch in a more intuitive position.  The system itself is not bad; the engine restarts quickly and smoothly.  But I only want to use it when I anticipate a relatively long stop, like arriving at a traffic light that has just turned red.  So I am turning the system on and off multiple times in local driving but it's hard to find the switch without taking my eyes off the road.5. The interior trim on the driver's side door and left front of the dashboard reflects sunlight on the instruments and windshield under some circumstances.  It's an occasional minor irritation.  Overall, it's hard to find much to complain about with this car!",4

Seriously, I traded my 2002 Audi S8 which had massive engine failure at 118,000 miles for a new '14 TDI.  I commute from Tampa, FL to just beyond New Orleans, LA.  I was looking for the ability to tow a small trailer, get good mileage and like all wheel drive.  Seemed pretty good, but there was a huge catch.  Vibration.  There is something called vibration tolerance.   It seems the longer a human is subjected to vibrations, the more aggravating the particular vibrations (generally low in frequency) become.  Every trip I made (10 - 11 hours total trip time) I was feeling pretty bad upon completion, nauseous and jittery.  I've owned diesel cars before and have been a ship captain for many years.  I'm accustomed to diesels.  I've never had this issue before.  This is not something that could come as a surprise to engineers.  It is well known.  I got the impression that accountants were running the engineering.  It's called ""Value Engineering"".   After being fully prepared to follow Florida Lemon Law, Audi corporate made be a generous offer to trade for a 2015 Audi SQ5.  Most regrettably I accepted this offer.  You may be interested in my review of the 2015 Audi SQ5 when posted.  At present I'm engaged with the Lemon Law process but suffice it to say I'm more convinced at ever that Value Engineering is the single overriding ""Truth"" in their engineering.

Gas mileage is outstanding. Getting calculated 37MPG on a long trip is common. I'm averaging 32.2MPG in 18,000 miles of ownership. Traction is outstanding with quattro. OEM Michelin Latitude's are ok, not great, so I think traction could be further improved with better tires. Shifting is smooth in all gears, although the shift from 1 to 2 only after the idle stop was engaged is the slightest bit rough. Interior materials are first rate, layout is very intuitive. MMI is very good, nav takes a few minutes to start up on initial startup, I really like the LACK of a touch screen nav system. Everything is controlled through the selector wheel and buttons, Hands are closer to the wheel, no stretching for the nav screen and less eyes off the road. Cargo capacity is ok, but you know that buying this vehicle - if you need a Suburban, go buy a Suburban.Audi's tend to be a bit more sporty than the Mercedes, and on par with BMW. Consequently the ride is never harsh, but a bit firmer than you may be used to coming out of a Merc, or certainly a Lexus, which places a higher priority of comfort over better handling. Having said that, this is a heavy vehicle and center of gravity will be higher than any sedan you compare it to. Comparing this size SUV to any other comparably sized SUV, it's hard not to like everything it offers. Price is a reflection of the technology, materials, and performance you get, which is to say, it doesn't come cheap.Comfort, room, performance, fuel efficiency, quality of materials, and build quality, Compare it to anything you like, you won't find everything this vehicle - as a TDI - delivers anywhere else.",5

All that being said, I'll never buy another Audi based on this car.   The car 'lags' when trying to accelerate just a little from an already-slow speed (like turning at an intersection with pedestrians; or waiting for a break in oncoming cars while turning) leaving you in dangerous situations at times.  The electronics are WAY behind the curve: you have to take your eyes off the road and hand off the wheel for FAR too much.

I've been very careful during the break-in period, which happened during extreme cold temperatures and much snow and ice on the roads for a few weeks in February. The car would start flawlessly every time even at temperatures of -20 F in the mountains of Colorado. I've averaged 25.5 mpg in the city during cold weather and snowy roads. On a 180 mile round trip from Winter Park to Steamboat Springs, where you start at 8800 ft, go down to 7000, then up to almost 11,000 ft and then down to 6,800 ft I averaged 35 mpg with 5 people in the car, skis on the roof and a fully loaded trunk. From Boulder to Colorado Springs and back I averaged 41.5 MPG.Update: After owning this vehicle for two years I'm just hoping it is not too good to be true with the diesel scandal. I bought it because it had power and speed to spare while using very little fuel and polluting less than a gasoline car. That may still be true for CO2 emissions, but it is not true for NOx emissions, and that is very disappointing. I'm hoping the fix will not reduce my power or fuel economy. I've averaged almost 31 mpg over 25,000 miles, with no mechanical or electrical problems. My biggest complain is the Google Earth based GPS. The time to arrival algorithm is not very accurate, especially when driving in the mountains. It can be 30 minutes off on a two hour drive. In the city though, it is accurate enough.I bought snow tires to get one more season out of the all seasons it came with, but I still think the original tires will not last as long as expected. The Audi Q5 is excellent in the snow with these new snow tires. I did notice an appreciable difference in traction, but it does not corner as well as with the all seasons, as expected.Last year we drove the car from Colorado to California and from Colorado to the East Coast. It was such a pleasure we may do it again this year. The seats get a bit hard after 6 hours drive, so we bought a seat cushion for long trips after the first one and our bottoms thanked us.Update: The major change I've seen is my mileage has increased to an average of 31.6 of combined driving in the third year, from 30.8 the first year. I don't know if that's due to the engine loosening up and becoming fully burned in, or because the original tires are getting worn out. I have 34,000 miles and I have measured up to 40.5 MPG on one trip. Usually the computer is off by up to 1 mpg, so figure at least 38-39 mpg on the highway through 3 Colorado mountain passes.I hope Audi can fix the diesel cheating problem without affecting performance. I don't know of any other car that can perform similarly or better (range, MPG, AWD, ground clearance, acceleration, comfort, luxury, quality). Maybe next year the plug-in hybrid can come close or surpass it.Update (Mar 26, 2017): Audi may offer to buy back my 3.0 TDI Audi Q5 if they cannot solve the diesel problems by December 2017. I would take them up on the offer if I could find another vehicle that performed equally or better than what I have for a similar price. I don't think there is one, if I want similar range (600+ miles), acceleration (6.2 sec 0-60 mph), fuel efficiency (30.8 MPG combined, down a bit because of the use of snow tires), road clearance (7.9 in) , turning diameter (38.1 ft), and combination of length and cargo space on an AWD car.

Although I bought mine pre-owned at high highway miles, there is no doubt it still feels and runs like new. The interior fit and finish have held up well indicative of the attention of detail befitting a German luxury mobile. The cons are that because the standard suspension is fairly sporty and firm, rough roads may be felt more but its manageable.

The handling is superb, much more car like than truck like. The comfort is very good, the seats are much better than the Mercedes and it seems like there are more adjustment options.

Audi's First Gen R8 will be a history maker well into it's 3rd and 4th Generations.  Much has been said about the 1st Gen Tiptonic  Automatic Transmission but after 13,000+ miles I would buy this Supercar all over again. Absolutely no transmission problems with regular maintenance and care. It's the Best Daily Driver Sports Car on the market even 7 years later. I plan to own this car indefinitely as it will most surely be a sought after Investment Grade Classic Car in 20 years time.  This 1st Gen R8 will be known for putting Audi back into the luxury market of quality built cars.  The versatility of the vehicle on the track as well as touring to the local wineries makes this vehicle a very fun vehicle to own. Not to mention the looks and attention you get when driving it. The car is also easily adoptable to making the V8 into a howling muscle car or with many after market add-ons a show piece worthy of any high end car show. From a practicality view it most definitely blows the doors off any Lambo and is much less common than any Porsche. The corvettes of 2009 don't even compare to the drivability and road hugging capability of this unique car. Anyway you look at it the 1st Gen R8 will take your breath away and if not careful take you up to an easy 90mph before you see the rotating red lights of your local's finest coming up behind you.

The car is so confidence-inspiring that you want to go 10/10th's through every curve and turn. V-10 power might be welcomed but the car is very well- balanced and quick with the V-8. You do need to keep the revs up past 4000 to extract max power & fun. The seats are the best I've felt in an exotic, as comfortable as my A8L. Lots of comfort for two but not much space for things.

I spent a day driving a new A8 loaner with it and didn't like it. The S7 also does not have the Eco engine cutoff feature that the other A7 models have. I find that feature distracting. The S7 is very quick and while not as capable on snow as my old 8 it seems sure footed on wet streets. It did occasionally hydroplane on deeper water because of its wide tires but I changed the tires to a more wet friendly tread and haven't noticed that problem. The 7 has been a great car with only one problem so far. The air suspension was making a noise when the car was cold. But that was last year. We'll see if it picks up again this winter. It's a very impressive, well optioned car at the price point.  I keep trying to justify buying another M or an AMG and I'm always astounded at how much more expensive they are than Audis.

Some of my favorite features are the massaging seats (many variations of messaging available), 14 speaker - 630 watt Bose sound system, infotainment system (once you figure it out), options on ambient lighting, Google maps (the best!), Apple Car Play, USB connections (finally), clean exterior lines, gorgeous interior styling, acceleration (off the charts), and finally driving and handling ability!  If I had to give a gripe (and I have a couple), the gas mileage can be really bad if you're not careful and the noise level on highway speeds is higher than I would have liked (It's about the same as the others in it's segment, I'm just used to an SUV and it seemed quite because your higher off the road....I guess).  Keep up the good work Audi, you knocked this one out of the park!",5

In comparison no other car felt as athletic, well grounded, and luxurious all in the same package as the S6.  The S6 is awesome, by far the most enjoyable Audi i have ever drove or owned.  I am looking for reasons to take it out (grocery store, pick up fast food, run errands, etc).  The engine gives you massive hp and torque at low rpms, and the exhaust note is intoxicating, but is not overstated.  The S6 has plenty of room for both front and rear passengers, and has lots of tech upgrades such as bose audio system, apple car play, google based navigation, and tons of safety features.  With configurable settings for ride height, transmission, and suspension the car can go from stiff and sporty, to comfort and luxurious for longer drives.  I love this car!",5
442, on 05/04/18 20:34 PM (PDT),Justin T ,2013 Audi S6 Sedan Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (4.0L 8cyl Turbo 7AM),"Great car, horrendous repairs and maintenance"," I purchased this car with approximately 40,000 miles on it and by 60,000 it needed over $4,000 dollars in repairs. At 50,000 miles the ""check coolant"" message appeared every day until a visit to the dealer revealed that a new water pump was needed at around $2,000 with labor. Not 5,000 miles later the engine developed a high pitch squeal at idle. The remedy for that was a costly repair to the high pressure oil system.  Throughout the ownership of the car a clunking noise could be heard from the passenger footwell over every bump. This was never actually solved but was believed to be the front drive shaft and was replaced. Granted the dealership sympathized with me over the problems I was having and had Audi cover the cost. The adaptive cruise control went out of calibration several times and disabled the cruise until a $400 calibration was completed. Besides from the mechanical issues several interior rattles showed up in quick succession. Maintenance costs were as expected for oil changes but in order to perform the 75,000 mile service the entire front end would have had to be disassembled adding up to a $2,000 plus charge. All that aside the car itself was fantastic. The engine sounded rich and the acceleration was insane. The interior looked premium and the quilted seats were gorgeous. The exterior of the car had just the right blend of sport and luxury. All in all the dealer was exceptional and I would recommend the car if you don't mind the high maintenance and repair costs.",3

No denying that a V10 is truly addictive. Gas mileage in non-sport mode is quite good...around low 20's mpg.  The only issues I had have been electrical...automatic headlights didn't function correctly after a few months and had to be completely replaced (under warranty).

The nav, radio, satellite, bluetooth phone controls are easy to learn. It is as fast as my CTS-V was, but much more sophisticated. Don't see any S6s on the road, which is nice.

The car performs largely as advertised.  Accelleration is steady and very powerful, continues to build way past any speed at which I am comfortable to drive (and way past any highway speed limits). The dual clutch transmission is also smooth and fast, though driving with one takes a little getting used to, particularly when changing from reverse to drive or at low speeds. The sedan is also quite nimble for its size, and with the active suspension it has very little body roll. In particular, it is a pleasure to accelerate through and out of turns, let the torque vector push the car around the bends.  The interior is very quiet and comfortable, and the comfort seat package IMHO is great (I think ventilated seats are a must in a warm climate). My only gripe is that the touchpad system is terrible. Audi uses it for radio presets, and it will often mistake a touch for an attempt at setting a new preset, causing you to have to go back and re-input your intended stations. I just don't use it at all for anything but navigation entry (the handwriting recognition is good). The audio quality is solid (I didn't choose the top-level system, just the upgraded sound).  Fuel economy is about what you'd expect for a car of this type, and I average about 22mpg in mixed driving.

This issue goes away when you use the tiptronic shifter. I also find the lag gets minimized if you go easy on the gas pedal initially and then lay into it.

The Audi a6 allroad has timeless style, will go anywhere in the snow, ice or rain with extraordinary confidence.  This is a great car for wet and snowy weather. The allroad has a very smooth ride and great handling due to the air suspension and quattro (all wheel drive) and still has a sporty feel and good turbo acceleration.  The car has style and classic good looks. In addition to all of the aforementioned this car is very practical; it comfortably carries 4 adults and can be used to haul a variety of things from the garden store/nursery and hardware store.  Audis are luxury cars and generally maintenance is not cheap, if you can't afford to have the car serviced by an Audi dealer you probably should consider another option. Audi still produces A6 allroads, however they have not been imported to the US since 2005. The A4 allroad is a smaller car than the A6.

Luxurious, well equipped, safe, phenomenally practical in all weathers and great for those of us who ski, canoe, back pack,  etc.  I carry plant material in the back, and dimensional lumber on the roof rack.   I actually use the adjustable height suspension in snowy conditions, beach driving, and  unpaved back roads.  It works and adjusts on the fly.   But the best part is the engine:  great torque, great sound, and it gives the allroad very good acceleration and passing performance.  I had looked at  2.7l allroads in the early 2000s, and was put off by their lack of punch.  Bought Saab 9-5 Aeros instead.  Have owned Audis, BMWs, old Porsches before.  Car before this was hotrod Outback.   In terms of overall performance, this is the best.There are some drawbacks.  I bought this car 18 months ago, with 60,000 miles on it.  It now has nearly 80,000.  It is expensive to maintain.  I have had to replace large parts of the air suspension system and odd mechanical gremlins are present.   Navigation system and cabin electronics are historical artifacts.   Previous owners had broken or mislaid interior and exterior trim parts. Nevertheless, this car may become a hobby as well as a mode of transportation.   I already have more money in it than I could get out of it, but what could I replace it with?OCTOBER 2016 UPDATE: I stand by my previous conclusion, car is great for long days of high speed driving, etc., etc.   I must note, however that at 86,000 miles the engine self-destructed for no reason that Audi or my independent mechanic could figure out.  There seem to be no rebuilt ones available, and so my Audi dealer found a used 4.2 L engine and installed it in the car.  This  took over a month.  Audi dealer was very cooperative with loaner.

The suspension is a huge selling point giving you that capability but it was a hassle from day one with failures in the electronics and controls. There were numerous times where the check engine light would come on due to failed electric sensors. The V6, although a twin turbo unit, is underpowered for a car this heavy.

More oil leaks repaired, expensive hoses($180), windshield( normal wear), brakes, water pump, thermostat (caused overheating ).   Still like the cars capabilities, should be past most wear items for a while ( only paid 8% of original purchase price ).  Great performance after computer remapping ( 'chip'), definitely worth it.",4

It's a 2004 Allroad 2.7 V6 5-spd automatc.I was able to find the Audi dealer in Montreal who serviced the car and obtained all the service records from Audi. There was a 50$ service charge but well worth it. The previous owner's name was blacked out but all details were there indicating full professional service and verifying the mileage. After a few weeks I had to replace 2 front upper control arms and fix a transmission oil leak. After 18 months I decided to upgrade the air suspension.,4.75

While they did the right thing by discontinuing the All Road model they apparently still have many problems with the A6 (according to a 2010 worst rating survey) and God help you if you have an A8.My brother gave his to the Cash for Clunkers program.",3

It can be raised to SUV height which is great for driving around the city and off road.  It is as good as any vehicle in snow.  It is a genuine autobahn cruiser on the freeway.  The only limitation is hard off road.  It needs beefier tires and it would be dumb to beat up such a nice car with that kind of use.

Moved our daughter from Humboldt over the weekend driving 14 hours straight. The wagon swallowed a ton on accumulated stuff, handled the twists and turns of highway 101 like a sports car and was a very comfortable cruiser on Interstate 5. The engine had plenty of power for passing but I had to use the paddle shifters because in drive mode the transmission kept the higher gear too long which made for a jerky  ride when you were trying to shoot the gaps. The sport mode shifted sooner but I didn't want to pay the gas penalty.Overall it is a comfortable cruiser and 14 hours behind the wheel was not an issue. I highly recommend this car.",5

Space for cargo--although not as much as one would think--car-like handling and great style. Audi builds great looking cars. My issues are with maintenance and driving performance. MAINTENANCE: had to replace tires, rotors and brake pads at 20,000 miles. Have a mystery rattle that was never found so the premium Audi came in handy to drown it out. Great sound system. DRIVING CHARACTER: Coming from an Avante, the driving characteristics of the All Road are not as refined or sporty. Little more body roll in corners and some squirlyness on imperfect roads. I would advise not buying with the upgraded 19"" wheels as they render the car useless in snow or conditions where Quattro will be functionally useful. Look good but compromise ride quality. Ask the 8-speed dual-cutch transmission is clunky at low speeds. Finally, Audi decontented the cars packaging from the avant. Many of the handy cubbies and drawers were taken away in this iteration of their wagon class. Ironic, considering it's positioned as an activity vehicle. THE GOOD: The car does accelerate nicely when asked to and the fit and finish is really good. Cabin noise is very quiet. Looks great, alright the front end styling is a bit soft. Subjective. I'm stepping out of my All Road into the new Golf Soortwagon after looking at the BMW wagon--very pricey--the Volvo V60--no paddles on the R Design AWD--and stellar reviews on the Golf. It's good all around, sans AWD, and is a great value.",4

I went from 117F in Death Valley to 37F on Vail Pass, all in the same day.  The car had plenty of power cruising the straights of I-15.  I calculated my MPG during the trip, and it came out to 29mpg (rated 27mpg highway).  That's including climbing from sea level up to CO.  I have the Sport Package with the Sport Seats, and they were very comfy for my 1000mile trip.  There's all sorts of supports that you can change to make sure no single part of your body is aching from sitting in the same spot for too long.  I planned to break the trip up into two days, but I just love driving this thing too much, so I soldiered on through the night.  12noon to 5am.  Done and Done.  My only beef would be that while the xenon headlights are plenty bright, they might be aimed a little too low for me.  It was easy to overdrive them ;) ;) ;) There's plenty of brightness to project further ahead, but not sure if it would result in blinding oncoming traffic or not.  The MMI with Sirius is a godsend on a roadtrip.

Also needed power for climbing the mountains and good gas mileage for driving long distances without living in a gas station. This Allroad does it all with ease and style.

Its redline is 8250 rpm and it is a joy to drive with smoothly delivered power across the rpm range. Winter handling with winter tires is exceptional and the car is on rails in hard packed snow.

I am astonished with the car: plenty of power, enough eye candy and the best attribute: I can cause BMW drivers to go crazy with the power I have under the hood.

On acceleration the engine makes an excruciatingly high pitched whining nose with no corresponding feeling of acceleration. The steering is terribly numb requiring constant adjustments in corners.

I previously owned an '04 S4 that still brought smiles to my face after four years. The RS4, however, really is a very different beast. The engine has a very distinctive character. Not only is the sound phenomenal but it just simply has more oomph throughout the rpm range. This is especially true above 5000rpm  where the tach rushes to redline. Living in the northeast, the car has been wonderful in snow and ice. It is easy to drive even with the ""S"" mode activated (I had read where this made smooth driving difficult, but I disagree).

You'll be amazed at how nice the car feels driving on mildly winding roads at 30-50 mph, and you'll be equally as impressed with it's ability to easily handle the same at 75mph. Acceleration is actually scary during the first week. All the other aspects you expect (the exhaust sound, the ""sticky"" 4wd, the short throw, the seats, etc.) are exactly as you'll hope: perfect.

In addition to my own perception of excessive wind noise a passenger in the car recently commented that she thought that a window might be partially open.  I am surprised by the wind noise because several automotive journalists had commented that the allroad was a quiet car on the highway with little wind noise – like many car buyers I did a lot of online reading prior to pulling the trigger.  All of the door and window seals have been checked but the wind noise persists.  There was considerably less wind noise in my prior vehicle which was a mass market mid-sized sedan.,2

Good, not great, in snow with 4 new snow tires.  Ultimately poor ergo dynamics led us to sell the car at 8 months of ownership and 9500 miles.  Getting in and out of the car was difficult without hitting your head or shoulders.  Getting out of the car the back of legs would always hit the door sill trim which sticks out too much.  The gear shifter is different then standard automatics - easy enough to figure out but difficult if going from a different vehicle to this one.  Cupholders are in the worst possible location - under buttons.  Every time a cup is removed or placed in the holder a finger gets scraped.  The MMI (technology) buttons and knob are between the shifter and the cupholders.  One spill on the MMI controls and they are likely to get ruined and replacement costs are not covered by warranty (even the dealer warned us).  The radio volume control knob seems to be in a great place on the console but way too easy to hit with a bag - change the volume, turn off the volume.  The radio display - when a station is changed the display changes to the new station and then mysteriously shows the previous station (does not change the music) for about 10-15 seconds - why would it do that???

Drive select gives you two different flavor of driving, dynamic being stiffer, comfort being softer, and it was more than capable when traveling through mountains or highways. More space than you possibly imagine, huge cargo, very comfortable second row (don't look, sit on and you know what I am talking about). Length is the same with SUVs like Lexus RX 350, only with lower ride height, giving substantially better driving pleasure. Technology wise I don't know a car better than this except tesla, definitely better than current BMW (2017). Combination of advanced lane assist, adaptive cruise control and traffic jam assist almost make this car driveless, removing most of driving pressure, but still in practical level (you have the control instead of the car itself).

I personally would never own a BMW so in comparison I'd take the Q3 over any similar models in the same price range any day. It's a very sporty, cute little SUV that looks and feels really good (with a Sport mode that you can use if you want the car to feel especially sporty.)",4
791, on 07/18/18 21:03 PM (PDT),Paul M. Zahorosky ,2018 Audi Q3 SUV Premium 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),A P.O.S. in a shiny wrapper.," I drove a 2018 Audi Q3 for 10-days as a rental on vacation. The vehicle had 8K miles and appeared to be of decent initial quality. This, however, quickly diminished. For reference, I own a 2013 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited and felt throughout my entire time driving the Audi that it was far inferior to the Outback in almost every way. Virtually every ""convenience"" in the Audi was difficult to use. The sunroof button has 5 ""positions"", two of which did nothing and the remaining three did not consistently work. The buttons on the steering wheel are completely useless, hardly any of which control any of the media electronics. The instrument panel has the speedometer, cruise control or a few other options in at least two locations, but there is no indicator for headlights. The interior door locks don't work with the key removed. The keyfob unlock button wouldn't consistently unlock all doors, wouldn't unlock the rear hatch without using the actual trunk unlock button, and the car would relock shortly after unlocking making unlocking the car from a distance and then walking to the car without the keys frustrating as the doors would relock before reaching the car. The turning radius is horrible for a car so small. The braking system is extremely sensitive and while braking normally the vehicle would sporadically brake harder a few seconds into slowing the vehicle. The cockpit is a tight fit for me, being an extremely average 5'9"", 165lbs. The console is too wide, causing your leg to press against it while driving. Steering wheel and seat adjustment were impossible to get comfortable. The rear passenger space is quaint, not being able to fit two adults and one 12-year old or allowing any of them any legroom at all. The absolute worst experience with the Audi Q3 was driving from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles in 90+-degrees heat, slow- to stopped-traffic and a climate control malfunction rendering the air conditioning useless. The fan would audibly change settings but nothing came from any of the vents no matter how we tried to adjust settings. A few hours after reaching our destination, the climate control worked ""normally"". The only positive aspect of the Audi Q3 is that the engine does have decent ""power"" considering its small size, obviously from the turbocharger. But there is no way this car was getting 40-MPG that the trip computer was telling me. Overall, I feel the basic front-wheel-drive Audi Q3 is nowhere near the value of a similarly priced, fully-loaded all-wheel-drive Outback. A lot of the Audi felt cheap compared to the Subaru and I was extremely disappointed with the lack of quality as Audi is generally referred to as a high-quality, luxury brand. The Audi Q3 is an extremely overpriced piece of frustrating garbage. Not that I was considering purchasing a brand of vehicle other than Subaru, but if I were Audi would definitely NOT be an alternative brand I would look at.",3
792, on 06/20/18 17:05 PM (PDT),Jeffrey ,2018 Audi Q3 SUV Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great little CUV," I have been in the market for a CUV and the Q3 is the one that won my heart. I have a Quattro Premium Plus with Sport Package and Navigation. It was the perfect size for me as I do not have any children, nor do I haul rear passengers often (Q5 was too big). Although my previous car (2016 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited) had a ton of advanced safety features, I found them rather annoying, nor did I ever use the adaptive cruise control. I also had a 2013 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited. It was part of the oil consumption class action suit. Burned oil higher than normal and dealer tried to say it was normal. In regards to Subaru and interior quality, I've been in several other car brands and Subaru's is one of the worst. Also, don't get me started on the dreadful CVT, wind and road noise Subaru has. The only thing pleasant about Subaru was the AWD system. So, I chose Audi because I know they also have one of the best AWD systems too. The Q3 handles well, has a high quality interior, as well as a quiet and comfortable ride. Although, not everything is perfect, there are some compromises. Acceleration and gas mileage is okay. But those are things I can overlook. Otherwise, this is a decent little CUV. Look forward to many road trips with it.",5

Great performance and safety. Fun car to drive.  The one negative is there is no Homelink for garage door so have to use a clicker which is 30 year old technology.  That was disappointing. Didn't find that out until after I bought the car.  Audi needs to change that and be upfront it currently does not have it.,4

I wanted a small SUV this time with all the bells and whistles. The dealer had a loaded AWD that we drove. I was impressed with the way it handled and drove. Living in Florida, I figured a front wheel drive would be enough for us, so we ordered a FWD Premium Plus. After delivery and driving it several times, I felt like it was not like the car we drove at the dealer. It was sluggish and hesitated at stop lights and the shift points seemed off.  I made an appointment at around 2500 miles to have it checked out. No problems were found; the Audi tech said he wanted to explain something that we may not have known when we ordered the SUV. He said the AWD and FWD have different transmissions and the AWD is more spirited and reacts when stepping on the gas, whereas the FWD is more economy minded. A light went off in my head  that answered my nagging question. Now, I have a one year old Audi Q3 that I don't find fun to drive anymore. I'm waiting for the 2019 Q3 and Q4 models to come out, but in the mean time, Consumer Reports Magazine just put the new 2018 BMW X3 at the top of the list for compact SUV's. I plan to go test drive it soon.",3
797, on 02/03/18 13:36 PM (PST),Wendy ,2017 Audi Q3 SUV Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Highly recommended compact SUV," I’ve been a long-time Audi owner (A6, TT, A4) so it seemed pretty straight-forward to try out the Audi line when we were ready to replace our SUV. I had been eagerly awaiting the US release of the Q3 after researching it from afar. Before buying, I drove the Q7 and Q5 for comparison. Both beautiful cars, but we were looking for something compact. I give the Q3 5-stars in every category but acceleration, control logic, and road noise. The acceleration is fine, just a little less gutsy than some of the Audis I’ve fricen before. The control logic is great, except for the sound system control. They’ve moved it from the main center console to the center dash console. (Edit: after driving the vehicle for 8 months I no longer notice the difference) Road noise in an SUV is almost always going to be heard, add in winter tires on weathered roads and it’s pretty much impossible to keep it quiet. Not too bad, considering. Everything else has been exactly what I have come to expect from an Audi.",5

There is nothing like a Quattro Audi, I drive one myself as well and even if you don't get snow it's really nice the way it handles the road. The main thing about the Q3? It listens to the driver. Go try the x3 or the x1 or the lexus rx: they're great cars but they have a mind of their own. The other thing is that we got an amazing deal thanks to Edmunds forums. I found out the residuals and the money rate, I followed advice on how to shop and I got a really great deal. It's a premium plus with the sport plus trim, which makes it look even nicer than stock.

I have had nothing much tech/mechanical issues since the day I bought the car. Overall it is a very nice car. Its stylish, it's okay on pick up (but nothing like the Maxima) the interior styling is very nice and the trunk/folding down rear seats are why I mostly wanted to upgrade to an SUV. However, the minor down sides eventually became so irritating I traded it in for a BMW Gran Turismo. The windows constantly needed the ""pinch sensor"" reset. which means my windows would roll up and then immediately roll back down. This happened 4x. I would need to call and either talk through it with a tech over the phone or drop it off for reset. My BLUEtooth never worked properly. Heaven forbid I answer a call while my 3rd party player was streaming music.... after the call ended I would have to reset the bluetooth system and again maybe play 2 songs before it randomly disconnected. My AC stopped working 7 months into owning the car. ( that was the last straw) The car is very nice, but it didn't wow me. Even aside from the minor issues....the tech package is bland at best.

My 2016 Q3 has now 21,150 miles on it and has not missed a beat. Recently drove from Houston, Texas to Fair Haven, Vermont and back in ten days; it was a great experience from start to finish. The Q3 met every challenge along the way averaging 32.5 mph at posted speeds. Handled great, avoiding two possible truck encounters and a Northeaster that dumped 24 inches on us in Vermont.  The all wheel option did well in the snow as well as in the rain and ice.  Heated seats came in handy in 5 degree weather while the heated side mirrors made it easy to drive in the blowing snow conditions. A USB port would be nice but the Bluetooth option for Pandora and Audible made the trip a fun experience.  If you want a good value with multiple option plus good mileage, the Q3 is an SUV worth considering.Now a few more miles down the road and still enjoying my ride. On short coming is the lack of “gritty-up” to enter feeder lanes for our Texas highways; 50 more horse power would make a difference, then again Texas drivers love to go 80 in a 70 while staying on your bumper might have more to do with the sense you may be in somebody’s way creating that “need for speed”.

I surprised myself when I bought this since I wasn’t looking for a “luxury” SUV. However, I had shopped for over a year and drove virtually every other SUV in its’ class and was just not impressed with the drive and handling (or sound systems) of the Q3’s competitors. I love how this SUV handles on winding roads and love driving it so much I look for excuses to take it out! I’ve read several reviews suggesting the Q3 may have below average acceleration and power but have not found this to be the case at all, even with passengers in the car. To me it’s like driving a sports car with an awesome sound system. Some blogs suggest you can purchase a Sprint Booster module for even faster acceleration but I don’t feel I need it. There is no lag in acceleration when I hit the gas unlike other SUVs in its’ class that I have test driven. I’ve only needed to take in for service for the first oil change/checkup; its' basically been flawless since I bought it over a year ago.Update on 1/5/18. Over 2 years out and still loving my Q3. Perhaps the most important update I can give is that after all this time (closing in on 25K miles) I have had zero issues with my Q3. Hence, the quality of Audi's vehicles has held up in my case. I've also seen where Edmonds reviews lists sluggish performance and handling as negatives for the Q3. I can't speak for later models but I'm still very happy with the peppy acceleration on my Q3 and strongly disagree with the handling point. My Q3 is a dream to drive and handles extremely well on winding and downhill roads. This was a major selling point for me after driving many other SUVS. Breaking is also smooth and dependable. The infotainment system is admittedly dated (but has worked just fine) and gas mileage could be better (though has been slightly better than advertised in my case), however, these were not my highest priorities when purchasing my Q3. My advise is to test drive a Q3 if your looking to by a compact SUV and not go strictly by the reviews.",5
826, on 12/10/16 05:32 AM (PST),Linda H. ,2016 Audi Q3 SUV Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),"The best car I have owned, truly"," This is my first Audi, but I have had several VWs and they are the same ""family"".  I have owned it 6 months.  It is nimble, handles the road well and it accelerates well when I need it to.  I love back country roads with hills and corners and would call this a ""driver's car"".  If you enjoy driving, this is great for that and driving is not boring.  I already used the word nimble, but I emphasize this word here as it makes me smile and I often think ""I am one with the car"" when I drive this.  I drove in ice and snow with it for the first time earlier this week.  These were bad conditions and a 45 minute drive took me 2 1/2 hours and my Audi handled it like a champ, truly.  Other cars were spun off to the side and this vehicle stayed on track (of course I drive according to the conditions) and my car simply did it well.  As for complaints, I would say that being able to change songs on my MP3 or change stations on my radio ought to be on the steering wheel vs. the dash.  I also am waiting for my first oil change (soon) to have them do something to update my GPS maps as this car doesn't ""get"" newer construction and simply thinks I'm off-road at times.  But, aside from that, it is a joy to own and drive, so very quiet and I have to also say that not a week goes by without a stranger telling me it is ""so pretty"" and complimenting it.  Someone helped me out of a store with something heavy not long ago and stopped in their tracks and stated ""You have my dream car!"" and I did enjoy that.  Something is awfully fun about having people making a remark regularly about how nice the car is, I admit that.  I have never felt compelled to write a review before of any car I have owned, but I love this so much that I decided that I needed to share.  It is simply just a happy vehicle for me to own, I like happy!Updated, at Edmunds request at a few weeks less than one year of ownership:  I still love the car.  I'm still as happy as I was before.  It is a great vehicle and it is all the things I said previously.  I've not got about 18,000 miles on it.  People literally stop me in parking lots or gas stations to tell me what a pretty car it is, and I still love that.  I had an incident with the car where I avoided hitting a dog in the road (sadly it was running free) and hit a curb and destroyed a tire.  It needed a front end alignment after that.  Everything is fine, the vehicle handled an incident like that well and I was quickly able to adjust my driving and avoid hitting something.  It brakes well, handles well, does it all.As stated previously, my only less than perfect rating is the technology.  The radio is sluggish when you try to surf stations, not being able to change stations using the steering wheel is a negative on long rides.  The sound is good.  The GPS is ""old school"" and not a touch screen and it sometimes doesn't know where it is, forget trying the voice commands as it never gets what you say, even if it is said clearly.  An update of that would be $420 dollars at the dealership, so no thanks on that.  I have a previously purchased Garmin in the car and will use that for long trips at the same time as the navigation in this car as I now do not trust it.  One time I was in the car driving in Rhode Island and it literally placed my car out in the ocean rather than on the route.  That was truly bizarre.  Yet, 95% of the time it works just fine.  I need dependability for appointments and trips, so hence the need to have the Garmin on hand.",5

We use it both here in suburbia, and in our trips up the mountain to our home there.  For a 4-cylinder, performs well, with good acceleration and an extremely smooth ride.  The handling is amazing - like a sports car.  With the leather interior the cars smells so good!  :-)  The trunk is small-ish, so if you have kids maybe this is not the car for you - consider the Q5.  But it holds a LOT with the rear seats down if you have to haul something.  Minor quirk - I would have liked the adjustable steering column to have more adjustment down, as it sits a little high for me, even as a 6 foot driver.    Mileage:   On the highway, the indicator shows about 32 MPG - not bad.  But actual measurement is about 29 on the highway - surely a modern 4-cylinder can do better!",4

831, on 01/16/16 21:24 PM (PST),Brian M ,2016 Audi Q3 SUV Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Don't waste your money!," This 2016, Audi Q-3, Prestige Quattro, is a nice design. PROS: The colors are great both Inside (chestnut brown leather) and Out (cuvée silver metallic). The car holds the road firmly and has a good ride. The steering is crisp and the breaking is excellent.  Headlights are awesome when driving at night on unlit roadways.  Seats are fairly comfortable with the Sport Package that was included as an option.  However, not nearly as comfortable as the seats in an A-4.  Sight lines out of the car are great.CONS: the electronics (Nav, phone, Wi-Fi) are a little difficult to get used to, but can be handled with some practice. Heated seats take forever to warm up.  Rear view camera takes too long to turn off after shifting back to a forward gear.  The only engine available for this car, 2.0 L / 4 cylinder / TFSI, that produces 200 hp & 207 ft-lb torque, is minimally enough for the car. And that's with just me as the driver.  If I had 3 other adult passengers in the car with me, the engine would struggle even more to get the car moving. The 6 speed transmission seems to do a good job, but could certainly use more support from the engine.  And, driving the car in the ""S"" gear to get the engine more power, forget about it!  The gas mileage would be terrible for a 4 cylinder engine.I think the worst part is that this same 2.0 L engine with 6 speed transmission is used in several other Audi models. But, they have way more hp and engine torque and even get way better gas mileage.  Unfortunately, this car/crossover/ SUV paired with this weak engine does not live up to the standards set by this brand's other proven models.   Quite the let down!",3

Just the right hight to get in and out easily and still sit up a bit so you can see. The back seat is cozy, but easily handles two grandkids. Very quiet interior (compared to a Camry): all the technology requires re-education, but it works well.

I was very impressed with the ride versus my 2011 A3 TDI. So when I went back to pick up my wife's car, I decided to sit down with a salesperson to discuss the possibility of trading in my A3. The deals they were offering were excellent, and I just wasn't willing to wait to see how Audi was going to resolve the emission issue affecting the 2.0 TDI engines.So far, I'm extremely happy with my decision. The Q3 with Prestige and Sport Packages is a real step up from my 2011 A3 TDI. The ride is extremely comfortable and the cabin is incredibly quiet. Incidentally, on previous occasions, I also had the opportunity to drive the 2015 A3 Sedan for an extended period as a loaner car, and the Q3 feels a lot nicer to drive. The handling with the 19"" tires included with the Sport Package is really impressive. It doesn't handle like an SUV at all. The car accelerates very evenly and the transmission shifts very smoothly. The exterior and all of the interior finishes are just beautiful! The Bose Audio system included with the Prestige Package sounds great, and I love how seamlessly my iPhone connects (via Bluetooth) to play all of my audio files. My only disappointment is the relatively poor fuel economy for an SUV in this class. In fact, the fuel economy is essentially the same as my wife's Q5 which is significantly larger and heavier. It's especially painful because I was averaging nearly 42 miles/gallon with my A3 TDI. However, it's unclear whether or not these fuel economy figures would have been impacted by whatever solution Audi/Volkswagen comes up with to meet the emission requirements.For me, it's the perfect compromise of size, comfort, quality, and luxury. I also considered the BMW X1 and the Mercedes GLA, but these two alternatives were significantly more expensive when comparably equipped. The Q3 is really an excellent value and I'm looking forward to years of driving this exceptional vehicle.",5

Love the auto climate control and the cargo area is big enough for my bike which is why I wanted a crossover. It's fabulous and zippy on steep, curvy mountain roads. I'm averaging 24.5 mpg with combo city/highway (mostly city) driving. My only challenge is figuring out all the computer programs in the car and setting everything up to my preferences. The car manual has become my lifeline and I have to reference it often as it's a bit complex. The cruise control/radio/navigation/windshield wiper/etc. controls are pretty easy to access from the steering column but I find that I hit the wrong controls occasionally because everything is in one place. Huge learning curve with the car ( but then, my old car was a 2004 so I'm behind the times for car technology) but I have to say I'm very, very happy with it.",5

From my perspective its a great replacement.  Interior feels like an Audi - has space for my family of 4, but it cost less to insure, less to fill with gas, and cost a lot less than a new A-6.  My mother-in-law really likes the Q-3 because it is just the right height for  getting into and out of - the A-6 was too low and my wife's Land Rover Disco was too high.",4

I've added a little zip to the car with an EPL tune + pulley that gives it another 80-100 hp from stock. I'd advise anyone that likes an extra sporty ride with no downside to get this tune....Amazing!!  Back to the car. Love the drive. The quattro has an incredible feel of safety. Rides on rails for a luxury sports sedan. I don't have the air suspension so highway driving is a breeze but chippy roads can get a little rough, especially with 20 inch wheels. A6's have a touch more body roll than I thought they would have but it's not an S so it makes perfect sense. Interior is excellent. Seats are very comfortable. Heated seats work great but no cooled vented seats in my ride, which I really miss. Air con. is great though. Once you get used to MMI it's so easy to navigate. Speaking of navigate, the live google navigation is very nice to have at your fingertips. GAS Mileage you ask?...even with tune,  30mpg on highway at 65-70mph (26mpg on highway @ 85mph). City is around 20. Steering is a touch vague but extremely confidence inspiring. All in all the car is fantastic. I've owned an e39 M5, S55 AMG with tune (rocket), CTS-V, G35 and way way back an Integra GS-R (totally stock). I think for all around sporty driving and comfort for a family of 5, this one is my favorite of all. It obviously has more tech but the feel of safety and road holding is just amazing. It's just so easy to drive!    For pure driving fun the e39 was probably the cream of the crop. Although the A6 w tune is a good bit fast than the M.",5

NEVER go to an Audi Dealer, unless you have no other choice. In my case this is $85/hr for a very good after-market shop vs $155/hr at the dealer. I recently retired my 2000 A6 Bi-turbo with 424k miles. Anyone who says Audis don't stand up over time is talking rubbish. But at such mileage almost any luxury vehicle is going to nickel and dime you. Thus, my move to the 2012 A6 Prestige.The 2012 A6 is a differently beast entirely than the 2000 A6 it replaces. Longer wheel base, wider. The supercharged 3.0  feels distinctly different than the bi-turbo 2.7, and with a re-mapping of the ECU (APR), The engine makes 400hp vs the 310 it has in stock dress. An older driver, I've always been a 'car guy', though my priorities have changed somewhat. The 8-speed automatic features paddle shifters. The Sport mode significantly tightens up the acceleration curve. While a subjective 'anecdotal' opinion, my repair shop owner who has owned and driven some of the fastest cars out there (Lambos, Ferraris, Mercedes AMGs), says my car accelerates off the line in what feels to him like a 4.6 second 0-60. The supercharger pulley upgrades I'm planning will add another 100 hp, perhaps dropping the 0-60 time to 4.2 or 4.3. At a purchase price of  $17,400 it's clearly a bargain. Audi makes 3 levels of options, the highest being what they call 'Prestige'. My Prestige 3.0T has all but two options.

There were too many problems reported with 2.7T, so kept away from that. This 2.8 V6 can surely use more power, especially at low speeds. However, if you are little patient, the speed builds effortlessly from about 40-50 MPH. The ride quality is awesome. Little stiff for city driving, however the solid grip it has on the road makes for it. The car is built like a tank and you feel it at high speeds. The car gets more and more stable with higher speed. This is a huge difference in feeling after coming from cars like toyota camry and highlander.

This car is a great looking car and very fun to drive, but none of that matters when reliability is an issue. I can honestly say that unless I win the next mega lottery I am never buying another Audi.Now before you dismiss me as a hater I want you to know I really wanted to love this car. I like German engineered cars. I had a few BMWs before and liked those, and my wife had a 2000 Audi S4 for a couple years that was also a fun car, but had maintenance issues that should have warned us from buying another Audi. We had an extended aftermarket warranty on that car though, so I guess that helped us ""forget"" about the issues.Right from the get go the A6 was trouble. When accelerating from stop signs there was a drastic delay before the car would shift into gear and start moving - you would push the accelerator and nothing would happen for a couple beats and then it would suddenly take off. I finally learned that if I kept the car in sport mode that didn't happen. Sport mode is fun so I didn't mind too much, but my MPG suffered. After returning the car to the dealer I bought it from a couple time they still couldn't fix the problem and offered to put a new transmission in for $1,200. After agreeing to that I soon discovered that did nothing to fixed the problem!That set the tone for a trend that continued throughout ownership. Every four months or so an issue would pop up that required a trip to the local Audi dealer for repairs. I started to joke with people that a trip to the dealer was always followed with at least $500 in repairs.The icing of the cake though occurred last week when we brought the car in for a failed battery. At this point we have 123,000 miles on the odometer and we asked them to change the oil as well. Then we got a phone call from the dealer saying that the timing chain was stretched and the car sounded terrible. They would recommend we don't drive it but have it towed if we want a second opinion. The repair would cost $5,000!! And that was just to repair one of four chains in the engine. To repair all four the cost would be $8,000. That was just the repair of the timing chains and there was no guarantee that more damage wasn't caused to the engine when the timing chain broke.Now after reading some forums and talking to some repair shops I have learned that this is fairly common with Audis of this time period. Apparently Audi went to the timing chain versus timing belt set up starting in 2005 and the new chain system trends towards failure on a good percentage of the cars between 110,000 and 150,000 miles. Now some people may say that is is a common result of neglected maintenance. I can tell you I was current on all of my oil changes and service. I can't say what the history of the car was before I bought it, but this drastic problem with a ridiculous repair price tag is unacceptable. If you look up the value of my car, this repair costs more that the car is worth at this point.So although I typically don't write reviews, I felt obligated to share my experience in hope that I can save some other car buyer from the same fate. The dealer was useless and offered no assistance with this major repair even though THEY broke the car while it was in their shop. This is one of the big Audi dealers in the Twin Cities. In the end I sold the car for $2,500 as is, even though I still owed $7,500 on the loan so I got to pay off the remaining $5k for nothing. Do yourself a favor and buy BMW or Mercedes if you want a high end German brand, or go with Lexus.",3

The sticker shock is over quickly, but the fun remains. The car has a bigger feel than the 2002, but the handling is better. The navigation system is terrific if you take the time to learn it and keep at it.  But be careful not to get preoccupied with the nav system and forget about driving - it is easy to forget to keep your eyes on the road and not the screen.  Acceleration is much better than the previous 3.0 - ride is much stiffer now - great ""feel"" for the road, but the passengers will have to acclimate if they are accustomed to a soft ride.  Large trunk - smaller opening than the 2002. A great car that is fun to drive.",4.875

I decided on the A6 over the Benz E-350 and BMW 525i.  The interior is absolutely beautiful and comfortable.  When you're in the drivers seat, it feels like you're in a cockpit of an airplane, but still very comfortable.  The leg room in back is really comfortabe for any two adults, and can accomodate 3 children (as we have) fairly comfortable.  I love the new exterior styling for 2005, it has a much sportier look.

The 'lag' many speak of, lessens after 3000 miles or so on the car. Minus a few dashboard squeaks and one airbag issue at delivery, this car is flawless. Audi has always been a standout among other German brands in term of quality, interior design and never 'blends' in to the crowd of so many other boring vehicles.

I've had it for 10 months now, and already I've put 30,000 miles on it. It rides so smoothly. My only complaint is the DVD nav in that it's not accurate at times (it's rare). Telling me a gas station is a block away when there isn't one. When driving in ""D"" there's a little lag. But if you shift it to ""S"", no gap in acceleration. YOU ARE FLYING. Handling is superb.

Considering the price was $10k less than BMW/Mercedes and $5 less than the Infiniti, it was a no brainer.

Servotronic keeps steering input moderated and, if needed I can stop on a dime if a wayward Opel pulls into the left lane.  I wish all A6 owners had the opportunity to wring out the German engineering that went into this car on the autobahn.  They would be doubly impressed with their Audi.

The interior in the Audi is really laid out nice. Their information system is a lot easier to use than BMW. The MBZ E500 was $11,000 more money without the Nav, XM Sat Radio, etc...Not quite the head turner as my BMW, but worth every penny. Consider me extremely satisifed.",4.75

I took a ""loan"" of the A6 4.2 (they just give you the keys to borrow and tell you to come back when you're done) and I knew immediately I had to have that car.  The power under the hood and the handling was simply awesome.  It was more comfortable than anything else and features for the money beat all the competition.

I bought the Prestige trim  - 3.0T, driver assistance package, comfort seating package, and cold weather package - with florett silver metallic exterior and atlas beige (valcona) interior. I previously owned japanese cars  - toyota or honda - that were progressively higher end trim as I got older and had more disposable income, but they were never luxury cars. I personally subscribe to the belief that if you're going to buy a luxury car, wait until you truly can afford it then get the higher end, where you notice and can enjoy the engine performance, higher end tech, interior quality etc. I still love driving my A6 almost a year into owning it. In this case with the 3.0T Prestige plus options, it was close to $70k, no doubt a high cost, but again, I waited quite some time and took care of other financial priorities first.  In owning the A6 Prestige 3.0T plus options, I notice the drastic difference between my beautiful, powerful A6 and the less powerful, pedestrian quality materials on lesser A6 versions when I use a dealer loaner. BTW, there is an important warranty option - 10 years, 120,000 miles. At this cost, meaning the high relative cost of a fully decked out A6, compared with a few thousand more for this extensive warranty, I am surprised some choose not to buy this.

Bought just a few weeks ago.  I’ve had an Audi in the past and just had to come back.  Something about the way an Audi drives just works for me.  So far very happy with the ride.  Seats comfortable, teenagers are happy in back, wife loves the look of the car.  I drive the 3.0t, and it is a much more refined delivery of power than the 2.0t.  But I kept another 7k in my pocket with the plenty capable 2.0t.  Regarding engine note: no question a 4 banger is under the hood, but honestly it’s still a joy the drive.  Quick around town and a bullet on the highway. Corners great - mileage is a little under what’s on the sticker for city driving and accurate for highway.  I’m getting 18/30 rather than 22/31.  But I’m still having fun with the right peddle:). Hard to keep it under 90mph on the highway - just so smooth and quiet. I like my music, and the upgraded Bose sound system delivers - no complaints.

The back support makes for a comfortable long drive. The only very small inconvenience I've noticed is that the front arm rest is too close to the cup holder, making larger cups impossible to fit.

Ruled out the new 5 series for fear of 1st model year run reliability woes and the 6 cylinder E class is just too expensive.   Just loved the ride and handling of the A6, it's the right combination of sport and luxury. Plus this is the only German midsize you can order with REAR side airbags  and of course outstanding crash testing. The ride and handling are outstanding. Some formal car magazine reviews had stated the steering is  numb or light but I do not have that impression. The V6  gives you power whenever you want. I purchased a factory order Premium Plus with 19"" sport package and the layered walnut. The 19"" wheels ride well without added harshness and the 10 spoke wheels look stunning when paired with Florett Silver body color. The  black headliner with black leather and layered walnut wood option make the cabin exceptionally rich.  The MMI interface doesn't take that long to figure out. Voice commands are a little slow but the map with google earth view is pretty cool. The instrument cluster driver display can be customized to show different driver info and is nearly the equal of the newer cars that have the all digital display for the driver instrument panel. The Bose stereo is  good but not great (and wasn't going to cough up $4200 for the Bang and Olufsen upgrade). Driver's assistance package work very well especially the adaptive cruise control keeping distance from the car ahead of you and lane assist keeping you in the lane. Yes it's the oldest of the German luxury mid sized sedans in terms of this version, but it stacks up well to the competition. I love it and have NO regrets buying it.",5
1077, on 03/05/17 07:22 AM (PST),Mink70 ,2017 Audi A6 Sedan 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),"Comfortable, Quiet, Easy Handling, Fuel Efficient"," There is no perfect car, but this one comes pretty close, with mostly ""pluses"" and just a few ""cons."" The only options I did not order on the Prestige Package were a Bang and Olufsen stereo, the $3300 comfort seat upgrade and night vision (The Prestige comes with 12-way ventilated seats). I also stuck with the stock 18"" 245/45 all weather tires because of their higher profile. On the plus side are its stylish look in Florett Silver with Atlas Beige/Dark Walnut interior, great handling, extreme comfort, great temperature and direction controls, wonderful visibility, well-designed driver assistance, and great parking assist (easiest car I have ever parked beside the 2017 Q5). The virtual cockpit and heads up displays are easy to use, informative and very helpful. It's great having the Nav display directly in front of the driver. The transmission shifts smoothly, and for such a powerful car, it is surprisingly quiet  when accelerating, and there is virtually no wind noise when cruising, The ECO start/stop was a little hard to get used to (abrupt stop), but I really like the fuel savings it affords around town. Speaking of fuel economy, I have been getting between 30-36 mpg on trips and averaging 25 mpg combined. FANTASTIC! I think the secret is that I allow the adaptive cruise to pretty much control the car on a trip. On the ""con"" side, the info system does take time to figure out. I spent over 2 hours with Audi Connect getting the AT&T SD card and navigation system reprogrammed, I am still learning the system. I wish all the information on the retractable Nav screen could be turned off so the entire screen displayed the route. I wish connection to the internet was included in the price like GM proposes to do on its new models. The garage door HomeLink was a bear to set. The salesman spent over an hour at my home setting it up, but it has worked well since being programmed. Dash glare is another ""con."" I had ordered the brown interior and dash trim with the expectation that dash glare would be reduced. NOT! My 2011 Volvo S80 had a similar colored dash that gave off almost no dash glare. Instead of using a grained glare-reducing material over the entire dash, Audi used hard plastic around the heads up display and other selected places which, in combination, produces a lot of reflection on the windshield. It apparently failed to engineer the windshield angle to reduce glare on the type of dash materials it chose to use. I also join others in expressing a desire that the car have a little more storage space in the front passenger compartment, but I have learned to do more with less junk in the cabin of the car. It is only these later ""cons"" that kept me from giving the car 5 stars overall. Its looks, its performance, its comfort, fuel economy, etc. all call for 5 stars. Because of some convenience issues, however, I could only give it 4 overall. (PS: The price for this category of car was in line with its competitors, and I thought the dealer treated me fairly considering the additional warranties that were included in the out-the-door price. Therefore, the price rating should be read as an N/A. It was not a factor in my ratings.)",4

The car looked good, handled like a dream, acceleration was OK, and it had a 3 year bumper to bumper warranty. I forked over the $39K and proudly drove my car home. After a week, the dash light up with the check engine light. This was a light that I would become far more acquainted with over the 9 years that I owned the car. The first incident was an O2 sensor. ""No problem"" I thought, as the dealership assured me that they had a loaner car. Well the loaner turned out to be the mechanic's eight-year-old personal project car - with no radio. There was a gaping hole filled with wires where the radio should have been, but it got me to work for two days while my car was in the shop.  Over the 9 years that I owned this thing, six years without warranty, it cost me over $16K in REPAIRS (and I'm not counting oil changes and tires in this figure). That check engine light would come on, and the car would eat another $2-4K in repairs. I had the propellor (drive) shaft replaced twice, the airbag control computer once, brake jobs cost over $1000... it was ridiculous. And ALL of the work had to be done by an authorized Audi dealer. The dealer that I brought the car to also would fix one thing, and break something else. ""It was like that when you came in"" they would claim. Letters to Audi went unanswered and I got fed up with the whole ""Audi Experience."" When the car finally clocked 106,000 miles, I sold it in a private sale for $5K and gave the buyer a new set of snow tires, and was happy to see it go. Yes it drove beautifully when it was new, and Quattro is a fantastic all-wheel drive system, but the lack of support from Audi and their crappy dealers made me swear off another Audi.

Spent about equal time driving and being in the service station.   Vacuum leaks,  cam shaft seal leaks, valve cover leaks, axle leaks.  Just about every week, something new comes up to fix and the repair bills were about $4,000 per year.  Figured I better get rid of it before the turbos, engine, or transmission need replacing because those thing would cost me more than the car was valued at.  I did keep the car for about 16 years, but if I had to do it over again I wouldn't by an Audi (way overpriced), or if I did, I would sell it at about 60,000 miles.  They do not hold their value well.On a positive note, one of the best things about the Audi was after 16 years, there was no rust anywhere on the vehicle.  Audi did an excellent job with metal finishing and plastic protecting guards underneath the vehicle to limit corrosion on these New England salted roads.    In closing, my personal experience with the A6  is that it just keeps eating away at my wallet, my green alligator.   Never another Audi for me.",2

The car seats 5 comfortably pus it has a lot of cargo space.

Window switch ($110) 2x failed, 5 min DIY repair. Front end torsion squeaks (>$1000). Expensive oil changes ($80). Center display is getting dim. Most fun daily driver I have ever owned.  Unique body and interior of the 4.2l sets it far about the mundane 2.7Ts.  Great in the snow. Almost as fast as my 911.

The last three to four years I have sunk a ton of money into it. Every time I think I'm past the worst, something else happens. Most of it has been replacing the water pump, timing belt, etc. But there are things I have not repaired that should be, e.g. the instrument panel and AM radio. The information box is barely readable and requires a whole new instrument panel ($800+). AM radio went out years ago - estimate to repair was $2600! I was about to trade the car in the fall but it needed $1400 in work. Thought I would keep it a while longer, now the tranny goes bad (reverse  clutch) and the estimate is >$7k.

Just before the extended warranty ran out, I had the AM radio fixed (it had never worked).  When I picked up the car I found that the warranty company had paid about $1,000 for that repair alone.  Since then I've been spending about $1.5k - 3k every six months on repairs.  As noted in other reviews, CD player failed and LCD panel faded at about 80k. The cup holders are flawed.

At 70,000 miles I upgraded suspension with Eibach springs, Bilsein gas shocks, 17"" BBS wheels and Pirelli P-Zero Nero tires. Wish I had done that sooner. The handling has gone from floaty to tracking on rails. The turbo motor is smooth, fast and fun. I can take the care anywhere and it looks great, especailly now that it's lowered a bit.

I decided to open my mind and consider getting something different, for a change.  After reading the reviews, it appeared the A6 had surpassed all its competition, including the 5 series.  You know how test drives go... I didn't really get to push it and certainly couldn't appreciate what daily and practical use of the vehicle would entail.  You've read all the professional reviews which tend to ignore some of the annoyances you pick up on after owning the car for a while.  In this review, I will only focus on the negative aspects of this car (not  the positive).  In no particular order... * Bluetooth connectivity was sub-par (compared to our Lexus RX 350).  It takes far too long for  the vehicle to recognize your phone, which poses obvious problems.  If you are using the google maps app on your iPhone and it vocalizes guidance instructions over your car speakers, the  first part of the instructions are always cut off (not so on the much cheaper Lexus).  * iPhone integration is a joke.  In a 2015 model I received the connection to an iPhone 4!  When I asked where my iPhone 5 connector was, the dealership informed me I had to go to Apple to buy the adapter.  Are you kidding me, Audi?  If you connect your iPhone via Bluetooth, you can only select your songs on the Audi display SEQUENTIALLY.  So if you have 3000 songs, you literally have to scroll through each song to get to the one you want.  They give you an Audi app for media, but it was not reliable. Best thing to do is just to hard connect, but you have to turn off Bluetooth  audio, or it will fuss at you. * Navigation has a critical flaw.  Say you enter an address, it may prompt you to select (from about 5-7) a zip code.  If you are unsure, you pick one and if it's the wrong one, you are informed that address doesn't exist.  Why in the world would the option to select a zip code to a non-existent address be available, in the first place? There is also a feature to vocalize (input) the address.  The button to activate this feature never worked reliably.  * Computer processing power is sub-par.  You'd think Audi would just step it up a notch and put in a better processor to speed up execution of commands.  It takes forever for your system to initialize.  Say you want to turn on Satellite radio, it may take up to 10 seconds (from when you start the car)... not so on my Lexus. * Seating is not great for road trips.  I was spoiled with my last BMW because I had the comfort seats.  The A6 (2015 version) didn't have this option available (I heard they added it in 2016, but have not verified and don't know just how comfortable it is for long  hauls).  On a few trips to Austin and Dallas (from Houston), I found myself constantly shifting from side to side because the seating was just not comfortable.  My wife (5'4"" 112 lbs) had similar complaints.  * Steering still didn't feel as tight as my last BMW550 and, understandably (because the 550 was more powerful) the acceleration was not what I was accustomed to, either.  * Air recycle always turned off by itself.  It will not let you select the option to recycle and stay in this mode.  * No USB to add music to the Jukebox.  You can only do this using a CD, DVD, or memory card. * Transmission/gear issues.  During slow (parking lot) speeds the car would occasionally jerk forward as if a gear was slipping or something. I ignored it at first, but my passenger would always say ""Is there something wrong with your car"".  Long  story short, I had the car for two years (on a three year lease) and put about 10K miles on it.  I sold it and didn't mind paying for negative equity.  This experience, along with my poor experience with Audi Central of Houston, I will likely not purchase another Audi.",3
1192, on 12/18/16 23:39 PM (PST),Robert C ,2015 Audi A6 Sedan 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),"Excellence isn't cheap, but it's worth it"," As I filled out the survey and came to the ""value"" section, it was hard to settle on a good answer.  The A6 is an absolutely wonderful car, but it costs a lot too - especially if you opt for the V6 and some upgrades.  In the end, you do get what you pay for, so I settled on four stars, as the car is not a bargain by any means as was my 1999 A4 and 2007 A6 (both Quattro's and V6's).  Had I not owned the aforementioned vehicles, I would never have ponied up $55-60k for this or another upscale sedan.  But eight years with each previous Audi was enough to keep me coming back for more, even if I did vow to never again buy another one if the rate of inflation stays on course as it did between 2007 and this one.  Putting financial matters aside, let's talk about what makes it worth the price for me.   Aside from how solid the car feels inside and out, top to bottom, and aside from the top-notch technological features, I flat-out love the way this car performs in every mode of driving.  I run 50 miles per day on twisty backroads in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, and this car makes every mile a pleasant one.  Whether I am in the mood for some spirited driving or just relaxed cruising, the smoothness and grace with which this automobile takes these roads is little short of astonishing.   It is silly-quick, handles like a sports car, and in true Audi form does it smoothly as silk.   I do not advise anyone pay for the ""sport package"", as this one handles as well or better than did the 2007 A6 WITH a sport pkg.  Bottom line:  Even tho the car is quite attractive and had luxury appointments and technology aplenty, it still manages to give the driver a superb driving experience, which to me is priority #1.  My only complaint is that the German carmakers who had always prided themselves on providing drivers with the best road-feel on planet earth have all gone with the electronic steering which takes so much of that feel away from the driver.  I guess we have to chalk that one up to ""progress"".  Interior appointments, as all have stated, are excellent, and the superb paint and bodywork will probably outlast all the mechanical components.  If there was one nicety I would put in the must-have list, it would be the Bose stereo system.  An automobile this good does not deserve to have lousy audio.  If you want a sedan that pampers you while also understanding you actively appreciate an excellent driving experience, look no further.  It may not be cheap, but you absolutely do get what you pay for.",5

I opted to go with the 2.0 over the 3.0 and I don't regret that decision in the least.  As the other reviews state, it gives you more than enough power.  It doesn't have the same ""sound"" of the 3.0, but trust me, the zip is there.  Plus, the gas mileage is much better.  The interior has a few quirks, but the materials are top notch.  One thing to note - the breaks squeak in cold weather.  Audi is aware of the problem and has no fix for it.  By cold weather, I mean below 20 degrees.  For a luxury car, I find this rather annoying.",4

It was my daily driver for 2 1/2 years and my 35 minute commute (mostly curvy country back roads) was comfortable and the diesel had plenty of ""umph"" for passing.  It has shift paddles but I never use them as the tranny seems to work fine and I still am not ""in tune"" with the characteristics of the diesel so I let the tranny do the shifting.  I have taken it on three long road trips, each about 600 miles each way, and it is fantastic.  Over 40 mpg at 70 mph with a nice stereo, awesomely comfortable seats, and an efficient cruise control (as an older base car it doesn't have adaptive cruise control).  GPS is great and has voice control that works fine.  We got the prestige with most of the bells and whistles (how did we live without heads up display??)  The diesel-gate hit the fan a few months after we bought it but it never bothered me.  We just had the fix done about a month ago and it seems to drive the same but mpg seems reduced a few percent.  We already received our Audi settlement payment but not the Bosch one yet.   Anyway, six months ago we sold my wife's SUF and bought a truck to pull a trailer so I've been driving the F150 and she's driving the Audi.  I only drive it occasionally and today was such a day; I'm re-impressed with this car every time I drive it.  I can't imagine that aside from size (and this has plenty of rear-seat and trunk room) an A8 can be any better.  Thoughtful touches like the grocery bag hooks in the trunk are great.  The interior (we got the open pore wood with a light tan leather) is still attractive and it is my first car with cooled seats, which are great in the summer (and for my hot-flashing wife!!).  Anyway, can't say enough about it.  Rockville Audi has been great (we had a BMW but the service at the local dealer was horrible).  Last thing; I have managed to find what for me is the most perfect seating position in any car I've owned.  I have a relatively short body compared to legs/arms but it is fully adjustable and the seat bottom tips back a bit to keep the thighs supported.  Love it!  We normally turn over cars about every three years but have decided to keep this for another three.",5
1196, on 05/30/17 06:55 AM (PDT),Walter ,2013 Audi A6 Sedan 2.0T Premium Plus 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Overall excellence," Purchased car two years old with 19,000 miles. Two years and 26,000 miles later, I have yet to experience any mechanical failing. It drives great, its MMI system is intuitive and easy to use once you spend a bit of time with it, the car handles and drives exceedingly well, especially for long trips. Very comfortable, with only getting in and out a slight challenge for older folks as it sits low. Some have complained that the 2.0 turbo with CVT lags in performance. I've found it adequate in drive mode with regular gas, giving an excellent 31 MPG on the highway and about 26-27 around town. When rapid acceleration is required, a flick into the Sport mode provides plenty of acceleration. It really is like having two separate engines as it changes the shift points. You'll lose a couple miles per gallon though.In sum, the design, exterior and interior quality, and ride and handling are all very good. The criticism would be the braking, which although decent isn't quite up to the ride and handling of the rest of the car.  I've changed the oil 3 times at 8-10K miles, and haven't yet been down a full half quart. Audi service, though I've only needed standard maintenance to this point, though very good is not cheap. When I had to have the 4 plugs changed and the automatic transmission flushed and changed, the price quoted was--are you ready?--over $700! I took it to a good shop and got it done for $400. Hope this helps.",5

I bought this vehicle used with 33k miles on it from and audi dealership in peoria az in May of 2016. with in a week of owning it it was in the shop for the o2 sensor. Normal and under warranty so I didn't pay attention. Took it back in on October because i had had to put 2 quarts of oil through. Had an oil consumption study test done. Audi says oil consumption of 1qt every 1.5k miles is normal and not a problem. Fast forward to Apr 2017, CEL came back on, took to dealership and the same o2 sensor was bad again. they couldn't fix it then due to recall filling up their garage. One week later while driving i hit the breaks hard and the car warning lights came on saying that it was out of oil. had to put 1 quart of oil in it right away and took back to dealership. They said it was 1.5 quarts low meaning that my car was 2.5 quarts low without any oil level warnings going off. This car has no dipstick and the oil is electronically monitored. Raised hell about oil consumption and they finally dig a diagnostic. My oil sensor was dead. They replaced it. May 2017 driving to work lost power and the car was stuttering. Took the car to another dealership in scottsdale. 4th cylinder ring failure, only able to hold compression of 35psi, replacing the engine. 48k miles and 2 months out of factory warranty. Audi won't do anything about it...looks bad for them. I bought my wife a q5 from the same dealership after i bought my a6. We traded in her q5 for a lexus nx200t as soon as we started having problems with the a6. So i have a car that bought with 33k miles on it and put 15k highway miles on it commuting in 1 year and the engine is blown and needs to be replaced. Pass on this vehicle. in fact run away.",2

It has the B&O system and the 20"" sports pkg; these 2 options being a must for me. I'm a previous owner of a 2010 Audi S5. I love the utility of the A6, the 4 doors and folding seats. It's surprisingly quick in acceleration for a 4k lb sedan. Yet, it is also surprisingly agile for it's heft, and it's handling is commendable. It feels planted and sure-footed, and I'm definitely a spirited driver. I push my cars whenever I get the chance, driving them to their designed limits! Braking is linear and confidence-inspiring; and the braking prowess of any vehicle is a top priority to me. The looks of the A6 are timeless. The interior is beautiful, with high quality materials. The seats are very comfortable, even for long-term driving. I know, because I'm a Chiropractor. The B&O system is wonderful. I'm an audiophile and love great sounding music. The one complaint about the B&O system is that it should have a drivers' focus option, like the S5. Overall, the best car I've owned. I plan to keep this car for at least 10 years.

Drove a 2011 Infinit M37 sport and 2010 BMW 535i sport the same day. The Infiniti disappointed with the driving experience (too soft and slow power delivery), and BMW was way behind in the gadgets (though the handling and power were great).

I had a poor impression of Audi in the past. When I drove the first one I was surprised how fast I found myself driving without even noticing, no noise, no fuss, just effortless acceleration. (previous car had 370 hp). Audi is a car you discover slowly. And the more you drive it, the more you enjoy it. I would start with complaints first: at this level, the car is missing some basic equipment found on much cheaper vehicles: rear cross traffic alert, Apple/Android Car Play. I think the windshield chips a bit too easy and so is the paint. The Bose sound system is good but not outstanding. My previous Genesis had a better sound(Lexicon). The electronics are somewhat fussy and distracting. But when it comes to driving pleasure and performance, this car is outstanding, it moves so fast with such ease, it's quiet, planted on the road like it is on rails. It has an intrinsic elegance and a remarkable presence.Update: almost a year later, I keep enjoying this car more and more. Long trips are a breeze. Passing other vehicles or merging on highway is super easy and fun. No malfunction. Bose sounds better after some adjustments. Audi added another year of free internet access. Comfort and quietness are excellent. Complaints: the screen that comes out of the dash is a gimmick, I worry the mechanism will brake in the future. Also the kill engine at stops is very annoying, this is what one of my first cars used to do, only it won't start when pressing the gas pedal. Brings back stressful memories :-).",5

First is the extremely annoying stop-start of the engine each time you stop the car for a traffic light, stop sign, heavy traffic, etc. You can turn off the feature if you remember to do so each time you get into the car, but you will often forget. Even with the feature turned off you can ""feel"" the engine thinking of turning off. I absolutely hate this feature and will not buy another vehicle with it. The second issue relates to the very low feature of the tires. There are only a few inches between the road and rim. I've had two blow outs because of the narrow space between road and rim. One blowout was from hitting a curb and another from a pot hole. Both situations would not have happened with regular height tires. At about $300 a replacement, this is a very expensive problem.",3

I fell in love with the aesthetics, but the performance and well-appointed interior sold me. It was definitely a superior vehicle hands down, albeit pricier, worth every penny. My initial criticism was that the interior plastic components are relatively delicate therefore I wouldn't recommend it for families with young children's wandering hands. After nearly 2 years of ownership my only criticism would be that the transmission can be not as smooth as one would wish at times. Make no mistake, this unassuming sedan is a rocket, particular in dynamic mode. It coners well even for being slightly nose heavy. Lastly, it's not so fuel thirsty despite its 333 hp supercharged V6.",5

First, the engine is very loud, even when you close the windows you can still hear the engine, comparing it to my wife's MB E350, huge difference. The ride is rough, even on the most comfortable setting, especially if you sit in the backseat. Everytime we go out as a family, the kids would run to my wife's car. I am really disappointed at the infotainement system. Search and scrolling through the setting is so antique, I wish they can learn from Tesla or Volve how to make the infotainment system user friendly: easy to use and attractive.

I loved my other two and actually went to a new dealership for the third and had a wonderfully helpful sales person. The third one is the best looking of my three and I was so ready to love it. I hate it. Literally, the worst car I have had since my first BMW 7 series. I bought the prestige model with all the technology packages including the heads up display and driver assist. Truly, almost nothing works right. I can't input addresses into the GPS, the brake assist never works, it rattles like the frame is not welded onto the frame, the phone system and voice activation never gets names rights and I constantly loose calls that I am able to keep when driving the same route in my wife's Mercedes. I have been on the phone with 'Audi Experience' no less than 20 times. I have been through endless fights with service where I can demonstrate what is not working, take screen shots and they admit they cannot fix it. The regional service rep was going to call his software guy in Germany except the guy was on vacation. I think I will need to look into 'lemon law' protection as this is intolerable. Going back to Mercedes or BMW. They are totally clueless. I went from being a loyal Audi fan to hating every day in the car. Buyer beware!",1

It's the right size, looks terrific, a comfortable cruiser and the materials inside and out are top notch.  It's really too early to comment about things like reliability, maintenance costs etc., but both my wife (the primary driver) and I feel good about the purchase.  The A6 replaces a Q5 which was our first Audi and the ownership experience was stellar.After 6 months we're still enjoying the A6.  No issues at all.  A very solid car.  The ride might be a little firm for some, as ours has the sport suspension, but I enjoy the sharp steering and handling that comes with it.  One niggle is the placement of the HVAC controls.  They sit very low on the center stack and are difficult to see and adjust while driving.  Something used so frequently should be in a better location.  One option is to set the system to AUTO and forget about it - But at times things need to be tweaked.  Overall, a great car and deserving of the praise that's it's received.After 1 year we're still enjoying the A6.  No issues at all as well as not creaks or rattles.  We've taken two long road trips and got 30+ mpg's depending to the speed, terrain etc.  It's a keeper.In June my 2016 A6 passed the 2 year mark.  The car continues to impress.  We've had zero issues with it with just routine service needed.  The car doesn't have any creaks or rattles and still feels very solid.  With the sport suspension and the ride being on the firm side I keep the tire pressures at the minimum recommended and it is a good balance between ride and handling.  Overall a great car and a positive ownership experience.   I'll take a look at the new gen 2019 when it comes out, although there are a couple of other cars on my radar as possible replacements.",5

You would never know it is a mid sized car. I have a BMW Z and it is second fiddle to this car. Acceleration is quick and gas mileage is in low thirties driving 70 mph. What's not to like. Plenty of leg room in both front and back with a pretty good size trunk. The led headlamps are amazing. I have two other cars with HID, but no comparison. The car is just fun to drive and the driver assistance with lane tracking works great. It does tell you to put your hands on the steering wheel after about 15 seconds, but I just like checking it out. Before I purchased, I tried the E300 and the 535xi. The E300 was old fashioned, the acceleration was subpar and it did not feel as sharp in the handling. My wife was leaning towards the BMW 535XI until we drove the 3.0 A6. Then we drove them again and it was no contest. The BMW handling was nowhere as good as this A6. Loving it.",5

I've admired the Audi's for a few years, so once I retired and not now tied to a major customer auto brand, I traded my Lexus LS for the A6. I was impressed with the style, handling, driving dynamics, quality of manufacturing, interior materials, fit and finish, fuel economy, and layout. After 10,000 miles, I'm still as pleased as with day 1. This car is a pleasure to drive, has a conservative style, lots of power from the 3.0, quiet and fun to drive. You must get used to watching your speed. You can find yourself approaching triple digits on the highway without realizing it. At first, I hated the pop-up info display, but have warmed up to it nicely. Once your all set with climate control, music, etc., you can allow it to disappear, and the looks of the dash is so streamlined compared to the huge screens on most other luxury vehicles. Good sized rear seating, and trunk for a car of this size. Really like the Google Maps on the huge screen. Really slick to,see Google Earth exactly where you are driving, the buildings, landmarks, and interesting things just beyond your street view as you drive down a highway.

Even after the first year and half, the car has all of the  exuberance of new car ownership.  All that has changed is that I ""know"" it and its capabilities and amenities better and driving out the driveway each morning is perhaps a little less thrilling and is now more of a long time, settled-in, best friend car-owner relationship.  I have only one issue, and that is at times the Audi connect service (which enables you to go into many of the internet options, including navigation points entered from your home computer) sometimes requires me to re-enter my PIN and is every now and then slower than I would like (but these are minor and few and far between occurrences.)  The only other thing that I have learned from time is that the front under-bumper spoiler IS LOW, and you have to be very careful about parking up against concrete parking stops.  I had a major run-in with one, and it caused enough under bumper damage for me to take it to the body shop for (a not in-expensive) repair/replace.  (This is user error, but users be aware.)  The car sails on smoothly, responsively and with the same youthful eagerness that it did when I first drove it off the dealer's lot.  I will most likely be keeping this 2016 A6 for several years, and my next car will be another Audi, probably an A6, with autonomous (self-driving) capabilities!

I had NO IDEA of the stats for cars equipped with Diesel Engines. i.e. I didn't know they have a higher value, higher (MUCH) higher gas mileage.I enjoyed my '14 A6 - THAT MUCH, that I just went and traded that in for a new '16. (Faster MMI/Console MUCH better resolution on the screen - that ""techie"" list goes on and on, though I have to admit, it's the ""techie"" stuff that sells me.)One final note: (Added 7/20/16) I know the Audi A6 3.0 liter Diesel is one of ""those."" (VW Diesel Engine Scam?) Not only do I _REALLY_ not place much concern on that issue, but Audi is making GOOD on the deal. I've already received ""some"" compensation (without EVEN asking for it) and according to the news/media there's more, a LOT more, coming BACK into my wallet. So after reading that last note, you can certainly see that Audi is a company that is ""making good"" on THIS customer's experience.  Heck, and the car is even MORE 'techie' than my '14. Once you experience the safety Audi is building into these models using technology, you'll NEVER go back. It IS ""The Audi"" in my opinion that has the ""most"" bang for the buck when it comes to the built-in safety features of that car using technology. (Quick Example: Looking at the camera views when backing up, there is a portion of the screen that it APPEARS to be a camera that's sitting ~ 20 feet above the car so you can see ALL around the vehicle.) The ""Adaptive Cruise"" that will STOP YOU if you get too close to the car in front of you or the vehicle in front makes a sudden stop - your brakes WILL be applied and you will NOT hit the car in front of you. I assure you - there are 10's of other (safety) reasons Audi has built into this unit just not enough room here in this forum to share them all with you. There are just SO many other technical features built-into that vehicle and my writing I know cannot possibly do it enough justice. Bottom Line: I've owned MANY, practically a new one EACH year since '09 of higher value vehicles all 3 manufacturers come from Germany. Bar-None! If Audi keeps up doing what it's doing, I will have NOTHING but new Audis in my future purchasing plans for the next xx years.

I'm 6'5"", and most other cars don't fit me well. This car is comfortable, roomy, and has a nice, big trunk. I love the all wheel drive, especially in the winter. This car has been remarkably reliable for me. (Hope I didn't just jinx myself!)  I had the timing belt service including water pump etc. performed at the prescribed mileage. I've replaced the battery, brake pads and rotors and tires, and a couple of front end alignments. The only non-regular maintenance items I've had to do is replacing is a tie rod end and both front axles, all due to torn rubber boots at the ball joint and CV-joints, respectively. At its age, I can't really complain. None of the work was done by the dealer. This is an Audi after all, so expect to pay more for work and parts than on other cars. I've had good luck with a couple of local independent mechanics. The 2.7 liter bi-turbo is nice and peppy when needed. I usually buy this class of car with more than a couple of years on it. Since I like a firm, responsive ride I'll usually start by investing in shocks and struts all around, but this car has handled beautifully from the get-go and right up to the present, so I still have the original suspension components.  Fuel consumption isn't great by today's standards: about 21 mpg around town, and 26 on the highway, and I drive rather carefully.A common problem on a used Audi is oil leaks around the engine. Oftentimes the leak is above the exhaust manifold so drips or runs down to vaporize and stink. I haven't had this problem, but be mindful of this issue. Another issue I need to point out, NOT related to this car but on any Audi with the 2 liter, 4 cylinder turbo engine built roughly between 2006 - 2013. This engine has a very serious problem with oil consumption. It's not leakage. It simple burns it at the rate of a quart every 600 to 1500 miles. It's a widely known issue. My wife's 2007 A4 Avant has this problem. Of course we learned about it after we bought it. Response from the seller, ""It's always done it."" From the dealer, ""They all do it."" Both are right. Caveat emptor.I find it curious to say the least that Audi, a German company that otherwise makes beautifully engineered cars, hasn't figured out to make an oil seal that lasts, either external, the dripping, or internal, the burning of oil.Would I buy another one? Most likely. I like the overall feel.",4

I was surprised with the average gas mileage(averaged 26.4 mpg) over the past two years.  On the down side, I spent a lot of time in the shop for small items (some covered by warranty).  Repairs included new battery, 4 cv boots, head light, two tail lights.  On average I spent $1,200 per year in repairs not including oil changes, brakes and tires/rotations.

I've tinted the windows and added aftermarket wheels to the otherwise boring design of the 18"" S- Line stockers.  Oil lines to the turbos were updated for 2004 so no more blown turbos (one goes you've got to replace the other)!  Ride is very nice and not too harsh.

When I first looked at the A6 I looked at the 3.0 CVT model, but heard many negs about the CVT.  Decided to risk the turbos and step up to the 2.7T S-Line as it wasn't much more money on the used market.  I am so pleased with my decision.  The car is beautiful inside and out.

Pretty disappointing for a luxury car but otherwise the interior is pretty well built. I would not recommend this car, at least from personal experience, because of its reliability issues. We bought our car second hand, granted, but it came with a fun oil consumption issue and heater did not work. Maybe ours was a lemon, but if you are buying one of these, watch out for this problem. Our old Buick has not exactly been babied and it still does not burn a drop, plus it is much older and has ironically run longer than the Audi. It looks like every other reviewer on here has had a good experience, but if you are buying one of these, buy one with a warranty or with its service history so you can tell whether the previous owner was meticulous in maintenance or not. If the previous owner didn't treat it well it will not treat you well. Don't take a chance and think ""The previous owner probably treated their car well.""",2

Great ergonomics. I'm a car nut, and every time I think about buying a new car I hold it up to the A6 for comparability. Most are found wanting.

It all comes down to reasonable and prudent reliability and quality of materials.  This was a 24000 mile pre-owned Audi certified car we purchased.  Driven lightly for the last 5-6 years, garage kept 1/2-2/3 of the time owned.  What's good?Performance, feel, and overall car experience were favorable.  Fuel economy is outstanding, especially highway.  Car has generally been trouble free, or so I thought (see What's Bad).What's Bad?Where to start.  1) Service intervals - we have had this into Audi every 10K per suggested and every time we leave with no less than a $400 bill gone for what I would have normally thought was a Jiffy Lube type $65 event.  They ALWAYS find something wrong that needs to be fixed or replaced, or updated - and being a good Audi owner I comply since I want my Audi to be in top shape all the time. 2) Absolutely $%## poor quality of materials on interior knobs, dials, and trim.  Just google it and you will see lots of people with delaminated interior trim.  Audi chooses to turn the other way though and does not recall this to fix an obvious mfg defect.  Its a calculated risk for them I assume thinking not enough care - I do and on this alone, I will never buy Audi again.  I tried to sell my car (which is otherwise in great shape) and everyone was turned off by paint peeling off of the various knobs and dials.  3) Power Steering - Developed a leak at 65K miles.  Too expensive to repair on my quickly depreciating car - no return on investment there, so just keep adding the $30/pint Audi fluid as need be.  4) Oil Use - uses about 1 US Quart of $8 synthetic oil every 4K miles.  No matter what they say, this seems excessive.  My Ford Explorer had 200K and used 1/3 of that.  5) Technology - Even in 2006, simple things like AUX jacks should be available.  There is no way to connect a device other than Radio Frequency Module - which suck.  My 2002 Corolla was better than that.   6) Navigation is ok, not great.  Its so outdated and Audi wants you to pay $300+ for their map update CDs....residual income for them I guess.  7) Battery - The $180 battery that goes with this only makes it about 12-14 months then dies.  Get a good one with a warranty since you will be using it A LOT.  8) And now for the 95,000 interval (I had to wait to 98,000...shame on me).  Remember that the car has been factory serviced every 10K since 24K miles....  8a) Windshield washer pump was shorted out $400 - had to fix this since its a safety item.  8b) windshield washer blades - there are no auto store or aftermarklets available.  Audi must provide these @ $60.  8c) Oil and filter change @ $400.  Up to $800 now.  8d) take a guess...bad battery $180 (I declined since mine is Autozone and under warranty).  8e) Motor mounts are bad (huh?) - $1300 - I declined.  8f) Adaptive headlight sensor error - must remove front end to check it $1200 (for a light that is still shining? LOL) - I declined. 8g) Rear brake light error - tech tried to check this but the lens covers were too brittle.  New ones cost $1200 - again LOL - I declined.  8h) Front end bushings need replaced - $1800 - I declined.  8i) Oil leak noticed around timing and valve cover - $1500 - I declined.  I stop them here.  This $6,500 car is way past its service life at 98,000 miles.  Didn't even make it to 100K - wow for a $65K automobile.I share my experience with the first person I see who I knew had a A3 with 50,000 miles on it.  They just traded theirs in after their service call quoted them thousands of dollars in very similar repairs and failures.  Different dealership, different auto groups so no suspicion there.  I assume its just a fact that an Audi is disposable ($0 value) after 8-10 years or 50-90K miles.  Well, I hear scrap metal is $3/100 pounds so there is that.....",1

I'm am only selling for fear of costly repairs down the road which if I could predict to be reasonable, I'd keep it.

This car is a lot of fun to drive and handles better than most cars I've owned; the quattro AWD system certainly inspires confidence. For its weight, the car is a little underpowered with the V6 engine. Seats are a little firm and I can't seem to adjust the driver's seat just right. Long trips are still pretty easy. Rear seat has a lot of leg room. The female end of the center seat belt is recessed and hard to reach for practical use; definitely cannot use a car seat or booster seat in the center.  Other than that, car is very well built, gets a lot of looks from people, and is not all that common (making it even better!).",4.5

The car is a dream. It rides better and is more comfortable than any car I've ever had. It can float down the highway or play on mountain curves, whatever suits you. Even with the 8 cylinders, I get 28 mpg on the highway. In town is rough at 15, but I expected that. I like the fact that it has all the features of its better know competitors, but you don't see as many of these on the road. If you see one for a good price, grab it before it runs away.

Had some electrical surprises - audio shutting off, no way to turn back on unless battery is disconnected & reconnected. Worse, my left front headlamp leaks & fogs.

Before buying, I compared the A6 to others in its price range, and it came out on top in almost all areas.

A quantum leap in technical sophistication, comfort and fit.  Seating very comfortable.  Highway noise almost non-existent.  Great acceleration and manuverability.  Only two minor manufacturing flaws, neither performance related. The MMI is easy enough to use, but it is distracting.  I live with a lot of wide open spaces, but with hundreds of satellite radio stations to choose from, you get distracted.

It offers fantastic grip on the road, and I have driven it at 155 mph frequently, without being worried. All the electronics offered in the car are also very useful and good. I never experienced any error in the car as yet (after using it for over a year).  I unfortunately didn't get to buy a Quattro.

Every component of the vehicle--from the well thought out and purposeful controls and convenience features (Audi's MMI runs circles around BMW's iDrive and Mercedes' COMMAND) to the cavernous trunk, buttery-smooth engine and transmission, tastefully appointed interior and distinctive exterior design--works together to achieve a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts.

I have been a mechanic for 30 years, and there are some things that were done with this car that makes me think it was designed and assembled by retards.  The compartment aft of the engine (where battery is) fills up to the top with water and i guess Audi never thought that anything like leaves or dirt might just get in a clog those microscopic drain hole in that compartment, had the problem 3 times, finally got pissed to the point taking a chance and drilling a 1"" hole in the bottom  of it. That also causes water in the carpet area, which then leads to expensive electronic modules stopping to work, which are located under where your feet rest in the front seats.  STUPID!!! ----- Next, they built the exhaust so the heat shields fail prematurely and they attached the exhaust hangers which are spot welded to the heat shields!  So that falls off the car and gets wrecked resulting in a $1,700 bill.  DUMB!!!   ------Next, Their bodywork for a German car appears to be way below BMW.  This car had surface rust all over the typical areas at 124k miles, that is unacceptable for a car built in 1999.  -----Front Suspension?  Parts are GARBAGE, wears out very quickly, every inspection it needs a new upper front or rear A-arm.   Next--- LCD information screen in dash, POS!  Also fails prematurely on most of these cars.

I have to agree with previous reviews that it feels slightly underpowered while in a partial throttle acceleration from a standing stop, but if you get on it, the 200 ponies are definitely there.  When the engine is cold, the trans does not want to shift at the normal times, but the tiptronic cures that.  The car is a joy to drive on the highway - smooth as silk and good handling.

The Quattro AWD system cuts through the snow-packed New Hampshire and Maine roads like a knife through butter. We also have a Mercedes E320 4MATIC and by far, the Audi Quattro AWD system leaves the Mercedes buried (literally). We also found the front and rear seats more comfortable than MB, BMW.

Watch out for the stereo, though. If you change the battery, or there's a short, the stero locks up and you need a code to unlock it - which'll cost you $75 if you don't know it.

This vehicle has every electronic and convenience option available in 014. The brakes have an annoying, very aggravating and obvious chatter or shutter when applied at speeds above 35 mph since 3000 from delivery.  Complaints to the dealer resulted in a polite explanation that the brakes are safe and I just have to live with the shuttering as they are not able to cure it under the factory or extended warranty I purchased with the car. For a chance to rid the car of this birth defect they say I will have to pay for replacement rotors and pads.  Aside from the inconvenience of taking it in between scheduled maintenance visits I am otherwise ok with the A6 although several non life threatening electronic system failures were cured each time by the dealer's service department under warranty. UNFORTUNATELY because the brake chattering issue tarnishes the driving experience every time I get behind the wheel and dealers unwillingness or inability to cure it under the warranty,  I would not purchase another car from this manufacturer. While I own it I will keep asking them to address the brake issue each time I have it serviced. Maybe someday they will have a change of heart then perhaps, so will I.",3

I love the side assist feature, works flawlessly. The Bose sound system is fantastic. The other great feature is the ability to change handling, 4 different settings, love this feature. It's extremely comfortable to drive, easily feel the road through the steering wheel. The navigation takes a bit getting used to as it totally voice controlled, sometimes it takes 2-3 commands for the system to get the address correctly. Overall navigation is quite easy to use. The controls are easy to find and use without distracting attention from the road. The amount of features takes a while to become used to and familiar in using. I chose  the 2.0 engine on purpose, has a lot of torque, and the turbo is immediate in response. And in Los Angeles you'll never use all the power of the 3.0 engine anyway, unless you drive after midnight. I'm quite surprised at the quality and reliability of this car, I was expecting some issues, but not one so far, except for the tires.

All of the benefits of the old, large V8 engines that used to be in the luxury cars, without any drawbacks. Not only do I get smooth power basically anywhere in the powerband, but I get exceptional fuel economy if I am cruising on the highway.  The supercharger allows for the immediacy in power, which is essential for drama-free passing on the highway, and it also allows for quiet, efficient cruising. With a light foot, I have had the car exceed 38 mpg, with normal highway cruising returning ~30 mpg. I mean seriously, it feels like a crime having both power and efficiency.Everything else is as expected: quiet, comfortable cabin with class-leading technology, layout and materials used.  The screen is beautiful, with NVIDIA graphics allowing for beautiful map rendering, the Bose sound system is rich, and the MMI is fantastic once you get used to it. I am techy so it took me about 1 day to learn the system while driving around, but I feel as though almost everything makes sense in terms of layout and ergonomics.  The ride is not as supple as some of ultra-luxury cars with air-suspension, but those cars are no fun to drive. This is the perfect compromise.I bought the car used with ~5k miles on the odometer, which not only took a few thousand off the price, but more importantly gave me the piece of mind of a 5 year 100,000 mile warranty! My only question is how much less power does the 2.0T have? Because for day-to-day commuting, you don't even get into the power in this car.  Yes, it's nice to have the power to pass 98% of cars I see on the highway, but at the same time, 90% of my driving is done with efficiency in mind.",5

Pros: THE best looking styling of all European/Japanese/American mid-size luxury sedans, hands down. Love the TDI diesel--44+mpg combined, quicker than a bullet, quiet engine (see the one major con on this engine below). Road handling is superb and this car is a blast to drive on a curvy highway. Cons--On the other hand...not the most comfy to drive on long trips and I have taken this car cross country. I get it's a sports sedan but after a while the lack of expected comfort starts to wear on you (esp. on a $60,000+ car). Tires--I have 30,000 miles on them, I don't drive hard, but the dealer told me I have about 10,000 miles left on them. What? 40,000 miles on a set of Dunlops? Biggest beef--as the tread wears down the noise these tires make is unbearably loud. Last issue-- Audi sends me a letter letting me know my TDI diesel engine was engineered to run on UP TO 5% biodiesel. Unfortunately I live in a state that mandates the sale of 20% biodiesel in the warmer months. Nice. Wish my dealer would have mentioned that to me when I bought the car. Audi goes on  to state in the letter to me that in any event, they WILL honor any warranty issues arising out of the use of this biodiesel. As one who usually ""buys them and drives them forever"",  I don't think I want to own this car after the warranty expires. I love this car but doubtful I will buy another diesel engine as long as I live in this state. I realize this is not Audi's problem but hopefully they are working on this biodiesel issue.",4

1855, on 10/22/13 18:18 PM (PDT),mdifanis ,2014 Audi A6 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),The performance/MPG sweet spot," My TDI is equipped with S-Line option package & optional 20"" wheels with summer performance tires. It is both gorgeous (and menacing!) looking and incredibly fun to drive. For most people and most situations, the diesel **is** the high performance option, effortlessly building speed and dispatching almost all tasks without feeling like it's even trying. In normal, sedate driving, the tach doesn't exceed 2,000 RPMs, yet it hits its maximum torque output within this range, which is the secret to the extraordinary fuel efficiency/performance combination. And if you want to do spirited driving, it is happy to oblige, and it sounds happy to rev. Most folks would never know it's a diesel.**Update as of 10/16: Still loving my A6 TDI.  I have put may miles on loaner Audis with the 3.0T and 2.0T engines.  In each case, I could not wait to get back behind the wheel of my TDI. My lifetime average fuel economy is over 32 MPG--for a 4,300 pound car with all-wheel drive that can hurdle to 60 mph in about 5 1/2 seconds!The TDI emissions scandal may make these exceptional buys on the pre-owned market.  I'm still awaiting the final manufacturer's fix, which for the 3.0L engine will likely be a software update,  since this engine has the urea based exhaust treatment system.  I anxiously await what I hope will be the eventual return of diesel models to the U.S. market.****Update as of 10/24/17: still no emissions fix, but the car now has more than 106,000 miles, and it runs beautifully, still exceeding EPA fuel economy figures if I drive anywhere close to the speed limit.  The price premium for the diesel engine paid for itself in fuel savings more than 50,000 miles ago.  As of this week where I live in Illinois, diesel is $2.35 per gallon, while premium unleaded (which is what the gasoline counterpart calls for) is $2.99.",5

Having come from a 2010 3.0T A6, the TDI feels just as powerful as the 3.0T (albeit rated about 60HP less), but then again it's all about the torque with this car (428 lb ft). The MPG (easily averaging 30mpg+ in mixed driving, and close to 40 on long highway runs) and the range (averaging close to 600 miles/tank) are incredible for a car of this size and power. Love all the tech in this compared to my prior A6, and the car just looks great in Daytona Gray w/ all black interior, 19"" sport pkg and full LED headlights to top it all off. ",4.875

I looked into the S4 as well and went with the A6 3.0t in the end because of the added room and larger gas tank. I had an aftermarket APR tune put on the car and did a Pully swap (making it a stage 2) and couldn't be happier. The car was fun to drive before but the tune really woke up some serious potential in the car. You step on the gas and it's just effortless how it moves. I plan on keeping the car for a few more years before upgrading to an S6 next. For what these cars go for new being able to pick on up used that's been well taken car of gives you a lot of car for the $$$. I looked at a couple other brands before the purchase of this car and you just can't beat the Audi fit and finish...highly recommend this car and Audi's in general.,4

Despite reviews from others, I thought the 3.0T was weak -- compared to the 4.2. And unlike the transmission mated to the V6, you can hardly feel it shift in the V8. The 3.0T has to work to accelerate. But if you can't feel the difference in your test drive, then save your money and buy the 3.0T. The 4.2 engine growls and accelerates smoothly.  Unlike the 3.0T, you can't feel the vibration of the engine in the steering wheel. The fit and trim is incredible. And the lines are just breath taking.

I then went to my local dealership and test-drove the V6. And after the test-drive?  Do not believe Edmunds, go try both and form your own opinion.  In mine, no comparison with my 08 V8, not even close. The 0 to 60 thing, 5.8 sec. (for the V8) versus 5.9 (for the V6) are close, and are probably true (and no Edmunds, the V6 is not quicker than the V8, and did you really do your research, did you really test drive both models?).

Great acceleration between 80 mph and 130 mph.

The tires, as on so many performance cars, are not able to take potholes (expensive lesson), but they grip extremely well. For a car with more than 400 lb-ft of torque, the all-wheel drive allows you to drive with surprising ease on icy roads.

1949, on 11/10/17 22:11 PM (PST),Mythos ,2018 Audi S5 Coupe Prestige quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Fantastic Upgrade from 2015 S5.," The overall feel to me is a higher level of sophistication than previous generation.   Audi has made a step up in overall quality of interior design, materials and switch gear.  Suspension changes are quite noticeable which provides a more sure footed feel.  Gone is the under steer tendency when aggressively taking corners.  It feels much quicker with surges of power more instantaneous across the RPM band than the previous generation due to the Turbo providing low end torque where the 2015 Supercharged engine only produced that kind of torque over 3k RPM.  Didn't think Audi could improve the interior but they did.  Seats are more supportive and yet more comfortable,  The changes to the MMI took a little getting use to but now it is second nature accessing information is faster with the new button layout.   Input of information is easier too especially with the touch handwriting recognition.  MMI\Navi computer is much faster.  No lag time between screens and the navigation display is amazingly sharp and directions are accurate.  The visual cockpit is a joy to use.  Information right in front of you where it should be.  Love the multi gauge setups.  Even the B&O stereo system is a step up in sound quality.  Very glad I upgraded to the 2018.",5

Glad it was the 2018 S5 Prestige!," This car is absolutely incredible. It drives and handles like a  dream. The technology can be a bit overwhelming at first but once you get used to how things work it is great. The controls and ergonomics of the cabin are almost perfect. Great quality materials in the buttons, high-quality diamond stitched Nappa leather and a sound system that is fantastic. Everything is arranged within the cabin with the driver as the focus of all controls and electronics. The virtual cockpit is incredible to use as is everything else. Engine response is superb with just a slight turbo lag in the low rpm range below 1300rpm. Once past that line, the acceleration is incredible. The handling is so balanced with acceleration and cornering that is way out of its class. I could go on and on about what a great car this is but all I can say is this was my first Audi S5 series, it will not be my last.",5

I am disappointed that mechanical problems have started. I rarely open the convertible top due to the hot climates in my area, however I have noticed there is unusual wear at all the fold points of the Root top fabric. In addition,I have noted some peeling paint Around the doorhandles. I brought this to the attention of the local Audi dealer and they refused to do anything about it claiming that it was not significant enough yet. I asked them what would be significant enough and they said we can’t tell you that. For a premium car, at a premium price, in a premium brand, that is just absolutely unacceptable in my opinion? I received a tutorial from a dealership in Charlotte North Carolina, not my own dealership, regarding enhancing the performance of the vehicle through the settings. This certainly did improve the acceleration and some of the performance, but I believe the car still feels more luxurious and smooth than sporty. It remains sluggish to rev up and acts like you are asking a lot to get up and run.  Not ready for a hot-lap on the track like the F-Type that feels like hopped up on espresso and biting it's nails to go everytime you start it. I still feel is not enough trunk space for a golf bag, couple tennis rackets fit fine. Handling is still very nice and crisp and the steering has a very connected tight feel that almost does what you think, very BMW-esque. Ride is still very quiet with almost no noise. Very tied down cabin.  I have found that the lack of a microphone and hands-free is really unsafe and cumbersome and a large disappointment...really??  My $30k Toyota Truck has voice command AND a touch Screen?! The Audi also lacks front parking sensors And with a nose that extends far beyond the front wheels, this is often a problem with curbs. Now, many of those complaints are relatively minor, compared to problems I’ve had with other vehicles. But the mediocre sports performance of the vehicle combined with its high price tag and the lack of support from my local dealership in this premium brand really leaves me disappointed about the vehicle. I would seek to trade in the vehicle, but I found out even a more for Disappointing fact. Despite the vehicle being somewhat rare and not very common, its resale value has plummeted since purchase. I believe I will look to other premium brands such as Lexus  with increasingly disappointing service provided by the German automobile makers.",4

I ran an auto check and found out that it was in an accident. the dealer took back the car but its now reselling it CPO and acting like its perfect.

I don't put a lot of mileage on my S5 but it has has no maintenance issues and is a delight to drive.  Finally, my son liked mine so much that he went out and bought an S5 coupe! There remains only one item I wish was different - there are no front parking assist sensors on the S5.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this is not standard or at least offered as an option as even A3 cabriolet has them. The color, Sepang Blue Pearl, is awesome and I constantly get compliments on it.  In addition, just as on our Q5, the paint job is FLAWLESS - not a touch of ""orange-peel"" anywhere.July 2016 Update:  Since we do most of our longer trips in the wife's 2013 Q5,  the S5 Cabriolet has just 12,100 miles to date.  The car has run flawlessly, looks showroom new and continues to draw admiring comments wherever I take it.  Worth noting - I cannot get a definitive answer on best tire pressure.  When I inflated them to the factory-recommended (sticker and owner's manual) pressure of 39/38psi the ride becomes a little too harsh for my liking.  I reduced the pressures to 36psi all around and the ride was better with no perceptible degradation in handing.  Also, I wish Audi would come up with a better composition for their brake pads - I bought a pressure washer to deal with the constant accumulation of black brake dust on my wheels - almost as bad as my old Bimmer.  I'm not at this point yet but when our Q5 said it needed brake pad replacement - Audi would not turn the rotors!  This strikes me as ridiculous and made a simple brake pad replacement job cost over $1,300.  I may not go to Audi when my pads need replacement.Having said all that,I still love my S5 Cabriolet!",5

I was torn between waiting for the supercharged V6, or getting the V8.  After all of my research, I discovered, that the V6 will be on average 2-3 miles per gallon more efficient.  Which if you drive 15,000 miles a year, and extrapolate over a 5 year car ownership averages to about $2000 saved for the V6.  I chose the V8 because I test drove both engines, and the V8 just sounds better, feels better, and I personally like feeling the gears change and shift, because it makes me feel that I am driving a rocket.

The Audi S5 is that, and more!After test driving BMW, Audi, and Jaguar, I was on the fence between BMW and Audi.  The Audi just “felt” more fun to drive.  The BMW had a better entertainment system and better fuel economy.  Also, the Audi was slightly more expensive; telling me it had better resale.  The other thing that made me choose Audi was the Adaptive Cruise Control option.  BMW doesn’t have this option on many of their convertibles, and it was easier to find an Audi with one.  I am so glad I did!  What a great feature to have if you drive highways frequently.After 7 weeks with this car, it is more than perfect, if you can say that.  It is a high performance speed demon if you want, with a great exhaust sound and rally inspired handling.  If you want a leisurely cruise with the top down, you can have that too.  It does drink a little more gas than I was expecting, but the smiles per mile more than make up for it.  Traction hasn’t been an issue, and I can’t wait to try it in snow.The main issues I’ve had are with the entertainment system.  The Homelink garage door opener has not worked a few times. (I literally jumped in the OTHER car I have with it, pushed the button, and door went down on the first try.  After returning home, the Audi Homelink worked fine.) The “MMI” Nav screen has become “stuck” on a screen before after using the reverse camera.  I had to push the Media or Nav button to get it un-stuck, so not too bad of an issue.  One morning after putting the top down, a window kept going to 25% closed while the rest were 100%.  I had to manually use the window button on that door to get it to stay up.  The cord to connect your phone or iPod to the Nav system is a pain, as it is in the glove box.  Instead, I bought a 16GB SD card for $10 on Amazon and play all my music that way with one of two SD slots.  The Bluetooth for answering calls and playing music is flawless, however.  I very much prefer the non-touch screen in the Audi vs the touch screen in the BMW.   UPDATE: I have not had any issues with any of these systems since the dealer updated the MMI 6 months ago.Driving with the top up, it feels like a normal car.  The road noise can be elevated at times, which is because it is a cloth top.  A Mustang driver rode in my car and noted that the road noise was much less than theirs.  The AC cools very fast, creating a cool atmosphere on a hot day (95F) with the setting at 76F.  The ventilated seats cool quite quickly, but I am beginning to think they are more of a gimmick than worth the extra money.If you are buying strictly for performance, you might be a little disappointed with the vehicle stability and throttle response.  You can feel a lot of vehicle sway when cornering on a rough road, and many people install a rigid bar across the engine bay to reduce body sway.  The throttle is not responsive unless in sport mode, which is quite punchy and hurts drivability a bit.In addition, the looks of this car are unique and stylish.  Not too aggressive or over the top, but smooth lines and well-designed features.  Even with the release of the redesigned 2018 model, this one doesn’t look out of date.Overall, this car is a pleasure to drive and look at.  You won’t be disappointed in buying, although maintenance is slightly more expensive when items fail, the reliability has been fantastic.  If you came to this page to find the perfect car, this is the ONE!UPDATE: After driving this car for 14 months, I like it even more.  I've put almost 32K miles on it with no mechanical issues.  Even changed the tires and it didn't need an alignment.  I think the performance is better than I originally thought.  Keeping the car in Dynamic mode helps the stability in cornering quite a bit.  I drove it on slick and icy roads without any issues.  The entertainment system had a few sporadic problems, but an update to the system by the dealer took care of them.  I found out gas mileage can drastically improve with driving habits, haha. Overall, still very happy with my purchase.",5

My first choice was a Porsche 911 C4S but I couldn't justify the expense (that is code for too steep of a price).  So, why did I go this route? The audi S5 that has been in the market for a while.  Yet, you don't see very many on the road.  It's sexy, is quick and agile.  It does have its limits as it is not ""an all out"" sports car but a luxury GT Coupe. Fun Factor and great looks: I thoroughly enjoy the ride quality and quickness.  Quality of the interior is above board.  Wow, it a reliable rendition of what a GT coupe should be.2018 Update: 22k miles - still love this car.  Garage kept.   Car looks good in caparison to others on the road.",5

The difference is remarkable, both in performance, as well as an overall graduation to nicer interior stylings, technology and engineering. With the beast 333 hp supercharged engine under the hood, the acceleration from a dead stop was palpable, if not downright enjoyable. Outer stylings will certainly turn heads, as the car jumps off the page demonstrating elegance with an understated sportiness, particularly with the hardtop coupe model.  The technology and dashboard layout can be both intimidating and frustrating, for example many controls are dash mounted, consequently, its important to learn where everything is prior to getting in it and spinning around town. Sadly, in my case, the vehicle has only 18,000 km on it over two years, and paint is flaking off in large 25cent size pieces from the rocker panels on both sides of the car (where you would expect the paint to never fall off). I have notified the dealer in Mississauga, Ontario in this case, who recommended I go to Audi Canada, since it was out of their hands. I have contacted Audi Canada about the issue and they are unwilling to do anything about it citing road damage. I live in the city, drive the car infrequently on paved roads only, and do not drive the car in winter (as I spend my time in the south).Quite frankly, I am surprised by Audi's reluctance to do anything about it, since I am a repeat buyer, which is prompting me to look elsewhere when I replace my car in another year or so. However, when I do drive the Audi S5, the flaking paint is a good advertisement for the poor quality paint Audi has put on my car and anyone who asks, I tell them the problem. Other than that, defer to my earlier comments about performance, and its highly recommended vehicle if you don't mind the paint falling off it.",5

In the time leading up to my purchase I drove the new M3, RS4, A5 and S4. The S5 is the perfect combination of performance, comfort, style, features and audible pleasure. I loved driving the M3 and was close to deciding on that car but I was a little worried about RWD in the northern Wisconsin winters that can make driving even an AWD car a challenge 6-8 months out of the year. After nearly three weeks with the S5 I can say I am thrilled with all aspects of the Audi. I disagree with people on the MPG, for a car of this type, the MPG is great.

I just got it, but I must say it is not that great of a car.  I own an M5 2007 so there is a big difference in performance.  When driving you must step on the gas more due to the quattro system.  When you release you will feel a slight deceleration which makes people think you are braking but you are not.  The handling is not as nice due to the really light wheel.  I do not get any feedback like when I drive rear wheel cars.  You will notice it the most when you drive on twisty roads.  I do understeer on turns since the line of entry is a little different with this car.  Great car for everyday drive but for performance the 335i can boogie against this car.  ",4.125

I've found the V8 is perfectly robust and yet sumptuous, and the acceleration is long and powerful in any gear. The interior made my former 3-series feel outdated instantly.

All and all so far it has been everything I have expected.  A few things I have noted are that the IPOD option does not come with an IPOD adaptor!  Seats are a 6 on long trips due to comfort and I have noticed that the tires seem a little narrow over 100 mph.

When I say great ride, I mean great ride. It hugs the road. It's almost as if the car is saying, ""Let me show you what I can do"". I was on the highway one afternoon, and the engine was purring like a much contented cat, when I glanced at the tach, and it was around 2000rpms. Then, I looked over to the speedometer, and I doing close to 90mph. It' just that smooth. Of course I slowed down, but jeez! Curves, cake. Passing, let's go. When you get in, you feel pampered, but not overwhelmed. The controls and appointments are laid out in a pleasing and thoughtful manner. Yes, the trunk is small, but are you really going to throw 100 pounds of mulch back there? Didn't think so. I looked at the Mercedes CLA-4 MATIC, and the Cadillac ATS, but neither came close. If you like to drive as much as I do, drive the Audi A3.",5

All my nav, media, and car info can also be displayed and controlled independently in front of me in addition to the Nav screen in the center.

I have driven it some, quite impressed with its (front seat) legroom, smooth ride & handling, and giddy-up, esp. when you drop it into Sport mode.

What I don't understand, therefore, are reviewers who are critical of the car (or any new car, for that matter) on things that should be obvious. Come on now, before spending your hard earned money, didn't you do your homework? You complain that the seats aren't heated, and the GPS is not what you like. Really? I think it's one thing to have 'failed' experiences, like poor reliability or gas mileage, but if you wanted certain features, why did you buy the car? That all said, the A3 is a great compact car. I love the look and feel. And features.Follow up: 6+ months/6500 miles: 2015 A3 Cabriolet still looks and runs great. No issues. Had the oil change/5k service done at the dealer. Averaging 34.5 mpg on highway, and 25mpg around town. Nice combination of power, looks and economy for a 4-passenger convertible.

I owned it in an area with several feet of snow and even in the fwd version with factory tires she handled excellent. I honestly I had great experience and only got out of the car and did not purchase due to two things. The first was that I do not have children, and only rarely do my back seats get used. Well one day I went to open my back door and the handle fell off, this was at about 800 miles (got it with 15) on the vehicle. Since it was a lease I thought this would be an easy go in and get it fixed. Wrong. They tried charging me just to look at it - over $100 - and then said that the warranty on the vehicle would not cover this as it was wear and tear. I was in disbelief as I only had used the back door on that car a handful of times. After fighting the dealership and calling corporate, they agreed to at least look at it for free. It ended up being a very simple fix, and they didn't charge me - though the bill they almost gave me was for over $300. The second was simply a cost thing. The first oil change on her was over $350. I understand other things are checked and such, but honestly the cost of the one visit was as much as my payment. I LOVED the vehicle and would definitely get another, I would just be VERY mindful of cost to own and warranty!",5
2033, on 02/23/17 07:21 AM (PST),PAC ,2015 Audi A3 Sedan 2.0 TFSI Premium quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),"My first Audi, and it is stellar"," I'm towards the end of a 36 month lease on a 2015 2.0 Premium A3 sedan. I have been, and continue to be very happy with this car. I wanted a small luxury sedan that was nimble and easy for city parking and was very good in snow, as i live in a major city in the northeast. I needed something easy to park. I wanted something with a simple but well appointed interior. I'm not partial to the Japanese luxury brand interiors, as they have so much stuff everywhere. I like clean and simple. I liked that the display could retract into the dash and the interior would be very sparse. I also wanted something that was a bit agile. I came from a VW Golf manual transmission and most automatic transmissions were slow to respond ""off the line."" I wouldn't call this fast to respond off the line, but it was preferable to me above the other luxury brands I test drove. I compared this car to Audi A4, BMW 3 series, Mercedes C300, Lexus, Inifiniti and Acura. This suited my needs the best and was most comfortable for me. I am short and it is perfect for me. This would not be a good car for a family of people over 6ft. The car has been incredibly reliable. I have not had one single issue. This car handles great and is very agile. It is very responsive for my needs. The combined MPG over 18k miles is 24MPG. I drive a combo of sport and normal mode, and do a fair bit of stop and go commuting. most of the miles are commuting miles I'd guess. My only issue is I wish the cargo room were a little easier accessible from the boot through the rear seats. My VW had so much more usable cargo space, but in fairness it was a hatchback. The pass-through from the boot to the rear seats is small and prohibits getting much back there. In fairness, I knew this was the case when I bought the car and it is a minimal complaint. You're not going to fit any furniture in here, but you probably dont expect to. I wish there were still a hatch version of this available in the states. The standard features are great and I wouldn't add a thing. I had the cold weather package added and that was it. I would recommend this car to anyone who is looking for a small, responsive, luxury car with solid standard features.",4

Seems well built, solid, still handles great and gets decent mileage for a gas model.

2037, on 10/18/16 07:12 AM (PDT),Luke Ty ,2015 Audi A3 Sedan 2.0 TFSI Premium quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),"My favorite car ever, with a few warts."," I purchased this car new in October, 2014 and have 60,000 miles on the car.  I average a combined 30mpg and I am a spirited driver.  The engine in this car is phenomenal.  The acceleration is fantastic.  It's a real sleeper.  I doubt there are many other cars that have four doors and excellent fuel economy that can handle and drive as well as this car.  I'm 6'2"" and the driver's seat is adequate.  Be sure to purchase the upgraded seats, I did not and the passenger's seat controls are very difficult to use.  The passenger seat confuses every single person who enters my car, including those who have been in my car enough to know how to operate them.  There is a knob to lean the seat back and it is not easy to use.  For an extra $500 you can get power seats all around.  There are two things with this car that annoy me to no end.  At low speeds the transmission on my car clunks in and out of gear.  It's unsafe.  I've been on a slight hill and trying to get the car moving and it's started rolling down the hill in the opposite direction rather than engage D or R, nearly causing an accident.  I've had it to the dealer several times and they've reset the transmission computer, but the issue was never resolved and I am now out of warranty.  The cure is to give it more gas, and this is counter intuitive and not what you want to be doing when you're in a tight parking space or on a slight grade.  It truly is a safety issue and I don't like it at all.  The transmission on my car also doesn't shift that great.   The automatic transmission is nowhere near as good as the engine.   I've had several loaners and none have had the awful and dangerous clunking in and out of gear at low speed transmission issue my car has, and they seem to be smoother shifting as well.  My next major gripe is the sunroof.  Mine has been rattling since around 4,000 miles.  It took me a long time to determine where the rattling was coming from.  Once I found it, I took it to the dealer where they broke more parts and damaged my car.  I've taken my car to three dealers and all they've managed to do was break things and put dents, dirt and grease stains on my ceiling and lie to me and tell me don't come back.  I'm not making this up.  I tried in vain to get support from Audi USA, but they were not helpful either.  So I have a clunky, defective transmission and rattling sunroof and no support from Audi or the dealers.  My experience with the three Audi dealerships I've visited has been horrible.  I've owned two BMWs and two Mercedes and never had issues or outright lies from dealers like I have with Audi dealerships.  Due to this, I will likely not be buying any Audis in the future.  This is a conflicting review.  I absolutely LOVE driving the A3.  The engine, handling, ability to cruise in the snow, and the car's confidence in the rain combined with excellent fuel mileage offset the miserable transmission and horrible support from the dealers and Audi USA.  I really love this car, but It's a mixed bag for sure.  For the $$, I wasn't expecting annoying rattling and non existent dealer support starting at 4,000 miles.  It's a shame the dealers have been unable and unwilling to help me resolve my transmission and sunroof issues.  I will not to go back to the Audi dealers due to the horrible treatment and outright lying I experienced.  I will deal with these annoying problems until it's time for me to find a new car, which will likely not be an Audi despite my love of this car.  Audi USA, if you're reading this, I tried to contact you MANY MANY times about my experiences.  It's clear that you don't care.",4

Very well cared for from my end car has 20k miles.  In 20k miles I have had car shut off on highway from overheating, dealer added antifreeze, but it was above minimum and I've never had a car just shut off.  dealer said drive it in.  next I've had multiple electrical problems,  says doesn't recognize key, then i walk away come back and it recognizes then problem goes away for weeks.  then brake light out signal comes up on dash, brake lights are functioning and on (took video of it) took to audi,,  says no engine code, would have to tear car down to look for a short!   so I wait to have them take care of it, and it doesn't do it for months,  intermittently it will occur.  just give it a day or two and it goes away.   then i was rear ended while stopped at light (8k damages and frame/uni needed pulled to straighten)  had audi shop do the work.. got the car back and it vibrates badly from 65-80mph.  take it to body shop, they send me to Sunnyside audi service in middleburg OH, dealer service says everything is straight and balanced and no problem with their work. but they can put new tires on and balance them for 1200.00,  i reply that the car didn't do this before accident, they say they don't know.  I exclaim that the tires on there have plenty of wear left as i have snow tires and the tires have less than a year of road use.  they can't tell me why they would shake then.  I ask for a guarantee that it would stop if replaced, can't give me a guarantee.  I call audi america and they send me back to dealer.  Its a run around shell game thats completely disappointing.   I am 100% sure that the car DID NOT do this before accident and even said if you replace them and it fixes it, i will pay for them,  if it doesn't then you figure out what is wrong. no luck...  so in my short experience as a first time audi owner I have only been given run around on a car with clear issues and horrible repair work (dealer even washed the car immediately after their repair shop did a paint job (you don't wash and wax a car with fresh paint until it cures- at least 20-30 days, sunny side audi should know this).  anyway, each department sends me back to the next with no guarantee.  I've had a rental car for a total of 2-3 weeks in year.  Ive not had any resolution.  I will come back and post  a VIN if anyone purchases this vehicle and has problems which aren't disclosed at purchase,  audi america is aware, dealership is aware and you should get an attorney.  if you get this lemon, post a reply on my post and i will get back to you with an email/give you records of incidents so you may use them for recompense.  PS i asked repair shop to make sure carfax is aware, they say they don't report.  nationwide insurance company couldn't give me an answer if they would report the 8k.  caveat emptor but i hope whoever buys this and has problems finds this post.  JUST HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, run around.  but alot of apologies, i.e.    ""we care, we can send you back to"".  I've owned toyota, honda, ford and acura where the buck stops at dealer if any problems.   acura replaced an  600.00 engine part under extended warranty and 2 years after ( no longer in warranty) the same part had an issue,  acura fixed it free of charge under good faith that it was a bad part.  That is service.   AUDI has provided no service other than free rental cars and offer to sell me more stuff to maybe fix it.",1

I do wish a backup camera option would have been included, but I like how the car feels and drives.  So far, I have had no major issues and have just done regular maintenance.  I have found that tire rotation is necessary every 5k miles or the rear tires will wear out much faster than those on the front.

Once I got the car back the EPC light started coming on and I lose power while trying to accelerate.  At other times when I accelerate the car loses power without the EPC light coming on. I took it back to the dealer and I'm going on day three with still no answers.  I only have 12,000 miles on this car and I shouldn't be having these huge problems.  I love the look, comfort and feel of my car. When it's running I love it, but I am VERY concerned that i will continue to have problems with the car.

I bought the most tricked out model with driver assist, auto braking, etc/. No one -- I repeat -- no one does driver friendly technology the way Audi does. It's one of the reasons I love the brand. Every time I drive my husband's Mercedes, I cringe at having to deal with an illogical navigation system.  I love the car's handling with the exception that it can be a bit trickier than my A4 on curves - perhaps because of the more narrow wheel base. The reason I say that a little more testing with women drivers would have been helpful is because the car lacks a couple of features that a woman will notice. Unlike my A4, the A3 does not have the automatic seat settings so every time I get in the car after having it valet parked, I inevitably have to move the seat back in position. But the thing that drives me absolutely nuts is that the A3 offers ONLY the options of having a driver's door open with the keyless OR all 4 doors. Gentleman - what exactly do you think a lady does with her larger size handbag? Hint: we do not hike it over the console!!!! We put it in the back seat, which means that you should have offered the setting to open only the two doors on the driver's side or allow the doors to open independently. Now, I have no choice but to use the 4-door setting, which makes me more vulnerable to things like carjacking when I get in my car in a parking garage.",4

It's about a foot shorter than the A4 and feels sportier and quicker since it has the same engine but is smaller and lighter. The interior is definitely up to Audi standards, but the CD player is placed in the glove box, making it useless when the driver is alone (unless you want to drive into a ditch changing a CD!). The handling is sporty, steering seems tighter than the A4, and the car rides just as well as its larger cousin. The engine is quiet and smooth but there seems to be more road noise than the A4, probably due to less sound insulation. Mileage has been impressive, quite a bit better than the A4.  Comfort and space int the front seat seem equal to the A4 but the back is understandably tighter. The bucket seats are firm and comfortable on a long trip. Drove through several snowstorms this winter, and the Quattro all-wheel drive keeps the car feeling secure and planted.

One visit was never recorded with Audi after 7 days of trying to trouble shoot and duplicate the leaking, which they never did get to leak....supposedly.  Took it in twice to a dealer with it physically  and they still said I was imagining things.  REALLY DISAPPOINTING AND VERY FRUSTRATING after I had such high expectations of buying a luxury European car such as Audi AND FOR THE PRICE.  The convertible button is located on the lower console but my puppy (45 pounds) steps on it, it starts rolling up.  One other time he stepped on the power button and the doors locked with my key fob sitting on my seat, he stepped on the lock button on the key fob....glad the windows were down partially and I could reach my key.  Lesson learned there and really pretty stupid of me to leave my puppy in the car to talk to the mailman, but thought they might make it a bit harder than that to lock yourself out.  Surprised the key fob isn't deactivated if detected in the car. Pinch protection on the windows was not working, one day I went to my car after it poured rain for 3 hours and drivers window was down 1/3 of the way and the interior door, seat and floor were soaked. This happened with the passenger rear window as well.  The Audi connect never stayed connected, had to go through a big process every time I tried to use it and log in again and again, with a pin and other annoying login criteria, it was only a 3 month trial.  After that you pay $500/year for the service and as far as I could tell, you only received a satellite image of the navigation, which for that price I am ok with 3D. Navigation seems really outdated even with the most current version....supposedly.  The one thing good about my car is the ride.  I do enjoy the handling and peppy pick up, VERY SLOW acceleration which they say because it has a clutch system, which I thought would be instant. Probably should have saved myself $20k and bought a Beetle convertible - same options and details since they are made by the same company. The convertible is lumpy and creases easily.  Large amount of road noise which I believe is associated with the top leaking since it is not sealing properly.  The Quattro is very nice in the winter. Glitchy annoyances like after closing convertible it turns my heater on full blast and it's 90 degrees out. If you switch from radio screen to navigation it goes to radio stations in the area not the presets that it was on so you have to switch back and hit the preset button again.  I could go on and on......I would pass if I were you!!",3

I was leery about getting another VW product after being burned with issues galore by two late 90's-era Jettas and my 2004 Passat, but that was a long time ago and I had recently read that Audi reliability was #3 or #4 out of all brands, so I took a leap o' faith. It's been a month, and so far, I have been VERY impressed. I actually have the 1.8T with the Premium Plus package, and it has everything I could ever want-heated seats, Nav (which comes with a free 6 month subscription to AT&T that turns the car into a rolling hotspot and links the Nav up to Google Earth-which is pure awesomeness), Dual Climate AC, and the best part of all-the Bang & Olufsen stereo-which truly is ""banging'"". I had the Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade in my 328, and I didn't think it was possible-but the B & O system is way better! Thus far everything is working as it should-no interior lights have burned out nor interior trim pieces have broken off, a la my previous VW's.I recently broke the car in on a Cannonball run to West Texas-6 hours in the car and the seats still felt comfortable. The car is rock-steady at 90-100 MPH, and passing power is more than ample.  My only complaints are sometimes there is excessive road noise (dependent on the road surface, of course)-but I believe this is due to the lower-profile optional 18-inch 10 spokes that I have on my car. Also, due to these tires, you can feel more imperfections in the road, and I don't like the way the brakes feel when braking with these tires, either.The car is small, but it's designed to be a small car so I'm really surprised when people say the trunk space and backseat are inadequate. Duh. I have no kids so it's a perfect size-my BMW was actually too big for my preferences. The gas tank is relatively small, so I find myself filling up more only due to its size (I think 12 or 13 gallons max) and not due to bad fuel economy-in the traffic hell that is Austin I still average 28 MPG. This car is right-sized with very sophisticated styling that pictures don't do justice.

My last Jetta cost 14 grand less and had heated seats.And the big gripe:   You cannot move the or extend the sun visors.  In other words, if the sun is coming at you from the side and you position the the visor to your left while driving, there is a huge 7 inch gap,  which cannot be blocked because the visor will not slide in or out.   Again, even the cheaper Jetta could do that.Very annoying.Oh, and the GPS system is fairly useless, and will be expensive to update, and event which can only occur once per year???!!!

Functionality: the NAVIGATION is THE PITS. First of all it doesn't recognize many street addresses, businesses and locations. It doesn't take into account traffic- I live in LA so it's useless and it gives you random hazard alerts that are hundreds of miles away- there is no way to program this. In short, the navigation is 100% USELESS and I am forced to use Wayz every time I get  in my car. BLUETOOTH: NOBODY CAN HEAR WHEN I TALK ON THE PHONE USING MY BLUETOOTH.  I have to move my head close to the speaker and shout into it. Other issues: the car doesn't come or even make an emergency spare key (usually plastic) so if you surf, don't want the valet to have access to everything in your trunk, or are sporty it's a huge inconvenience- the only option is carrying a very bulky metal key.Positives: the trunk has hooks which are great for grocery bags.

It was a terrible purchase, even at a price I thought was great. It was leaking coolant the third day home, and required over $5k in repairs the first year. It was out of warranty, buyer beware, etc. I still like the car. It is expensive to fix, but when it is good, it is really good. Nothing cruises at highway speeds like a German car. Plenty of power, even on a high mileage engine. One thing I learned during the first year of ownership is this: don't take it to a dealership for service, period. You will overpay, in a ridiculous way. Example: bent rim, new wheel: $825. Really. I bought four new wheels and tires on tirerack.com for a hundred more than that, and they were lighter rims, and look better. That is just one example. The best thing you can do is learn to do your own maintenance/repairs and be vigilant. Read the online forums and watch the youtube tutorials. You will have to buy all new tools with a german car though. It is nothing like an American or Japanese car, which I have previously owned. Lots of starbolt fasteners. Even the wheels are held on by lugbolts (17mm) instead of lugnuts, which freaked me out the first time I rotated the tires. Most used car ownership experiences have a few repairs involved, especially once you break six figures on the odometer. For an Audi/Volkswagen, the parts are expensive and the service at the dealership is outrageous. I suppose I knew that going in, but that first year was rough.The interior is holding up pretty well and it looks like a much newer car than it is. The front seats are supportive and comfortable even on long road trips. The leather has held up well with a minimum amount of creasing and no cracks. The seatback on the passenger side did randomly detach at one point, but I was able to fix it with a pair of pliers and some glue. The navigation system is one of the least user friendly I have ever used, with a very cumbersome amount of effort to program a destination. It works fine once you get it programmed I guess, but I just navigate on my phone to avoid the headache. The bluetooth is easy to program at least, but it doesn't stream audio to the radio. The system does have an input for an aux cord though, and my wife likes the satellite radio. The sound is great.The performance is the best part about the car. It is a GTI in a fancy suit. Plenty of power to keep the driver entertained and with the S-line sport package you get great steering feel and confidence during cornering. Under aggressive acceleration I get a lot of wheel slip, which is the only gripe I have. Even with grippy summer tires, you have to baby the throttle a little bit. Most drivers probably aren't as lead footed as I am though, so it may not be an issue for most. The transmission is as high end as I have ever driven (manual), with smooth clutch engagement and a shifter that slides into gear like a hot knife through butter - so smooth. It feels very refined, but is every bit the sport hatchback when you want to play.The exterior of the car has also held up very well. The paint is still glossy like new. The styling on this car was well ahead of its time, and it doesn't look even a little dated. My wife fell in love with it because of the looks, and she hates hatchbacks. I get compliments on it all the time.You take the good with the bad. The Audi has been a bittersweet ownership experience. Sweet to drive but bitter to keep it running.",4

Able to push it a bit and diesel torque is evident.  Combined mileage at about 35 mpg, highway over 45.  If the reliability holds up -- so far, so good -- will likely sell my second car ('98 BMW540).  Couldn't be happier but am looking forward to an A4 wagon with diesel.  More wheelbase, more power.

The A3 is amazing and so beyond all I could ask for.  It is very upscale inside and out.  The mpg is excellent and the torque is a thrill.  The Ipod interface allows me to have a lot of CD's in an organized fashion, and the Bose sound is so clear and deep.  The Navigation has real time traffic and a crisp and clear screen.  I love the LED lights front and back.  The car in Ibis white looks very European, especially with the black open sky roof.  The transmission feels like a manual without all the work.  Storage room is a little better than the Prius.  I highly recommend the A3 TDI for MPG as well as practicality.",5

Has the active headlight option where the lights are just ahead of your turns. It is also the S-Line quattro with 18 inch fancy wheels. Has things and functions if not used on a regular basis, one has to get out the book to remember what does what. Everything still works fine. Perhaps one of the most fun things is being able to put the rear seats down for hauling a family of dogs or whatever.  Excellent road car, but not the best mileage. can achieve 30 mpg if one does not go over about 68 MPH.  They only put six forward gears in this racing transmission.  They now have seven to eight gears in the new Audi models.  At highway speeds the motor should not be turning more than about 2000 RPM's.  Would prefer about 1750 @ 70-75 MPH.

I felt the same way when I chose my VW GTI VR6 over the 1.8T a few years back.  Steady power from the very low RPMs.  Beyond that, the build quality is great, the nav system is awesome, and I'm smiling!",4.875

Put that together with the supreb handling, unparalleled Audi cabin, and high fit and finish overall, and you have one sweet little ride.

I had a VW Polo before that I really loved and this Audi rides even better (sure more power, better transmission....). My biggest concern about this car is the transmission while maneuvering. most specifically when shifting from Reverse to Drive, it always makes a funny noise and you can feel that something went wrong. After a while you get used to it and if you are patient enough to wait 3 seconds it wont happen. I was really surprise that nobody reported this issue on the previous reviews. Different from what most people say about not using the back seat, I have a 19 months baby that loves to ride with the top down. Yes, space is limited but you have to keep that in mind and use a larger car on longer trips. The quality of the materials are SUPERB!! Everything is extremely easy to use and perfectly located. Driving it on back roads is an awesome and relaxing experience. The short wheelbase, powerful engine and excellent suspension makes you feel like you are driving a Formula 1. It hugs the asphalt on every curve and the feedback from the steering wheel is outstanding. This is my 2nd year with the car and I'm loving everything about it.",5

The ride is quiet, sufficiently powerful and ""luxury smooth."" The standard leather seats are very comfortable. The inside is laid out thoughtfully and everything is accessed conveniently. Car is quite handsome with top up or down and the convertible top is incredibly easy to operate in all respects. The Audi 3 seems to have all the latest technology---as much as I could possibly need and deal with. The ability to leave my iPod home and enjoy all my music from a custom-loaded, tiny sound card is just one of the many very nice little extras I discovered after buying this car.The windscreen is a great standard feature that is remarkably effective in minimizing the wind inside the cabin---wife thankfully no longer needs to put the windows up when the top is down in order to protect her hairdo. Only oddity is that power seats are not available at any price---no problem for us, though, since I am pretty much the only driver. The car is a bit pricey but the quality seems to be there and I've learned that you get only what you pay for. Thus, I'm confident this A3 cabriolet will be a durable and reliable car for us for many years to come. It is truly a pleasure to drive and I'm quite proud to be seen in it.     Twenty Months Post Purchase: I’ve now owned this car for about 20 months and my opinion, above, is confirmed by my 20 months of ownership. One caveat to my opinion: My Audi is stored throughout the winter months. Therefore, my experience is based upon May through November driving, only. I can’t comment on winter performance.       Also, the complementary service included with the purchase of this car is minimal, at least when I purchased it. Only the first oil change is complementary and prices for everything at Audi are quite steep, as they are with most Euro luxury brands.      Nevertheless, all things considered, I’d buy this car again and continue to be very proud of it and pleased with it.      Updating today, 7/2/2018, after two years and a few months of ownership. I store the car in winter and drive sparingly in summer. Thus, barely 5,000 miles on odometer. That said, no problems at all. Still enjoying the car very much. Totally reliable. Learning of its oddities, like when you drop the top, the windows automatically go up, not down! When you play music from the SD card, you have re-check the shuffle option every time you turn the engine off and re-start. You have to spend money to change the brake fluid after two years, even though you have only 4500 miles on the car? Other than such oddities, I'm perfectly pleased with the car and plan to keep it either until things begin to act up or the styling changes significantly. Rumor has it that this A3 cabriolet model and the A5 cabriolet will soon be discontinued and a new A4 convertible will replace both of them. My guess is that if this happens at all, it won't be for at least a few years. Then, I'll probably get the new model. But for now, I'm perfectly pleased with this beautiful red convertible.",5

When I bought this car I was so excited since it was beautiful and such a great deal. However, as sad as I am to admit it, the car has some major flaws. You wouldn't think there'd be blind spots in this car, but they're extremely dangerous. They designed the side mirrors to look sleek and sporty, but they're so small you can't see much at all. I had to purchase stick-on blind spot mirrors in order to be able to switch lanes. Anyone that drives my car has the same complaint. Also, the wipers don't go hardly fast enough in the rain. There's been times I've had to pull over because I couldn't see in a normal rainstorm. I never had this problem with my past Audis. Also, within the first year it broke down three times and had to go back to Audi to be fixed. The turbo leaked into the engine, a pipe started disintegrating, and a spark plug clogged - all within the first year. I leased the car so Audi fixed it for free but the fact that these many problems occurred when the car was brand new was extremely concerning. Otherwise the car does drive very well and gets decent mpg. I drive mostly highway to work each day and the mpg is from 30-33. The entertainment system and climate control are also great.

I bought a 2.0 Quattro Premium Plus with the sport package, and it accelerates much better than I expected, nearly as well as my S4 did (being smaller and much lighter helps in that regard). As one expects of Audi, the fit and finish, inside and out, is excellent. As far as driving dynamics are concerned, it is very responsive and nimble, feeling much like my Porsche Boxster.Given its smaller size, it may not suit those who have to carry a lot of cargo, or those who have to carry more than one passenger.

2146, on 03/19/16 07:44 AM (PDT),Jeremy ,2008 Audi A3 Wagon 3.2 quattro 4dr Wagon AWD (3.2L 6cyl 6A),Most FUN car EVER!," In my years of owning different cars, one car stands out as the most practical, the most fun, and provides the most absolute joy when driving. That one car is my 2008 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro with DSG. I have gone from (in order of ownership) 87 BMW 325iC to 99 Audi A4 2.8 Quattro to 02 Audi A4 1.8T Quattro to 05 Audi S4 Cabrio to 08 BMW Z4 Coupe (Sunday car) and 08 Audi A3 3.2 Quattro DSG (everyday car), owning the last two the same time. I was a bit torn deciding between the Z4 and A3 before I moved to Chicago. I decided I just need one car so I had to sell one of the two. Needless to say, I sold the Z4 and decided to keep the A3. Sure the Z4 was sexier, faster, and just had more prestige maybe for the lack of a better word, but overall, I simply thought the A3 was just the car to keep. I am glad I did. I didn't want to regret giving up the A3 again. Rewind back to 2009, I actually owned a 2007 A3 3.2 Quattro DSG in 2007. After two years, Audi offered to buy it back from me, so I did sell it to Audi. It was a mistake because I really missed that car shortly after. And in the U.S. production stopped that year. So I went looking for another but none available -- not the A3 3.2 Quattro. So for some time I had the 08 BMW and I got myself a Subaru Tribeca as my everyday car. By chance I went looking for another A3 again in 2012 and found my now 08 Audi A3. Hallelujah!This Audi A3 is pure joy to drive. I have gotten out -- without digging around the car first -- of 19 inches of snow here in Chicago in the Blizzard of Super Bowl 2015; I have taken corners in this car that I probably would not dare take in any other car; I have gone up a circular freeway on-ramp at high speed enough to scare (and impress) my friend while he hung on for dear life to the ""Oh Sh!+"" handle; I have passed many cars on an uphill climb without the engine gasping for air. And what's another thing that makes this car such a delight to drive? It's that buttery and silky smooth dual sequential gearbox (DSG). Whether I'm driving in automatic mode, or sport mode, or manual with the option to switch gears with the stick or paddle shifters, the double-clutch transmission is so silky smooth and quick shifting up and down.

Poor to maintain.," We bought 2008 A3 in 2015 with only 27000 miles on it.It is FUN to drive! It feels like a race horse wishing to run!  This thing is made for highway driving. It's ability to accelerate and maneuver is the best I have ever felt.  That said, it is annoying to drive in city. The least little bit of pressure on accelerator causes it to jump, sometimes too far too fast!It is very uncomfortable / awkard to get in and out of, and I am an average size American guy (5'8, 200 lbs).  The worst aspect is the inability to find qualified, reliable mechanics who are willing to work on the vehicle.   I have owned Ford, Isuzu, Honda,  and Toyotas.  I never had an issue with find qualified mechanics with those brands. Here, it took awhile to find one outside of a dealership.  Audi has a management software that few mechanics have access to, and I live in south Florida, not middle of nowhere Montana, North Dakota,  etc.!Also, due to low profile,  going over any railroad tracks or potholes can be annoying at best, or expensive at worst. We went over one, and fractured the radiator support, which needed to be replaced.  I saw later that it was made completely of plastic!  How cheap!  A front-end structural support made of plastic,  how cheap on Audi!",4

The A3, being based on the GTI, should be fun-to-drive, and come with nice Audi touches, so I thought this was the car for me. The Audi comfort touches are all there, but sadly, the fun-to-drive was not. The major problem is that in Drive mode, the DSG transmission like to conserve fuel, so it keeps rpm low (1500rpm). This means that when you need power, it takes a long second or two to kick down 2-3 gears to get going, which really really kills the fun-to-drive factor.

Rides great on the highway but too ""loose"" in the city.  I have had several problems with my car and am just glad it is under warranty (though a new battery is not covered). My battery completely died after two years.  The clip for the sunshade on the Open Sky system broke (as is common) and was replaced by a non-matching black clip (interior is grey).  At 21,500 miles, my manual transmission broke where 1st gear and reverse did not work.  My car is currently in the shop (over one week now) and Audi is going to replace the transmission since they are afraid the problem could spread to the other gears if they rebuild it.  ",2.5

It has been to Northern Michigan during the winter ( ESP worked very well )and the summer  A/C worked very well . Average mileage winter/ summer is about 23 mpg city and about 28 / 29 highway. In the winter we have seen 32 mpg on a round trip to Atlanta and on a trip to North Carolina we saw about 28 . Very comfortable on a long trip. In town as an errand vehicle the car has been very handy.  Parking is a breeze and even in summer with the AC running ( as in right now ) we get about 21 in town  day to day stop and go. The warranty on the 2006 was handy with the sunshade and the AC needing repair as well as the oil change and service intervals. ,4.625

I couldn't be happier. It is a phenomenal vehicle, and all for under 30k. It all starts with the engine. The 2.0T is a great powerplant, and I love the short throws on my 6 speed manual transmission. The low end torque really gets the car going. The steering is very responsive and the ride is very stable. It is such a blast to drive. It is a coin flip between this A3 and a 323i as the best driving cars I have ever owned.  The quality of the interior build is much better than the BMWs I have just come out of (a 323i then 530i). The fuel economy is not bad (25mpg for me) for such a fun car to drive",4.875

Considering the performance, the springs should be a little harder, I replaced them and I am very happy now.  The other issue. Mankind has been building cars since 1908, you think by now we could wash the engine with a hose pipe and not damage the engine. Well maybe I am wrong, so I did, and it cost me $180. Do not wash the engine with water. Otherwise really a great car. ",5

I must confess with a stable of alternatives I often find myself firing up the little Hatchback as a prefered choice.  Imagine that!  This vehicle hits the bullseye like Willy Tell.

Also had to have a relay replaced since the car would not go above 30! Aside from that drove it across country and it was great and lots and lots of fun.    We just got in a serious accident in it and walked away with only minor injuries from the airbag propellant. This car might have saved our lives.

Got everything except nav and Bluetooth; the car is a pleasure to tool around in with precise handling, brakes, low road-noise and comfortable seating.

OK for 21/2 years 15K miles, then problems began. 18 months of a slow coolant leak which dealer could not find. Had to keep a gallon of coolant with me at all times. Finally, after warranty expired, the dealer replaced the water pump to cure the problem. Wanted to charge me for it. After pointing out that it had been in three times over the past 18 months, they decided it was under warranty. Now with 55K miles, the waste gate regulation valve on the turbo has failed, along with a pressure line to the turbo (I previously owned a Jetta TDI, given to my son, whose turbo failed at 46K miles - this failure occurred after I had bought the Audi). So far, up to about $1500 in repairs on a car with has lost 20% of its value due to the emissions shenanigans. I am waiting to see if Audi will offer to buy it back. A recent court settlement calls for them to buy back the older TDI's on the road and ""repair"" (read destroy the good mileage) the newer ones. Needless to say, THIS IS MY LAST VW/AUDI PRODUCT.Addendum 12/16: Audi will buy back the car at the end of this month. While it seems to be running OK after two 10-day long visits to the shop, the check engine light came on shortly after the $1500 repair to the waste gate, with the same error code! The dealer said ""we would be glad to take a look at it."" I asked if that meant (like after the first repair failed) they would charge $135 per hour to diagnose it. They said they would diagnose it to the tune of $500 worth. I did not take it in, as I will not put any more money into it. I am letting it sit in the garage until the buy back in two weeks. Audi and particularly my local dealership are awful.",1

It looks great, gets above average gas mileage and I thought it was going to be dependable...I was absolutely incorrect and it has cost me a significant amount of money!  The warranty expired at 50k, which is when the major system began to fail.  First it was the motor in the seat...not a huge deal, but it was expensive.  Next the A/C compressor failed, an issue that Audi is aware of and has issued a service advisory about, but without a warranty, one that I had to pay for.  Finally the Turbo charger failed. At this rate it will have all new parts before it hits 60k.  This car is crap and Audi should be ashamed that they built it.  ",3.625

I hated to trade it but decided I wanted all the technology and driver assist offered in the newer models.  Waited through the periods of no gas sport backs imported into the US, then the ""clean"" diesel debacle, then waited to see how the e-tron worked out.  It's a 10.  Admittedly I had to get used to the fact that the 1.4 is a very different drive than my old 3.2.  That engine was amazing, but in truth it was a way more powerful car than I really needed or used, although the drive was great fun, but the nav was a CD that only knew the roads up to 2008.  (a CD!)  I've had the e-tron (Prestige trim) for 6 months, love it.  Got the Bosch charger for the garage and total charge in 2 hours.  My electric bill is unchanged.  My mileage is far better than advertised. I consistently get close to 30 mpg on the charge, and even when I use both gas and electric I get 75 mpg in normal conditions, and over 50 even in stop and go nightmare traffic.  Admittedly, I am a pretty chill driver, but I deal with LA traffic periodically and still get great mileage.  The comfort is great - the backseat is a little tight for long distances but totally adequate for around town.  And the back is as luxury as the front.  Another improvement is that the closed moon roof filters more light than it did in my old 2008, which in southern California is a good thing. The versatility of the A3 is what sells me - the hatchback turns the small car into a truck - pop down the back seats and the cargo space is amazing - I can fit bikes, furniture, large cartons, just about anything in there.  For groceries etc the cargo space without pushing down the seats is more than adequate.",5

End 6/18 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM),Fun and practical," I was at the end of my lease with a BMW i3 REX and I needed something a bit bigger. I looked at 7 cars, from BMW 330e to Ford Fusion plug-in and Honda Clarity Plug-in. I read all the reviews and watched many you tube videos where people were raving about their plug-ins. Then I test drove all of them (couple of times!) Let me tell you this, you can’t get all the features on any car unless you have something custom built for you. But after balancing it all and look at all the pros and cons, e-tron was the logical choice. I have driven it few days now and I love it. Coming from an i3 I was worried that I would be sitting lower to the ground. No problem. The car has so many great qualities that I quickly forgot about sitting low. Electric range is lower than i3. If you need more electric range, you should look at Honda Clarity Plug in or i3 REX. Small compartments could get a revisit as there are not many. Was that the deciding factor? Not really. The other thing: if you want Navigation the price jumps by about 7000 as it only comes in expensive packages. I chose to go without Navi and enjoy the craftsmanship Audi has done on the car. I am interested to see what other people say in their reviews as I did not see any at the time of my posting. Love my A3 e-tron.",5

Running purely on gas it appears to be in the region of 40 - 45 mpg.  The rid is pure Audi - very quick and secure.

The tires are wearing quicker than I would have expected (Contiental EcoPro?) but other than that no issues. Charging cable issue went away, and dealer can't duplicate the minor cold squeaking issue yet, but there are 20K miles of warranty left. Fuel economy was the same, just over 50mpg combined with 49% battery and 51% gas, we did several  long 11 hour drives. Looking at the resale value, it has dipped quite a bit for the 3rd year, which what Edmunds predicted, my guess it would increase (less depreciation)  as the price of gas goes up and people get rid of SUV's. Overall we are still satisfied with the car.Update January 2018Have owned the car 13 Months and it now has 17000 miles. The car is charged nightly and averages a little over 52 MPG overall with the the MMI indicating a little over 51% gas motor/49% electric motor. The car has two issues that need too be addressed in a service appointment next week. First the front end creaks and squeaks over bumps, especially noticeable when slow. Second, there is an issue with either the charging cable or the charging system as intermittently the car will only partially charge after being plugged in,  to about 1/2 charge. Overall, we still like the car and find it a good value, and cancelled out Tesla M3 reservation.Update  July 2017Have owned the car for 7 months and driven it 5500 miles. The car has been trouble free and the only warranty issue was the side assist computer was inoperative when I bought the car, and the dealer it fixed with no issue. With mixed driving and plugging in at home nightly and we are averaging over 60 mpg. On battery charge alone we average 18-20 miles.  I would not recommend purchasing a level 2 charger for you home as the Audi supplied charger completely recharges in 8 hours. We found a very nice aluminum wall mount that fits the Audi Charger perfectly for $100 on Etsy. We really like the car, especially the adaptive cruise control and lane assist warning. It's very quiet and comfortable. The audio system is first rate. (B&O). The navigation interface (MMI) takes some getting used to. The car had a 6 month trial for the Audi Connect, and I let it expire. The car never loaded the destinations properly from the phone app, and I can't see paying $10 plus a month for google maps. Hopefully with the next version of the software the app and interface will get better. We have a reservation for a Tesla Model 3, and this was to be the bridge car. Welike the Audi enough to consider not getting the Tesla.Original ReviewPurchased a used A3 e-Tron lease turn in a little over a month ago with 3300 miles. This is my first Audi. It is a very nice car, and so far a good value, especially since the used price reflects the first owners receiving federal and state tax credits. The car is very quiet, comfortable, handles well and efficient. I only have limited access to plug in charging, so I charge it about 3 times per week. With a full charge I normally get 13-17 miles on pure EV mode and in hybrid mode average about 41MPG. The last tank combining 4 plug in charges and a full tank, it averaged just over 51 mpg with mixed hwy (75%)/city (25%) driving. Its not the EPA advertised 83mpgE, but is what I expected based on the reviews I read. I agree as other reviewers have said, if your daily commute is over the pure EV range, just put it in hybrid mode to maximize your plug in charges. The ability to select charge mode at the end a long trip to use EV mode for city commuting, a feature that I heard was discontinued on the 2017 model is also a plus. I also like the clean simpleness of the interior layout and minimizing of buttons, especially the placement of the radio on/off/volume/track select button on the lower console. This car has the adaptive cruise control and pre collision braking, both which are awesome and worth the extra price! The items which I am not so impressed with are the B&O sound system and Audi Connect. The sound system is adequate, but lacks the bass response that my other vehicles have (Bose). The e-tron does not offer memory seats/mirrors which was disappointing since it was the highest Prestige trim level. I still cannot get the Audi Connect App to fully work after talking with the courteous and helpful Audi phone people twice. It wont push directions to the NAV and wont display all the Audi Connect features, nor remotely turn on the A/C. The Nav screen is adequate, but frustrating at times to use the wheel interface to input destinations. Since this car is new tech for VW/Audi, I would recommend purchasing the extended warranty and prepaid maintenance plans. Overall, I am satisfied with the car.",4
2317, on 11/10/16 20:55 PM (PST),George A ,2016 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron Hatchback 1.4 TFSI PHEV Premium 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM),What is the TRUE Mileage of the Audi eTron," I'd like to share with you my experience with the mileage of my Audi A3 eTron. This is similar to what I wrote on Yelp a couple of weeks ago. I'm giving this review 1 star because the car did not meet my mileage expectation for a plugin-hybrid car. I purchased my 2016 Audi A3 eTron around 6 months ago hoping that I can:  1. continue to be motivated to support our planet by going electric / hybrid; 2. get the best gas mileage (savings) with a powerful car; and, 3. get the carpool lane sticker. So given my first 2 goals, I thought that I ""upgraded"" when I changed my Toyota Prius to the Audi A3 eTron. I was totally misled by the advertising of this plug-in hybrid car. And now I'm beginning to think that I actually made a ""downgrade."" AUDI USA claims that the A3 eTron can run 83 miles per gallon on hybrid mode. This number 83 was on the window sticker when I got the car. And the salesman also told me that the eTron can go 83 miles per gallon on gas + electric mode. First thing that came in my mind is the huge savings that I can get considering that my Hybrid Prius can only deliver around 48 miles per gallon (Toyota claims that the Prius can go 52 miles). Second thing that came in my skeptical mind is not to believe the advertising. So given my experience with my Prius, I thought that if AUDI USA would put a claim of 83 miles, maybe they really meant around 75 miles (given a 10% error on their estimate). But 75 miles per gallon is still huge savings. Third, if one of my objectives is to save money, then why consider buying a ""luxury"" or high end car. Why not just settle with a Prius? or a Volt? Just because I purchased a more expensive car does not mean I waive my rights to complain about its mileage. The advertising still says 83 miles. And so I purchased my AUDI A3 eTron at Audi San Diego in Miramar Road. Don't get me wrong. It is a great car. Its just that it cannot run 83 miles per gallon on hybrid mode as claimed by AUDI USA. Why? I'm still unclear about the explanation given to me by Audi San Diego (Valerie from their GM's Office). So I brought my car to the same dealership where I purchased it for service. I asked AUDI San Diego to test my car because I only can get around 45 miles per gallon on hybrid mode. YES! 45 miles not 83 miles not 75 miles! The biggest disconnect for me is that AUDI San Diego service department did not even know that the A3 eTron offers 83 miles per gallon mileage. The sales department is just beside their service department. Perhaps the eTron is still new. The service department said that if I only get around 45 miles per gallon, maybe its because of my driving style and my usage (city/highway/etc). Given I'm the worst driver in the world, my mileage should not be half of what the car claims that it can do. And so I left my car to the dealership so they can test it. And they reported to me that my car can go 44 miles per gallon and not 83 miles as being claimed on their advertising. Valerie from the office of the dealer's General Manager responded to my review at Yelp.com and explained to me that I should be happy with my mileage because based on the report that she got, the eTron should only be running 39 miles per gallon on hybrid mode and my car is running 45 mpg. What confused me is that she quoted and placed the link from plugincars.com. Why she used the explanation from plugincars.com got me confused. Is plugincars.com part of Audi? Does Audi has its own explanation for my concern? She also said that if I have further questions, contact Audi USA. OMG! What is the TRUE Mileage of the Audi eTron - now I don't know.",1

She's wanted a plug-in electric as she has driven hybrids since 2007. We looked at the e-tron and the Volt. She was impressed with the Volt but after driving the e-tron, she said there was no comparison. She has never stated that a car was fun to drive. She did after driving the Audi. To her a car is an appliance.  There is compromises with the e-tron particularly wit the range.  In our case my wife has a 5 mile commute to work.  The 16 miles of electric is sufficient. So far, she has ranged from a low of 16 miles, (90+ degrees out, AC running non-stop) to 23 miles (70 out, minimal AC). On a trip from our home in Hershey Pa to Charlottesville, VA we ran it on hybrid mode and got 42 mpg. Other than that road trip, she's not needed gas. It's been 4 weeks since we last filled it, driven 400 miles and it's still on Full. If the etron fits your needs - buy it! If you need more range, then the Volt is an excellent car too. In our case, with a short daily commute, the Audi is a perfect fit. With discounts, credits etc. we are in for $37k on the Audi versus $35k for the Volt. But we got power seats & moon roof for that difference in price.Update - We took a road trip from Hershey PA to Hackettstown, NJ.  Approx. 100 mi. each way.  We averaged 45 mpg running in Hybrid mode.  We've now learned all the nuances of the selectable driving modes.  For road trips, we put it in Hybrid mode to optimize the gas/electric mileage.  For the daily commute, she leaves it in the default EV (electric only) and runs without the gas engine.  Update 8 months of ownership - First off the gas engine's turbo blew at 3500 mi.  Not a good sign.  We've had it back awhile but since my wife uses it mostly on electroc it hasn't been truly tested.  As for the electric - it's great.  She goes 600-800 miles between gas fill ups due to her short work commutes. She's averaging 89.0 mpg! Great little car.  Now let's see.Great car that fits our needs perfectly!Update 18 months of ownership - the car has been perfect since the turbo issue.  It's extremel reliable gets great mileage.  My wife is up to 110 mpg since she can commute to work and back on electric.  The interior is still perfect.  The handling rock solid. My wife loves this car like none before it.  She loves to drive it.  She has said she'll get a new one when she's ready.  Great car that fits our needs.",5

The dealer had to order parts from Germany. Apparently U.S. dealers have not received a lot of the parts needed to do anything beyond ordinary maintenance.

When the VW diesel settlement is final, and the 2017 is available, I will probably get one.",5

It took me a couple tanks of gas to figure out how to use the computer system...but now that I understand, the results have been very impressive.  I'm in sales and spend a lot of time on the highway...which is not the best place for a hybrid, but my fuel economy is still 40% better than my diesel.  If I'm taking a short trip, I leave the computer in the default EV mode.  Otherwise, I immediately put the system in the hybrid mode and the computer does a very effective job of balancing the battery and engine use.  With about 5,000 miles on my car, I've been averaging 58 miles per gallon (with a lot of highway driving)....about 20 mpg better than my diesel.  If you only drive highway miles, a hybrid might not be the best choice...but if you're like most people, a hybrid does an amazing job.  This week I've done mostly local driving and I'm averaging around 74 mpg.",5

Handling, acceleration, and comfort are excellent, and I have averaged 82 mpg over the first two years of ownership.  I appreciate the car's simple, understated (non-dorky) appearance, which is something that seems hard to come by in the plug-in segment.  The A3 Etron wasn't cheap to buy, but has been relatively cheap to operate.  I buy a tank of gas every 4-6 weeks, and otherwise run around town on electric most of the time.  The $4,500 tax credit was very nice, also.  Overall, it's a great car, and one I will be happy to own and drive while I wait for the Tesla Model 3.",5
2326, on 03/01/16 10:55 AM (PST),Mark Cusac ,2016 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron Hatchback 1.4 TFSI PHEV Premium 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM),Perfect? No. Good Balance? Yep.," This is my first Audi and first plugin. While there are some things that aren't perfect (I'm looking at you radio/climate system), overall this is a very pleasing car.Who buys this thing? Gas is cheap at the time of this review, so you don't buy an Audi plugin to save money, exactly. Who buys it then is someone who likes the handling and style of the Audi and is willing to pay a bit more for it, but still wants to do the environment a good turn. I doubt they'll sell a lot of these.Still, for me, this car fit the bill. And I'm overall quite pleased. I've had it 2 months and still have over half the original tank of gas in it. I'm averaging around 270 MPG. I do that by managing how I drive and making sure to arrange things to drive on electric as much as I can. This clearly is not something everyone will want to do. For shorter trips and my daily commute, I run all EV. For longer trips, I put it into hybrid mode from the start and let the car decide when to use the battery. Performance: hate to disappoint performance enthusiasts, but I've never floored the car. I bought it for a reason and I stick to that. I have hit it harder in EV mode when I pulled out and misjudged the distance of the car coming. It went to around 60% and I was frankly shocked at the acceleration. This is because when you're driving it 'normally,' it seems to be tuned so that it feels weak. But noooooo, noooo, it's not weak. Cornering-wise, this thing is beyond awesome, but that's coming from a guy who has driven non-Audis before. Hey, it helps my MPG to go around corners without braking, right?I have two main complaints, mainly with the controls. Why can't I switch radio stations without taking my eyes off the road? Seriously, there are like 18 radio controls and they all require me to look at one of two LCD displays. Sorry, but I miss being able to hit button #3 and know that I'll get a certain station. They un-invented that. Second, there seems to be no way to just let clean air vent into the car in the winter. For a plugin, this does make a difference. Using the heater costs me miles. When it's not THAT cold out, I'd rather just vent rather than have a choice between a) fogged windows and b) use my battery to get the vent temp up.If you're looking for a racecar, why are you even reading this? if you're looking for the best plugin hybrid, you should probably go see a Volt. But if you are looking for a way to do a good turn for the environment, to do it in style, and to have some pep when you want to let it loose, this car is worth a look. Is it a good value? Depends. Mine cost around $35K after the Fed rebate. This puts in territory of normal small luxury cars and normal plugin hybrids. I'm not sure I'm 'saving' money exactly with this car, but I am pleased I bought it.Update after a year and a half of ownership: I don't have anything major to change and still think it's a 4 star car. I found that by pulling some tricks and putting in some effort I can boost the mileage I get on electric. But that begs the question: why do I have to work harder to get the most out of my Audi? The reason, as far as I can tell, is that Audi sits in a performance mindset, and for them the electric motor is a way to boost performance, with mileage an afterthought. I mean, car has a sports mode that is easily accessible, but no eco mode at all. That's the main gripe, but overall it's a very versatile and economical car.",4
2327, on 02/20/16 10:22 AM (PST),Mark S ,2016 Audi A3 Sportback e-tron Hatchback 1.4 TFSI PHEV Premium 4dr Hatchback (1.4L 4cyl Turbo gas/electric hybrid 6AM),Poor Hybrid Implementation," We are long term Audi owners.  We traded in the infamous A3 TDI and own A4, A5 and TT.  Honestly, the TDI was a great car.  Too bad it was spewing so much pollution and worse, Audi lied about it by calling it ""clean"".  So now we have an etron.  Although mechanically, this car is great, the software, communications and electronics for the hybrid are so extraordinary poor, I would not recommend this car to anybody.  The benefit of a hybrid, is so you can hopefully reduce your operating cost.  Electric companies provide significant savings for people who can schedule their charging their cars at night and at work.  However, the software and communications for the car must work to make that happen.  Audi's software simply does not work.  Yes, they are aware of the problems.  Yes, they are working on it.  However, after 1.5 months, they still cannot get it working and they have no idea when it will be de-bugged.  Thus, the benefits of having a hybrid simply do not exist with this vehicle.  The other most dangerous problem, is that the RFID keys ""almost"" work.  The etron matches the VIN number to the key.  However, if they do not communicate perfectly, the instrument indicates that it does not recognize the key and wont start.  Unfortunately, it does not do it all of the time.  So we now must carry both sets until they figure out the problem.  Perhaps this car will be ready 2017 or so.  We are fans of Audi, but this car is not ready for Prime Time.  We want our pollution spewing TDI back.",2

My previous car was a 2006 A3 Sportback, the first generation A3 in the US shores. This new car's driving dynamics is very similar to that car, which is a good thing. I do wish that Audi gave it a larger battery because driving in all electric EV mode in this car is very quiet and very satisfying. The 1.4 engine when it turns on is also quiet and more than capable. There were a few internet connection hiccups in the beginning with the e-tron connect service, but that eventually got sorted out.Update:With the warmer months approaching, I'm now able to consistently drive between 20-22 all electric miles (the on board computer usually reads 25-28 AER). The e-tron drives fantastic with just the electric motor. Audi made the right choice by giving it enough juice (85 kW) to pull away from traffic lights and freeway on-ramps on electric power alone. Selecting Hybrid Auto or Sport mode (Hybrid Hold), a driver has access to all 204 HP and 260 ft-lb of torque. One pedal driving with strong regeneration is possible with Sport mode or manual mode on the Tiptronic.e-tron connectivity service can sometimes hiccup. But I believe this is due to Verizon Telematic's finicky signal that is built-in to every e-tron.",4

The S550 is nice, but the S8 just felt like something more special.  The v10 engine (smooth and quiet at normal speeds, and unbelievably poweful and ""baritone"" when you want it to be), and the special ""S"" interior and exterior felt like something a step above the norm.  Even the ride (with the std 20 inch rims) is wonderful in comfort mode... unbelievable given the potholes in my part of the country). I average about 15.5 mpg (70% city/30% highway).

You never feel at the limit or out of shape in the S8 as it seamlessly governs oversteer, understeer and anything else you can throw at it. When I drive the S Class extremely hard, I can get it inside out such that the ESP feels confused.

The engine though can roar to life when desired, and the handling is awesome with any weather condition. I had taken my Shelby GT500 on road trips, and just felt beat up at the end of them. Not so in the Audi RS5. It is the perfect mix of power and refinement. I joke with people that if my Audi S5 and my Shelby had a baby it would be this car.

If you're reading this now you are looking to buy a used one.  So what is it like after 3 years and 35,000 miles?  I still get compliments wherever I go.  The car still feels special when I get in and drive it.  The engine still amazes - remember this is based on an Italian design so there is not a lot of torque or power until the revs build.....  From around 3700 to 8250 redline it is wonderful.  The transmission is one of the better dual clutch automanuals.  Quick shifts in manual and very smooth in automatic.  Handling is good for a big heavy car.  You don't toss it into corners like my Boxster but the grip is pretty amazing and the special differential that the RS5 has actually makes the car very neutral in cornering.   The dynamic/sport mode and comfort mode make this into a very smooth quiet grand touring car or a car that you can have fun with when the road calls to you. The car has aged very well.  The interior still looks brand new and everything works as it did on day one.   I'm thinking that because of the depreciation of German high cost machinery this will be a good deal as a used car.

After nearly two years, I still love it.  It gets about the same fuel mileage as the '08 3.2 A4 (unless you use the extra power the supercharger provides) and it is simply a absolute joy to drive.

I didn't even know what it was until I found it online and did more research. Coming from a 2011 VW GTI with DSG, I figured I was getting in another 1.8/2.0T VAG product. Little did I know, it has a 2.7L V6 with twin K03 turbos. Mine was a well maintained one owner car with the Tiptronic transmission. Reliability? HAHAHAHA what a joke. I have the most random and smallest issues to fix. And as annoying and expensive as this car is, the feeling it delivers with the turn of the key, irreplaceable. It has a 145k miles now and I have done routine service and I would not hesitate to drive it cross country. Quattro? Pulled up a 3800lbs. 90's Lexus SC400 with a welded rear diff up and STEEP incline with two uneven cracked strips of frozen pavement like it was a feather. And pulled a 4x4 Ram 1500 out of mud. All while being slammed to the ground on H&R springs and blown shocks. Transmission is limiting and will be the ONLY reason I sell this car. I want a 6spd. so I can upgrade turbos but even with an APR Stage 1 tune and a Borla catback, this car pulls and through the entire rpm range. Constant power delivery and complete sleeper. And the sound it makes.......absolutely phenomenal. The interior is incredibly simple yet so elegant in its own way. Every  bit of it feels heavy to the touch with a quality finish. Exterior has the timeless design that still fits in today with modern cars on the road. Will I buy this car again? Absolutely, when I'm not a college student. UPDATE: now at 173k been leaking coolant since before I posted this and still runs strong. Took a hit to the passenger side in a wreck and walked away without even wiplash. Will never buy anything but German.",5

A lot of people talk about how expensive the repairs are on this car, which is true. My oil pan cracked about a month ago.

There is so much potential with this car that no other audi except the A6 2.7tt can offer. This engine can handle 400awhp without making any kind of mechanical upgrades to rods or pistons.The Euro RS4 comes stock with k04s and 380hp on the same engine.

So WHY does the S4 feel so lively?Very simple, its all in the gearing!It is running the equivalent of a 4.11 final drive which as any gearhead knows will give you blinding acceleration and instant thrust through the gears at the expense of fuel economy. Which brings me to..2. Fuel economy...TBH I do not find it to be awful, I average 19-20mpg and given the facts on the gearing is about right. Now if we were to swap the gearing to similar to a 1997 vette came with( 2.87, 3.23 or 3.42 if memory serves) you would see a large increase in average mpg, probably 5 to 6 mpg more. But then your highly rewarding impetus would be diminshed, oh well.Please do not get me wrong, I am NOT critical of the car at all, but it is not a miracle motor some claim, just a good old fashioned combination of sound engineering and gearing.Moreover Audi are to be praised for having the corporate balls to build this the way they did although in the mid 2000,s the economic rug if you like had not been pulled out from under the vast majority of Americans.Drive and enjoy, prepare for high maintenance cost and so so fuel economy.",4

And oh, the engine!  It's the finest engine I've ever owned - power and torque and an understated rumble.  It's hard to say how this car could be improved.

It felt a bit heavy at first after driving a sports car for so long but I quickly fell in love with the smooth ride and roomy, well appointed interior. The big car feel and rumbling V8 almost makes it seem like a 60s era muscle car, especially when cruising city streets at low speeds with the top down.  It is also quite practical with a full sized trunk (with top up) and decent sized back seats, making it perfect for a long weekend of road tripping in the country. My wife and both of my parents all fit comfortably for short trips. In short, a well rounded combination of style, luxury, and performance.   ",4.625

I love the slightly lower- key styling (no fins, spoilers, etc.) and the aural excitement from that V- 8.  Handling and performance are both superb.  I've seen many mentions of this car's low gas mileage, but I've been averaging about 23-24 mpg.

Otherwise, it's a very comfortable convertible. It's a much better value than a BMW M3 Convertible, which doesn't even have power seats standard, and a much much better value than the Mercedes-Benz CLK 55, which is $85,000.

I recommend getting all weather tires to rotate onto the car in winter for both performance and economy. Tiny trunk if you put the top down. The cars interior has very little storage.

The powertrain let's you do anything you want.  At 2,000 miles the engine really opens up and becomes even more impressive.  The adaptive transmission in the automatic really adapts to how you are driving, hit the gas and you're gone.  I found a little hesitation of the line, but if you put it in sport mode and turn off the esp traction control, it more than solves the problem.  With the top down the stereo adapts with road noise and is a lot of fun.  The three layered top sounds as quite as a coupe with the top up.

Audi is welcomed to the muscle car category!  I will say that I miss the bi-turbo of my 2001. The bi-turbo is quicker off the line due the turbo and light weight of the V6.

The Audi S4 should not be compared to the BMW M3. They are different and serve different purposes. I had an M3 and now an M5. I can speak to this: S4 - better family car. Better in weather.

AWD is a plus in the Audi, but it still doesnt handle as well as the M3. Reliability - BMW. Comfort Audi, Interior/Exterior - Audi, Fuel - BMW, Both are equal in the other categories.

I chose this car for its more sporting nature than the A6, the more youthful attitude than the Cadillac CTS, and the extra doors relative to the M3.

Coming from 21 years of driving BMWs, I was doing a lot of research on why change. But with technology platforms changing so fast, I wanted to keep an open mind. It was a surprise that Audi S4 came out on top for me after two test drives and a lot of research. Interior, Exterior, performance, and driving comfort.

I came from a 2011 Infinite G37X and while I loved that car, you really cannot compare the two.  The Audi is simply the best vehicle I have ever driven.  My S4 has the Napa leather package and the S Sport package which I highly recommend.  This car handles amazing, it actually feels like there is someone sitting behind me steering my rear wheels while taking turns or curves at a higher speed.  The six piston brakes are awesome also.  Anyone who nit picks the steering, suspension, brakes, transmission or anything else on this car is being ridiculous.  This car is solid all the way around and this review is coming from your everyday guy.  There is nothing I don't love about this car, I look forward to getting into it everyday.

2536, on 08/10/17 04:35 AM (PDT),Twowheelsgood ,2018 Audi S4 Sedan Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),2018 vs 2010 Audi S4 Prestige," After much cross shopping, including the Mercedes C43 AMG, I ended up replacing my 2010 Audi S4 Prestige (7A) with a relatively loaded 2018 S4 (S- Sport and winter packages, 19"" wheels, Dynamic Steering). I've only had it for one week so this just my first impression, which is mixed. What's better in the 2018 S4: suspension (more compliant with no loss of grip); brakes (less grabby with no loss of stopping power); steering (still lacks feel but quicker and more accurate, particularly off center); front seat adjustability; instrument panel; parking & driver aids; headlights; fuel economy. What's better on the 2010 S4: exterior styling (except the lights); throttle response; transmission (DCT); difference in driving experience in different mode settings (comfort, auto, dynamic). It looks like the 2018 wins by a knockout but it doesn't. The new car is really let down by a tendency to bog on initial throttle application. It feels like some combination of poor transmission tuning, a very soft throttle tip-in setup, and some degree of turbo lag. It can be a party pooper and the car doesn't come alive in Dynamic mode they way the old one did. We'll see if the 2018 S4 grows in on over time. I've already discovered that using the paddle shifters helps with throttle response. I've already shifted this car ""manually"" in one week more than I did in the old S4 over seven years.  The  ZF 8-speed in the new S4 responds pretty quickly to the paddles but doesn't cope well with stacked downshift requests. I read that the terrific new 10-speed auto in high performance Chevies drops multiple gears in an instant.  More to follow once my new S4 passs the 1,000 mile break in period.Edmunds asked for an update, so here it is at 5,000 miles (February 2018).  I have warmed up to this car considerably. The performance is sneaky in that very potent acceleration, cornering and braking occur with so little fuss that it's easy to caught out going much faster than appreciated. It reminds me of riding my BMW S1000RR in that regard. What is really impressive is how well a car with this performance deals with slogging on the daily commute. When surrounded by other cars that limit enjoyment, I put the car in Auto or Comfort mode, set the dynamic cruise control (on secondary roads as well as highways) and let the car deal with it while I listen to the excellent B&O sound system.  When conditions and traffic permit, I switch to the Dynamic mode with or without manual shifting and go for it. The steering and handling are excellent and with the sport diff the car actually wants to rotate, which is a rarity in front-engine Audis. The issue of delayed downshifts and throttle response persist but these are largely eliminated when Dynamic and Manual are selected. I think my original disappointment with Dynamic mode was because I followed the recommendations for light throttle inputs during break-in. There is now a distinct difference between modes, Dynamic is very crisp but happily does not cause the ride to become too brittle or edgy. The only other irksome problem I've had so far is a weak HomeLink transmitter. I have to carry the remote in the car because the built-in unit often fails to open or close the garage door. I believe this is because they relocated the transmitter from under the front fascia in the B8 to somewhere in the back end of the car in the B9 version. Indeed, if the HomeLink doesn't get a response when I approach nose-in, I can turn the car around and present the back end to the garage and it will work. But that's tiresome so I keep the remote in the car. Seems a dumb fault in $65K luxury sedan. I had no such problem with by B8 S4 or with my '14 Audi Q5 TDI. So as you can see, I have warmed up considerably to this car and would strongly recommend it to any enthusiast who wants a 4-season sport sedan that copes equally well with felonious speeds and daily driving. Every time I get in the car I look forward to driving it and the interior, including the virtual cockpit. I have also been saved a few times now by Audi Pre-Sense, Lane Assist and Cross Traffic Assist, so the technology is excellent. At 5,000 miles there have been no mechanical issues with the car and it will easily get 24-25 mpg measured at the pump unless relentlessly flogged in which case it will be in the teens. One last point - when I bought the car I was told by an Audi service manager that the 18"" Audi OEM wheels I used for winter in my B8 S4 would fit the B9. Wrong! These wheels didn't clear the calipers of the new car so I had to buy aftermarket 18s to which I fitted Nokian Hakkas. Not the sportiest winter tire but absolutely the best in terms of stopping and going in snow.",5
2537, on 07/23/17 19:11 PM (PDT),Chris ,2018 Audi S4 Sedan Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Simply Fantastic! Coast to Coast! 2018 S4 Prestige," Coming from a 328i and being a BMW fan in general I was very skeptical, with high expectations, for the S4 and I felt like I was taking a risk when I purchased this car. Looking back, I honestly feel I could not have made a better decision. This car is simply amazing in every way. I recently drove this car coast to coast from New Jersey to San Diego and had plenty of time to break it in. Ride comfort: 40 hours and 2 1/2 days never went so fast... the Quattro handled torrential downpours to aggressive cornering like a dream. Fatigue was not an issue with the 3-way massaging seats! Driving Dynamics: The S4 accelerates like a rocket and handles like a dream at any speed. The different driving modes are critical as road conditions change. I loved how the Dynamic mode handled the winding mountains in the Southwest with ease and the comfort mode was smooth sailing through the various construction work zones across the country. Tech: The high end gizmos in the new Audi's was what finally pushed me away from BMW and towards Audi. The adjustable color heads up display with Navigation and speed sign recognition worked great! Crossing America, I never had to worry about the changes in the speed limit from a high of 75 to a low of 45 in the work zones... The cameras always caught the sign changes. I had never used lane keeping assist before so there was an adjustment period but once I got used to it... it was a blessing. After hours of driving and possible fatigue it felt like you had a guardian angel by your side giving you gentle nudges to keep you on track day or night. Having Navigation on dual screens is quite nice and extremely customizable, especially zoom in/out with the scroll of your thumb. The only negative I have is that the download speeds of the Audi Connect when searching weather or traffic updates was a bit slow but not surprising considering all the digital processing constantly going on with the car. Overall this car is a dream machine that I plan to enjoy for many years to come.",5

Currently have 86000 miles with the original turbos and the car is chipped. You can drive the car hard, but be smart about proper warm-up and cool-down for longevity.

I've always driven sport/luxury cars including Volvo S60 R-Design, Infiniti G35 and G37 Sports and this is one of the best I've had. Crazy fast, the sound and kick in the pants is intoxicating when you bury your right foot and that supercharger kicks in. Interior is one of the nicest and infotainment/MMI is the best for ease of use. If you love music as I do you have to go for the B & O sound system. Two minor complaints; front brakes needed to be done at 22,000 miles and I must be getting old because the seats aren't as comfy after about 2 hours in the car. Up for a replacement this fall and the short list consists of the new Audi S5 Sportback, the Volvo S60 Polestar or the Lincoln MKZ with the 400 hp twin turbo. I know, it's North American but I will know once I have driven it.UPDATE. The car goes back at the end of October and I am going for the Lincoln MKZ with the twin turbo 400 hp AWD. I am impressed with the car, only reason for changing from Audi is the Lincoln is a bit bigger, a bit softer (bad back) and it's maybe just time for a change. I will miss the roar of the Audi when you put your foot into it but the 2018 Audi with the turbo instead of the supercharger is a bit more subdued anyway.UPDATE 3/12/18.

I am very impressed with my s4, thus far 1 unscheduled visit to the dealer to repair a leaking water pump (covered under warranty @46k miles).  I now have over 110k miles.  I went with a ""Stage 1"" software upgrade from Revo when the car hit 50k miles....best bang for the buck upgrade I've ever done.  333hp in stock form to 410hp and torque from 325 ft/lbs to 390 ft/lbs, not only did I get a lot more torque (which is noticeable when overtaking) but my mpg improved as well!  No other issues to report.  I am due to replace my OE clutch.  The ride is stiffer than in the past, I think the shocks are on their way out.  The interior has worn well, no tears on the seats and minimal stretch marks on the leather seats.  The navigation is a tad on the slow side (as others have mentioned).  The car is heavy though and I can definitely feel the heft when I track it.  Because of it's heft, the brakes get worked thoroughly....on the street, you won't notice any brake fade (just on the track).  Tire wear is even, perhaps due to the AWD system, you really don't need performance tires.  The s4 has impressive lateral grip. Fuel economy has dramatically improved from 23.1mpg when new to now I'm consistently getting almost 27mpg (mostly highway driving).  In the 110k history with my s4, I'm on my 4th set of tires (OE Continentals & 3 sets of Pilot Sports), on my 3rd pair of brakes (front), 2nd pair brakes (rear), and 1 headlight bulb replaced (right).

The car looks great, sounds great, drives very well, and is a lot of fun...when it's working.  It is surprisingly spacious for a convertible.  It's powerful but because it's heavy, it rather needs to be...but it accelerates well.  I think it should be all these good things, because it was the most expensive car I've ever bought, and not my first convertible.  I should have listened to friends right after I bought mine - they got a lemon and swore ""Audi - never again.""  For me it's also been, by far, the most trouble of any car I've ever bought.  I saw the problem coming: during warranty period, a small headliner strap disconnected from the convertible top frame - it kept a section of headliner folding with the top.  A bit of superglue might have fixed that.  But no, the official service required a $1000 headliner replacement.  Just after warranty expired, my nice radio had trouble - the antenna broke.  Simple fix, right?  A $1000 replacement - much of the interior of the car needed removal to replace it.  Then, my AC went out.  After numerous trips to the dealer to add coolant, add fluorescent dye to find a leak:  the compressor needed replacement.  Turns out, that's not a minor thing in an Audi.  The dealer quoted $6000.  I didn't do it, so they worked around and ""disabled the compressor"".   Many more small things went out - like the headlight washer system blew a tiny cap - water everywhere; of course they don't sell the caps, only the full $200/light washer.  That's small for Audi.  Recently I started hearing a noise near the engine and took it for diagnosis: $700 just to remove enough for  inspection (from a 3rd party, probably a good price).  Something was throwing bolts out of the engine area!  It turns out, now the broken compressor was disintegrating, and was ready to take out other things too.  So, thousands more, now, forced to even keep the car driveable, and all this on a car with less than 62K miles on it.   AUDI:  Never again.",3

Let me just get the transmission issue out of the way right now.  I don't know why people would get an automatic in a car like the S4.  You're buying a Camry, Impala, or whatever, sure, go with an automatic, who cares, but an Audi with V6 supercharged engine?  The whole point of a car like the S4 is to have some fun, but then you get an automatic with it and you're saying, ""actually, I want to reduce the fun I have with this car.""  What?  Anyway, whatever, just my bias.         Okay, to the car itself -- what a marvelous vehicle.   I did a lot of research on cars in this range, test drove a few, and knew this was the one I wanted.  It took me nearly a year to find a used one in the right color (grey), black optic package (just for the wheels, don't care about extras), with the 6M, and the right price, but when I found it online, I jumped and bought it used with 12K miles and hope to keep it a long time.          Engine and transmission: fantastic, best transmission I've ever driven, engine sounds great, power is there all day long at whatever speed you want.    Spectacular.    Some people (mainly auto critics) complain about not enough ""feedback"" from the steering.  I don't know any better and the steering feels great to me.    This car sticks to the road.  I put Conti ExtremeContact DWS on a few months ago.  They are not quite as sticky as the summer tires that were on, but the very marginal loss of performance in turns is more than offset by the superb all weather capability.  With the Contis and quattro, I am ready for any ice and snow or rain.    Interior and exterior are beautiful, not flashy, very sophisticated.  That's what I wanted.  If you want to show off, get some attention, you may need to look at another car.    Tech:  these are my only nits.  As noted in reviews, the MMI control knob spins in a non-intuitive direction.  Why?  I have no idea.  The MMI interface is good, not great, but good.  Love the dash display, all the options.  Climate control is my least favorite feature.  It works, but it is too complicated, too many buttons.  I am still not 100% positive what I am ending up with when I make certain adjustments.  I can live with it.    The S4 comes with so many other helpful electronic features that I highly recommend you go through the manual page by page to make sure you are aware of them all.  (For example, you can set the passenger side mirror to tilt down when you back up.  Never would have known that.)   You can adjust suspension, engine sound, etc.   In sum, this is a wonderful car.  There are other possibilities in this price/performance range, but I can't imagine anyone ever regretting the S4.  (especially with the 6M transmission!)",5

I decided to do as much as possible myself (I like working on my cars) and after some initial investment in required tools my son and I already changed oil, breaks, disks, sparks plugs, filters, etc - everything strictly according to the maintenance schedule and AUDI torque specs. We use only OEM parts and save about 60-70% compared to our local dealership price. We also had to buy a special cable to re-program the car, reset service reminder, etc. I actually love working on this AUDI, it is very well engineered and it is a pleasure to service it.There is one more thing to know / consider. You should not expect this car to be very economical fuel consumption-wise. It all depends how you drive it - you can get anywhere from 15 to 28 MPG on a highway. Once you floor it, your MPG drops - but the thrill is very well worth it.Highly recommended to those who like quality, sophistication, reliability, technology and speed. This S4 delivers all of that. Good job AUDI!",5

So far, I'm really happy I did. I referred to the Japanese equivalents as semi-luxury because there is a noticeable difference. The fit and finish of the Audi is much nicer than our MDX.

And the Q7 specific tire is apparently unique to the Q7, so getting a replacement in rural areas would involve spending a day or three in Bates Motel accommodations waiting for the new tire. Also, since the tires are more performance rather than high mileage rated, you'll likely buy a pair if the tires are over 15k miles. And the tires are pricey too at $300 to 400.

However, Audi has taken the technology to another level. It is clear that autonomous driving technology is making it's way in to today's models. There are many features that are prefixed with ""assist"", ""adaptive"", ""pre-sense"". They are not just marketing buzzwords but rather features that try and influence the way you drive with the goal of safety and fuel economy in mind. If you do not like this idea then this is not the car for you. Some features cannot be permanently turned off such as auto start/stop which cuts the engine under certain conditions (like at a red light) to save fuel. It is very disconcerting at first especially if you are waiting to make a turn but the engine does start in the time between you lift your foot off the brake and step on the gas. It can be temporarily disabled by pushing a button but it is re-enabled after the car is turned off and on again.

Surprisingly, in less than a month, a sudden annoying beep, repeatedly announcing an Emergency Call Malfunction, terrified us.  After contacting Audi Service, they took the car on November 24th, 2017, and promised to fix it in a day or two, saying they know about 2018 Q7 car defect.  This comment rang a bell in our mind.  If they already know about it, why Audi sell it without fixing it?!  Is this a fair trade?!  After more than 20 days later, Audi did not fix the car.  Going back and forth, finally Audi’s Service Department told us that they could not fix the car, because a part was not received from Germany!  This was not just an irrational excuse; but, also, a gross insult to us for spending over sixty-seven thousand dollars on an Audi car, and receive such poor service!  Is this a fair trade?!  Anyhow, to solve this problem amicably, I told Audi’s Manager either to give us a full refund, or a new similar car.  The latter agreed to provide us a new similar car in a few days.  Alas, Audi did not fulfill its promise, again.  For the benefit of doubt, we gave Audi’s Manager a longer delay; saying we are travelling and will be back around mid- January.  By then, we expect you to give us a similar car, or a full refund.  Sadly, Audi did not fulfill its promise, for the third time.  By definition, a brand-new car means a defect-free car.  Hiding the 2018 Q7 car defect is an act of misleading and dishonesty.  This defect is known by Audi and its dealership since some time.  Yet, Audi did not tell us about it.  Thus, Audi deceived us in selling this car.  Plus, our 2018 Q7 car is considered a lemon car by Federal and State Law.Audi’s Dealership knows that I am a science major and must concentrate on my studies.  Audi wasted our time for three months for no legitimate reason; during which we were – and still are – paying installments, interest, and insurance on a car, which we are not using since last November; because it is in Audi’s possession.  Audi’s dealership has frustrated us, disappointed us, caused us to suffer, and denied us the enjoyment of using our own brand-new car.  By any standard, Audi’s transaction is – unethical and unfair.  Audi’s Director of Variable Operations offered us his apology for causing us this ordeal.  Does he really think that his apology shall alleviate our suffering?!  Based upon the aforesaid trouble, we find it very difficult for us to trust Audi anymore!  We honestly believe that if Audi and its dealership care about their name, business and reputation, they must cancel this deal as well as its loan, immediately; pay us a full refund of our money, including all interest, insurance, and installments we made.",1

2854, on 01/27/18 10:15 AM (PST),Danny ,2018 Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),No spare tire???," I was going to place an order for a fully equipped Prestige Q7 but the night before, while going over the list of features, I discovered the Q7 is not equipped with a spare tire nor is there space to carry one . The next morning I called the tire dealer I generally use, Les Schwab Tires, and was told the 20” tires I was going to have the Q7 equipped would be a special order.  The can of fix a flat and compressor, that is included in lieu of a spare, is only good for 1/4”, or smaller, puncture in the tread of the tire. The fix a flat goop is of no use on a side wall cut which is not an uncommon occurrence on an SUV especially one as capable off road as the Q7.  The run flat tires have a recommended driving range of 50 miles. As I frequently travel in Central Nevada, Idaho and Wyoming, often outside of phone coverage, anyone familiar with these areas is aware that 50 miles is an inconsequential distance in many parts of the West. However if I were to be fortunate enough to be within miles of say Beatty Nevada what are the chances of finding a tire there that I could not find in Denver? The Q7 I was about to order was 93K which is too much to spend for a vehicle that could leave me stranded for something as simple as a flat tire.",4
2855, on 01/10/18 22:17 PM (PST),Mainul ,2018 Audi Q7 SUV 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),I love this SUV," First, the negatives: There are a few things that are a little irritating. I sometimes bump my knee against the dash when getting in. The seat can be adjusted, of course, but when you are in hurry (like when it's raining), I suspect you'd bump your knee. The dash and headlight controls could be pushed a little further in. Also, I sometimes hear some low level vibration in the rear door panels. I think it is more noticeable when my daughter puts her water bottle in the door pocket, but sturdier materials would probably help with the noise. Also the dash panel switches are brushed plastic type things. BMW uses more glossy materials which just look better. But the thing handles like a boss. The acceleration is pretty impressive, even for the 2.0 T. I switch between the Dynamic and Sport mode mostly and performance level change is incredible. Only had this for a month, so reliability questions are not applicable. The seats are spacious and comfortable. The 3rd row can seat average sized adults if needed. The trunk has plenty of space. The panorama roof if beautiful. The cabin lights, exterior lights, and assist lights are thoughtfully designed and soberly placed (not a glaring bright wash of harsh lights when you open the door). The cameras and console display are great. The LCD display on the dash is very useful and adjustable. And the handling! Yes, the handling! All in all, a winner. I'd buy it again!",5

The car is luxurious, holds the road great, and even has a nice smooth ride, SOMETIMES.  If your freeways are often like the freeways in Los Angeles, be prepared to bounce like you're in a U-HAUL, and it's miserable!  It's amazing that such an expensive, high-end SUV, has such a disparity with the drive.  At times, it's so smooth and comfortable, and other times, it's bouncy and horrible.  The head Audi technician brought me a new, identical car to the one we leased, to test drive exactly where I frequent, and it was the same!  Even he was baffled and disappointed as to the ""bounciness"" of the drive.  Just a side note, it's difficult to get into the car without your knee smashing into the dashboard if you're short.  I am 5' 1"" and it took me a few bruises on the knee until I got used to carefully & slowly getting into the car as to not bash myself on the lower portion of the dashboard.

I was assured that the new Q7 will be inspected and will be thoroughly cleaned. . . However, the car was delivered with serious paint defect - heavy pitting on rear quarter panel and tail gate (It looked like chemical that ate the paint.  Deep pitted surfaces).  And, driver side doors are not aligned.  I requested Keyes Audi to replace it with non-defective one or cancel the sale.  The arrogant GM said ""Sorry, it's not going to happen"".  Long story short I was forced to bring in the car (never used).   It took 2 weeks for the brand new 2018 Audi Q7 in the dealership.

Job order:  remove paint from tail gate and rear quarter panel, feather fill and repaint.  It looked OK - but it is not factory process. . . Door alignment never got fixed.

Audi of America is not even doing anything to make up for the defects.  All they do is check the dealership on what they have to say.  And they talk like parrots, kept saying ""Audi will continue work within the terms of any applicable manufacturer's warranty"" when I spoke with them.  Adding more insult, I checked in the car with 53 miles then checked out with almost 30 miles added - GM will not even investigate.

In short, I was forced to accept the car.  In November 2017, I drove the car to Las Vegas on a 4-hour trip.  Halfway my trip, the alarm sounded off.  I immediately made an emergency call to Audi Support Center.  But all they can say is to bring it back to dealership.  Having no other option. We proceeded to our destination.  The car kept beeping every couple of minutes for 2 hours!  On our way home, it still kept beeping the whole duration of the trip (4 hours!).  But the worse part was when we took a detour to Barstow, CA for a short rest, the car just slammed the break by itself and made a hard stop at the freeway off-ramp, then a louder beep sounded off with indicator lights flashing.  It was a very dangerous occurrence.  It is fortunate that it was in an isolated road at that time.  Otherwise, it could have been a serious accident.  I filed another complaint and still no commitment from dealership on my request to replace it.  The car was picked up by dealer for series of checks and repairs (3 week duration).  I finally decided to start a legal remedy and this time Audi USA took me seriously.  I was offered to have a brand new replacement but I changed my mind already and demanded for full refund.  Took couple of months of negotiation.   I got my full refund + customer loyalty $2,500 if I buy another car in the VW group.",2

I won't repeat those. I do think it is important for any potential buyer to understand the increased speed that you will encounter maintenance needs. First, the premature brake squeak is REAL. My brakes began to squeak at 15,000 miles. By 20,600 miles I was told that both my brakes and tires need to be replaced. Majority of my travel is commuting my kids around. Interpret that as you may, I am rather conservative on the road. A simple search will help the consumer understand that this is not unique experience and that there are numerous complaints out there. Audi has no solution in sight.  Had I known about this issue I most certainly would have made another car buying decision.

The second item is the runflat tires.  Audi chose to save weight and space (like many other companies) by eliminating the spare tire.   They commissioned a tire just for just this vehicle resulting in an extreme cost of $528.00 per tire!  The last item is the jack.  The Audi engineers could not find space for the jack anywhere in the vehicle, so it is unsecured in the rear cargo area making it a missile in the event of an accident.

No support from Audi at all just a brand new car 8,000 miles needing tons of repairs. Dealer decided to purchase the vehicle from us and being that the dealer steped-up to help us we decided to give it another try. Leased another 2017 AUDI q7 carbon gray metallic premium plus with warm weather package which meant higher payment and another down payment. Not even 24 hours into the new Q7 we had troubles with the supercharger. Should have known then it was not going to stop there. Center consoles get warped horrible design which leads into the terrible quality of the seats. we leased a Q7 with Warm weather package due to heated/ a/c seats hoping that these seats would wear better. NOPE front driver  seat 2nd row seat and 3rd row seats all need replacement. Drivre side front window needs window regulator slow roll down and noise.Drivers door has a pop sound which we have been trying to chase for 5 months. Have fun trying to close the doors 5x . Oh and don't forget squeaky brakes around 6-9k miles still no fix in site for that.

My car has been into the dealerships for pre sensor issues 5 times.  Service department always stated that they can replicate my issues and the car was driving as is and designed. They reset my car to manufacture twice and adjusted my cameras grasping for some sort of an explanation.    My car stopped me at a turn light and shuts off.  Then it presence went on in bumper to bumper traffic and my seat belt choked back on me when there was no reason to. My fuel injector malfunctioned at 6000 miles.  Because they can't duplicated the concerns, they dubbed the car safe.  As a driver and my car stops for false pretense detection that could put my life at risk and possible a fatal accident.

Even with a captured video, what cannot be duplicated becomes the consumers fault. https://youtu.be/txjonKMic1U  Audi service department could not grasp my problem, so I only got service... but I never got the ease of mind for safety, nor the customer satisfaction that my car was fix and safe to drive.

Let me start off by stating that we did not regret buying the car. We've since taken it for two long distance road trips and we throughly enjoyed this new car: generous space, elegant and comfy cockpit. The building quality is superb. There are some minor issues which are not uncommon for a new model: there was a high-pitch noise coming out of the side mirror at 40MPH+; some of the features do not work consistently (e.g. easy seat entry - the steering column is supposed to retract when the car is switched off); the Nav is not as easy to use as those offered by other manufactures (we had a Lexus RX before whose Nav, despite from 8 years ago, was extremely well designed and easy to use). Having said that, the dealership I bought the car from - at Bridgewater NJ -  is HORRIBLE. The only time they are responsive was at the time of sale. Once the car leaves the lot, you just won't hear from them. I contacted them couple of times for the issues stated above and for the key code they forgot to give to me - which I need for Audi Connect. Never heard from them. I finally drove up to their office, at which point they claimed they fired the service rep who apparently has been stonewalling all their customers. Well, how I wish that was the only bad apple! I had to make another trip to the dealership after I heard nothing from them for many weeks only to be told that they have assigned my case to another rep who conveniently was not in that day. After another few weeks without hearing anything from the ""new"" rep - all the while I was calling their office and even asking Audi US office to help - I had to drive up to the dealership again. This time I asked for the sale manager and told him that I wanted an answer from him directly. This guy, their sale manager, PROMISED to my face, that he would definitely get back to me within a week, ""before next Friday""... Well, Fridays have come and gone and it's been more than a month yet not a single word from anyone at that dealership. Granted, those issues (e.g. missing key code) are mostly annoyance, not exactly life threatening. But you expect  certain service when you buy a $60,000+ car and want to have some trust in the dealership that they will take care of certain problems when needed. It's a shame because honestly we like the car, but the poor customer service has put a huge dent in our enthusiasm and adds a significant doubt as to how long we should hold on to this car.Update 8-2017: The experience with the service department at this dealership has been better than the sales side - yes I have been using their service despite the really bad experience with their sales because of the location and convenience. They are still not as responsive as I would expect when it comes to schedule appointments etc but they do get the job done on time once I get the car in and the folks at the service department are courteous and some of them even go out of their way to help.",4

Today we got a ""safety system error"" yellow light on the dash indicating that the airbag is malfunctioning.  In addition, on 3 occasions the car has literally turned itself off by itself when we place it in park.  This happened one at the aim and twice when switching drivers in front of the house.  I'm not talking about the engine turning off to save fuel, I'm talking about completely off to the point we have to hit start again for the car to reboot.

2900, on 01/17/17 08:36 AM (PST),pensman ,2017 Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),A lot of car but a lot of money," This is really an adult car and not a kid carrier.  I went for the adaptive chassis which gives the Q7 amazing road holding. This car is loaded with technology.  Audi should hold classes the way Apple does to familiarize the owner with everything this car is capable of doing. You have the ability to control all the cameras; that means you can get front, rear, side, and 360-degree views at will.  The driver's seat is really a cockpit seat giving you access to heads up technology, and ability to control the dashboard display to meet your immediate needs whether it be fuel consumption or directional maps. The only real downside to the car is storage. The glove compartment is barely able to hold the manuals; and the center console might store a pack of gum.  If you drop all the rear seats then you can fit in groceries or a set of golf clubs. I would urge you to purchase the extended warranty as everything in this car is digital or electronic, including the shift; and that will take a bit of time to adjust to.  The only thing that still has a rotating knob is the radio volume on the steering wheel. It's a good that that through MyAudi online that you can view a number of instructional videos that help explain the car's technology. And when driving the car, be careful, because it is so quiet that you can and will exceed the posted speed limits. A great driving experience but it is an expensive driving experience when you have the prestige package. It has been a year,  and I do like this car.  I have figured out most of the tech and am just disappointed in the recurring monthly charge to keep maps and all up to date.  That runs twenty bucks a month. Given the sudden changes in weather we have been experiencing, I am pleased I am in a mobile mini-fortress. Even with all the safety features it is still worthwhile to remember no one can drive on ice.I have had the Q-7 for a while now and still enjoy its major benefits as drivability, acceleration, comfort, and safety. But front storage is still a problem that can't be fixed. The official Audi app is close to useless, and Audi should pull it from the market period. Overall the Q-7 is a superb driving machine.",4

Overall it is excellent, but there are some areas that need to be considered based on your needs. More on that later.   The ride, handling, and quietness is far superior to the 2010 Lexus RX350 that we traded on this.  I also find the seats to be significantly more comfortable.  After an hour in the RX350 I was already adjusting the seat due to discomfort.  Not with the Audi.  The virtual cockpit and all the driver assist features (adaptive cruise control, side assist, pre-sense, etc.) LED adaptive headlights are fantastic and have worked flawlessly.  This does not drive OR ride like an SUV.  You easily forget you are driving a large SUV.  For those actually looking for a seven passenger vehicle, there are several things to consider.  We just had our third grandchild, so the ability to put three car seats across the 2nd row was a must.  The car seats barely fit in the RX350; making it very difficult to fasten the seat belt on the high back booster.  Not a problem with the Q7 since there is approximately three additional inches between the arm rests.  HOWEVER, we also wanted a seven passenger SUV so we could take their mom and dad, if necessary.  Only way to do that was to put two of the forward facing seats in the third row.  Grandkids loved it but difficult to connect belts, etc.  Plus it was necessary to put the rear facing infant car seat in middle position of second row , in order to fold and flip the outer seats for access to the 3rd row.  If that car seat is too wide, you are unable to flip / fold the outer seats.  Measure carefully before you buy if you have similar needs.  Cargo capacity with the third row seat backs in the up positions is significantly inadequate.  For those planning to vacation with seven, this is not the vehicle, unless you don't mind buying one of those roof top carriers that make you look like the Griswalds.  I really was not thrilled with the fact that the Q7 only comes with Run on Flat tires.  There are very few manufacturers that make the 20"" tires (Goodyear) that our Prestige has so you have to wonder how many tire shops within a 50 mile radius would have a replacement tire in the event of a tire failure.  I read horror stories about ROF tires, but ride quality, noise, and handling are not an issue in the Q7.  Due to all the technology there will be a very steep learning curve.",5
2902, on 01/08/17 08:05 AM (PST),TxAggie ,2017 Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Comfortable Luxury but not perfect.," Based on just 200 miles of driving this is a very comfortable car with great technology.  I have the Prestige trim as many of the features I wanted were standard.  I has the heads up display which is great except for one small fault.  The plastic frame around the lens in the dash is smooth.  At some angles sunlight will create a bit of glare around the edges of the display.  They are low enough not to be in the line of sight but I would have expected the engineers to realize this and make the frame out of a material that reduces glare.  The vehicle also comes with run flat tires and does not have a spare although it comes with a jack with no place to stow it so it isn't in the way.  It has a can similar to something like fix-a-flat.  Reviews on the mileage expected on the tires is not encouraging and a quick search for replacement tires (21"") on shows two manufacturers (Goodyear & Continental) with a price per tire near $500.  The interior is very nice.  The one drawback is the lack of storage bins.  There are only two small bins.  The one under the arm rest will hold a pair of sunglasses but leaves only a little room for anything else.  The CD player is located in the glove box so if you want to play a CD you have to load it before you start driving.  The virtual cockpit allows you to do many things without taking your hands off the steering wheel.  Functions like the radio and phone can be selected and controlled on the steering wheel so you don't have to look to the side to make a call or change the radio station.  The blind spot warning lights are on the side mirrors cover and are easier to see than just a small emblem on the mirror.  The speed limit for most streets is displayed on the instrument panel and the heads up display.  You can set a reminder that will cause the posted speed limit to flash if you exceed it more than the amount you set.  A very nice reminder in residential areas.  It also lets you know if you are in a school zone although it will still flash as if you are speeding even when school is not in session.  My wife has a very hard time pulling straight into a parking spot.  The parking assist will display your position in the parking spot so if you are at an angle or taking up two spots you can see it before you exit the car.  This is a great car (a little pricey) if you know the small shortcomings.After 5000 miles I still enjoy driving the Q7.  I love the heads up display.  I won't buy another care without it.  It took a little while to learn to use the adaptive cruise control and I don't drive on the freeway anymore without using it.  It does have a few quirks though.  The set speed automatically adjusts downward with a decreased speed limit which is good but it sometimes reduces speed even though there is no change in the speed limit.  This is especially true if the road had a long term construction project.  The cameras will also occasionally miss an increase in the posted speed so the speed sign will flash until you pass another speed sign and this can be for many miles.  The camera doesn't recognize all the signs indicating the end of a school zone so it will also flash until you finally come across another speed limit sign.  There are a  couple of irritants.  The drivers door has developed a rattle when driving over a slightly rough road and the dealership hasn't been able to fix.   (I didn't have this rattle after 100k miles on my Lexus SUV.)  Also the steering wheel is slightly ""off"" level.  That is if I put the steering wheel ""level"" the car will move to the right and it this includes driving in a parking lot.  The dealer checked the alignment and said it is ok but it still does it.  The backup sensor is nice but when I have a bike rack in the trailer hitch the warning tone is constant when backing up so you don't get a sense about how close you are to objects behind you based on the tone.  The car computes the estimated miles remaining before the next fill up but it tends to over estimate the gas mileage so it can be up to 100 miles  less than indicated on the display.  It is more noticeable when driving long distances on an interstate highway.After 14000 miles I like the car.  I had to have the motor that controls the driver side mirror replaced.  This required resetting the cameras that are used in to indicate car position ( lane & parking) and it took all day.  They also looked at the door rattle.  They could hear it bout couldn’t find the source.  A manufacturer rep said it was the seals so they applied something to the seals.  The door still rattles.  The MMI connect which give you info about the car is now incorrectly telling me a window is open.  I had to make an appointment to get it fixed.  I just drove on a 4K mile trip.  It doesn’t get near the advertised mpg.  There is a screen that gives you the mpg for the trip nut it is off 3 to 4 mpg.  (Checked at every fill up.). The engine seems to burn small amount of oil.  Trailer hitch can’t be locked.",5

Good looking and good finishes made this attractive in comparison to the X5 and GLE 350. Drove great.  We found the technology a little cumbersome but that could be expected as it was new to us but not as difficult as other test drives. The navigation voice commands could not recognize very much. The salesman indicated that it would get used to our voices. Right.  I checked this out with a current owner. He confirmed that voice commands are limited to his contact list.  The kicker for me was there was no spare tire! The salesman went looking for it and could not find it! It was sorta funny but it wasn't.  Their defense was it was equipped was run-flat tires with a 50 mile range. That may work for city slickers but we go to remote locations and that won't hunt. The  X5 also has no spare.  I understand that this is becoming more common but its not for me.,4
2904, on 12/19/16 12:15 PM (PST),Maurice T. ,2017 Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Exciting only in Dynamic mode," I have been considering this car, but I wanted to have a real testing experience before actually shelling out $60,000+.  So, I was able to rent this car for 1 week (it costs me some, but I think it is worth to avoid a costly mistake). I put about 1,000 miles on the car driving on all kind of terrains in Southern California, except in snow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           FUEL ECONOMY. In auto mode and 60-40 highway/city I was getting a respectable 23.5mpg in Auto mode. On a long stretch of freeway I achieved 25mpg as claimed. In Dynamic mode, the fuel economy suffers immediately as the car shifts and revs up more. On the same 60-40 highway/city I could only get 21.5mpg. I was not driving slow and, in fact, I got it up to 100mph on several occasions; as usual, the ""secret"" is to accelerate gradually.                        DRIVING EXPERIENCE: It is boring (Lexus RX 350 sort of feeling) in Auto mode. More exciting (BMW X5 sort of thing) in Dynamic mode. I was actually surprised by how agile and stable the car is going uphill at good speeds in Dynamic mode. A true Dr. Jeckyll  and Mr. Hide sort of personality.   The car is long, but parallel parking is actually easier than I was expecting. Mind you, I said easier and not easy. Without the rearview camera and at night in dark areas, it is not completely a ""piece of cake"". Driving uphill on serious pitches like in Old-Town San Diego was more pleasant that I hoped for. I was a tad concerned on some pitches when I had to come to a complete stop, but the car proved excellent.                                                                          NOISE: Wind noise in more than on the BMW X5, at least once I hit 80mph-ish.. Road noise is definitely low. Excellent in that sense.                                      INTERIORS It is well detailed, it not exceptionally luxurious, at least not in the Premium or Premium plus trims. Unfortunately, the Luxury package (another $6k) is available only in the Prestige trim.   The car is comfortable, but not exceptionally comfortable. I am 6'2"" and 245lbs, and on a 4 hour + driving I wished the car had a better support for my thighs . The seats feel comfortable, but after hours of driving, did not feel that comfy anymore.  The double shade panels in front are an excellent touch. I wonder why more cars do not have them since that is an inexpensive feature..                          INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM.  I rent many high end cars, so I am quite familiar with the bells and whistles of infotainment systems, and I have learned tricks on one car that carry over, so to speak to a different brand, but it took me about one day to learn 80%+ of all functions.  For example, getting ambient lights and set them up is not completely intuitive and I had to watch a video on YouTube that taught me how to get it done choosing the colors (you must have the proper package for it, though).  The navigation system is pretty good and I do like the fact that it is higher up, although I use the one on my console while driving. But I would prefer a larger screen. I think that both Lexus RX 350 and BMW X5 are better visually speaking.  But it got me where I needed to go and it provided good directions in all situations except one where it kept sending me up a steep and narrow street only, we found out, to cut the driving distance by about 50-100 yards.   BRAKING.  It is overall fine, but in two instances I found myself wishing it could be a little more prompt. But that could just be me and the fact that I am used to a different car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            LIGHTS: The Q7 lighting system ranks among the good ones. Drove it at night on hilly and narrow roads with nothing in terms of street lights and I always felt that I had a good view of the road, in particular using the high beam lights.                                                                                                                        OVERALL GRADE (A-): It has about all a driver would want, but it is fun to drive only in Dynamic mode.  The visual luxury is all there, but it is not 100% comfortable.",5
2905, on 12/02/16 16:36 PM (PST),JL ,2017 Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Can be improved... but still great overall," Recently made a switch from '13 BMW X5 50i to a '17 Q7 Prem Plus. Great car with lots of updates in tech and safety. Comfortable and quiet. While the engine has the punch in 'dynamic' mode, it lacks in 'auto' mode due to the tranny not shifting when needed. Going up a hill or trying to pass a vehicle requires a brick foot. Granted, I came from a turbo-charged V8 but expected more from the tranny which probably would make up the difference. The auto-start/stop isn't great when stopping - as if I am slamming on the brake b/c the engine shuts off before the car comes to a complete stop. The middle-rear seat cushion does not appear to be fixed in place as it shifts slightly - probably bringing it in to have it checked out. The tire jack tools have no where to be stored and sits in the trunk. One would think a small storage compartment can be built in somewhere for it. As some others have mentioned, when the phone is plugged in to USB for Carplay, you can no longer use the blue tooth function and have to go through the Carplay menu to make calls. I have not been able to hit the manufacturer's gas mileage of 19 city/25 highway/21 combined. So far locally I am getting 15 mpg or less and 20 mpg on highways. This is less than my V8 X5 which was consistent 17/21 mpg. For the pros, lighting for the vehicle is great inside and out.  Drive is very smooth and quiet; curious to see if that changes when the run-flats are worn in. It would seem I've been more critical than happy so far... I am just starting to get comfortable with the changes and hopefully it will get better over time. Overall, I am happy with the vehicle. Let's hope it is reliable and will last and retain good re-sale value.",4

I love the esthetics and the drive but the electronics of this car are absolutely terrible! Don't buy this car! I have had  a steering wheel malfunction in this car 4 time where all the controls in the steering wheel stop working, -and next day everything is working again! . I took it to Audi 3 times and they can't figure it out! Also the rear camera doesn't work every time it rains. My volume button stopped working temporarily 3 times! My oil change light went off when it wasn't due for an oil change. The light went off the next day by itself.  There is a clicking noise everytime I start the car. Like a processor sound. I took the car to Audi and none of the issues where fixed yet.  I am planning to apply to lemon laws.",2

Any size concerns related to parking go away with the visual package and the 360 view. As I am breaking in the engine I have not pushed any pedal to the limit but I can sense the power that this engine can provide and I am confident that I will be as impressed as I was with the demo car. Materials and ergonomics are top notch. I recommend to get the visual package because you get the LED lights, the extra cameras and the virtual cockpit which I have found very useful. I also got the Bose 3D sound system. If you are thinking on buying this car, you must listen to the standard sound system and compare. For me it was money well spent. On the negatives, I do not think that you will be able to get more mileage than what they advertised, I have been very reasonable as I am breaking in the engine and I am not getting more than 20mpg combined. The other thing is that sometimes I have to reestablish the Bluetooth connection in the phone to make it work. I have not found the pattern that causes that yet, hopefully the Audi guys tell me if I am doing something wrong next time I go there. Overall, a great experience so far. It is not cheap but you may not have a better option if you want to have a luxury 3-row SUV that performs and looks good for a family guy.10k update: Car keeps driving great and fuel economy got to 21.5 miles/gal. Two minor issues: climate control cannot be synch-ed from the driver controls, you have to manually do it. You have to look at the temperature in the second row as well. Not ideal for a car of this price. One of the speakers will have to be changed as it has a raspy sound in some specific range. It will be covered under the warranty. All things considered, still very happy. Pleasure to drive.20k update. Very pleased with the car. All works as expected. Pleasure to drive. I bounce between the auto and comfort drive mode. Fuel economy a little above 22 mpg now. I extended the satellite radio service. I have not extended the Audi google map and news service, I think that it is too expensive and they should offer a more competitive price or maybe separate the google map connectivity from the rest of the features. Without the google map service your navigation system works but it is not smart. It will not update route based on traffic. If you want that you will need to use the Apple service through car play.",5

It's electronics are far inferior to that on my Lincoln MKT.  The navigation system suddenly reboots during trips.  The voice activated system apparently only speaks German, as it doesn't understand English.  6/12/17:  Pros:  Car drives great on a long trip, and gets good mileage.  Averaged better than 25 mpg on 780 mile trip from Georgia to Maryland.  Comfort better than average.  Excellent braking system.  Cons:  Repeated navigation system failures where the system suddenly ""reboots"" while driving!  Of course, Audi cannot replicate in the shop!  All data is lost and the trip has to be re-programmed into the system.  Car still leaks going through a car wash.  Audi solution, turn off the A/C when in a car wash!  Key fob suddenly stopped recognizing the car.  Audi reprogrammed.  Said ""it happens sometimes.""  Self-leveling system pump is so loud when it runs it can be heard above the radio, and I am partially deaf!  It sounds like someone is filling a tire with air!  There is no dip stick to check the oil.  You have to turn on the car, and page through the settings to find the ""check oil screen.""  Then it will tell you the oil level, sometimes.  Other times it doesn't seem to work.  The technology on this car is great, when it works.  I have had multiple failures and many more problems then I ever had on my Lincoln MKT.  This is my first and last Audi.12/11/16:  My car was returned from service for this issue after 14 days in the shop.  The mechanic's comments on my receipt follow:   ""Took vehicle thru car wash with A/C on. Found water coming from the bottom of the dash. Removed wiper cowl cover and air intake ducting. No damage to seals or evidence of leaking. Ran vehicle thru car wash again using borascope to watch inside housing intake. Found when foam from car wash hits it is sucked into the vent box. Removed housing from another vehicle and found it did the same thing. Contacted product support. Was advised this condition is ""normal"" and vehicle needs to be in recirculation mode or A/C OFF while going through a car wash!""So according to Audi those of us living in the south should turn off our A/C or put it in recirculation mode to go through a car wash?  This is my 20th new automobile.  I have never had to do any such thing with any other brand.  I'll be trading back to Lincoln next year.  I miss my MKT.This is my first Audi.  I have always purchased Lincolns, but they discontinued the MKT.  I traded my 2011 MKT on a new 2017 Audi Q7 equipped nicely with $66,000 worth of bells and whistles.  I should have kept the MKT!  I first noticed the car leaking when my wife and I drove it through a car wash and water dripped onto her feet.  We returned to the dealer in Jacksonville.  After many hours they reported they could not ""replicate"" the problem.  They said they blew out all the drains, etc. and hopefully our problem was solved.  10 days go by and I visit the car wash again.  Drip, drip, drip into the passenger cabin with about a cup of water during a 2 minute trip through the automated car wash!  I filed a written complaint with the dealer and management.  The service writer called me (not a peep from anyone in management).  He had the car picked up at my home (117 miles from the dealership).  It has been there 7 days now and the last report I received on Thursday (today is Sunday) is that they were going to drive it through a car wash!  No kidding?  It has not rained since I purchased the car.  We are about to take it on a 1500 mile trip to see the grandkids.  I am extremely worried the car will flood if we run into rain!  This is supposed to be a LUXURY automobile!  The electronics are flaky for the radio, and the navigation system is a throw back to the system I had in my Lincoln in 2006!  No touch screen!  A stupid knob to turn to enter data one character at a time!  The MMI system works sometimes, other times it doesn't seem to connect unless I turn off the car, and restart it.  The entertainment system has crashed and rebooted several times without explanation.  As I stated earlier, this is my first Audi.  It will also be my last.  Poor dealer service and response, a leaky brand new luxury automobile, and no response whatsoever from management.  Do yourself a favor and find another vehicle.",2

I've only had it since October 9th, but it has a great feeling of quality and solidity. The interior is well made and of high quality components. Seats are good, but I would expect sears that have upper seat back movement like in BMW's comfort seats. Without that the headrest seems too high or too low. Coming from a 2015 BMW X5, I am left missing the transmission calibration of the BMW, even though they have the same trans. It's quick to upshift and makes me have to kick down when I think I shouldn't. Also, because Audi doesn't make enough of the Q7's, they are in demand and the dealers use that to their benefit. (Pretty much plan on no incentives and no discount on price) Overall I'm very happy with my purchase, and would do it again.Starting just over 10,000 Miles, the brakes started making a horrible squeaking and squealing noise coming to a stop and backing up. VERY LOUD. Audi dealer says Audi NA is aware and working on a fix.... I’m still driving around with it noisy and unacceptable.",5
2912, on 10/18/16 13:07 PM (PDT),HonestJohn ,2017 Audi Q7 SUV 3.0T Prestige quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Better Than Even the Best Reviews," If you are interested in this vehicle you likely have read the many terrific reviews from Motorweek, Car and Driver, and even Consumer Reports. I certainly did. I was able to get the vehicle at a small discount which was lucky as some dealers are now asking above sticker or loading on even more packs. The car is a joy to drive and while some have compared the ""Virtual Cockpit"" to a video game, I find it helpful and very effective at communicating information, which is what a dash should do. The placement of controls is excellent, and they are well organized by function. The volume control for all uses (voice, phone, audio) is delightfully located on the console where one's hand naturally falls. The shifter takes a while to get used to, but Audi seems to have anticipated a learning curve. When I first owned it I tried to put it in reverse without stepping on the brake pedal. The dash lit up to inform me I needed to do so. There are a few issues. First, interior storage for the driver is simply unavailable. The console holds virtually nothing and there is not even a sunglass holder. The absences of cubbies is a disappointment, but certainly not a deal breaker. I have had two minor problems. First, one day the alarm system went off every time I tried to lock the vehicle. The dealer (only a mile away, happily) was able to remedy this in less than an hour. Second, the steering wheel is no longer centered after only 2,500 miles. That, too, will be corrected by the dealer. Overall, it's a terrific vehicle as far as I am concerned, despite minor issues.Update, April 2017: Car sat for much of the winter as I had to have emergency back surgery. As soon as I was able, I was driving again, and my very positive impression of the driver's seat was reconfirmed the moment I sat in it again. Very supportive, but not confining. Was able to drive 6 hours (with breaks) and no discomfort. Got stuck in stop-and-go traffic entering Chicago (no surprise) and the Traffic Jam Assist feature, previously untested, worked perfectly. Very impressive. With cruise control set at 73 I got a steady 26+ MPG. Around town am averaging about 22.5. Overall, VERY pleased with vehicle.Update, October 2017: Still very happy with this vehicle. The longer I own it, the more impressed I am with the subtle benefits of Audi's technology. The touch pad works very well, and the audio is amazing. I still remain slightly irritated by the absence of small-item storage for the driver. After 15 months, the build quality is evident. I am delighted overall.Update: April, 2018: Remain very pleased with the vehicle, but as in any long-term relationship some of the bloom does go off the rose. One annoying problem has arisen--noisy brakes when in reverse under most weather condition. Horrendous squeal. Dealer says Audi is ""working on a fix"" but that they were having similar problems with the Q5 (not sure if he meant the new model or the pre-2018). The ""fix"" for the Q5 has not worked well and dealer has no idea when Audi will be able to correct this annoyance. And a few more minor gripes: Why does Audi choose when the headlight washers come on? In previous vehicles, I could do this manually. With Audi, certain parameters must be met before the system operates automatically, or so I am lead to believe. I am not sure they have ever come on. I still wish that Audi had come up with some storage solutions for the driver's cockpit and elsewhere (no storage for the jack??) So, yes, I am increasingly aware that this is an imperfect vehicle in minor ways, but would not hesitate to buy it again. It's still a terrific drive!",5

Handling is nicer, not as nice as BMW though. Cabin is very quiet. First impression is amazing. Nicely designed and finished. As soon as you start driving it you realize run flat tires destroy the comfort you may like from Mercedes. Head up display, as Paul already mentioned, produces ugly glares on a windscreen, right in front of you, distracting and destroying the whole experience of having a head up display technology. The best you can do when the glare comes up is to use a paper towel or something else to cover it up. Turning it off doesn't help as glare is a reflection from the HUD optics, not an image from the projector. Driver assistance package seems like an interesting enhancement but the car doesn't fully stop itself as advertised. You better read about all the limitations etc. The last one and a very annoying issue it the air-conditioning. The level of the noise the funs produce on a sunny days is hard to bear.  If I had the money in my pocket again I would seriously consider other vehicles like GLS or XC90. Perhaps this is what I'm going to do. Wait for the new GLS and trade it in. Good luck.",2

I've had it in for a fix and all they did was a master reset. What good is that really going to do?? Ha, nothing, as it is happening again. I'm pretty sure the pre sense is not working. I've had a couple close calls where it should have and it didn't work.  But they tell me it is. I've just started having issues with the key remembering my settings.

Wireless charging the cockpit (they missed it, even with all the technology), vents in the 3rd row (this is standard on all 3rd row vehicles.  this is a huge mistake.)  4.

Basic Tire Pressure monitoring system (they have some formula with the sensors to tell you if the tire pressure changes.  Just use a standard TPMS valve).  I'm happy with the car, but at this price point the car should have these basic features.  I would also have to agree with the comment about the run flats.

I had some apprehension buying another Q7 mainly due to the user interface to the navigation/entertainment (MMI) system along with the very poor keyless entry system on my 2011.  The 2011 was frustrating on a good day, basically a great car destroyed by bad programming but the engine/transmission combination was awesome.  So I test drove the 2017 with my list of frustrations and likes from my 2011 vehicle and was very happy to see that most all of my concerns had been fixed or greatly improved upon in the 2017.  So I factory ordered another Q7, with everything but the driver assistance package and the Bang & Olufsen sound system.I drive 120+ miles everyday so I am very focused on driver comfort, safety features and ease of use on all features.  This car excels in all areas.  It is extremely quiet and there is no road noise from the tires.  Engine responsiveness is still exceptional.Gas mileage is surprisingly good as I am averaging around 25MPG at average driving speeds of around 75MPH.  I liked the 2011 as it got about 20MPG and combined with the 26 gallon fuel tank it had great range.  The range is just as good on the 2017 despite the smaller (22.5 gallon) fuel tank. User interface to the entertainment/navigation system is much easier and more configurable and does not require you to take your eyes of the road to find the correct button.  The heads up indication of speed, cruise control speed setting and navigational turns is excellent, not sure I can ever do without this in the future!  The keyless entry is still bizarre and its built in ""safety features"" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  The ability to utilize the map on the driver's dash display is very nice to have.Keyless entry is still bizarre, the logic behind the ""personal safety feature "" have just the opposite effect, you will surely get mugged before you gain access to the car, especially if you use the hatch first.  I am frequently cussing out some unknown Audi programming or product management team somewhere unknown....  My advice to the Audi programming team is to go try a Lexus keyless entry system, it always works and lets you in the car.  Also, I have given up on the  hands free tailgate opening.  I end up dancing in the parking lot and ultimately just pull out the remote.Seating comfort with the luxury package is excellent and highly configurable.Probably the biggest improvement is in the longevity of the tires and brakes.  I currently have 53,000 miles on the vehicle and I still have 6-7 mm of tread remaining on the original factory Eagle Sport runflats and minimal wear on the original brake pads.  I am very happy with the OEM tires in all weather conditions and they have been great in the Wisconsin weather.So far my only three complaints or observations are:1,) Aforementioned keyless entry and hands free tailgate programming issues. 2.) The tilt steering does not go down close enough to my legs for my own personal taste, seems to stop in too high (straight) of a setting.3.) On an overcast or partially sunny day it seems like the auto fan setting wants to stay in too high of a setting and basically makes you feel cold and also creates more noise than necessary.Overall the vehicle is excellent and I enjoy my daily drive.",5

I traded in my 2014 MDX. This thing is light years ahead of the MDX in refinement and build quality. It drives like a sports car. As quiet as a Range Rover. Car & Driver made 0 to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds. Not bad for a 5,000 pound suv. The dash layout is sheer perfection. Real buttons to engage functions with a quality feel. The silly Senus system in the Volvo and my antiquated MDX required at least 2 button presses of the touch screens just to get to a setting. Ridiculous. This thing is so quiet, even when in dynamic mode. I sprung for the air suspension and 4 wheel steering option. It makes a very noticeable difference. The TFT gauge cluster displays Google maps in full glory and is highly configurable to show all information. The heads up display is a huge bonus. The safety and technology features are abundant and although some are intuitive, I recommend an evening of reading the owner's manual from cover to cover. The MMI system works flawlessly for navigation, maps, telephone, audio and all of the cool Audi Connect services. This new Q7 is like a spaceship. Best car I ever bought by far. Driving this car after driving the MDX and X5 is night and day. The XC90 was a nice demo, but it just wasn't up to the level of performance that the Q7 has. XC-90 is a bit more luxurious with really nice front seats, but the 4 cylinder was loud when accelerating and idling was rough. In the Q7 you can't even hear it when stopped. But when I get on it for a strong burst of acceleration , it sings a pretty song. Just an incredible automobile. I love this SUV!",5

I went with the prestige package since it includes cold weather, warm weather, 20"" wheels, and the vision packages for a better overall value.  As a previous owner of a 2013 Audi Q7 I was immediately impressed with the way the 2017 model feels in regards to handling, steering feel, and performance.  The 2017 model has shaved off 500+ lbs from the previous platform and makes the Q7 feel more like a car.  The 3 Liter engine has plenty of power (333hp), smooth shifts from the 8-spd transmission, and great road grip with little body roll.  I would describe the 2017 Q7 as nimble,  something I could never say about the previous Q7 model - which felt more like a tank.  I look forward to driving the Q7 everyday, and right now im looking for excuses to go take it out just so I can drive it.  Audi took a long time to re-design the Q7, but I think they got everything right: style, performance, comfort, and technology.",5

I drove it from time to time and was impressed so when it was time to replace a 2012 X5 I looked at the redesigned Q7.  The ride, handling, and performance is as good or better than the X5 and the fit and finish is far superior.  It has a little more room inside while not seeming to be larger on the outside.  The ride is a little less harsh and more quiet than the X5.  Handling install responsive and the turning radius is excellent.  It is a joy to drive.  It is also easier to fit multiple sets of golf clubs horizontally in the cargo area.  I have had the car for about a month and so far no problems.  Everything works well.

I bought a 2015 Allroad through their CPO program with the extended mileage warranty to 100K miles.  I saw the Q7 then but thought I'd pause and see which side of the divide my experience with this machine would fall on.  After almost a year of driving the Allroad and having it serviced ($254 for the 25K service) I saw a 2015 Q7 show up at the local dealership...6cyl supercharged and on the CPO program.  I didn't hesitate...a brief negotiation and now my wife is the happiest gal on the block.  It's a beast, it's heavy, sticks to the road like glue - while the inside wraps you in luxurious trim, electronics and comfort.  Despite using super-unleaded gas....we got 400 miles out of the first tank full....I checked into the service fees for this beauty.  They are expensive....$800 for a minor service, brakes are $1500+, tires are low profile, and a major service is close to $2000.  With eyes wide open I opted to buy the ""service package"" from the dealer at the time of the deal.  You can negotiate...I ended up getting two years of (2 minor and 2 major services) for $1500.  You do the math.....So there are plenty of options.  In the meanwhile, this LUXURY SUV rides like a dream, accelerates like a rocket, and is a real head-turner.  With the economics in mind...if you can you should.   I should mention I've also owned a Jeep Cherokee (Overland), 2 Range Rovers, and a Tahoe.  I looked at the Mercedes and Porsche Cayanne...at the end of the day....this Audi was the best all-around bang for buck and fun combination.",5

Didn't even look because every car I've been in since my '12 Q7 has had them, including every cheap rental. My '14 Audi S7 has them, as did my '14 Silverado. I assumed that there would have been some kind of progression of in the equipment on these cars since 2012. But seemingly, I bought the exact same car again with a slightly different options list. :-)Seems like an easy thing to work around, but they did not even provide a charger socket in the armrest,  just on top of the console, near the shifter. So if you want to charge your phone you can cram it over in the glovebox or have your charger and wiring and phone sitting on top of the console like it was 1996 all over again. It was bad design in 2007 and it's comical in 2015. I'll have to go to a stereo shop to get wiring run into the armrest. Just like it was 1996. :-)Enough whining about that oversight. It's still the capable SUV it was in 2012. Because of the VW TDI scandal, I was unable to purchase the TDI. Which I thought was a phenomenal powertrain. So once I've driven it a while, I will review the new 3.0T more thoroughly.  I was expecting it to be sadly underpowered by comparison, but so far I've been pleased with it. Sadly the back up camera setup has not changed, and compared to my other '14 model cars it seems really tiny and poorly laid out. As I said before, it really seems to be the same car as before but more options have become standard. Or at least more available?  Big ones that I didn't get in my '12 are keyless entry and start, and XM traffic info on the nav display.  Also, with the S line or prestige package, I got ventilated seats up front and heated seats in the back. The ventilated seats seem to work better than those in my '07 A8. They also offer a black optics package which blacks out almost everything.",5

The biggest problem is that the controls, for the most part, just make no sense. Let's take safety - all other modern vehicles with front sensors alert you when parking. With this car, you have to enable the feature (or go into reverse first) before the system becomes active. That's not just non-intuitive, but just downright dumb. As for the side assist, make a turn when a car is next to you and nothing will register.  The side assist is only blind spot assist, and there are strict parameters where this function only works.  This is junk - the truth in engineering is that you help the driver and take the risk out of driving by adding modern technology, not that you take technology and make it not work the way it should.  Other controls are not intuitive either - from AC to the pain of having to use the wheel to enter an address for navigation.  Interior looks nice, but functionality and design are fighting each other.  Lexus and Infinity vehicles have much better fit and finish to them and are intuitive and easy to use.",3

I've never owned an Audi before and the 8-speed Tiptronic is very smooth, but it doesn't go into a true manual transmission mode, most likely for engine safety reasons. Meaning, in manual mode, when you down shift, it won't go into a lower gear unless the RPMs are at a certain level. If the RPMs are too high it won't allow you go to a lower gear. So you don't really have the control that you would have with a true manual transmission. For example, you are going too fast and want to down shift around a curve, it won't let you unless you break and slow down first. That said, the transmission is very smooth if you know what to expect from it. I live in the mountains and the car is heavy, so it is a bit mushy on the curves but handles well. The heaviness is good in the snow and provides for a quiet ride. When the doors shut, you really feel like you are getting your money's worth. Now as far as features, it is fully featured and the details make all the difference. Audi has added nice touches; such as, there are two sun visors on each side and the one visor has the option of swinging to the side while the other blocks sun from the front. Additionally, the visor that swings to the side has a sleek pullout extension that allows for additional sun blockage. Now for the cons: I have only 22k miles and have already replaced all four tires and it’s due for breaks in another 1k miles and the service assistant said that rotors usually need to be replace with each break pad change as well , so maintenance is expensive. Also, I the check oil has come on twice between oil changes even though not due. So I called the dealer and they said I needed to add a can or two to get by until the oil is due for a change and that it is normal for the car to burn oil like that.  I have also had major dashboard warning lights come on twice and had to bring the car in twice, in addition to regular maintenance, for these reasons. The first time I brought it in was for the “Audi Q7 engine emission warning light” and the “Audi Q7 glow plugs pre heating warning light.” They said, the car had been exposed to bad diesel and they ended up having to change the lower fuel pump.  Then after two months I brought it in the second time for the same warning lights. Again, the claim was bad diesel and the fuel filter and all the fuel lines had to be changed. The car is still under warrant, but the thought of have to pay for all this is scary. I’m hoping this has been worked out, but I’m skeptical since I only go to major brand fuel stations.",3

Plenty of room in the Q7 '15 model for us as a family of five.  The technology is great, easy to use and functions as one would think, not a complex interface like MB icommand.  Audi technology features are well done, I have internet enabled in this Q7 and it gets a great signal, we've connect up to 5 devices, the max is 8 devices.  Of Course Bluetooth enabled works well too.   Overall I love how smooth the Q7 is, handles well and while it's a V6 Diesel with 240 HP it has over 400LB of Torque per ft.  The MB GL550 was a bullet at 390HP but rode rough I thought and the technology gap with other car manufactures in the 2012 MB GL series was just not good.    The Audi Q7 gets great milage about 18-19 in the City and over 25-28  m/p/g on the HWY, much higher too is possible, but I have a heavy foot.  One could get in the 30's for HWY milage easy.

2961, on 01/12/17 06:47 AM (PST),SCVolunteer ,2013 Audi Q7 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),best Euro SUV on market," Bought Q7 TDI 3.0 used in 2014 with 25k miles. Exterior styling is very Euro-slique. LED headlight design is very eye-catching and bright. Crisp ride with almost no vibration or wind noise but a little harsh. I traded out tires for Pirelli scorpions and dropped recommended psi and that has helped. Still rides less cushy than Tahoe or Yukon and especially our Escalade which we traded. The interior is scandanavian like minimalist with easy buttons but lacks a factory DVD player option and any rear factory monitors for entertainment and rear seat climate control that is worth a darn. That's a fail for Volkswagen/audi in my opinion since the Tahoe, Suburban and Escalade have a movie theatre quality rear entertainment system and rear heated and colled seats now. What you get with Audi is impeccable materials. Fit and finish is exceptional. Eveything in cabin is tied down, no rattles like US SUVs. Also, they use REAL leather in seats, not ""pleather"" like US brands. That means the seats actually last and wear over time and dont crack and lose tanning like our Cadillac did. Rear luggage space with 6 people is inadequate. Third row seats only big enough for 7 year old. Cant get two pieces of luggage behind 3rd row seats. Had to buy $800 roof rack. All that said here are the pros...acceleration with turbo diesel is nasty! Once it revs up it just goes like a stabbed rat. 0-60 in close to 5.5! At 75-80 highway it sips fuel. We have seen actual Mpg of 36 and close to 550 miles between fill ups. This engine is superior to any US diesel even in the Fords! I know they may have ""fudged"" on emission reports but I have to say (california tree huggers) worth it!! We have 100k on vehicle now and maintenance has been a problem. It has developed bladder control issues like all my prior Germans and leaks oil all over garage. Dealership said they could replace gasket between engine and trans to fix for a meer $7k. I'll get a drip pan...tnx. It also chews up tires like a 5th grader goes through tennis shoes. The Quattro does not allow a slip like other US AWDs and it takes 2mm of tread off every tight turn. It also consumes brakes like a teenage boy goes through food. Two complete sets of brakes (dealer will not turn rotors?!) in 3 years at $2200 a pop!!! No bueno...volkswagen needs to abandon Bosch and talk to Raybestos or Brembo.  Overall amazing engine and impeccable attention to detail with interior finish, but add 10% to sticker price for post warranty and all maintenance. Its a pricey ride.Update on Q7: the car has now crossed 120k miles. We have had more engine problems and it has been back to dealer twice. We are considering buy-back with VW/Bosch class action for the emissions fraud. We love the gas mileage with the 3.0T diesel and the interior and exterior are holding up very well with little signs of wear. But the vehicle maintenance and reliability is starting to become a problem. Unfortunately, it seems to be following the tradition of my other German autos after 100k where they start to break frequently and the out of warranty repair bills become astronomical. Seeing at least $1100 per visit or more with $120/hour labor charges. We have friends with identical vehicle and they are at the same conclusion. Disappointed with overall experience of ownership with this vehicle, hoped it would hold up better than BMWs. VW needs to work with dealers to drop labor charges and high ownership maintenance costs and build them with more reliable parts.",4

Bought my Q7 TDI after driving/considering the X5D, ML350 Bluetec, Toureg TDI. Only the TDI provided me with the space I needed in cargo area and fairly useable 3rd row, even if only occasionally. I have my own soccer training business and none of the others would fit my gear without much struggle. Close 2nd were the ML, which rode wonderfully, and the X5D which felt very much like a BMW. The Audi is a great combo of all the things I needed. Very powerful, quiet, and tremendous gas mileage! Came from an '07 MDX where I struggled to get 330 miles from full tank, I now get that on a half tank! **Update 7/2016...Still love the Q7! The only thing that I would improve is the WiFi. Hope they have improved it for 2016 because mine is awful. Nine out of ten times I have to take it off WiFi if I'm trying to stream music because it can't do it. Other than that, it's been a great vehicle for us.**Update 1/2017 Cancelled the Audi Connect which provided the WiFi through Sprint. Total waste of money. Hope it's improved. Had my first mechanical failure since purchase in 4/2013. Blower fan for climate control died, unfortunately during the coldest weather of winter so far. Audi Chantilly was awesome as usual and was replaced under the extended warranty I purchased. Other than that, still love the truck. Sadly disappointed the TDIs have been eliminated for the foreseeable future. Will consider trading in on a new diesel if they ever come out with one.",5

Neither Audi nor dealership were helpful just basically said ""sorry"". From what I understand there have been many brake problems in this vehicle. Brakes still squeal. Terrible customer service from Audi headquarters and dealership and obviously do not stand behind their vehicles. It is a fun car to drive but for the  money I spent you would expect high quality and customer service. Fuel economy bad even for an SUV. DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE.",3

I have never owned a vehicle where the brakes and tires went bad at such low mileage.  The engine sounds like it is struggling all of the time and is sounding more and more like a pick-up truck and not an Audi SUV.  We spent the extra money for the keyless start and it doesn't work when it is cold out.  I think the quality of Audi's have definitely decreased.",3.875

Example - the gas door feels and works like a Yugo. Instrument panel is directly under cup holders and any spills screw up the audio. $800 to fix and not covered by warranty. Service has declined dramatically over the years. It feels like they are trying to wring every dime they can from us at every chance. Not much different than most but different than our past experience. Have had for 1.5 years and seems like there is always some little thing wrong. Engine is great, great on snow. If I had it to do over again I would get the GL 450 or 550. The Acura is more reliable but does not drive as well or turn as sharply. ",3.5

I traded an FX45 for it, which I loved. I wanted something larger, but sexy, alluring, but professional. Audi really did it. I am not saying I am not going to do a few mods (larger tires and rims is all), but it really is a beauty all on its own. I looked at the MDX, VW, another FX, Range Rover Sport, BMW, and Mercedes. I have never felt so much safer and hotter at the same time. A lot of room for my single self and traveling companions. Would make a nice soccer mom look FABULOUS. All the other mommies will be jealous. There is so much room. ",5

It handles like a sports car; seats are very comfortable; engine and ride are extremely quiet and smooth; luxury features such as MMI, bluetooth, rear camera, air suspension system, large sunroof and sunscreen, and rear hatch are very useful; and the electronic stability system really works - I felt very safe descending a steep, winding, icy road without having to use the brakes.

Third row seat is designated for small passengers on short trips. Once we became familiar with the MMI and other options they were very user friendly and worth the time to learn.

I drove the 4.2 (not much more money than a loaded 3.6) and felt the 3.6 was faster, not sure why ,maybe less weight? Better gas mileage too. I also drove the S-line it felt a bit doggie, maybe the suspension or tires? I love the look and feel of the interior and all the bells and whistles especially the keyless entry no more digging in my purse! The MMI takes some getting use to but well worth the time.

It will get up and go and the brakes will bring you down in a hurry not to mention a super smooth ride.  Adaptive air suspension really makes a difference as well.

Why not a solid sun roof cover to keep the sun and heat out?

3062, on 09/28/17 05:50 AM (PDT),Jay ,2008 Audi Q7 SUV 3.6 quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Do not buy this car!," It is bad when you are at the dealer service center and the salesman as well as the senior tech both tell you that they wouldn't own this version of the car! So my wife and I were looking to swap out our 2012 Lincoln MKX for another luxury vehicle with 3rd row seating to cover the new needs of our expanded family. We had owned the Lincoln for 3 years and aside from repairing a faulty cooling fan, the vehicle performed flawlessly. We drove it on many vacations and loved the ride comfort, features, and style. The only fault at all was the lack of seating which is what led us to search for something new. We thought we had found that in a used red 2008 Audi Q7. We choose this vehicle because we were looking to buy another SUV within the price range that we could sell the used MKX ($15-16k). The Audi won us over with the amount of features, luxury items, sportiness and pedigree being a cousin of Porsche and Volkswagen. The vehicle we purchased had comparable miles as our MKX had (75,000 ish) so we expected a vehicle that would be broken in with a few scratches here and there and maybe some slight wear on the interior. What we received however was something straight out of a comedy. We ordered the vehicle and had it shipped to our house. When the transport arrived the vehicle didn't want to start so they had to boost it to get it off the trailer. While at idle we began to smell gas. Upon inspection we found the fuel tank was pouring gas onto our drive! Went to move the car but it wouldn't start back.We had it towed to the Audi dearlership for repair ($210.00). 3 days later we picked it up after a service recall which repaired the leak free however the leak caused damage to the fuel pump which required replacement ($475.00) and to replace the battery it had to be programmed to the vehicle ($318.00).On the way back home however, the TPMS indicator came on then the ‘Hill Climb Assist Error’ indicator, then the ABS light and then the Brake booster light. Not far after the check engine light came on and the vehicle began to misfire. Additionally, as I was travelling back home the cabin began to get stuffy. I went to turn up the AC and both blowers were not functioning. I opened up the sunroofs and dropped the windows. Turned the stereo on to popping and cracking speakers. Not to be outdone, the charging port that I was using to charge my phone stopped working. As misery sat in on my 65+ mile trek home, it began to rain. I went to roll up the windows and close the sunroofs to find that the rear window wouldn’t go back up and the front sunroof only partially closed and the rear would not shut either. So the final 15 minutes of the drive home was spent getting rained on. After we arrived home my wife helped me force the rear window up and we managed to coax the main moonroof closed however in the process the rear plastic cover of the passenger seat fell off! Additionally, we opened up the rear hatch to gain better access to the rear sunroof but when we went to shut it, the hatch wouldn’t close. It took 10 minutes of coaxing it to finally get it all the way down. The next day we contacted the dealership and told them what had happened. They suggested that it could have been affected by the battery programming (I called BS on this but went along with it) and suggested we bring it back in for a diagnostics test to see. We drove the vehicle back, in the heat, without ac and only able to drive it 55 mph on the highway due to the engine misfire. The dealership to notified us that the AC blower motors were in fact faulty, the speakers were blown and the fiber optics were busted on the stereo (thus disabling the satellite radio and causing a short). The tire pressure monitors were all dead (they run on batteries which expire every 5 years or so and require replacement, even on the spare, to the tune of $275.00 each), the rear window resistor was bad, the sunroofs and hatch control assemblies were faulty , all but one of the charging port connectors were melted at their base and shorted (also something that is prone to failure as we were informed.) The engine misfire was caused by a faulty connection to one of the coils which was easily corrected during the diagnostic test. Overall, however the test alone cost us $330.00. Then the dealership told us the cost for the remaining repairs would total $4,385.00! We ended up getting our $14k back from the purchase and now own a Cadillac Escalade. Will never own an Audi due to the cost of repairs and the volume of items which are prone to fail with age!",1

I took it in today and was told you're out of luck because you spilled something on it. Had I known this was such a common problem, I wouldn't have bought this car. Now I have to shell out the money out of pocket to replace the MMI system. After reading a bunch of reviews, it seems to be an extremely common problem. ",3.5

Further, with a carseat in the center location, it is impossible to move the seats forward to access the third row.

It has been a pleasure to drive with good handling (minimal body roll) and reasonable acceleration for the class of car. (I drive an RS4 and still enjoy the Q7). The ride can be rough, however, especially at lower speeds -- some likely related to 20"" wheels that were a part of the s-line package. Wish the air suspension was an option on the 3.6 which would likely improve ride quality. Gas mileage is reasonable with the 3.6 (21mpg at 70 mph) given size/wt of vehicle.

Apparently my 20+ year driving experience and owning multiple SUVs/trucks and not having the brakes shot at 15K means nothing. I suggested that the dealer pays for rotors and I pay for pads, so will hear back from Audi in a couple of days. Complaints about the breaks/rotors replacement at early mileage is something that various Audi forums cover well. Thinner break pads (7mm) vs. other luxury SUVs and softer break pad material, all seem to contribute to the issue of premature brake failure. Single use rotors, which are not supposed to be serviced until ~35,000 miles according to Audi Q7 Maintenance Schedule, need to be replaced with every brake job, which can drive the cost up to $2,000 for parts and labor. I'm excited at the 2017 Q7, but who needs a brake job that soon, so may not be trading in next year.",3
3114, on 07/14/18 20:53 PM (PDT),Jason W Theis ,2014 Audi Q7 Diesel TDI Premium Plus quattro 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),I almost love this car!," As an owner, you know that every car purchase has some degree of weighing the vehicle's pros against its cons.  As long as you go into this with your eyes wide open and willing to accept the cons, your satisfaction is likely to be high.  And, so it is for the Q7.  This TDI has fantastic fuel economy, gobs of power, handles well for the 5,500# beast it is, looks classy, rides like a dream, and is comfortable enough to drive all day every day without fatigue.   So, what are the cons?  Well, two major things:  1., space use for cargo is horrible; Audi really should have made the car six inches taller.  As it is, cargo room is quite height-limited, and this is something I find quite annoying (quite often).  The fact that it has a third row for seating simply means that there is less cargo space for a useless row that no normal (or even relatively small) human can use with any level of practicality.  2., Too many sensors.  If anyone ever asked the question, ""Is it possible for a car to have too many sensors?""  Audi answered it for us:  Yes, it is!!!!!  Honestly, many of the sensors main purpose in life is to give false-positives because they are in damage-prone areas and are for things that even the worst car owner should be entirely capable of managing on their own.  Example?  Brake pad sensors.... seriously!",4

I owned my 2011 Audi Q7 for 6 years and for the most part it was alright. My biggest complaint is the maintenance. Every single service I had done was done at a Certified Audi Dealer, yet after 3 years the thermostat went out, exactly right after the warranty had expired. To make up for this, Audi did not pay for the repair, they did offer to cover my service through 75,000 miles. Fast forward 2 1/2 years and my 6 weeks after my 85,000 mile service my coolant light comes on and I take it back  to Phil Long Audi here in Colorado Springs. To my surprise the thermostat again needs to be replaced because it is leaking, as well as an additional 2K in suggested repairs. So 6 weeks after a service and an ""Audi World Class"" Inspection at  certified dealer, the car basically fell apart. I contacted Audi of America and they offered me a 25% discount on the Thermostat repair only as a good will gesture, what a crock. They do not stand behind there product as long as there is a buck to be made and I refuse to do business like that no mater how ""nice"" there cars are.",1

The torque in the gas engine isn't quite as good, but still feels like plenty. The gas engine feels more alive and is funner to drive.  It is very nice inside and out. However, some things like plastic interior door handles, cheap feeling engine start/stop button, make it seem slightly less expensive than a BMW, Lexus, or Mercedes.

My wife fell in love with the drivability, the appointments, and it not having the stigma of elitism (buying a brand badge versus a quality car).  Most of the people we knew at the time had never heard of Audi.  Maybe because we were too poor to even afford one, but we all knew Mercedes and BMW!  My wife didn’t want to drive a badge, she wanted to drive a well-crafted machine that would last a long time.  A few years later, I found a lease return TDI Prestige in Florida that was well priced.  I jumped on it.Why really did we want the Q7 over anything else?  We wanted a 7 passenger vehicle.  There are only four of us in the family, but randomly we will transport friends to and from school and ball games.  So the third row seat didn’t need to cavernous, just legal for short trips.  We wanted a comfortable long distance vehicle.  We regularly travel 2,500 miles across the United States, so we desired something comfortable.  I’m 6’1” and many vehicles don’t fit me.  This fit me like a glove.  In these travels, we travel through all types of weather, including snow.  We also travel back roads a bit also, so we desired a four wheel drive.  We needed something that could tow a 5,000 pound camper.  And we desired 20+ mpg.  This wish list narrowed us down very quickly.  The Q7 was at the top of the list.With nearly 180,000 miles on our Q7, we have done NO major maintenance.  Brakes, oil, tires, battery and other small things like this; but we have done nothing major.  We continue to drive this car as our primary cross-country conveyance.  We have no squeaks, no rattles, no clunks and to broken nobs.  The seats have no tears, rips or bad wearing spots.  This car has really held up to my family.  It has truly held up to the price I paid for it.  Even my fuel mileage increased as I put miles on it.  Currently, we average 25 MPG on the highway, and around 18 in the city.The bad:The OEM brakes.  This is a heavy machine, and the brakes remind you that it is heavy!  Our first brake replacement, we upgraded the rotors and pads and reprogrammed the sensitivity of the brake pedal.  It made an immense difference.Tires.  This is a heavy machine, and it eats tires faster than a minivan.  I finally went to a Conti DWS with a 50,000 warranty.  This way, every time I swap tires at about 40,000 miles, I get $125 discount off the new set.  MMI  The interface with the computer is like jumping from Windows to Apple.  There is a lot of getting used to the strange interface.  My wife loves it, so I won’t expound on it!",5

Wife wanted luxury and reliability and I wanted performance and fun.  It wasn't until we looked at the A7 that we found the right combination.  I know you may be thinking ""but you bought the diesel"".  Well test drive the TDI and tell me it doesn't put a grin on you face with all the torque on tap and we just got 39 MPG on a 800 mile trip.  I would classify the car as a GT and in this regard it excels.  It comfortably seats 4 and can still put a smile on your face on a twisty canyon road.  Is it going to hang with a 911......No, but you can't put all your luggage, the dog and 4 people in the 911 either.  The TDI has a slight diesel rumble at idle when cold that is barely noticeable (if you have everything in the car turned off....heater, stereo, etc..) Once in gear and rolling, the car is very quiet and amazingly the TDI has an un-diesel like growl to it when you drop the hammer.  The transmission is super smooth and seems to always be in the right gear for what you want the car to do.  The interior and technology of the car is as cutting edge as your wallet will allow (options) but even the base model is nicely equipped and very functional.  The headlights and interior lighting make nighttime driving less stressful for those that may not see as well at night as they use too.  The A7 has real usable storage space, every person I have shown the lift back to has been amazed at how much storage there is (notice I didn't use the word trunk space as no trunk can compare, it closer to an SUV than a car).   In conclusion, after testing every reasonable car in the midsize luxury GT class I am happy with my purchase and would recommend the vehicle to others.",4

A far as comfort, the heated/cooled seats work very quickly and the massage function on the Comfort Seating Package is ridiculously great.  I find myself using it almost 100% of the time. The seats themselves offer as many adjustments as I could imagine and are very comfortable and supportive when cornering quickly.

If you want to just drive the car I suggest the following: Put down the LCD screen using the button on the dash, it will pop up only when needed (this also looks cool).

The Audi, in comparison, is that redhead in high school you wished you'd asked to the prom, just to see what might happen after the prom!  It is fun, and that sums it up.  It's over priced; for the money one can choose from an array of fine rides, BMW, Mercedes, maybe a Jag, any of which could get your blood flowing.  But this a vehicle you won't see too many of on the street.  It truly stands out with great styling.  I've had no less than four strangers tell me what a fine looking auto the A7 is.Audi is famous for beautiful interiors and this car has one.  The interfaces, voice or touch, are superior to the Lexus, in my opinion, very nice for a non-techie such as myself.  The media interface alone is marvelous.At first I wasn't sure about the feature where the engine shuts off at red lights (on or off, your choice), but have come to appreciate the option, especially since premium fuel is strongly recommended, the main negative thus far.

I chose this car above all German and Japanese equivalents, and it was no contest. Ease off the line and it rolls sedately forward. Crush the pedal and it pins you back in the seat, the engine giving a subtle growl that quickly becomes a roar. 70mph comes fast, as the steering, handling, and balance tighten. It is the best performing sedan I've ever driven. Hit the gas out of the apex and it hunkers down and rockets out of the turn. The curve speed sign says 40mph? Try 70 and you will be fine. The interior is sumptuous, ergonomic, and classy without being fussy. The electronic systems are user-friendly but have layers and layers of functionality once you start exploring. In the snow, this car outperforms the most eager SUV. Speaking of SUVs, when you open the lift gate you have a storage cave that serves almost any cargo need. Every possible situation was contemplated with this car. This A7 feels like an extension of me--more so the longer I own it. And as with my 2012, the 2016 turns heads and solicits conversation wherever I go. I have the Mythos black with Nougat interior, and it couldn't be more compelling. The car exudes understated success and standing, and imbues the same upon its driver. My only fear is that one day Audi will stop making the A7. It's that good.",5

Prior to the fire I was looking at the Audi line of cars. After quite a bit of research I decided on a Audi A7 due to its versatility and great interior. I didn't go back to Porsche because of their lack of concern when my car caught fire!! I was planning on buying off of the local dealer but they told me it would take 90-120 days to order the A7 configured the way I wanted it. I got on the net and connected with Lauren Whitcraft at Rick Case Audi in the Atlanta area. She located a dealer who had a car that was being built in Germany and traded one of their vehicles. In a little over three weeks she notified my car was ready to go. I must add that we did the deal over the phone in thirty minutes from the time I called initially. I flew to Atlanta on a morning flight and she picked me up at the airport. After I hit the road I drive from Atlanta to Richmond in a constant rain. My new Audi A7 impressed me the entire trip averaging 37.5 mph. I have owned a ton of cars and this one is a keeper. On a recent trip I averaged 42.6 mph(diesel). My wife keeps telling how much she like the A7 and just smile and go ""yes I do. I really with I could complain about something but I can't. I am looking forward to taking a long trip some day soon. In closing I can tell you this puppy is pretty darn fast too. It midrange acceleration does not seem to bog down until I loose my nerve....Did I say I love my A7? I can't wait until the 2016 Q7 comes out so we can fly to Atlanta and replace my wife's vehicle.",5

The 19 inch wheels with low profile tires are great for handling, but with our non-aggressive driving, we will opt to go the the 17"" with A/S for lower noise and less road feel.

In other words, you really can't beat this car for comfort. Even the controls are laid out in a configuration that makes sense, and with easy access so your fingers don't fumble around when you want to reach out for something. The highest compliment I can give this car is that I actual enjoy being a passenger when my wife is driving. Not that my wife is a bad driver, but usually I am a horrible passenger. The ride is amazingly smooth and acceleration is close to driving a sports car. The safety features are amazing and should you be using lane assist, you will get an audible warning to tell you to put your hands back on the wheel. Some people aren't fans of all the safety features but I am. Given the condition of roads and the amount of distracted drivers out there, I like feeling I might have an edge. The navigation system is excellent and it also provides you with traffic conditions and problems ahead. I did purchase extended warranties guaranteeing me bumper to bumper protection through 2023, including scratch protection. These automobiles are really comfortable computers on wheels and only a fool would fail to protect themselves in case a computer board or chip gets fried. My collision insurance took a slight jump as these wouldn't be inexpensive cars to repair, but it wasn't a bump such that it is highly noticeable; more like a hundred dollar jump. My wife has pretty much appropriated this car. She prefers the shift over the newer electronic shifter where you press ""P"" for park rather than actually move the shift into park. No doubt the 2018 model has upgraded but my wife is putting off the inevitable as long as she can.  Now, my wife isn't a lead foot by any means, but she likes a car to jump when she hits the accelerator. She also appreciates the ease by which she can manuver.

Even after three years, the model remains a head-turner and a true joy to drive on my daily 20-mile commute. Performance of the A8 4.0L T is robust, yet the look is understated. My only concerns relate to the inability of local dealerships to keep up with the service capacity demands as more Audis are sold.  Also, the unexpected service charge of more than $650 to align the adaptive cruise control should be covered in the pre-purchased Audi Care package.  On the whole, I am quite satisfied with what is my fifth A8.",5

It has everything that you could want.  I cannot imagine needing more power than what the A8  3.0 brings to table.  You tap on the accelerator and you're off to the races with all of the horses you need under the hood.  The back seat comfortably seats people 6'5"", which is a rare find in any vehicle.  The seat massagers are a great feature for the driver and passengers and the climate control is excellent for front and back seats.  It has the smoothest ride of any car that I have ever been in.  There are roads that I regularly drive on that you have to take slow in my wife's Toyota Sienna of you'll get bumped around that I can drive over at normal speed and not even feel.  The camera that gives you a 360 degree view when you are parking or pulling out of a spot is a phenomenal feature.   It's tough to live without when you're driving a ""normal car'. I get 30 MPG on the highway, which is completely unexpected for this land yacht.  This is car is so luxurious that my wife tells me my expectations are too high when we look at other cars.  Once you drive this car, you're going to have a tough time downgrading to another vehicle.  About the only complaint that i can come up with is the in-car wifi, which only has 3G capability and the navi system which is based on google maps which you have to have the 3G service for which is unfortunate, but I mostly use Waze for navigation anyway.  If you can afford it, don't second guess - buy this awesome piece of engineering and luxury!",5

I purchased mine gently used (15k miles-strongly recommended given the depreciation)  from an Audi dealer  after 1 year of patient research.  I needed a daily driver (I was commuting 120 miles daily) with all wheel drive, good-great gas mileage and comfort. I landed a 2015, fully loaded 4.0L, after exclusively researching diesels, and I've not looked back.  Its extremely (almost scary) fast and nimble in Sport Mode and a world class, gas-sipping luxury saloon in Comfort Mode:  0-60 in 4 seconds (unreal power) or 30mpg on a gentle highway jaunt, the car has incredible range:  and although its fantastic to drive, riding in the back seat (with the Rear Seat Executive Package) is equally wonderful.   And I although some will say they disagree, I strongly recommend the Bang and Olufsen sound option:  just watch a few of the videos online about the perfectionistic development of the system, and listen to one against the other:  I've been grateful I held out until one came available.  I'd strongly recommend AudiCare (its a total bargain given the frequency and cost of services) and it transfers with the car, which I'd imagine increases residual value.  I could go on and on about all of the details which make the vehicle exceptional-  I'd just recommend you go drive one.",5

But Audi is not telling its customers something very important.  If this car is in a wreck, it can take up to 3 months to repair.    I was in a rear end collision over 6 weeks ago.  The repair work has not even started.  The reason is that Audi limits collision repairs to one shop in any particular city.  I live in a city with 5 million people.  There is only one shop that can repair the vehicle and the shop has only one technician who is authorized to do the work.  As there are five other cars waiting to be repaired ahead of me, it will be at least another month before I may see the car back.  I filed a complaint with Audi, and they told me the reason for this insane policy is that the vehicle is aluminium and requires special training to repair.  With all due respect to Audi, there are many other cars made of aluminium and many other repair shops that can perform the repair.  So to make sure that these shops cannot do the repair, Audi will not sell them the parts. Audi refused to provide me with an alternative equivalent vehicle and refused to buy the car back.  It is insane to purchase a car which costs between $90 and $100k and for Audi to create a situation where it is impossible get it repaired in a reasonable period of time.  I will be commencing legal proceedings against Audi in the near future.  I will report back on the results.",1

After buying my first Audi, a 2016 A6 3.0 earlier in 2015, my wife was so impressed driving my car that she traded her Lexus RX350 in for a A8 L with the same spunky V6. I can't help but to compare the drive, handling and ride quality of the A8L to a Lexus LS460L I traded for my A6 earlier this year. The Audi beats the Lexus hands down. This A8 L handles so securely for such a large car. The V6 is strong, and provides plenty of power. The car is hushed, substantial, has a huge back seat, yet handles like a smaller sedan. Technology is top notch, with the exception of no USB ports? What was Audi thinking? Otherwise, the navigation is quite good. Interior fit and finish is superb, with great feel at every touch. The massaging and ventilated seats are a nice touch as well. Fuel economy with the V6 is excellent, at 34 mpg in a 1000 mile trip at highway speeds in excess of 75 mph. A very comfortable long haul road car. Combined mpg has been a respectable 25 mpg. The LED interior lighting is subdued and well executed. The LED headlights are piercing the night driving. If these Audis hold up well, we are certainly going to continue to be Audi repeat buyers.",5

I have never has a bad experience, but wanted a change.  It has been two months and 4,000 miles.  The Audi has delivered in every way.  I loved the test drive, but find myself learning more about the car and feeling more at at home in the Audi every time I hit start...  I got a lot more than I expected.  There is a huge difference in Japanese vs German engineering.  Design, acceleration, handling, features, air ride suspension (wow!), and the way I fit in the adjustable seat.  The A8 offers subtle and spectacular at the same time.  Don't buy a MB, BMW, or a Lexus without driving the Audi.  Definitely worth your consideration....",5

3286, on 05/16/18 12:37 PM (PDT),Robert Potter ,2015 Audi A8 Diesel L TDI quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),Dieselgate Audi," The second generation V-6 TDI is a fabulous car.  Such a shame that VW/Audi felt they had to cheat on the emissions tests, because the repairs done to meet spec had virtually no impact on the car's operation.  About all they did was set the shift points at a higher RPM.  But because of the cheating, diesel cars are probably dead in the US market.  One can make a good case that the emission standards are ridiculously high, but that's not the point.  The problem is that VW/Audi cheated to get around them...and they wouldn't have had to.  Because of all this, the value of these cars has fallen through the floor.  But if you can get one for a song, you won't be disappointed.  The car has plenty of power, handles beautifully, rides very comfortably, and gets amazing fuel economy for its size.  I have easily hit mid-40 mpg on freeway trips (at least according to the computer).  The only thing that falls down is the navigation system.  The voice activation is poor.  It often can't find a specific address.  It is slow.  Audi connect, which overlays Google Earth on the map, is a neat toy, but it is too expensive for what it is.  My other gripe is repair costs.  Once the warranty expires, this baby is going to be expensive.  It uses odd size tires...and goes through them quickly.  I think I paid about $1600 for a set of four new Michelins.  At least they are good tires.  The Pirellis that were original were horrible.  Very noisy.  And the brakes don't last very long either.  New front pads and rotors at around 30K...one independent shop quoted $1200...got them done at another for around $800.  Can't imagine what the dealer would get.  Dealer gets $100 for a set of wiper blades, for Pete's sake.  Once the Audi Care expires, routine maintenance goes to an independent.  Dealer prices are beyond belief.  But the Audi A8 diesel is truly a great car, better than the several BMW and Mercedes I've had in the past.  No regrets whatever about buying this car!",5

This change to Audi was driven by frustration of dealer practices to purchase a new Mercedes S-550/S350 Bluetec at that time a 2012/13 model. I was promised an excellent deal but after almost 4days of back/forth on price and frustration,I went looking for Audi and I'm very happy I did. The only reason for not leaving any sooner I had 4 new Benz's within the last 6yrs from that dealership. Forget about loyalty.Love what you drive. I really do. This big girl has excellent dance moves..Rain or Shine, Curves or Straights it drives like a smaller car begging to show off. Both City/Hwy MPG is impressive. I still love my Audi A8..Im am almost 2 years in on my 2nd one a 2015 A8L..these cars are problem free and the Long wheelbase is just as enjoyable as the short. I really enjoyed my 2013, but my 2015 I love. I did look again at new 2014-15 Mercedes S550 but didn't find enough merit to return to a Benz. It was nice but in my experience not better.

I have experienced an array of problems during the last three years ranging from complete power steering replacement, faulty MMI unit, electric sunshades, tiers to excessive sticky brake residue., etc. The biggest problem are the tires. Audi created the unique size of the wheel for this vehicle (265/40/R20), which is only available from Pirelli tire manufacturer in all-season configuration. There are no other all-season tires available for this vehicle from any tire manufacturer in the world. Pirelli tires are extremely noisy from the beginning with horrible traction during wet and snowy weather and they last for only 20000 miles with very slow and conservative driving.

The Audi's acceleration is like butter, the car seems to move effortlessly. I was always skeptical about whether or not the price jump from the A6 to the A8 was really worth it, but after driving both there is a big difference and I believe the cost is worth it.

For a car with 250k miles it did it's job and then some, and surprised at how it held up despite concerns about ""german reliability."" Transmission shifted a little too loosely for my taste but a quick 5 minute recodding on a scantool or VAG fixed that real quick. As a used cheap daily under $2k. It's second only to my old LS400.

Tranny shifts are slow and tall gearing can make the car feel slow when not in the correct gear.  Fuel mileage is great for a car this big at about 25 mpg average when using cruise most of the time.

It is also nice to drive a best-in-class car without the haughty stigma attached.  If we had the opportunity to drive over 130mph daily I would have considered the M5 (even though I don't like the body as much as the A8).  But now with the S8 on the way it may be a moot point.   An amazing day to day car.  (Note: Unless you are riding in the back seat, skip the L version.  The MMI is relatively easy to use.  Get the premium package if you can.)  ",4.75

I drove the MB S500, and was turned off by the BMW 7 series' awful exterior and interior styling, so I went to Audi and fell in love with the A8L, great engine, the interior is exquisite and huge, and the exterior is refined but at the same time aggressive on the front end, a perfect design by Audi, it's the best looking car on the road in my opinion. In the 3 months I have had the car I've had only one problem with the car, the MMI computer system went out suddenly one day and it took 3 days to get a new computer installed by the dealer, they say that this is a VERY rare occurance and I'm not concerned by it",4.875

But I am very disappointed in Audi Company in their technical service department and also with the National sales team.My A8 was having a electrical /mechanicalissue with the relay that controls the power brake system.My understanding is thatAudi technical support instructed the local Audi Mechanic to wrap insulation around the relay so I would not hear the relay closing and opening. The next item was to relocated the relay to another spot in the car so I would not hear the relay. Both of this approaches did not address the core issue of the problem why is the relay started working that way. Instead it appears that Audi was trying to mask the issue hope the owner would go away. This is very serious problem with this car and I would not aspect Audi would try to cover up of the issue.The next point is that I ask the local sales manager to see what Audi would do for a trade value on my car towards a newer one. The answer he give was that Audi would not help out in this matter besides not fixing the issue.Needless to say that the way Audihas handle this matter is very disappointingfor a company that is trying to make inroads in the high end market. ,3.625

It has been trouble free for the past 1.5 years and I have added 10k miles to the odometer.  I got a stage 1 tune which is a mild upgrade in power and makes the car go fast.I spotted this car online and drove almost 3 hours in heavy traffic to finally locate this car.  I was not in a good mood by the time I got to the dealership.  When they told me the car was on their auxiliary lot one mile away I almost got back in my car to leave.  The dealer grabbed a car and talked me into riding with him over to this other lot.  The moment I sat in this Audi TT and started the engine I was grinning ear to ear.  This 2012 Audi TT is new to me for one month now.  I love driving it.  My wife loves driving it and riding in it.  That is a first and quite remarkable since I have previously owned two other roadsters which she did not care to ride in or even drive.  I have had a Miata and Z4.  Both are great for driving in the mountains.  I liked the Miata for its quick nimble handling (after some suspension mods and addition of a roll bar) but it was a bit cramped and underpowered for my tastes.  The Z4 didn't lack power and had good interior room but lacked that nimble feel.  Trammeling was a bit annoying as well.  This TT is the best of both and then some.  It has the nimble handling and feel way beyond the Miata and is even a bit faster than the Z4.  It also has the interior room I want.  The sound of the engine and the fast, crisp shifts of this transmission are the best ever to me.  The Audi interior is pleasing to the eye and probably the nicest interior of any car in this class.  My only gripe so far is the Navigation/Entertainment system.  Entering an address or phone number into this radio has gotta be the most painful and cumbersome system I have ever encountered.  It works fine but plan some prep time before a trip to set up a route.  One good feature about this radio however is the screen.  It is bright and clear even in direct sunlight with the top down.  I haven't gotten to do a lot of playing yet but so far, finding some curvy roads and engaging the paddle shifters is a blast.  This car is a stress reliever from the moment I turn the key.",5

First one didn't have quattro and the car needs it to get the power to the ground. Good power, fairly good handling, not so good steering. Too boosted, most of the electric steering car now being made just can't compare to a good hydraulic system. For its size, it has good trunk space. I can fit my bike after taking off the front wheel. While I miss a manual, I am getting spoiled by the DSG box. Just work those floppy paddles. Car is reasonably priced if you don't load it up. I prefer the stock alcantrara suede.

Roof hydraulics leaked (replaced with gas struts).  About 5 cracked vacuum hoses (hard plastic) caused rough idle.  Front Oxygen sensor bad. Sway bar inserts made cracking noises. Washer fluid leaked.  Serpentine idler bearings bad. Air pump rivets cracked.  Windshield was coming delaminated.  ESP sensor was flaky (easy to disable, 1st year bad design).  All of that stuff (plus new coils, plugs, shocks, etc) was easy to find and ran about $3000 (I did most of the labor).  So now I have a 16-year-old TT that runs great as a daily driver. It's been the most fun 15000 miles I've ever had, with no signs of stopping.  Make sure the timing belt's been changed, and nobody has used the wrong fluids (it requires special tranny, Haldex, coolant, etc). Wrong fluids will ruin it.  But do it right and you'll have a cheap topless blast that never gets old.  These are destined to become classics.  Just treat it right and it'll reward you.

I blame it on the used car dealer I bought it from, who messed up quite a number of things... seems like I have run into a series of issues that are annoying, but not debilitating. Due to turbo lag and AWD it is a bit slow off the line (compared to my old Z car and 79 Trans Am), but the car is very strong in the mountains and on the highway. It is a great cruising car on the open road, and handles well up to about 110 mph. My wife and I got silly while out on the plains of eastern Colorado and tried to find out how fast it was... at 115 it was still accelerating smoothly, but the car started to feel kind of like it was floating, and we lost our nerve. My goal is to actually FIX all the minor problems I have on this car and figure out how it goes when I've got those sorted out... I refuse to be beaten by this car. It looks terrific, you don't see too many of them any more, and (when it's not driving me nuts with a minor problem) is a pleasure to drive. Experience tells me though, there aren't any ""just okay"" versions of this model year... you either got a good one and are among the huge fans of the car, or you got a money pit you can't wait to get rid of... have a mechanic you trust check the car out carefully, and you can get one heck of a car.",4

I'm constantly adjusting my seat to get comfortable, and something as minor as a different set of shoes will throw off my entire driving position.  -The electronic components do, as said, degrade.  But as long as they don't fail, it's more of an irritation than a problem.  No, I can't see all of the pixels on my trip computer and no, I don't care.-The timing belt issue is real.  Pay attention to it, or you're a fool otherwise.  But really, this boils down to simple, diligent maintenance.I bought mine at an auction house for around $8k in 2013.  It was cheaper to insure than the Subaru I'd been looking at, and did better in almost every category except passenger and storage space, which I didn't really care about.  The previous owner had maintained it meticulously - he just didn't do a good job paying for it.  When I got it, the ABS control module was out, so I had no ABS and no traction control system.  I have never bothered to fix this problem.  It's better with standard brakes, human judgment and a fantastic set of tires.  Up in Montana where I am, we have janky roads and freakish weather.  This car handles great in all weather conditions: running Nokian winter tires (no studs) in winter - excellent traction on snow and ice and Hankook tires in summer getting over 40mpg.  The steering is so excellent and responsive it's almost hard to cope with when I step into it from my truck (which has 90's GM steering).  The clutch is very forgiving, if a bit stiff, and I don't think it's very easy to stall, either.  Sound system is bang on.This is an amazing car for a driver with the right mindset.  I don't think I'd pay the price for it new, but as a pre-owned vehicle, I've never been happier.",5

Bought it used from a guy that was as meticulous with it as I am. The only issue was the timing belt. it let go and cost a good chunk to get the engine rebuilt (my fault for not changing it sooner)... better than new now. If you are looking for one, ask for receipts on repairs/upkeep!In the 9 years I've owned it... I've replaced or rebuilt: engine, fuel pump (very spendy there), drive lines, rotors and the water pump(this has plastic impellers from the factory - change out for metal impeller pump). Total about 6K in repairs... but waaay worth it. I know what issues it has had and what has been repaired... no new 'can of worms' in some other used luxury sports car! It is at 124K miles now and should last me another 145K easy! Close to 30 mpg on the highway, 24-26 in the city (depending on my driving tendencies).I still get people staring and asking about it. I have the Black/black quattro. People are blown away when i tell them it is a 2001! 14 years old and still looks better and drives better than most cookie cutter 'sports cars' put out these days.

However things started to go wrong around 60k and it was in and out of the shop for one thing or another during my last year of ownership. Small problems like faulty sensors and door locks not working to control arms breaking and some engine problems. Finally got rid of it when, at only 68k, the timing belt snapped and the top end was destroyed. I did buy it second hand with 23k on it so that could have played a huge roll since I have no idea how the previous owner treated it. Overall, good car, just have to take care of it.",3.5

Excellent braking, even in the rain. First gear is a bit sluggish, but you can really kick it in other gears. Interior comfort is excellent for a two-seater and the well-designed top keeps exterior noise to a minimum.

The car's handling was phenomenal even on wet roads and felt glued to the ground the entire way.  I love this car because of its head-turning design, handling and ability to amuse!",4.5

I drive this car HARD and so far no problems except for the instrument cluster, but this seems to be rather common. This is a fun little car which has a lot of room (I am 6'2, 300), and fits the wife and dog just fine! I would like this little coupe to have some extra horses and a 6th gear, but it handles on rails. You CANNOT beat this car in the snow.

Good thing I bought the extended warranty because I needed all I could squeeze out of it.  If my money is going to Europe, I want to go with it so I'm selling my TT.  I'll miss driving it and parking in sports car row but not the too-frequent trips to the dealer and the bite on my finances.  And I'll stop twitching when the gas warning tone goes off because I think something else has gone wrong.  This was my second German car and I'll never buy another one.

It's been practically fault-free.  Those who complain about the maintenance should know better; when you buy a German car, be prepared to pay a lot when something breaks!  This car is more VW than Audi, so parts are somewhat reasonably priced.  If not for the size, I'd definitely go for another TT!",5

The 180 hp is much too slow, so I had to add a chip and the MTM performance package.  Still too slow. I never appreciate my car more than when it snows, the TT Quattro is amazing in the snow and cold temperatures.

It's a shame that I'll be getting rid of it soon, as I am unable to afford the monthly (sometimes bi-monthly) maintenance on it. Relatively simple repairs to unnecessary luxury features (i.e., headlight washers) should not cost $500!!  I have only had repair work on these little nuisances...never anything major.

This car has a reputation for being fast and upscale. Despite a 4 cylinder, this car quickly accelerates, the AWD feature must give it an extra jump.  Smooth ride at high speeds.  AWD does indeed help in the snow. The rumbling sound gives it a race car feel.  Small enough to fit in the tiniest of parking spaces.  Leather is first rate.  BOSE sound system is awsome. Large trunk when seats are folded down.  Red interior lights are cool. Downsides: 0 legroom in back, this car is made for 2 and  a couple of dogs.  Expensive oil changes.",5

Once you punch the accelerator, it downshifts quickly and performance is great. In sport mode, the car drives perfectly, shifting smoothly with incredible acceleration.

I've owned or leased 2 first generation, 3 second generation and now my third generation TT.  This is the best yet in all respects:  design, performance, miles-per-gallon, technology and fun.  Even one of my relatives who is not a car person marveled at the car and was especially impressed with the safety features, including the blind spot warning feature.  It's beautiful on the outside with just enough edge to keep it fresh but still maintains the overall sophistication and timeless design of the original.  It hugs the road like no other, and I find myself accelerating into curves.  The seats are exceptionally comfortable and adjustable.  I'm not a race care driver, but I've certainly had no trouble getting this car up to 70-80 MPH in no time at all.  I still love the automatic spoiler.  But it's the technology that's the true star.  The virtual cockpit is amazing.  While it took my maybe half a day to get used to it (definitely worth reading the owner's manual), once I did, it became intuitive.  You barely have to take your eyes off the road (just a simple glance down) and never have to take your hands off the wheel to manage any and all functions.  While not necessary, I have opted for Audi Connect and find myself using it more than I thought I would.  I especially like that I can have the system read my texts and emails to me out loud.  I feel obligated to find something to criticize; the only thing I would request is to be able to adjust the lumbar support up and down more -- a wider range of vertical motion.

I drove a Z4 and and a Boxster (tiptronic) for comparison.  TT won out on styling, interior quality and what I would label as 80% driving - that stuff we all do during our daily trips around town.  Z4 was a close competitor, but I just couldn't get used to the looks.  Boxster (with tiptronic) was a dog to drive around town, and it's interior was pretty spartan (read cheap looking) compared to the other two. ",4.875

Having said that it is fast enough to eat most other traffic for breakfast and great fun on rural roads - especially if there are no proper corners.

From experience, when a typical American is faced with a knob, switch or lever we are not familiar with, what do we do...we wrench, wiggle, push and pull on it until we brake it.

Instrument cluster fails, fuel cell broken 3x, automatic window motor goes out.

4017, on 08/01/18 16:05 PM (PDT),Mark ,2008 Audi TT Convertible 3.2 quattro 2dr Convertible AWD (3.2L 6cyl 6AM),Mine mine all mine!," This is my Audi TT 3.2L quattro cabriolet.  I've owned it for multiple years now and every time I think I want to look at other cars for a possible trade, I get in and drive and realize it still holds my heart.  This is a nice little sports car that gives great handling, great acceleration and puts a smile on the face of the driver.  Every time.  I did extensive searching when I made the change from my previous car ('99 Sebring convertible) and was determined to have another convertible.  I looked at just about every convertible in the market at that time and no other had the combination of perks and handling for which I searched.  Once that decision was made, finding this car took another six months--there just weren't that many with the 3.2L engine out there that were for sale!  I ended up having it shipped from Chicago down to the Dallas area.  Since then it has been my daily driver and I have learned all its quirks and joys.  Its acceleration is beyond fun and when I put it into launch mode, it borders on scary.  I know many complain that an automatic transmission is just boring, but for my needs I find it to be just right.  And when I want to get aggressive with my driving, going into Sport mode and using those flappy paddles is just great.            CONS:  One thing I have noted as a minus is the ease of tires braking loose during heavy braking.  It took me a while to get used to how the brakes work on this car, but once that was done, it's been resolved.  My only real complaint I would lodge against the car is the navigation system, but I have the same gripe on every other car I've driven that includes it (Audi A8L, Chevrolet Impala and Malibu).  The nav systems are ALL slow to respond, much less helpful than a Garmin or other dedicated GPS.  For that reason, I've always maintained a Garmin, especially for trips.         MAINTENANCE has not been too much of a problem with this car, but I would note I have had issues with the convertible action.  While still under warranty I had the motors for that replaced.  There also seems to be a real issue with keeping the top down sensor adjusted correctly and has had to be serviced on multiple occasions.  Their statement that you can be driving up to 18 mph and open/close the top is a LIE, so much so that their technicians state I should only actuate the roof when parked on a level surface with the brake held in place.  Perhaps in the past decade they have repaired that function, but I would suspect not.  I will be needing to take it in to get this irritation looked at AGAIN.  As it stands presently, I frequently have to spend a couple of minutes lowering/raising/lowering the top until the status light goes out.  If I don't it beeps out a warning that the top is not completely opened every couple of minutes--very irritating.  IN CONCLUSION, I would say this is a great little car to drive and I would recommend you try one out before just putting thoughts of a TT out of your mind since it's not a BMW or Benz or whatever else you might be considering.  You might be pleasantly surprised.",5

The 2008 coupe (3.2 quattro with S-tronic) is a step above the previous models in every respect: power, handling, styling, sophistication, fun.

B&O stereo is very nice but don't pass on the standard Audi stereo as that too sounds goodUpdate 8/23/16 Still love the A5 but one has to wonder if the people who design these cars actually drive them. For instance the window drops down when you open the car. Know what happens in the winter when at work when it sleets out. The window freezes up and will not drop down so you can't open the door, or if you can open the door you can't close it. Of course remote start would help but Audi will not offer one even though  VW does. Another thing, eighteen inch low profile tires. I'm on the third set in 20,000 miles.  Hitting a pot hole rattles the fillings, and then you can expect side wall damage or an outright blowout. Does not matter what brand of tire either. Water pump failure at 30K would cost over $1000 if not under warranty.  Crank case ventilation valve bad at 35K have to replace the entire valve cover, really? Yep.  Warped brake rotors a 35K miles.

I really liked BMW’s evolution to hardtop convertibles until I bought my Audi A5.  The soft top is every bit as quiet as the hardtop convertibles, but the additional trunk space when the top is down is significant (means I can get my golf clubs in the trunk versus back seat)!  The power in the A5 is quite impressive, and I have even gotten up to 38 MPG on the highway.  This is a very smooth driving and accelerating car, with slightly less road feel that my 05 BMW 3 series, but comparable feel to the BMW 4 series.  The technology and sound system are second to none, and I have found them very user friendly and easy to learn and use.  With the wind stop in place and windows up with the top down, there is minimal wind buffeting.  If too hot, the ventilated seats keep you much cooler (BMW does not have this helpful feature).

The acceleration and comfort of the drive is phenomenal. You’ll be doing 100 and not even realize it! The aerodynamic styling is very sharp looking. On the negative side the cup holders in front are in a bad location, they block some of the controls.  The glove box has lost some space from previous years, the owner’s manual doesn’t even fit in it. The small storage box to the left of the steeling wheel also is to small for the owners manual. The pockets on the door awkward to get items in and out. Overall the car is fun to drive in the summer (I have yet to own it during a winter season).",3

4086, on 07/19/18 13:36 PM (PDT),Don Husted ,2018 Audi A5 Convertible Premium Plus quattro 2dr Convertible AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Too New To Know," This is my 4th convertible.  They were/are 1964 Ford 500 XL (a big boat of a car), 1976 Fiat Spyder (a real fun car), 1997 Sebring (a sedan with a top that went down) and the Audi 5A.  The ""car"" before the Audi was a Rav4 SUV.  (Also a couple of station wagons along the way between convertibles.)  Stepping up in size is not a problem, stepping down is taking some getting use to.  With less than one month ownership I have taken a trip from Chicago area around Lake Michigan and a second trip to Door County in WI.  I am learning that a 77 year old body is not as flexible as a 35 year old one.  Getting in, sitting and driving is not the problem.  It is getting out after a few hours of driving.  One problem is blocking the sun with the top up or down.  The driver sun screen is very small.  The Rav4 had a sun screen that when on the side window could be slide back to do a good job of blocking the sun from the side.  The Audi does not.  Most of the other ""issues"" with the car are due to lack of knowledge and education.  Hopefully these will decrease with time.  Biggest problem is finding cheap high octane gasoline for the car.  Pulled into one station where regular was $2.83 and the hi test was $3.83.  I did not buy there.  But still paying 40 to 70 cents a gallon more.  Have been told mid-grade gasoline should do an adequate job.  Will try that since it is only about 20 cents more than regular.",4

Obviously this is the first redesign. Wow !!! is all I can say. The car is fantastic, solid, bold, head turning, powerful enough, just a joy to get behind the wheel of. Yes the tech is overwhelming and lots to learn but I am getting it. Its a great combo of luxury and sport. I own a 2017 E Class Benz. That car cannot hold a candle to this one. Night and day in my opinion. Having a soft top gives you lots of trunk space even the top is down. I have seen a convertible that has more trunk space. Audi nailed it on this one.",5

The technology for both the entertainment and the driving systems is fantastic. It takes a little while to learn where all the menu items are and what they all do. But well worth the learning involved. And I get envious looks every time I drive it. I have read some reviews that adults can sit in the back seat.

4090, on 06/29/17 05:11 AM (PDT),Roger Baim ,2018 Audi A5 Convertible Prestige quattro 2dr Convertible AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Worthwhile Upgrade From 2014 Audi A5 Cabriolet," This is my second consecutive Audi A5 Cabriolet and I'm an enthusiastic supporter of this car.  I traded out of my low mileage 2014 model entirely based on the migration of virtually all of the latest technology & safety features from the higher end Audi models to the current A4 & A5 platforms.  Especially important to me was inclusion of Audi's version of cross traffic (rear) monitoring; although my 2014 had ""Blind Spot Monitoring"", this back-up feature was not previously available in the A5.  IMO, this is an almost essential safety feature where I live because of the number of large cars & pick-up trucks which make backing out of parking spaces a nightmare.  I also enjoy the convenience of the Heads Up Display and the Virtual Cockpit rendering of the main display.  The optional adaptive cruise control provides semi-autonomous driving and has been of great assistance while driving in the stop and go traffic conditions which I encounter on a daily basis. The 2018 model has a more powerful engine and there has been further improvement of the suspension system.  My Prestige trim level's insulated cloth top now provides better sound insulation than in the 2014 model and there has been an improvement in the way in which the top stores in the trunk (relative to storage capacity).  I preferred the more classic body style of the 2014 A5, as the newly sharpened/enhanced sheet metal lines seem only to have been changed to compete with BMW & M-B.  I truly dislike what has been done to the interior of the car.  Compared to the ""quiet"" and integrated European appearance of the 2014 A5.  To me, the straight across dashboard of the 2018 looks like a mid-80s GM product.  Optional wood veneers shriek ""plastic"" and the standard shiny metal trim doesn't match the other metallic components in the cockpit.  I'm not a fan of the new non-retractable separate (top center dash mounted) display screen which has become favored by European makers; note that this display is NOT a touch screen, but is controlled by a large (""MMI"") knob in the center console.  It is convenient, however, to be able to show different displays on this screen and the virtual cockpit, giving the driver exceptional control of information.  The 2018 A5 accepts Android Auto and Apple Car Play and there is seamless integration of these programs with regards to navigation and media; unfortunately, Audi does not currently permit ""Waze"" or other non-media applications in Android Auto (compared with other manufacturers).   My biggest disappointment is with the lack of interior space in the cabin.  The glove box is now essentially useless, as Audi has moved the bulky CD & SD card player to that location from the center stack; there isn't even enough room to put the owner's manual case there (I've NEVER owned a car with that limitation).   The center console storage space is VERY shallow and not completely covered by the adjustable center arm rest; a small covered cubbyhole is provided in the lower dash to the left of the driver in a location which is not easy to safely access while driving.  Please note that Audi does not provide ANY ability to equip the A5 with an ash tray & lighter/receptacle, not even as a build option when ordering the car to specifications from Germany (this option is available in Europe).  It seems that there was little (if any) input from actual drivers regarding these convenience features.  Setting aside my complaints about the shortcomings of the interior space, I absolutely LOVE the 2018 A5.  Its combination of all precise wheel drive handling in any weather/road condition, more powerful engine and outstanding/state-of-the-art technology made it a no-brainer for me to upgrade from an already superb 2014 A5 Cabriolet.",5

Only downsides I have are smaller back seats that barely handle children and unexpectedly lower gas mileage. I can only imagine it’s gas mileage was based in a cool climate where the start stop function could be utilized. I’m in AZ where the AC is used all the time so the start/stop does not work while that’s on, therefore gas mileage is closer to high teens low 20’s if you drive very conservatively. Other than those 2 items, this is an amazing vehicle!",5

I became tired of the heavy and long doors getting in and out of parking spaces, and missed having an easy to use touchscreen.  Also, the Google gps is cool but over time impractable.  I didn’t need to see stuff so far to the left and right as laid out horizontally on the dash. Finally, the Audi dealer would not refund the maintenance plan a month after we bought it.  Very inflexible dealer.  I traded for the new and much larger Volvo S90 and love it.  For the same cost, it has Auto pilot and a huge touch screen similar to the Tesla.  It also has a huge back seat and drives like the Audi and with same gas mileage.  I’m much happier with my Volvo and use the auto pilot all the time.  I no longer mess with the Audi mouse and click on my touch screen directly.  Also, the screen is vertical so I can see more of what’s ahead of me and not wasted space like in the Audi screen.  Lastly, the Volvo has amazing headlights that turn with auto bright at night that makes night look like day.",3
4093, on 12/13/17 21:36 PM (PST),Tireguy ,2018 Audi A5 Coupe Prestige quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Love this car," So I'm pretty frugal. And when my 2000 Volkswagen Jetta 1.8 T finally died 17 years after I bought it brand new, I figured it was time for an upgrade.   I skipped VW and went straight to the Audi dealership. The S8 was lovely, but a bit out of my price range. The A3, with that high roof, looked too much like my old Jetta.  It would make a nice Pope-mobile. And then there sat the A5. The four door is nice but I wasn't going to be hauling my family around in this car. We have a Yukon XL for that. This one is just to move my butt up and down the George Washington Parkway, alone, in comfort--it had to be a Coupe.   If you compare the coupe to the sportback, well there is no contest. I guess if you have  three kids, you may be compelled to buy the sportback, which gives you an extra seat in the middle. I have more than three kids, so I might as well have been buying a Ducati. I was a little apprehensive about the 2.0T, which powers quite a few smaller VWs in lesser forms, but this car flies: 0-60 in 5 sec.  Good enough for me, who has no plans to take it to the drag strip.  It's a great car.",5

My last one was a 2010, and I loved the car - but it had gotten long in the tooth. The 2018 prestige coupe seems much better mechanically than the 2010, and both the engine and transmission are incredible. In addition, the car seems much quicker than the statistics Audi publishes, particularly in the sport mode. The steering is also very good for electric steering, and isn't too light and doesn't entirely lack road feel as many do. The electronics are also superb. In addition, the cabin materials are exceptional, and the fit and finish seems as perfect as a car can be. On the less than great side, the flat dash with the MMI screen stuck to it is sort of generic looking, and I don't think it is anywhere near as nicely designed as in the previous model. The appearance of the interior is nice, but that's about all it is. Also, the redesigned body appearance is, in my view, just okay. I used to like just looking at my dark metallic blue 2010 A5, and I thought it was truly beautiful; the 2018 model's appearance is less than awe inspiring, and lacks the uniqueness and character of the model it replaced. That's true of the interior design as well. Both are sort of bland, and there's nothing about them that stands out from the crowd. This is a car that is very good in all respects, but isn't exceptional or exciting in any respect.",4

The car is very, very quiet on decent roads, and the interior is immaculate.  It's not something you'll use to haul more than 2 people around for more than a few miles at a time, and I knew this going in.  The storage room is exceptional for this size of car.  Quattro system really makes you feel confident on the road.  I absolutely love the look of this car both inside and out.  The base safety systems that come with this car are very nice to have.  Frustrations are few but I'll note them now.  First, I wish they'd have made the gas tank a few gallons bigger, as I feel like range is too short if you're driving in the city.  I am replacing a 2009 Acura TSX which had about a 16 gal tank, so it's a bit annoying.  Second, Apple Carplay is really convenient and one reason I bought the car.  However, it's glitchy.  I don't know if it's Carplay in general, or as it relates to Audi, but they have programming problems that need fixes.  It glitches out after Audi Presense is engaged, requiring you to unplug and replug your phone in to get it to work.  Even with a brand new Apple cord, it fails to connect at times.  I've had problems with it freezing, or crashing my phone while in the middle of navigation.  I don't know if this is primarily an apple problem or an audi problem, but it can be maddening at times.  I have an Iphone 6+, so it is a relatively 'older' phone, maybe that's some of it.  Also, I was using 3rd party app Pandora, it could be from that.  Last complaint is that basic front of cockpit storage is pretty inadequate.  No sunglass storage, very little center console storage (probably for the better so I don't stash useless things).  If I can get the Carplay glitches worked out I would say I'm completely happy with the car.  The virtual cockpit is fun and useful, the large on dash screen as well, and the MMI system is very user friendly.",4

I love the MMI navigation and controls. My only complaint is the subscription based services for the Infotainment system should be monthly not paid in 3 year blocks. Also, the entire online and app integration isn't what you'd expect at this price point. The traditional auto makers need to take a lesson from Tesla on on-line/offline access.

The A5 is a driving car and I've read reviews where people thought the controls weren't convenient but they are precisely where they should be.

However, I have to say that the 2015 Audi A5 was a huge disappointment for me. Sure, the car is stylish on the outside and the performance is quite good, but Audi didn't live to the expectations with the interior and controls design. I bought the A5 Premium Plus with the Technology Package.Here is the good:- Stylish exterior- Great engine performance- Good MPG performance as related to the HP of the engine- High quality interior materials- Premium sound is amazingHere is the bad:- The controls are quite confusing. It is difficult to navigate the overall controls and features. Any system that forces you to look down to find a specific button is plain dangerous. All controls for the Multimedia system are on the center console between the driver and passenger.- Voice recognition is poor, even after going through the 5-minute voice training program.- Integration with Bluetooth devices is poor. I had to constantly turn off and turn on the Bluetooth on my iPhone for the car to pick it up. It does not happen on my wife's Honda Odyssey.- Maps on the navigation system are quite old; streets that are over 3-years old do not show up on the map.- There is only one usable cup-holder on the front. For some strange reason, Audi decided to include a cup holder in which only a baby bottle would fit.- No touch-screen functionality. Everything is controlled through a joystick in the center console, forcing you to look down whenever you want to adjust anything on the car.- If you use Spotify, Pandora, or any other music service through Bluetooth, the system does not allow you to skip tracks with the steering-wheel-mounted controls. You have to use the center console.- The steering-wheel controls are track-wheels instead of levers and buttons. They are very sensitive to the touch and you have to be careful not to roll the wheel more than one notch.- No USB ports. Only SD card slot (who uses a SD Card slot for music anyways?)I got rid of my Audi A5 just after 9 months. It was just to uncomfortable and awkward to control. Hope this review helps you.",3

The car is incredibly functional with all wheel drive, comfortable interior, great looks and good fuel economy.  The convertible works effortlessly, and it is incredibly quiet with the top up, as well as warm during the winter.  The attention to detail is exceptional with high quality materials and options that will impress most drivers.  The car is very competent on the road at high speeds, but does equally well as a relaxed touring car at slower speeds with the top down.  I never thought I would ever enjoy owning a car like this, especially driving it year-round!  I picked mine up used with very low miles, and for the price it was just too good to pass up.  It still has the balance of the factory warranty, and the dealer has been great so far.A few highlights: The Bang and Olufsen stereo will not disappoint, even with the top down.  The MMI Nav system has an incredible amount of features, but it does take time to master, so keep your owner's manual close.  The heated seats coupled with the neck warmers and wind deflector will keep you cozy with the top down even on very cold days.  The Quattro system is incredibly competent on slippery roads.  This is just such a complete package in a convertible that's designed to be used as a daily driver.Audi's quality seems to have increased significantly in recent years, so hopefully the car will stand the test of time.  So far I have had great luck with the dealer for servicing.  Seems as though Audi is trying very hard to compete successfully against the other luxury brands.Update on 7/19/16:  Been putting a lot of miles on the A5, and now at 21,000.  It continues to be a great car to own.  I did need to replace the tires though because of an alignment issue which caused the Pirellis to make a lot of noise.  Other than that, it has been pretty much a trouble free ride with up to 30 mpg on the highway.  It's an easy car to live with on a daily basis.Update on 1/20/17:  Miles are now at 27,000 and the Audi continues to be trouble free.  I put a set of Michelin Alpin Sports on for winter, and the car is wonderfully competent on slippery roads.  A small disappointment is the sound quality of SiriusXM, especially when compared to HD FM stations and CDs.  SiriusXM does not allow the sounds system to show off all it can truly do.  Other than that, I do enjoy owning this vehicle a lot.  I can't wait until it's warm enough again to put the top down!Update on 1/23/18:  Miles are now at 42,000.  The last year has been relatively trouble-free with the A5.  The only issue was a bad fuel injector that was replaced under warranty.  Other than that, the car continues to be a delight to own and drive.  The mileage continues to be very good, it's always enjoyable to drive, and it goes like a tank in the winter.  If you're thinking about purchasing an A5 cabrio, I would highly recommend it.  It's a very easy car to live with regardless of the season.",5

It definitely can get out of its own way, but on the average it gets 30 mpg.  Much better than my Passat (but I'm still keeping that too).  It's about as quiet as my Passat when the top is up.  It has useful storage with the back seats down.  This will be my daily driver in PA, and it's quite capable of doing that.",5

I love to drop the top and drive this car, if I do not have an errand, I'll cruise to Home Depot for a stroll. It's a bit underpowered if you want to be the first off the line at a redlight, but all the looks and functionality far make up for it. Regarding a comment about the soft top wearing out early, I cannot support that review. I'm on the original soft top at 77000 miles and it show no wear or disintegration. Plainly stated, it is fun drive and my best car buy of my life.UPDATE: I'm now a 60+ guy. I still have the same love for this car. I ""find"" opportunities to go to Home Depot so that I can drop the top and enjoy the Spring weather in Texas. Sadly, the glue that held in the back window failed and of course we had heavy rains. I ended up replacing the soft top and the interior carpet. The good news: my State Farm Insurance covered it.  For me, this car is part of ""Living the good life!"".",5

It will cost you approximately $ 8,000 to get a new one. My dealership got it down to $ 4,000 .I am suspicious . It is not covered in the warranty.Otherwise I have enjoyed driving this car. It is a 2010 A5 with 25,000 miles up. I am hardly ever here hence the low mileage. It is parked in the garage of my building. It does not receive any bad weather and is hand washed.My only other gripe is that you cannot pop the trunk from inside the vehicle. I was going to buy another Audi . Maybe an A7 .  Now I am thinking that because Audi made no attempt to explain why my convertible top had to be replaced .I can no longer trust Audi . If that happens , what else could happen?

Wish had test driven quattro more, but in short supply at dealers.  Have had top issue from factory not installing hydraulic lines for top appropriately.  Otherwise, I love this car.  Would have given up some of the fantastic millage for performance and real transmission.  Audi missed here and now I can't afford to change.

If you want a car that's a complete eye catcher, decent fuel economy, and just fun to get in everyday, this is a great choice. The only thing it lack is a little more power. That is easily fixed with an ECU tune, bringing the car from 211 hp to 240, and 258 tq, to 333 tq. That is is more tq than an S5, and makes the V6 middle option a complete waste of money.

Back seat access isn't great (not bad -  it's great for a coupe) but room when in is satisfactory.  Mileage is adequate if gentle - it's a function of fun:  more fun, lower mileage.  No question: best awd coupe for <$75k.",4.625

It takes some sports car queues and blends them into the coupe in a way no other manufacturer has done as of late. The main attraction are the LED's.

Interior design is peerless, controls perfect and intuitive, fit and finish defines fit and finish. Audi design doing in the auto world what Apple computers did in the computer world.

The system is WAY better than iDrive and the instruments are easy to use. It looks great, drives great and (as usual) is a completely reliable performance vehicle. Not a single issue.  Only drawback are the seats. Read a lot about the regular (non S-Line) seats before I bought and still went with the standard seats. Coming from the Lexus, I had a really hard time with back and hip pain in the Audi seats. Tough comparison from a Lexus SUV to a sports car, but wishing for better comfort.",4.75

Acceleration and handling are good but there are certainly cars with better. Got to test out the Quattro last month in some serious snow and ice... and it was unbelievable.

It did have an oil burning issue that is common to certain years of a4/a5/q5 with the 2.0t engine.  This was fixed under warranty without issue and the car hasn't burnt a drop of oil since.  Only other unscheduled maintenance in 4 years was a pcv valve that recently went bad and started making a screeching noise ($350 iirc).  Overall at 73k miles now it has been very reliable, maybe moreso than expected, given my previous experience with owning vw/Audi, knock on wood.  The car is on its 3rd set of tires, and I have not replaced brake pads and rotors yet in the 4 years and 50k miles I have owned it. City driving will give 21-22 mpg, with 30+ on the freeway (I've gotten over 500 miles on a tank before).  The car is not fast but it is quick enough, and handles well.  The build quality is great, especially interior materials, with no significant rattles on what is almost a 6 year old car.  Rear seat space is good for a two door - I am 6'2 and have ridden back there comfortably on reasonably short trips.  Trunk is large for a coupe.  If I could change anything, it would be to have the sunroof open and not just tilt.  Bluetooth audio would also be nice, not just phone compatibility. I am still a huge fan of the a5's styling and think it will look classic for years to come.  I plan to keep it for at least a few more years.  Overall I would highly recommend this car to a prospective buyer, just make sure it has has the piston ring/oil consumption repair done under warranty!",5

Acceleration is fun but only when the transmission is in the sport mode but the Quattro handling is on point 100% of the time. The trunk size is better than in the 3 series coupe but rear seating room is minimal and don't even try putting a rear facing car seat in if you'd like to have a front passenger. The front seats are comfortable and plenty of leg room is provided. As far as the layout of the entertainment system, it could have been better thought out because it is confusing but the sound quality is great.

I drive a lot (20k per year) and I must say driving this car is miserable. On the commute in stop and go traffic the turbo lag and engagement is severe.

The iPod cable is in the passenger glove box and is horrible to use an you will forget your phone every time should you plug it in. The Sounds system is good but the base rattles every plastic piece.

The only major disappointment in this vehicle has been the mileage.  It has averaged probably less than 20 MPG (I mostly drive city), and even a fuel tank with 100% freeway miles is probably only averaging 25 or 26 MPG, which isn't great.  Still, that's a minor quibble.  The engine has been a complete dream. No problems whatsoever.  the only glitches on the vehicle have been a leaking washer fluid gasket on the high pressure headlights, a broken elastic piece on the glovebox door, and a loose door handle on the driver's side.

Small crap, but still, you need to take it in like most German vehicles. Electronics, brake squeals, AC issues, electric window motor, engine computer idle issues, and so on. But, if this car were stolen today, I'd buy another one later today. Better looks and ride than BMW 3 series, but consider the V8 S4, which doesn't have the power robbing CVTransmission.

The trunk is one of the roomier ones for a convertible. With all options it is pricey.  I cannot help but feel that with this kind of quality, the resale value for Audi A4 Cabriolet will rise significantly.  This is a car well above what I thought an Audi might be.

The transmission shifts effortlesly and the power in the 3.0 is naughty (great).  When you accelerate, this engine gives that low gurgley noise of a powerful engine.

You notice the small things on detail over time (like the hangers in the trunk for groceries packed in plastic bags and the A4 manual compartment under the steering wheel, to keep you glove box empty and ready for anything you want.

If you are looking for a red light racer, keep looking.  If you want a car that handles VERY well, accelerates good enough, but does so with a classy, polished feel, then this is a car you should check out.  The sport package gives the A4 a flat, smooth ride, balanced handling, and good cornering.  The AWD and ESP provides the driver with confidence in snowy, slushy, and icy conditions.  I average 33 mpg highway (at 70mph)/23 city stop and go.  Interior is superb with everything right where you want it.

The 2.0 T and the new transmission work together for power and excellent gas mileage (the EPA projections are pretty darn close to right so far.) The quattro drive was probably the tipper over the other cars, providing more stability in the curves. If I had a few more available bucks, I would have definitely gone with the convertible version.

No bottom ""spoiler thing"" under the front bumper to help the bumper rip off on those parking lot curbs (yes, I ripped the old one off).

Test drive both and you will see what I am talking about.  I drove the 2.0T first and liked it, then I drove the 3.2 and had to have it.

To me, it feels like a $50,000 car. Real solid. However, I can't stand the center console. It's positioned so that my leg room is restricted and makes driving almost a miserable experience. I thought I can get over it but so far with 1,100 miles, I hate it. Way to uncomfortable. Gas mileage is horrible. My other Audi was incredible with MPG but this one is worse than a SUV. Seriously. It's very disappointing. I'm taking it to the dealer soon but Audi has never been famous for their customer service. LEASE these cars only and give them back before the warranty expires!",3.625

Recently, the programmable radio buttons and MMI began to malfunction.  I brought it in for service expecting a repair under warranty and was told that the problem was “likely” due to liquids spilling onto the buttons, not covered by the warranty.  I would tend to agree with this diagnosis BECAUSE the radio buttons are positioned directly next to the cup holders.  It is almost impossible to avoid spilling liquid into the buttons because of this design.  Even the motion of the car with a cup of liquid in the holder could easily cause liquid to spill into the radio buttons.  Nevertheless, this is clearly a design flaw with the center console.  I have been a computer engineer since 1983 therefore my ability to recognize a user interface design issue is my business.  But it doesn’t take an engineer to recognize the poor design of the center console.  I contacted Audi customer support AudiCustomerExperienceCenter@audi.com and after waiting almost two months, the customer service rep never bothered to provide a final response.  Instead, I had to escalate, searching the internet for another way to contact Audi, who agreed to cover only the parts ($600) but not the labor costs ($300).  I did not accept this offer because the design of the center console is the cause of this issue because it’s inevitable that liquid will spill into the radio buttons given that they are positioned right next to the cup holder.  So there you have it.  Audi has decided to lose a customer for $300 over what in my opinion and experience is a design flaw.  This is my second A4.  The cup holder of the 2012 A4 was NOT positioned next to the radio buttons.  In 2017 Audi changed the console and created this problem.",1

The value proposition on the Audi surpassed the others. Living in the N.E. AWD is a must, so the Quattro option Premium Plus was the best deal for me. The fit and finish is excellent. Yes, the exterior may be a bit conservative compared to the others in the segment - but it's classy without being gaudy. The interior is a technical marvel. The Virtual Cockpit has to be seen to be believed, none of the competitors can match Audi's current tech and Google Earth maps. Apple Car Play works seamlessly and the MMI system is fairly intuitive. With the exception of the Acura, the rival cars get pricey when you add the tech and safety features already in the Premium Plus version of the Audi A4. The ride and handling is very good, granted the BMW still shines in this area - but their tech is somewhat dated. In addition, the A4 cabin is very quiet and inviting. The 19 speaker Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system is remarkable, it sounds like your virtually in a live concert. The Acura A-Spec is the probably the best value proposition and has more horses but lacks the refinement of the Audi and Acura's duel screen infotainment system seems dated even though refreshed in 2017.

While the ride is firm, the driving feels light and with purpose.  The acceleration is exhilarating and fast.  The braking is trusted and precise.  Maneuvering this car is so effortless, it makes race car drivers out of everyone.  The overall external look is understated yet well designed with luxury and sportiness in mind.  The internal is simple and nicely laid out but with technology oozing and quality materials and standard leather seats cradling you every time you drive.  The MMI is simply the best and easiest to use.   I'm running out of superlatives to use, but don't just read this review, go and actually drive one, and all the others like BMWs and the Benzes, and you will more than likely come to the same conclusion.UPDATE:  After over a year of driving the A4, it still drives so fine and fast.  Had my yearly maintenance.  No issues found.  The A4 is such an amazing machine that you don't have to think about or even worry that something will conk out.  Acceleration is still fluid and fast.  Transmission shifts crisply.  Car electronics works as advertised.  Yay to the A4.  A solid and refined sporty car.  Update: it’s been 9 months and I’m still loving my A4. It’s like coming home when I get into it. All the controls are in the right place. It’s still zippy fast and the gas mileage compared to my previous Acura MDX has been a godsend. It’s very easy to love the A4. It just works and it does it very well.",5

Completely unacceptable in my opinion.   We had a Mercedes C300, traded it for the Audi A4.  We will go back to Mercedes with the next purchase.  Audi has attempted unsuccessfully to find the non-acceleration problem.",3
4561, on 04/26/17 09:44 AM (PDT),Krish ,2017 Audi A4 Sedan 2.0 TFSI Premium quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Sport Package makes a world of difference," I have owned 2 x 2017 Audi A4 in the span of 6 months. I traded in a 2013 BMW 320i with Stage 1 Dinan 6 speed manual (comparable to stock 328 i) for 2017 Audi A4 Premium Quattro. When I did the test drive, I drove the one with sport package and Premium Plus trim. I chose this car over Lexus IS 350/IS200t/IS300 , Jaguar XE, BMW 328i and BMW 340i(yeah!) first time around. the key reason was the responsiveness of 7 speed Dual Clutch transmission(coming from manual). Although other brands have numbers behind them, the transmission-engine combination can challenge the higher engine trim Jaguars and BMWs and it is way more refined. The Quattro system is obvious while cornering or taking turns with confidence, especially when it is wet. Dallas toll roads can be very prone to hydroplaning and boy, does it rain hard here.   First time around.. to save costs, I went with the Premium.  The car drove well(super quick with launch control and sport mode, paddles), but I was not happy with the speakers and sound system, although I am far from being an audiophile and I was not a fan of the base system and I was not a fan of the Ibis white exterior without the S-Line trim. So decided to bite the bullet and trade it in with 6200 miles and 6 months of ownership for 2017 A4 with Premium Plus/-Quattro with Sport Package. Although sport suspension and seats don't seem to make a difference on paper, they make a big difference in the way this car handles. I don't have the adaptive damper package which is available in Prestige trim, but this suspension is how this car should be in the first place. It is way more planted without being jarring and a ride quality/comfort above anything else in its genre. But coming from BMW, this is more close to the handling I am used to. I am a happy camper now. I love the Android Auto/Apple CarPlay with the Bang and Olufsen 3D sound. I personally stayed away from Tech Package(although cool and envy inducing and great conversation piece) since in my opinion, it is a little too risky to have in a first year German vehicle...So bottom line is for those normal people(not the trackers and oversteer/opposite lock enthusiats) migrating from BMW and convinced about 2017 A4(which should  not be difficult  ), I would highly recommend checking the Sport Package and Quattro. For someone with slightly elevated sense of sportiness in a car, it is a perfect fit for me. Also, I have lost money on Premium to warrant such an opinion, I guess..:-)",5

BMW may be sportier, while Lexus may be more comfort, for me this is the best of both worlds.   I've only had two weeks but love the ride, acceleration, and he included features. Comfortable seats. Nice cockpit. Overall exterior design is great.   Only negative as some have mentioned is that there appears to be some kind of lag when first hitting the accelerator which I'm still getting used to. But once it gets going, even the 190hp engine is pretty decent.",5
4563, on 02/23/17 21:22 PM (PST),Chase ,2017 Audi A4 Sedan 2.0 TFSI Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Definitely not a driver's car," Excellent design inside the cabin and exterior- good materials and quality. The tech is top of the class but if you enjoy driving this is not the car for you. Too often on long trips and such will behave like a fwd vehicle, the steering sucks even with the sport package (no way to fix that dead on center Audi feel- it's not old Lincoln bad by any means but not in league with Mercedes' , BMW's, Cadillac's, etc...) , the suspension is not close to what the three series has (I even opted for the adaptive one) - this has been the most disappointing car for me that I have ever purchased -mainly because I want to love it as it is the only one that checked all the boxes on what I wanted (tech features , bang and olufsen sound system, top safety pick, great real world fuel economy, love the looks, etc) Driving around town it can be a lot of fun but if you aren't constantly pushing the car then it loses any illusion of a sporting nature and becomes a very bland drive. If they could get it to have the road manners it does when pushed all the time then it would be an awesome vehicle , just disappointing otherwise.- Update- I got rid of the vehicle and got an Alfa Romeo Giulia and have not looked back; the interior is not finished as nicely as the A4 and the rear seat legroom is not quite as big but drive one and you’ll understand. Hopefully Audi can learn from corporate cousin Porsche how to make a vehicle that actually feels nice to drive- they have some of the best styling in the industry and fit and finish is great as well.",2

Imho it's the best value in the small luxury sport sedan class this year.   I have the premium plus trim and it has almost everything you would want.  But if you want all possible safety features you will need to step up to the prestige trim. Also the interior LED lights that allow you to change color is only on the prestige, the premium plus has only the white interior LED lights.  Some web sites say the car is slow off the line... I haven't noticed.  It feels amazingly smooth and easily goes 0-60 in 5 secs.   Also some sites have dinged the car for non responsive steering and again I disagree.  The car feels nimble and smooth weaving in and out of traffic.  My previous car was a 6 cylinder Infiniti g35 this car feels faster and more agile and does 10mpg better fuel efficiency.  I did one long trip out the car on comfort ride and did 33mpg averaging around 75 mph.   One thing I think could be better is the engine auto off... It's very noticable and the car feels like its stalling .   It can be shut off but I assume it will effect fuel economy.",5

I owned the current generation Passat, but traded it in a few years ago for a 328i. I loved the beemer and always missed the Passat for its all around good road manners and build quality. Needless to say the Audi is a finer automobile than the Passat with similarities. This is our 3rd Audi in 10 years. They are underrated. This is as good as it gets for a mid sized sedan. And it's design, inside and out is classic and practical, and will look good on the road for years. The new generation should have had a little more standout change. You will be very pleased with your gas mileage. Once you buy a German made vehicle you will find it difficult to settle for anything else.....in my opinion. And my updated review: 6 months later. I grew very bored of this Audi, because, well, it's boring. It is actually little better, if at all,than the Passat. Coming up my driveway into the garage is where the turbo lag problem really "" shines"". The front wheel drive in combination with the light front end and too powerful engine is downright dangerous if you are trying to pass someone. Many times, I nearly lost control of the car. It is time for Audi to add more value to this car. It is just too bare bones for 40k. You don't see many on the road in the luxury drenched area I reside....that's telling. Yes we have an Audi agency here, and it's not very good either.",4

It was really a fun car, with enough power and great dynamics. Since I was getting older, and my wife needed an automatic and was sitting in traffic a lot, we decided to get an automatic with more linear power(read I6/V6). Shopped around for Lexus IS350 and BMW 340i. 340i was good, but moving from manual to automatic, I didn't find the transmission react fast enough for my tastes. IS350 with its 8-speed transmission was also not as responsive. So I started looking for vehicles with dual-clutch given faster shift times and better response. Audi A4 is one of the few cars in the market with 7 speed DCT in the price range and new 2.0T motor is torque rich and in fact I found the vehicle better than sportier S3. Also even the base trim(Premium) has the Android Auto/Apple Play combo negating the need for nav package(mine has Convenience package, which is a must-have). And Quattro with rear-bias is another feature worth paying for. All in all, I got almost 5K off sticker on a brand-new vehicle which is a way better deal than BMW 328i(RWD),  Lexus IS300(AWD) and Acura TLX-V6 SH-AWD which are way out of Audi's league in terms of responsiveness and ride quality. Handling is little better in BMW, but everything else is dated. Previous Audis never impressed me, but this vehicle is quite a revelation and definitely worth considering if you are in market for entry level sporty-luxury sedans. At least until Lexus and BMW move to next generation, Audi seems to the best all-rounder in the segment.",5

I don't understand the people that complain about it.  It works so much better than the conventional system.  It is so quiet inside.  The ride is fantastic.  Handles great.

After 4.5 years with my Q5 I felt like it was time to trade it in while I had a lot of equity in it (Retained its value very well )  The new A4 was just starting to be talked about.  I test drove one of the first ones my dealership got, and feel in love.  It handles exceptionally well, I can zip around those land yachts!

When the sun hits it, it gets so glaring.  And of course, around midday, the sun will surely hit it because the Audi design is so aerodynamic.  This Aluminum thing reminds me of a similar design that Honda came up with about 12 years ago for its Civic.  That was glaring too.  But Honda dropped it.   But Audi caught it and put it on its A4??  So I recommend paying extra for the dark wood or brown wood.  About everything else, A4 is completely redesigned.  I'm quite happy.  I may write an update in 6 months.",3

I love this car. First time I've had an Audi I'm coming out of a 2014 BMW 428i coupe. This car is light years ahead of the BMW in terms of technology. The car my dealer had on the lot had the full tech and driver assistance packages. I wasn't planning to get all of these features but I got a great price on the car and I do love the features. The heads-up display is awesome. I love the highly customizable LED interior lighting too. The virtual cockpit along with large center screen are so amazingly clear and easy to use. I love how well thought out the graphics are. The fit and finish inside is very good everything from the paint finish to the seams inside and out. No rattles or anything. The front seats (which my car has the warm weather package and in Florida that's a must) are very comfortable. Love the design, headlights, tail lights, grille, wheels on my Prestige with gray/silver 2 tone. This car looks so sharp, literally. If I had to give anything that could use improvement, and this is really hard, I'd say: the bang and olufsen stereo doesn't sound as good as my Harman Kardon system in my BMW. I've played with the sound settings and when playing certain songs on the radio there's a 'tinny' sound to mid and high tones I can't get rid of. Only other thing is the sport seat any model has the side bolsters on the lower cushion are hard to come into contact with while entering the car. I hope over time these don't show premature wear and tear. But, as a 6'3"" driver I have plenty of room in this car both leg and headroom.

Right now, I think it offers the best mix of tech, performance and luxury in the class, at least until the next 3-series or whatever leapfrogs it. Pros: - The tech goodies are really impressive. Virtual Cockpit is fantastic and having the nav right in front of you in a huge display is actually very useful. It's easy to learn the basic functions of the infotainment system, but it is worth the time to dig deeper and really understand all the different ways you can customize the experience. It makes the car a lot more enjoyable. Even with all the tech, the usability is much better than Mercedes and Lexus. Honestly, you really need to get the technology package to get the best out of this car. - Beyond the gadgets, this is a very good driver's car. Acceleration and braking are very strong, especially with quattro. The ride is firm but controlled. The steering is lighter than I would prefer though. - The interior is not as rich as the C-Class and the GLC, but the materials are high quality, visibility is excellent and the look is very clean and modern. I am 6'2"" with really broad shoulders and size 14 feet, and I have enough head and legroom in the front. I did not fit well at all in the C300, IS and Jaguar XE. The 3 series also has a pretty roomy cabin.- It doesn't use run-flats and has an actual spare tire. I never cared until my wife and I both had flats last year. I had a spare tire. She didn't. I was able to get moving again. She had to get towed. Enough said. Cons: - Setting up the AudiConnect trial was a pain that required multiple phone calls and websites. I was told there were issues with both the new A4 and Q7. I work in tech, so I was able to muddle through this and get everything set up, but Audi really needs to improve the process. - Exterior styling is handsome, but too much like the last generation A4 and the current A3. It's really difficult to tell them apart at first glance. It would have been nice if the new A4 was a little more distinctive- Interior storage could be better. I love the adjustable center armrest, which seems to be a VW/Audi signature, but it doesn't fully cover the compartment, so you can't store anything showy in there. The glovebox is also very small, but at least there is a deep compartment next to the steering wheel that can hold a decent amount of items. - I wish you didn't have to pony up for the Prestige package to get the additional driver assist package. LA traffic would be a little less annoying with the dynamic cruise control, but cost aside, Prestige models are almost impossible to find on dealer lots right now, and good luck getting a color other than black or white. - With all the new tech, I hope long-term reliability isn't an issue.",5

Obviously, BMW car dealers only had cars with most of the high end stuff and even that we were able to find the right car, the price tag was high since wanted to stick to the 240 Hp of the 328 vs the 180hp of the 320.My wife owns an Audi Q5 and we happened to be in the dealer for a service and started to look around the brand new Audi A4 and learned about the upgrades on the design and technology and fell in love with the new car.This model comes with a 252hp engine, 0-60 in 5.8 sec and driving modes that made me forgot my intentions to buy another BMW.Some of the Pros that I see vs BMW:1.

The premium model it was perfectly packed to my needs, only thing I didn't need but is included is the rear view camera and got a credit for its cost!6. More comfortable than the BMW. Although sporty, it rides extremely well!The only minor thing that I have notice is that there is a little bit of reaction time when you press the accelerator, but once is going is pretty amazing.3 years ago I test drove an A4 before getting my 328 and there were not even close, and while purist may say that BMW performance is better I will say that you get 95% of the BMW with 85% of the cost which to me is a pretty good value for your money",5

I have put on a couple thousand miles and have been pretty happy so far. I do have a few gripes. I'm coming from a 2008 RAV4 so this is my baseline. Glove box is very small. Yes there is a CD player in there but still...it's kind of worthless for storage. That said, storage is pretty much non-existent. The RAV4 has a bunch of compartments for all my stuff. The A4 has nothing other than the glove box. No sunglasses holder. I can't put a large Gatorade bottle in the cup holder unless I put it upside down. My RAV has a removable rubber cup holder insert so I can put the bigger bottle in it. Side pockets are small as well. The interior is otherwise well done. Gas mileage is great. Performance is excellent. Stock tires are quiet but do not seem very grippy when pushing it.Overall very happy with my purchase, albeit with a couple of complaints.",4

The technology in this winner is state of the art.  I almost feel like I need to go back to school and get an IT degree to get the most out of this amazing vehicle.  Apple Car Play works like a charm the minute you plug into the designated USB port in the glove box.  For you Android people it also handles Google Play (or whatever the comparable technology is named).  The ability to load the Nav system where you would normally find your speed and RPM dials gives you the feel that you are the pilot in a 747.  Speaking of the Nav system it is the best of any vehicle I have ever owned or system used.  That includes Honda, Acura and Garmin.   So many electronic gadgets that I urge you to check out this magnificent machine online.   I am also surprised at how well it does on mpg -- I got 31.5 on highway driving.  I'm sure that will even improve on a longer trip.  Very pleased with this purchase.  My sales rep at Audi Natick, Kevin Schuster, was great.  Only drawback is it takes premium fuel, but with this high performance engine it's worth it.  The 2017 A4 is a winner in every way.",5
4592, on 04/27/16 09:10 AM (PDT),FWC ,2017 Audi A4 Sedan 2.0 TFSI Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),2017 Audi A4 Prestige Quattro AWD 4Dr," The new A4 design is a redesigned automobile based somewhat on the Audi Q7 cabinet.  Audi was smart enough to keep somewhat of the same exterior design. They were smart enough to add technology to the interior cabinet in place of big outside body changes.   With that said, the inside cabinet has totally changed - for the BETTER. There is more room and comfort, better placement of hand controls, a well-placed cup holder, and three very smart user display areas across the center console, driver dashboard, and windshield .  Compared to the previous model, it is a comfortable rocketship with added safely technology and conveniences surrounding the entire cabinet, including the heated back seats.  The only big drawback is the Apple CarPlay needs to be connected via a cable and not via wireless bluetooth. Yes, we are Apple iPhone users.  Another concern is BMW, Mercedes, and other car manufacturers moving away from Apple, since they are supposedly building their own car line. My questions are: will Audi stay up-to-date with Apple upgrades and changes, or move away?  And even if they stay with Apple or Android, can these new designs - Apple CarPlay and their GPS accept a software upgrade?   In regards to the new A4, I would recommend it.  The changes are enough to get me to the showroom. Hats off to the online marketing department.  In regard to price, it is pricer with all the new option stuff. In closing, I will probably buy one in June because my wife loves her A4, I love her, and it's time to trade up.   Good luck with the car hunting!",5

When I was looking at cars, it was between this and the newly released BMW 323 wagon. Even though the Bimmer had a lower base MSRP, when you added all the features to get it close to the Audi, it ended up costing more. Plus, the Audi has AWD and a nicer interior.

Right now the dash is lit up like a Christmas tree, but rather than be obsessed with those lights, I just keep on driving. I think people should stop trying to keep the 'check engine' light out and just accept the fact that Audis have issues. However, that doesn't prevent them from being an outstanding car. My Audi at 150,000 has many issues, but it also starts, stops, and gets me where I need to go. It's fun and has always been dependable. ",4.375

The 2015 Quattro A4 sedan fits me perfectly.  The 2015 styling is retro 2009 but has held its own over the intervening six years.  After comparing this sedan with the other two primary competitors, the BMW 3 series, and the Mercedes C class, I found the A4 standard features exceeded both.  Sure I could pay another four thousand dollars for a sun roof, leather seats and hands-free bluetooth but why when I could get these same features in the standard pkg?  The C-class had the best interior but the A4 tipped the scales over the BMW.  The ride comfort and road noise were subdued compared to the BMW but not as good as the Mercedes. After comparing the total acquisition cost, I would have paid another eight thousand dollars for the C300 with similar options.  I ended up adding Nav and heated seats to the other standard features to my A4.  I am very satisfied with my decision and look forward to every drive I take in timeless, efficient luxury.  The only regret I have is the car did not come with a smart key or backup camera --with all the other standard features, this is odd since they even came on my previous Camry.  The inly thing of substance I do not like is the transmission takes what seems to be an inordinate amount of time to swith into and out of reverse (about 4 secs).",5

The interior and exterior are basically flawless - showing Audi's attention to details.  I have drive over 40,000 miles since I purchased this new and have only had a few minor trim issues - nothing serious.  The handling is AMAZING and the car is definitely quick for its class.  I truly enjoy this car - twisty roads are the best as nothing seems to make the car cut lose.  It is a very good looking car and the interior is incredibly comfortable - with nice soft-touch materials.  Overall the car has been a positive experience and I would recommend it to anyone that asks.I only have two minor negatives about this vehicle - neither a reason not to purchase it:  1) The fact that it did not come with Bluetooth streaming unless you upgraded to the Prestige trim with the navigation system - a $4,000 upgrade for something that every Kia seems to come with by default.  2) I have had either indifferent or negative experiences every time I go to the Audi dealer (Plano, TX) for service - this has made it incredibly unlikely that I will ever purchase another Audi.  Even with those negatives this is an amazing car and you should at least test drive it if you are considering it - that may make the decision easy for you!Update at 59,000 miles. At 47,000 miles my clutch went out (manual transmission). It was covered under warranty and they saw no sign of abuse.

The car is obviously a very low profile car and I live in New England so I went through 6 Pirelli tires before I finally put all weather continental tires on the car. The car does not drive as smoothly now but at least I have not gotten any bubbles in the tires or cracked any rims since purchasing the continentals. There have been multiple recalls for the heating system, air bags, electronic, etc. that have required repairs. The check engine light came on around 30,000 miles and required multiple valves to be replaced. The dealership claimed they were ""faulty"" but gave no explanation as to what or why. Then, at 41,000 the car DIED on the highway due to transmission failure. I had to have the vehicle towed in the middle of the night to the dealership. The ENTIRE transmission needs to be replaced. Again, the only explanation is that it was ""faulty"" and they are unsure what exactly went wrong. Thankfully the car is still under warranty, but this does not make me feel any better. There is no reason there should be this many issues and ""faulty"" parts on a car this new. I will definitely be selling this car in the Spring and have NO intention of buying another Audi. Every car has its issues, but given the amount I have had with this car in a short period of time with NO real explanation of the problems from the dealership, leads me to believe Audi's are not as reliable as the price tag would suggest.",2

There's a little more understeer in aggressive turns than in the previous A4, but I can live with it.

At usage of 1500 miles (I bought it with 1000 on it), my car indicated low oil. As it had not been leaking, my car was burning it. Audi of America and the dealer said this was in spec, that turbo engines burned it. They offered to put a quart in every time. They could  not answer to the long-term ramifications however and did not want to fix it. Had I known that my car required a quart of oil per 1500 miles I would not have purchased it because something seems wrong here. ONLY the 09-10 A4s do this. Turbo engines shouldn't burn that much.

Interior is very sharp, except for small useless drink holder up front and flimsy drink holder in back. Shouldn't have to use two hands to set a drink down.

I thought the A4 would just be a larger version of the A3 and would offer a similar driving experience.  I was definitely wrong!

Wanted an all- weather convertible.  Couldn't be more pleased. The car is absolutely beautiful on the outside, and has Audi's workmanship and reliability. We've had it five months.  Absolutely no issues.  Inside, it's fine for me; tight for my six-foot-one husband.  We were able to drive anywhere in one of the worst winters we had, and the top- down experience is fabulous.  It takes close to 30 seconds to get the top up or down, but you get used to that. It's the only awd convertible on the market - I hope Audi remains committed.",4.5

Cons: It does not ride smooth. You feel every bump. Flex is pronounced. The engine is also rough and noisy, especially at idle in drive. Gas mileage has not been up to par with my previous Saab 2.0T (23mpg vs. 28mpg).  Acceleration is also not as strong.

The car, just like any Audi, drives beautifully, their windblocker assures your perfect hair day isn't ruined.

I feel the value of this car with all its luxury and fit n finish puts all others to shame in this class. It is a second car, so it doesn't get its fair share of outdoor time. I can't keep my eyes off it.  It turns heads on the road as well. The Alpaca Beige is really unique and looks great with the aluminum trim.

The car is very fun to drive, and Quattro is amazing. The fact that you can get it nicely equipped at about 46k is pretty nice too. I had the Premium and Convenience Packages, along with the Bose sound system. No MMI or Bluetooth. However, Bluetooth is pointless in a convertible if you have the top down. The wind deflector and heated seats are invaluable and they help you drive the car a lot later into the year. Digital climate control is standard, a nice touch over BMW or Mercedes. The CD player is an in-dash 6 disc. The changer moves to the glovebox if you get MMI. It also plays MP3 discs, which is handy.",5

The 3.2 Cab is a great car to drive. I've had Porsche and BMW convertibles and nothing can compare to the amazing roof this Audi has. It's canvas, but virtually silent even when driving at 80 mph. I don't know how the engineers did it, but wind noise is kept at a minimum. Handling is much better than the old cabs. It seems stiffer and the turn-in is quicker. Brakes are awesome and inspire confidence. Got it in Alpaka Beige, cream interior and tan room. It's a very nice looking car, even with the new Audi gap-mouth grille.

4757, on 12/14/15 23:59 PM (PST),Christopher ,2007 Audi A4 Wagon 3.2 Avant quattro 4dr Wagon AWD (3.1L 6cyl 6M),Budget Luxury!," I'm rating this a 4.3 out of 5 Stars. This little car has been a joy since the day I bought it. I bought the car from ASE Auto inc in Studio City, CA earlier this month. The first thing I noticed about the car was how zippy and smooth it was. Everything seemed to be fine until I encountered a problem with reverse. I drive the automatic version of the car and they can develop some issues around 90-100k miles. The problem consisted of the car disengaging the gear if the RPM's went up too fast. (Almost as thought he car slips into Neutral). My mechanic spoke to Sam at ASE Auto and he is fixing it for free. Other than that, there have been no issues with the car. As some of the other reviews say, the car does burn oil. You may notice some blue smoke from the exhaust when you first start it but it's nothing to be concerned about. I carry a quart of oil with me just in case and I top off the oil every 1000 miles or so. All problems aside, this car is nothing short of luxurious. Mine has wood trim that accents the dashboard, leather seats that have very good seat warmers, a steering wheel that feels great in my hand and a very smooth ride overall. The rear is a bit cramped with little leg room if the front seats are back more than half way and but the hatchback gives you a lot of cargo space. The car's technology is a bit dated but not obsolete. There is no aux jack or bluetooth but the sound system is just fine and the radio is very easy to use. The steering wheel also has a small dial that lets you raise and lower the volume with your right thumb and another one that lets you change the station with your left thumb. A big plus for me was not only Sport Mode but also Manual mode. The steering wheel has paddle shifters which are fun to use and good for keeping the car in a high gear when on a road trip (to save gas). There is a bit of a lag when using the paddles to change the gear but that's normal for a car of that age. Gas milage is not bad for a German V6. I average 16 city and 23 highway but the car does need Premium gas so she's an expensive date. She makes up for it in safety with a 9.6 out of 10 safety rating and airbags all around. The All-Wheel-Drive is also a bonus and keeps the car planted, even in very heavy rain. This car also shares many of its parts with Volkswagen so most parts will be very cheap. Overall, this car is definitely a good buy if you want a sporty and luxurious car that's safe, reliable and relatively cheap.",4

While I don't know if this will affect the car's functions, I will be turning it in at the end of the lease instead of buying out the lease. Also, for those not used to turbos, they have tons of torque in the midrange, meaning they are fast at 20-50 and 50- 75.

During that one frame all that was done to the vehicle was routine oil changes (5,000 intervals as I do not personally think going 10,000 is a good idea), tires around 45,000 miles, I always use premium gasoline. 80,000-115,000: around 85,000 miles during service it was discovered that my valve cover gaskets were leaking oil that was around $250 with parts and labor. 95,000 miles I had all brakes replaced (pads, rotors on all four wheels) I ordered parts from Advance Auto Parts for $210 and still currently have them on the vehicle at 170,000 smooth as the Audi brand no need to pay for brand name very little brake dust as well. 112,000 miles I noticed that I could smell a burning oil. So I took it in to see what was wrong, the valve cover gasket appeared to be leaking again. So I had hen replace it once again. 115,000-145,000: no problems at all until 138,000 I noticed little drops of oil on my garage floor. I decided to take it in and was informed that my valve cover gasket looked like it was leaking again and that my rear main seal had a leak. At that point we figured that the actual valve cover itself may be warped. I decided to deal with the small drops of oil as I did not see it necessary to pay almost $3,000 to repair everything. I now have 170,000 miles on the car and it has never left me stranded. The key to keeping this car serviced it to find an independent mechanic that will treat you fairly.

AWD combined with winter tires makes this car the best I've driven in extreme winter conditions. Consumer reports rates this a recommeded buy, one of the main reason I purchased it. Traditionally pre-05 audis were not nearly a reliable. My previous car was an acura RSX, a more reliable (I am told) car but not nearly as nice of handling or design. I only hope this car will be as problem free as my Acura was, but I am not counting on it. This is the price paid for nicer handling and design.",4.75

Even being front drive this car handles extremely well and the performance is much greater than expected for a 4 cylinder, thanks to direct injection.

Overall it is a great vehicle, comfortable, engine response is prompt, transmission is flawless, ride is quiet, steering is sharp. For negatives I would note the complexity and lack of intuitiveness of the infotainment system, using their GPS was taking too long to set on a destination and I kept using my TomTom. I guess it takes time to learn how to use it, same with toggling with the map display in the central area between the speed and tachometer. Also at low speeds the brake looses linearity and suddenly locks the wheels if you press a little harder. Also getting in and out of the car is a bit uncomfortable.

Wow, what a joke.I had the base model with the S-Line package and a few extras like navigation.The car was wholly unpleasant to drive.  The CVT an obvious annoyance, the interior, instrumentation and controls utterly mediocre and old fashioned.  It wasn't antiquated like a Subaru, but it seemed like a step down from even a VW, which is inexcusable for the cost.Everything about the driving experience made me completely puzzled as to why anyone would cross shop with this a similarly priced BMW 3 Series and pick this Audi.I'm not a BMW fanboy or anything, but the two vehicles are incompatible in driving experience, and yet they are about the same price.

It stickered just shy of the $50k mark. If I wasn't able to get a smoking deal on it I would have never bought it. Sure, it's pretty. Sure, people go ""ooohhh, you have an Audi"" but honestly, this car is nowhere near worth the price of entry. For $15k less you can get a fully loaded Passat with the 1.8t which is all anyone really needs. You will wind up with a much bigger, more comfortable car. With darn near the same build quality, and it will have everything a modern car should have. For example...Bluetooth streaming audio. The Audi doesn't have it until you pony up for the premium plus package. Which pushes you over that 50k mark. Another place the A4 falls woefully short is the back seat. If you have kids in booster seats, get ready to wrestle with seatbelts because the seat area is so narrow your booster WILL block the buckle. And we have the Diono Cambria which is a fairly narrow booster. Still blocks the buckle. Also, if anyone riding up front is over 6' tall, you will render that back seat virtually useless. My 4 year old complains about being squished behind me, I'm 6'3"". We don't have the problem in our far less expensive, much more equipped Passat. Basically, if you are of average or lower stature, the A4 might be ok for you, as long as you're ok with paying a boatload of money for a car that has some seriously glaring omissions in the options department. If you want a well built German car that has everything in it and won't break the bank, go to VW and save some money.",3

I can't do this in the Audi unless I purchase the much more expensive package or plug my phone in.. to a cord... in the glove box. No. Just no. Also, CVT transmissions are crap and forced me into a more expensive Quattro to avoid them. Who doesn't want to feel the car shifting? Who likes CVT transmissions?! Also, the back seats don't fold down, there's not even a ski sack like my 2005 had. So, there's no option for a bit more room.  I did not buy the Audi.

Like almost all 1.8T owners I've had to replace my coil packs (I opted to upgrade to aftermarket Hitachi plugs instead of the OEM versions).

Numerous electrical problems (too many to list) the dealership either can't or won't fix. Interior is cramped. I'm 6' tall and 200lbs and have to wedge myself in and out of the car. Driver's side leg room is very bad. Center console digs into my right knee. Cup holder and glove box are totally useless. Interior knobs and parts have broken, melted, and fallen off. Exterior parts fall off. Tires wear unevenly and one is bald after only 30k mi. The dealership laughs at all the problems I report every time I bring the car in for service.

Then, my FM radio reception died unless I was within 15 miles of the station (previously the reception was MUCH better). Just prior to the 60000 mile service, the engine quit. Thought it was electrical. It was actually a broken cam shaft! All freeway driving, I baby this thing. Average 36 MPG. How can I break a cam shaft? Dealer says everything looks fine, not abused.

My 6spd 220hp A43.0Q stickered $39,000, but sold for a lot less.  I had one problem with headlight washers - nothing more.  I'm getting only about 20 mpg, which is pretty poor for this size car. My previous car, a '95 Nissab Maxima easily got near 25 mpg.  The interior is beautiful, except for the bizarre set-up with the armrest / brake, and the worst cupholder this side of Yugo.

It has never been to the dealer or private mechanic except for the initial free maint and the few minor recalls.However, that is not to say it has not had its share of anomalies.Three timing belts, 3 water pumps, 3 batteries, One fuel pump, too many coil packs to count, one temp sensor, two valve cover gaskets and one thermostat.All this may sound horrible and it probably would be if I had no mechanical aptitude or desire to do my own repairs.The car is actually easy to work on.Very modular in the way things come apart.Information is readily available on the Net.I've kept this car because the 1.8T engine block is bullet proof.Update (4/22/16):  I still own this car and it now has over 250K miles and still runs strong.  The original turbo hasn't had any problems and the engine still has good compression on all 4 cylinders.  Synthetic oil is a must for this engine. The clutch was recently replaced and that was a major project. Another fuel pump failed leaving me stranded at the office, again.  It seems the ""Check Engine"" light is always about to illuminate as various high mileage sensors fail.  New upgraded brake rotors on all four corners has improved braking.  There are a lot of great resources on the web dedicated to these cars and I have been able to find detailed instructions for all issues I've experienced.  Overall I'm pleased with this car as it is a well balanced performance sedan.  However, if you are not mechanically inclined and don't enjoy the challenge of researching a given problem, order parts and installing the parts, then you're left with paying some mechanic big bucks to keep it road worthy.Update 10/22/16: My A4 now has more than 260k miles on the odo. Original engine and turbo still going strong. Getting close to needing its 4th timing belt service. The latest issues I'm dealing with: New radiator. FM reception is bad due to the small antenna amp near the back window. It's a common problem. Roof liner in the back is getting loose and sagging. Three window regulators have been replaced. The driver seat backing keeps popping out and falling off. Typical stuff for an old car. However, coworkers that ride with me can't believe how well it runs and looks. I often want to have a new car but can't justify it given the fact that this car just keeps going. One just has to stay on top of all the annoying little things that need attention.",4

My main complaint was the automatic transmission - the Drive transmission setting shifted painfully slowly and enhanced the awful turbo lag. The Sport transmission setting was better, but it had to be shifted manually with the paddles into 6th gear when traveling < 80 mph.

Bottom line is I appreciate the A4, but it lacks the getup and go of the 3-series, granted the 325xi BMW was a 3.0L-5 speed manual.   I commute about 70 mi. per day mostly on the interstate, the A4 with sport suspension gives a decent ride and is extremely comfortable for a 35 minute commute with an aver. 24.7 MPG but it lags substantually off the line until you get to about 2500+ RPM, however, at hyway speeds it kicks into passing mode just fine and you'll be going 90 before you know it.

The 2008 A4 had 28K miles from a warm-weather state and was a one-owner car from a vacation home - well cared for with full service records based on time, not mileage. I would have preferred Quattro, but the price and mileage were hard to beat. I should have listened to my instincts. Vastly different character than the A3... this A4 feels like a luxury car without any sporting pretense. The CVT transmission is horrendous - slow to respond in standard mode, jerky engagement from dead stop... in Sport mode, it holds RPMs far too long at low speeds before initially ""upshifting."" Engine vibration is far more apparent than it should be for any luxury vehicle - the same engine in the A3 was less prone to vibration. Brakes on the A4 are less direct, more difficult to modulate and with longer pedal travel than the A3 - might be fixed with stainless steel brake lines. Steering is much lighter and less dynamic as well; same with the suspension which is calibrated for a compliant, soft ride over handling - lacking the balance of a BMW 3-series. Lastly, the climate control is noticeably less accurate than the A3... the interior temp seems to be about 5 degrees higher than the set point during all seasons. Might be a faulty part or just the nature of the system - hard to tell and not worth tearing apart the climate controls to find out. On the good side, the car is indeed comfortable as a highway cruiser. The interior materials are top notch. The trunk seriously swallows more cargo than my wife's Ford Escape. Instruments are legible and direct. For the price paid, the car came well optioned for a 2008 model - although bewildering that certain features now standard on mid-level cars (like heated seats, Bluetooth and USB/AUX inputs) were nowhere to be found on my A4. It's a handsome car that will serve as a good family hauler for a couple of years - a car that I wouldn't be ashamed to take clients between point A and B. Lesson learned though - it's not a driver's car in the same way a 3-series might be. No major mechanical issues so far (knock on wood)... replaced post-purchase: an A/C diverter valve, the engine thermostat and the window lock switch. Not bad for a mid-2000s Audi. Overall, I'm not sure I would buy the A4 in this configuration again... at this price point for a used vehicle, there are more competent sport sedans and more reliable family sedans that cost less to operate.",3

The first year I owned it, I put over 25k miles commuting 100mi each way for work, across a mountain range. The traction control and AWD have literally saved my life twice hitting black ice on a bend in the highway. Very little issues with the car; cruise control module went out, covered under warranty; ignition switch died last year out of warranty, $160 total (cheap). Then one day, accelerating onto the interstate, the engine shut down leaving me just enough momentum to coast over to the shoulder (on a massive bridge, no less). After having it inspected and diagnosed at the dealer, it turns out a high pressure fuel pump exploded, literally. It blew metal shrapnel into the engine destroying the block and fuel system. A piece(s) of shrapnel severed the intake cam chain, seizing the cam and destroying most of the remainder of the engine. The engine is damaged beyond repair and has to be replaced, to the tune of over $7500! Audi has generously offered to cover 25% up front, but I am currently working with Audi of America to see if they can extend that courtesy a bit more. At this point, I haven't decide if I'm going to keep the car after all this or just dump it. Either way, I'm out as much as $6k on a car only worth $11k...If you want a car that is nearly perfect to drive, this is the one.

The first time was when a fuel sensor failed. I was stranded at a stop sign.  Audi's roadside assistance was so bad that I had to join AAA to have my car towed.  I was  told me there was a recall going out on the fuel sensor. With 30m miles on the car the car stopped moving forward or backward at an intersection.

The console is still small, with the small cup holders underneath, the ignition jingle never stops until both the driver and passenger have thier sealt belts on, and just all the little things about the Jetta are in A4 that would make you skeptical to pay $41,000 for it.

The design is excellent, top execution and materials. Everything is balanced with very good taste. The danger in this price range is sending the message that you bought the car to show-off. On the contrary, A4 shows that you have a fine taste of spending your money (let's admit it, it's not a cheap car and everybody sees that).  The 2.0T has only 200HP but is really powerfull provided that you now how to drive a 4 cyl Turbo engine, i.e., buy a manual transmission and do not ask the engine for maximum thrust at 1500rpm.

Sure all new 2008 sedans have S-line styling on the body, but not the 18"" wheels, sport suspension, and superb interior trim. My advice is to spring for it, as you hardly ever see the 18"" wheels on A4 and it enhances the look tremendously.

The sound of the engine will also take some getting used to as the turbo is a bit ""throatier"" than I'm used to.

I purchased this car used with 47,000 on it.  The first month I had the car I accidently leaned on the lid for the center console storage.  The cheap plastic hinge snapped off and Audi wants $280 for a replacement.  The tire sensors' battery went dead and you cannot replace the battery...I think the Audi sensor was $125 (?).  I went with a generic at the tire dealer for less than half that. My air conditioning compressor failed at the beginning of the summer.  A replacement is available online for around $300, but in order to get to it you literally have to take the front of the car off and support the engine with a jack.  Most mechanics understandably want $1,300-$1,500 for that one.  At the moment, I have an error code that indicates my high-pressure fuel pump is failing.  It is a too common problem with these 2.0 Turbo engines that may be related to a cam follower on the pump.   The story is that during a great demand for these cars a few years ago Audi contracted a new supplier to make these parts, which were made of sub-standard metal.  In extreme cases, these parts disintegrate and the metal shavings can cause catostrophic engine failure.  Audi is resisting  the making a general recall.  When everything is working well with this car, it is a joy to drive.  Unfortunately, I haven't been feeling the farfegneugan (sp?) very often lately.

I was extremely happy with the car - especially the acceleration and road handling. The first week of August 2016, with 47,000 miles on the car - the check engine light goes on and some unholy sounds begin emitting from the engine block. After two mechanics, I was directed to bring the car back to the dealer. After a day and a half, the verdict - motor and turbo are done. The dealer informed me that the motor/turbo parts were a mere $14,000! If I wanted to trade the car in, they would give me $500. Currently, the car is in a mechanic's shop in Brooklyn - it looks like the repairs, parts, labor will be around $11,000. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I had a Toyota Camry for 15 years and never once had to make a repair of that cost and magnitude. Or maybe I would be better off with a Hyundai.February 2017: Ended up paying $12,700 for a new motor, turbo and alternator from my friends mechanic in Brooklyn. Had contacted Audi and a personal service representative informed me that they would only pick up the costs if I had the car repaired at an Audi dealer. Spoke to a Vice President of Audi who directed me to their service website. I filled out a long, detailed questionnaire and NEVER received a response. My 2009 Audi A4 Turbo is running better than it did before these repairs. I have every intention of using the car through the end of the NY winter and then trading it in for a Lexus, Acura, or a Volvo. I've spoken with many mechanics who have agreed that it is near impossible for them to work on an Audi. Obviously, I will tell anyone to avoid the 2009 Audi A4 and the whole line of vehicles. The Audi representatives exhibited complete indifference to my problems with a 2009 line of vehicles that had a detailed history of inferior manufacturing problems.Additional: I traded in the Audi A4 for a pre owned 2014 Lexus GS350 AWD during March of 2017 that had 24,000 miles. I am extremely happy with the performance of the Lexus and the service received from the dealer - Ray Catena Lexus of White Plains. One final telling indication regarding the 2009 Audi A4 Turbo- it routinely appears as a Used Car to avoid in Consumer Reports annual car ratings. I'm aware that Audi manufactures several high quality vehicles but would not recommend an Audi based on my experience with the vehicle I owned. I will wholeheartedly recommend a Lexus & have two friends who have purchased or leased a Lexus based on their experience with my GS 350.",2

Thank you but is my car burning that much oil that I need to add a quart every 1000 miles or less? They offered to replace the turbos that ""might"" be the problem... Then the transmission problems started in. A very loud ""clunk"" every time you hit the gas pedal from a stop. Back to the dealer, ""past the warranty, 7,000$, sorry, dont know what to tell you.""  Apparently the transmission slips into neutral when you stop and then clunks into  ""gear"" (CVT transmission)  when you hit the gas. It sounded and felt like the transmission was falling out everytime you stopped at a stop sign. It was embarrassing. It had to be driven like a manual and ease it in. Then the interior rattles started. It sounded like something was loose in the doors, every door. The kicker was when I started dating a girl that drove a 1 year newer Jetta. It was THE EXACT SAME CAR with the same features for way less money. She opted for the manual transmission so no tranny problems for her.The good things about the car is that it has comfortable seats and the interior design is comfortable, although, coating on the plastic will start peeling off so your interior will look 10 years old after 5 years.I had enough and traded it in.

Power steering hose is on recall so had that repair completed at the same time and had to take it back again for the power steering hose. This car looks awesome but just isn't very well built I have confronted Audi and they say it is NORMAL for a car to burn up to 1 qt. every 1000 MILES. This would be 9 quarts of oil between oil changes. My 1997 Explorer with 185K miles didn't go through oil like this.,3.25

I wanted first and foremost a car that was fun to drive both on the daily commute and weekend trip.  I also wanted a car that stood out.  Unfortunately, it seems that everyone in this segment naturally gravitates towards the 3, usually because that is all they have heard of.  What I found in the A4 is a car that gives me all the performance with real handsome looks both inside and out (yes, I am a sucker for those LED head lights).  The car is incredible to drive, especially in Sports mode.  While I miss the torque of the 2.0T, the 3.2 is the one to have.",4.75

It runs great, the Prestige package has everything anyone could want at a great price, and the car's styling is superb.  The only down side to the car is that it burns 5 quarts of oil between oil changes, as was confirmed by a recent oil consumption test at the dealership.

A lot of reviewers complain about the 4-cylinder engine and its buzz, but I love the sound of a turbo 4.  I wish they had put the GTIs sound amplifier in the A4, but can understand why they didn't considering the different demographics.  The main problem I have with the car is that it gets expensive when you start adding features other luxury car manufacturers include as standard.  At an MSRP of $38K, the Premium Plus trim doesn't seem like a bargain against the 328XI, especially since the BMW has standard maintenance.",4.5

Interior and exterior design earn many praises from my friends.

For our next car purchase safety and engineering were at the top of the requirements list. After a 2002 A6, 2002 TT Roadster, and 2007 A4, we took possession of a 2009 A4 2.0T Quattro with Premier Plus option package.  The improvements in the 2009 A4 are impressive and reflect Audi's continued excellence in engineering.  This model, with it's increased length and width, adjustments to the engine mounts to reduce the vibration in the 2.0 four cylinder engine, and the tweaks to the acceleration off the line make us feel like we're back in our A6.

As typical for a German automobile, everything is placed logically. The steering wheel is weighted nicely but the paddles on the back of wheel are too small to make good use of them.

Expensive suspension failures, Cat converters going out, water pump, cracked fluid reservoirs, valve gasket leak, etc., etc., etc.  Come on Audi - have some pride.",2.75

The only thing that has needed replacement is the tires.  I live in Idaho so I see more snow than most cars do and it handles amazing in any weather.,4.875
5553, on 03/11/09 14:10 PM (PDT),Turk ,1997 Audi A4 Sedan 2.8 quattro 4dr Sedan AWD,Summary," Here is my two cents after putting 50K on my A4 which I purchased at 120K. Very reliable engine, manual transmission (same OEM clutch at 170K), no major electrical problems. What has failed, cruise control, driver side heated seat, thermostat. I believe overall it is a very reliable car, sensors that I have replaced along the way are just the same on all cars these days, all made by BOSCH and it doesn't make a difference which brand you drive. In terms of interior/exterior design, ergonomics and build quality Audi is never any less than other Germans and maybe much better in some of these areas if not all. The up side is because of its reputation here in USA, you can get them much cheaper!!",4.625

It's been 100% reliable.  It's a 5 speed stick shift red sedan.  I use to put lots of miles on it commuting to work and visiting family 4 hours away.  Now my life style has changed and my car is still thrilling to drive.  It sits for days when I don't drive it and it still drives like a charm when I use it.  I'd buy this car again and again and again.,4.875

But a bit of TLC took care of that. Even though I spent a lot of money on her, What she ended up costing me in total was still a bargain.

The drivers side window repeatedly slipped off the track, the transmission has been not shifting as crisp as it should.  Its a good car if you get on that has been taken care of.  Handles well, but there is a lack of power.  AWD system works great in MN winters.  Would buy this car again, but make sure the timing belt has been changed!!! If it isn't, you can bend a valve and it will be $3000 later before it will be back on the road.  ",4

It has 128,000 miles on it and still feels like new.  The interior holds up well as does the exterior body and paint.  It handles great in snow and ice.  Repairs are very costly on these cars.  I think reliablity is better than a lot of american cars but comes nowhere close  to a Honda or Toyota.  I've have to replace 2 controls arms, which was a common problem with these early models.  I replaced the clutch after 60  miles which seems pretty weak to me.  As far as routine maintenance the most expensive is 90k miles about $1000.",4.75

Around 1997 I lowered the car with new springs and shocks but otherwise left it stock. Just changed the timing belt a year ago, but other than that no major mechanical issues. I changed the brake pads myself around 60,000 miles (the easiest and fastest brakes I've ever done). The exhaust finally rusted out by the flextube so I've installed a new Borla exhaust.

It is just crossing over the 95000 mile mark and it still drives like a new car.  As long as you take care of the car it should live nicely.  The car is a bit delicate in that it doesn't respond nicely to adverse situations.  The check engine light is bound to come on for any little reason.  Maintenance is expensive.  The only major problem I have had was with the transmission.  At the 7 year mark the transmission had to be totally replaced.  My mechanic (a German car specialist) indicated this was a common problem with this style transmission.,4.5

The Quattro is a must for MN winters. The interior layout is perfect in the front. The rear is very tight. The repairs are expensive, but you can buy parts online and you really can do it your self. It's easier than my Jeep to work on. I've done brakes, wheel bearings, and plugs.  When you find one you like, call the local Audi dealers with the VIN to see if they have serviced it. They will tell you everything that has been done. The back of the owners manual has space for service stations to stamp. If you want to upgrade the motor in any way, don't get the 12valve V6! Their is NOTHING available. Go for the turbo. The V6 is more dependable",4.625

The 5 speed manual is like butter.  The acceleration in good, but won't snap any necks. Handling is amazing.  The quattro is a masterpiece.  Living in Colorado, all wheel drive is important, and I have never slipped on ice once. These cars don't hold their value well because of reliability concerns, but they are an absolute bargain.  The only problem I've had is the air sensor ($350), which is basically routine maintenance. If something does go wrong, it can be costly though because some parts are only available through audi. This car gives the performance and comfort a of a car 3 times its price and is still way ahead of its time",5

Belt tensioner went south at 60K, ($700 repair)  ECM at 70K ($600 repair) plus electrical and AC problems.  Recommended service always on time at a independent Audi shop.  Parts should not be failing at this rate.  Audi service manager said that these vehicles exhibit problems, and listed about 10.  Suggested I buy a 2005 A4.  My company cars (Ford, Chevys) are more reliable though not as fun to drive.  OK, we're selling this A4 and buying a new 06 Civic.  Fun to drive, tight body, go kart handling etc.  Not worth the $$$ to replace poorly designed components.  You can get the same performance looks etc., in other cars.",4.25

Its awesome on the interstate as well as on short in-town trips. In the snow, I think it handles better than the AMTRAK.  Seriously, on snow/ice/wet pavement, the car grips like nothing else, even on regular summer tires. Kind of costly when repairs are needed but its expected on all higher end brands, MB is not cheaper. Just remember this is not a Pontiac or Ford where anyone can work on it. V6 engine could use a little more horses but its just enough and very quiet. I travel a lot and I am always on a rental car. I cannot wait til I get back to my Audi, everytime. It never fails.",4.875

It is a pleasure to drive in the snow.  However, some how after 50,000miles or so.  I started hearing some rattling. The dealerhips have no customer service, and they are really rude.

Had 85k on the odometer and since I've put another 15k this year. The car is great in every way. It looks great, classy, good performance for a sedan, and very comfy. Also the car its self is very reliable BUT I feel that many previous owners will not take good care of the car. These cars are very picky and need premium fuel, synthetic oil changes, etc. Before you buy make sure the previous owner took care of the car because maintenance and repair costs do add up. This year alone I've spent about $1500 in maintenance including, transmission fluid, tune up, brakes, fuel cleaning, new turbo etc. But all in all great car!",4.75

This car is phenomenal to drive - it hugs off ramps and high speeds, the seats are supportive and comfortable on long trips, and the interior design is top notch.  I purchased mine with a red exterior and a black / silver interior and it's eye catching!  I also ordered mine with the sport suspension, which is great for windy road driving.  The 4 cyl Turbo produces excellent HP.  And for what you're getting in a car (entry level luxury sport), you're getting a lot more bang with your buck compared to the 3-series.

There is a noticeable hesitation when starting from zero.  Consumer Reports mentions this.  The 4-cyl. turbo, while powerful with a nice, occasionally pleasant burble, is, at times coarse.  Also noticed by CR.  The sound quality of the audio system is just good, not up to the sound in our '99 A6.

After 4000 miles it doesn't show much sign of easing up, and gear changes can be a bit rough.

Better replace the belt every 30K miles just to be safe. Since then, nothing but problems: ABS brake sensors (twice), tie rod ends (many), wheel speed sensors, an unknown compression problem that stumped three mechanics, including the dealer, power window motor, a half-moon seal(?), and more. Now the transmission is acting up. ",2.875

Its front seats are very compfortable, and its controls are logically positioned and easy to access.  The rear seats are a bit cramped, but OK for occasional use.  It has lots of trunk space. Audi's 50,000 mile warranty (even covers oil changes) is excellent assuming you drive enough miles per year to make use of the full warranty. Despite the fact that the car was carefully driven and exceptionally well maintained, problems began after the warranty expired.

In the month I've had it, it's delivered everything it promised, and a lot more.  Can't say enough good things about this car.  Handles wonderfully, no matter what mode it's in.  I prefer sports mode because it suits my driving style best, but ordinary Drive mode is nice when just cruising on the freeway and getting 30+mpg.  I'm averaging 29 miles per gallon, city and freeway, much better than expected and far exceeding what my V6 Honda ever got, even with cylinder deactivation.  Accelerates very smoothly, just a hint of a pause and then it kind of ""jumps "" off the line and up to speed seemingly instantly.  Feels much faster than what is written, and probably is. Definitely under 6 seconds to 60mph, but that's not what they say.  Very happy with the transission and wouldn't have got the car with a CVT, so it was a Quattro or a different make.  A bit hard to find in my targeted budget range, with the trim and color I wanted, but persistence, hard work, and determination paid off....and the willingness to travel over a hundred miles.  Kudos to Circle Audi of Long Beach for sending me a Uber ride to get there, and treating me well at the dealer.  No ""over the top"" selling with these guys, straight to the point and excellent product knowledge, what's you definitely want in a salesperson.  I laid out my specs to them, they found me the perfect car right away and got me the kind of deal I was happy with.  Such a great deal I don't want to say what it is, and it's a certified pre-owned Audi with some warranty, always a plus with a used car.  Thought I would miss my old car, and I do a little, but I've found a new love and her name is Audi Quattro. I'm hooked and as long as maintainance is low and the car remains dependable, I'll be in Audis for the foreseeable future.  All the car reviews of this car were spot on, and maybe even a little underwhelming for this car.  I can't really say anything negative about any aspect of the vehicle, only that the steering is a bit too soft at times and combine that ease of steering with how well the car moves and you have to be very careful not to change lanes by mistake because you turned your writ a half centimeter...it's that precise and easy to turn.  Sport mode firms it up a bit, but still very effortless and I like more of a road feel in my hands.  I like to drive, not be driven by my car. This car has both available, which is nice.  Electronics were simple to learn, navigation is so precise it's scary, and nothing feels cheap and not corners seem cut, to save a few bucks and annoy the consumer.  I'm a big fan of companies wh ""tighten all the bolts"" and aren't lazy, and cheap, about quality.  Nothing rattles, and exterior noise is virtually eliminated.  Engine has a nice little growl to it that's not over the top, but just loud enough to tell you that it's no ordinary 4 cylinder under the hood.  No sound of the turbo at all, which is really amazing, you really don't know it's there until the toque really kicks in and speed jumps up pretty fast.  I have to really pay attention, or I may be getting speeding tickets because you definitely don't feel the high speed, and 65 doesn't feel all that different from 100....not that I've ever gone that fast, but to illustrate.... Thanks Audi for a fine automobile.  I'm very happy with it so far.",5
5843, on 09/07/16 18:02 PM (PDT),Leigh ,2014 Audi A4 Sedan 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),So much fun to drive!!," I purchased a used 2014 Audi A4 premium plus quatro about a month ago.  So far, I love it!  I specifically wanted a manual transmission, because I just love shifting gears.  This car is a blast to drive and shift!  I previously owned a VW Passat, which I was pleased with, but have really enjoyed a slight ""step up"" to the Audi.  The car handles very well, I love the side assist (blinking lights when someone is in your blind spot and your blinker is on), the auto-sensing wipers (never have to touch the wiper level!!), and the overall feel of the car.  It is very ""sturdy"" and quiet.  My Passat was really noisy, so this was a great change.  I also love the push-button start and the push-button parking brake (no more difficult parking brake to wrestle with!)  My VW had the old-fashioned remote key lock and unlock, and I love that with my Audi, I just have to reach for the handle - as long as the key is in my purse, the car will unlock for me.  No more searching for my keys in the bottom of my purse!!!!!  Now for the disappointments: first, even though I have the premium plus, there is no back-up camera.  I knew this before I bought, but was told by the salesman that I could easily add one from Best Buy for about $250.  I looked into it (before purchasing the car), and it looked like he was right.  However, when I went to BB to get the back-up camera, I found out that these after-market accessories cannot be added to a factory-installed monitor without a VERY expensive adapter (like, over $1,000)!  So... now I have to live without a back-up camera.  I also don't like the radio selection on the steering column.  Instead of just pushing a button to move from one preset station to the next (like in my VW), you have to roll a little knob to select the station, and then push the button.  It's almost impossible to do this without looking at the dashboard.  It takes my eyes and attention off the road.  Also, I'm disappointed in the bluetooth voice command.  In my VW, my phone book contacts from my phone were automatically recognized by my car.  All I had to say was, call Samantha Anderson (or any contact in my phone's contact list), and it dialed the number.  With the Audi, I have to actually pre-record a voice tag for Samantha Anderson and input her number, or it won't recognize and call.  I was really shocked by these downgrades.  The Audi is supposed to be a step up, and it is in most ways, but definitely some technology oversights that are surprising.  Some other features that are very important to me: a very big trunk and seats that fold down (very easy to maneuver), seat memory, seat heat, and a rockin' sound system!!  Although there are a few technological features that I would change, I LOVE the A4!!!!",5

Walked into the dealer to buy a GTI and left with a 2014 A4 with the Black Optics package. First off - astounding looking car. Audi has come a long way from the 'bubbly' design of early 2000s. Secondly, it's the smoothest car I've ever driven. That's coming from someone who owned a 550, 135 and RX over the past decade. It's undoubtedly due to the higher torque at lower revs as well as amazing steering feel. One thing I wished: I think the car could do with a bit more power at the higher end (3-4k revs); but it doesn't necessarily need it for most Americans' driving style.Overall, amazing car, buy it and don't worry about a thing.",5

I really don't understand where Acura is shifting its target demographics, which is a pity, as they used to have such sweet packages. They no longer offer manual transmissions in cars worth buying.After long research the manual A4 quattro hit the sweet spot for features, quality and price. Drove one and got instantly hooked. So much technology, so nicely packaged on top of a mechanically exquisite car. A car that shares an engine and transmission with the Golf GTI, but packaged so much better. A blast to drive._____________________________________________________________Update after 2.5 years of ownership. Still enjoying the car, although the wife drives it more frequently these days. In the meantime I also acquired a BMW M235i, which I love, but that only completes my car ownership experience between the two cars. Audi is still the more comfortable and the go to car for any longer family trip. The BMW is the car to be in when alone and on shorter trips. The Audi is for family trips and for when I'm getting tired of the firmer BMW ride. Audi has a great suspension, firm enough to have an adequate attitude, but soft enough to be comfortable in most conditions. With good winter tires Audi is unbeatable in snow and ice. You don't get the thrills of the BMW acceleration, and precise handling, but you don't need that most of the time, and what you get in the Audi is plenty adequate for a very decent price. I also love the Quattro Torsen implementation. I just can't understand why Audi is messing up with such a great system for the more complex and likely less reliable Haldex in the newer designs. BTW, when researching my BMW I rode all sorts of other cars. I just can't go back to the over pampered and mushy experience in the Japanese cars. Don't get me wrong, they're great for the right people, just not for me.",5

They just aren't what they used to be. Then we drove the quattro.  Man, what a ride.  It blows the Bimmer out of the water.  It may not be as fast 0-60, but feels better in every other regard.  It corners better, it has a slightly stiffer suspension, and hugs the road like a bear. If you are thinking about a Bimmer, do yourself a favor and test drive a quattro.    P.S.

I was envious of the 2017 A4's engine output and torque figures. I mentioned it to the tech and while having the car serviced. He said, ""Just chip it!"" So, I did. In July of 2017 with 88,800 miles on the car, I went with the Stage 1 ECU upgrade from APR (goapr.com). The power improvement is immediately noticeable, and it's addictive. Once you get used to the improved performance it's not easy going back to the stock configuration. Just to be cautious I do revert to 'normal' engine mode every so often. The 'chip' has 4 modes: 93 Octane; 91 Octane; Valet [which restricts speed to 30 MPH] and Normal or Stock. My fuel efficiency has decreased as expected, but it actually improves when I run on cruise control for long distances.  I cannot accurately note the loss of efficiency because I went from Pirelli P7 Cinturato Low Rolling Resistance tires to Michelins Pilot Sport A/S 3+. Before having the chip installed I noticed a decrease in fuel efficiency with the change in tires. I'm still loving this car. A friend of mine, who happens to be an executive with Enterprise Holdings and is always driving the latest and greatest that the company has to offer, get's in and says, ""Ya know, I like this car!"" And believe me, this friend is NOT free and easy with compliments. I have 102,000 miles on the car. I am meticulous about maintenance and Keeping the car clean and shiny.  I was honestly looking at another Audi, but realized I'm gonna entire soon and will most likely keep this one as long as I can.  Still Enjoy This Automobile!My original review, made shortly after purchase follows this updated review.  I have owned the 2014 Premium Plus version of Audi's A4 for 30 months and 76,000 miles.  I still Love this car! I learned  of an issue with deposits accumulating on the intake valves of direct injected turbocharged engines.  I learned of some measures to reduce this accumulation and so far so good.  Performance remains consistent i.e. very much the same as when I first began driving the car.  I do my own oil changes at 5K mile intervals. I did notice that the HVAC unit seems to blow cold air when I wanted heat.  I mentioned this when I a had the car serviced. The technician assured me that all was as it should be. At my last service there was an update to the programming of the HVAc unit addressing the issue that I had identified earlier. The dual zone climate control now works as prescribed.   We looked at the new A4 but, in terms of styling, it seems dull compared to the 2014 (B8). Tires and wheels have been an issue as having never had blowout nor wheel damage I never anticipated a need for a wheel and tire warranty.  With the 18"" wheels, I purchased a new set of tires in six months. I've also had to have 3 wheels straightened at that place in Bath PA. Glad they're close by. I'm headed there again at the end of this month. Other than that there have been no issues. The car still gets nods and 'nice car' comments. And most of all, ""I STILL THOROUGHLY ENJOY DRIVING THIS CAR!!! Still feels good every time I get in. Color me 'Happy'! Here's my original review:Just purchased a 2014 A4. The driving dynamics are amazing and better than the new BMW's. I have driven performance cars all my life and the handling of this car is sublime. The styling is subtle and elegant. The engine lacks the sonorous qualities of more performance oriented vehicles but given the plebeian power figures the car moves with an alacrity and agility that genuinely impresses; credit the 8 speed Steptronic transmission. Steering, while a bit numb is direct and precise. That's all I need from a sedan. Amenities abound and present themselves when you least expect them. It's like an Armani suit, the closer you look at the details the more beautiful touches you find. The A4 IMHO blends Power Elegance and Beauty like few automobiles ever have. Love this car!!!OKAY! Here we are at 86,600 miles....and I'm still in love with my A4. Nothing much has changed at all. I have had no issues with the mechanics of the car and she still turns heads and gets the occasional envious glance if not an outright thumbs up.  I purchased a new set of Michelins as opposed to the OEM Pirelli's, which featured low rolling resistance.  I notice an increase in fuel consumption. of about 2 or 3 MPG.  But the Michelins feel softer and offer more feedback and about the same grip.",5

I love the hard feel. Plenty of power. I put the car in dynamic mode and it reminds me of my 1970 TR6. It's a blast. Ok so it's not as pretty as my A5 but it drives like a sports car. The downside is all the electronics. Way to difficult to master. But if pure driving is what your looking for you found it. To update my listing. MPG not what I had expected. Only getting about 26.5 . Very disappointed with the summer tire I just had to replace @ 21,000. Car could use some more HP. Otherwise the car still runs and looks great.

The S-Line interior is amazing and the sport seats are extremely comfortable and supportive.  The turbocharged four-cylinder engine is decent but you will suffer slight turbo lag and it can't compare to the supercharged six-cylinder in the S4.  I drove the 328i/335i, C300, IS 250, and G37 and decided the A4 was the best car at combining fun-to-drive, nice interior and exterior design, fuel economy, and technology.  My one disappointment is the fuel economy--only 23.3 mpg over 62,000 miles of mixed driving (almost all driving in regular ""D"" mode; I rarely put it into sport mode).  The car has been reliable with only two non-routine repairs, both of which happened in the last 10,000 miles.  I'm very happy with the car and am looking at the new ""B9"" A4 to replace this one.",5

This one is my first, although it is used.  A mint condition 2011 with 41k miles bought in early 2016.I REALLY debated over getting rid of my Ram pick-up, paid off mind you, for a few years of monthly payments.  The monthly payments are well within my comfort zone, so I'm not crying poor mouth, but I'm the frugal type and view the payments as opportunity cost.As with any car purchase...........do your homework.  As previously mentioned, years 2009 through 2011 are known for oil consumption issues (turbo engines only).  This alone caused me severe pause.  Not only did I go over the Carfax (work related to fixing this issue will be there if done by a reputable dealer) with a fine tooth comb, I actually called the shop, also on the Carfax, where my vehicle received all of it's milestone check-ups and spoke to the service people.  They were kind enough to review the service history of my vehicle with me.  My Audi has never been in for oil consumption problems.  The service person told me that it was unlikely that I'd experience this given the mileage......it should have popped up by now.   I also called Audi of America and confirmed that Audi has agreed to cover all repairs related to the oil consumption issue for 8 years or 80,000 miles.  Whichever comes first.  So with that final nugget of information I took the plunge.The car rides wonderfully and is extremely comfortable.  It took a while to get used to all of the buttons and gizmos (my A4 is a loaded premium package) but I feel so spoiled now when driving.I absolutely love the AWD (Quattro) but have noticed understeer when hitting a corner a little too hot.  It's not horrible, but you do need to muscle up a bit when turning into a corner at an above average rate of speed.  Very satisfied and am hoping that this is my starter car for what will be a long relationship with Audi.",5

I  was disappointed in this model but my new certified pre-owned has all the features my basic car lacked.  It is a premium plus.  I love the back up camera and split backseats.

I love driving it -- the car scoots and turns corners like it's on rails. I don't drive fast enough to notice any understeer, which is reportedly present (CD). Only two minor complaints: First, it uses oil. In the two years I've owned it, only two extra quarts, but still extra oil. Second, the radio has an inexplicable quirk. I regularly (read always) listen to an AM talk-radio station. Once in a while - it seems to correspond to cold wet weather - the sound flops from low to high volume. The amount of flop seems to correspond to the settings that specify how much the radio sound is turned down when the parking sensors are doing their job. But the parking sensors are not on and it only weirds out on the one station; others play just fine. I guess as long as you don't listen to talk radio, this is not an issue. Note: The dealer couldn't figure it out and was not interested in fixing it, despite it being under full warranty when I took it in. That didn't please me much. I'll buy my new 2017 Q5 somewhere else.I repeat -- I absolutely love this car -- more room than a BMW 3-series and just as fun to drive.",5

I bought the car in May of 2017, and it is March of 2018. So far, there have been over $2100 in repairs, and there is still more to be done. At 20 years old, some of it is understandable, but the seats are not comfortable for the 4 hours car trips I take, and all parts cost extremely high. An MAF sensor for a Ford is around $40, but for Audi - $180.

Jump 24 months later and it's almost like I have a 3rd child, I absolutely love this car!  Okay so let me start off by saying that the car was not perfect when I got it.  Be weary of coil packs and suspension components on this car.  I knew what I was getting into, because I've owned german cars before and follow car tuning forums.  So if you're looking to buy this car, please get it with a carfax and buy from a responsible person.  The previous owner of my car had it for 12 years and kept it completely stock!  Since I've had it, I've upgraded to coilovers and had a performance chipped installed as well as a new diverter valve.  I did all the preventative maintenance for the car the very first month I got it.  Regardless of what the previous owner told me.. I redid the oil change, I rotated the tires and realigned the car.  I also had the car checked out by an independent Audi Specialists who personally gave me the thumbs up.  Without going into detail, I spend an additional 3k on top of the 2.5K on the car just to make sure it was in top shape.  Some of you may think I'm crazy.. but here's the deal, at the end of the day I got a 200hp turbo, all wheel drive, stick shift, german car for $5500 with no check engine lights, no oil leaks, no ABS issues, no airbag lights... no regrets!  The car is an absolute blast to drive, what's so great about it, is that you won't catch any attention and you won't have a car that looks like everyone has one.  In my opinion the car looks beautiful and is so very simple.  BTW I've driven this car on Angeles Crest on many occasions and not once has it ever over heated or gave me trouble.  Excellent car for tuners and a great car for someone who just wants to have a fun driving experience with the added safety of the quattro system.  Before I conclude this brief review, I must let everyone know that this car will treat you right BUT you must treat it right, meaning you must keep it fed with premium gas as well as use only synthenic oil and OEM fluids.  Please please please don't cheap out on these things.  My Audi as 210000 miles and is still on the original stock turbo.",4

I added a GIAC chip which gave a little more throttle response and that was all the power I needed. The 2.8 is very smooth, the handling is great and it's a georgous car. On the other hand there have been some reliablity issues. I've replaced: eng fan, control arm, tie rods, defective CD chg, vac line (recall), cam seals, T-stat, and now the ABS controller is dying. Other probs were from fine tuning modifications that I added. I do most of my own maint and shop for aftermarket parts online and junkyards for deals on parts. So it hasn't been that bad financially.

Other than that this car has been fantastic.

Seeing as this was my personal 'to and from the office' car, I didn't go crazy with options, opting for just a handful: performance package (primarily for the shocks and sweet looking wheels), the driver comfort package (Homelink being the big one there) and the Driver Assistance package (camera/back-up sensors etc.)First off... the car's a hoot to drive. Setting the exhaust to dynamic makes the most of the engine, and makes it sound considerably sportier. The engine is responsive and the engine doesn't lack for power. I do suspect that my car is an underachiever in terms of horses - I'm not getting close to sub-5 second sprints to 60. This could also be because my engine only has 3K on it. The car handles extremely well - feels as well planted as anything I've ever owned - including my e92 335i coupe.The largest disappointment for me is the gearbox. I find that there's .5 seconds of lag between input and response - this isn't turbo lag per se, this is the gearbox being slow in response to the input. This happens across the rev range. (even in launch control mode) Audi really needs to look at the software and possibly tweak it. I know that other aftermarket parts suppliers have also noticed this and addressed it through add-ons. I also think that Audi should give this thing more than 6 forward speeds. I think that a 7 or 8 speed DSG would further help with performance and also improve highway mileage.Interior-wise, the cabin is stylish. I like the two tone seats in mine. I went for the black/grey leather combination - I find the black/red a little too garish for my taste. On the whole, I like the interior - although, a little more storage space would be welcome. The plastics on certain areas feel a little cheap. Back seat leg space is sufficient for my kids - think adults could be a little cramped over long distances.As a whole, I'm very happy with my car - and look forward to driving it. I just hope that they can address the minor items I've called out above (in particular, the transmission lag)",5

The S3 is an incredible amalgam of power, speed, comfort, features and appearance. It includes Homelink (garage door opener), manual sport seats (Recaro quality), nav system, and a ""jukebox"" (hard drive) that will hold up to 3,000 songs. The Bang & Olufsen sound system is great, so I rip my .mp3s at their highest resolution. The sales staff even made an after-delivery tutorial session where we set up the car's parameters. Switchable magnetic suspension, multiple drive and shift modes. Shocks Corvette and Mustang drivers! 4wd!!! After 18 mos, this car is still incredlbly fast and agile. Yet it can be driven in 'granny mode' very comfortably. A good radar dedector is helpful, as simple passing maneuver acceleration can put the car at 85-90 with no conscious effort. Takes gentle mountain curves at 110 with ease and a remarkable lack of drama, making a pleasant Sunday drive into take-me-to-jail territory.

However we needed AWD, fast (300ish hp), high quality, cargo space, fun, cool looking, DSG type auto transmission car.  Audi is the only one building that and it's the S3.  Considered S4 but MPG too low; Golf R has too little cargo room but nice car. S3 combines amazing refinement, quiet ride, taut but comfortable euro sedan ride, throaty exhaust when punched, great looks, good MPG, driver assistance that can be shut off, & much more.  The 2015 S3 is dual personality and you decide which one you want: rip roaring sports car or a easy driving luxurious touring sedan.  Amazing.Update 11/2017:   Still love this car and will never sell it.  It draws many compliments and I never seem to see that many S3s running around.  I like this 2015 styling better than the ""update.""  The update has more ""check mark"" style of headlights which I do not prefer.  I ran the S3 at the track and it was 100ºF that day.  With Nitto NT05 tires it performed well but wasn't scary fast; cornered very well however.  For me though it's not a track car but a perfect street car.  298hp Is adequate (and I'd like more).  But the S-Tronic transmission is the win in the S3: it uses the power very efficiently and you'll be able to beat a lot of cars that should be faster (I know b. I've done it).  Interior is amazing still, very comfortable and upscale showing very little wear with the high class materials.  No reliability problems whatsoever have cropped up although my car is fairly low miles.  MPG is around 25 which is amazing for an AWD sports car with this power.  When the warranty wears out I will put a Stage 2 APR chip in it to easy and safely unlock more power.  Guys who've bought the RS3 say the cars run about the same until you hammer the RS3 which on public roads is ill advised.  Anyway, I'd buy this car all over again and I don't say anything out there that I like better.  If I did I'd buy it.",5

I'll change as soon as one comes available. $50k car in 2015 with no Homelink, memory seats, data USB, boggles me. Interior storage also sucks. Glove box is a joke! All the items fall out when you open it. This message is for Audi but I DO encourage anyone to buy it. Its awesome!!",4.625

I truly believe this car was made for me. It's luxurious, it's FAST, and it corners way better than my S4 ever did. The factory sound system (B&O) is second to none and the technology is very up-to-date. My days are actually a little brighter since this little car has entered my life. Audi has created a true masterpiece.",5
6006, on 09/01/16 13:44 PM (PDT),Jim Glass ,2016 Audi S3 Sedan 2.0T Prestige quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),2016 Audi S3 is terrific!," I consider myself a bona fide car nut this being my 38th car I've purchased. Just to correct one thing, it does have a USB port in the console under the armrest right next to the Audi connect port. For perspective, I've owned several BMW's including 3 and 5 series, a Z4 3.0 and a slew of Benzes ranging from S-Class and G-Wagen to SLK and CLK430 and currently a mint CLS500. Two cars before this purchase, I owned a Porsche Cayman S for 4 years.  I've autocrossed, done track days and been a sports car fan since the late 50's when I first saw Jim Kimberly in his Ferrari win a race.  Enough history.  I shopped the M235i and MB GLA45 AMG before making this buy. The S3 is a true entry level luxury rocket. It has all the tech anyone could want (and probably never use). Mine is a Prestige and has all the Driver's assistance goodies, e.g. adaptive cruise, lane assist, blind spot monitoring, Presense braking, etc. These things are truly workable and disconnectable, great for interstate cruising. Now there is also Launch Control, along with 4 driving modes.  The sound when in Dynamic, or S drive is among the best I've heard.  And did I mention this thing really does fly. Audi says 0-60 in 4.7 sec. Motor Trend, C&D say 4.4 sec. One does have to know how to make it launch but it can be done in several ways only has one ""must"" step, disable the traction control. Shift to ""S""or manual, disable the TC, step on the brake and floor the gas. It winds up to 4,000rpm. Take your foot off the brake and hold on.  The sports seat are very comfortable but lack electric adjustment! Don't select the sports seats and you get electric. This isn't a big issue unless a number of different drivers will use the car. Not a problem for me.  One other lux feature missing but available if ordered at the port is Homelink. It's not on the option list but ask if it is a must have and it can be installed.  The B&O audio is terrific and entertainment sound options are numerous, Sirius, two of your own SD cards, BT stream through your phone or iPad, and it all works easily, automatically once you hook it up. The MMI system is as noted by many auto mags, easy to use and a really nice interface. On a closing note, neither the BMW or Benz interiors are nearly as nice and they don't have all of Audi's tech either... and comparably equipped (to the extent possible) they will cost $5-8,000 more.  Check their depreciation vs Audi's 53% after 5 years.  In summary, if you're in the market for a small luxury road rocket, you must give this car a look. As an update, I've now taken several road trips and have 8200+ miles on the odometer. The car continues to perform brilliantly with my only gripe being the inability to receive text messages unless iMessage is disabled and Twitter responses being very limited. Other than those 2 issues, I continue to believe I made the right decision purchasing Tis wonderful little sedan.",5

Handling and agility are tight and inspire confidence.  Acceleration is great, especially for the size of the engine; after taking it out for a spin, it took some effort to convince my friends and family that it was only a four-cylinder engine.  Shifting into higher gear at high revs sounds great, but engine noise when daily driving is calm and unobtrusive.The size is great for an urban area when you still want to fit people in the backseat - I'm 5'11"" and would be just fine sitting in the back on a decent road trip, though the back is not super roomy.  I prefer the smaller wheelbase over the BMW, as it only adds to the zippy feel of the car.  I compared the Golf R and the BMW M235, and was most impressed and got the best deal by far with the S3.  A must is the performance package (either the standard or the black optic) - the magnetic suspension is taut when on smooth freeways but welcomingly smooth when avoiding potholes in the city.  Extremely happy with my purchase, and would recommend to anyone in the market for a car that is sporty, luxurious, practical (relatively), and a great value.  You'll love it.",5
6009, on 05/27/16 10:44 AM (PDT),barmoley ,2016 Audi S3 Sedan 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),The little S3 that could," I am really enjoying this car. I didn't expect to enjoy it this much, but I do. I am coming from driving a 2012 E93 BMW M3 convertible, which was an excellent car in its own right. I expected to like the S3 after test driving it, but I could never imagine that I will like driving it more than the M3. Where the M3 felt powerful and fast the S3 feels quick and nimble. It is difficult to explain, but for me, driving the S3 is more relaxing and more controlled at the same time. M3 had better steering and better breaks even though S3's steering and breaks are excellent too. I like the power delivery of the S3 better. In S mode there is no turbo/transmission lag and D mode is OK for everyday driving. Magnetic/Active damping makes the car more comfortable, it is stiff, but not nearly as harsh as the M3 was.One thing I haven't figured out and having a slight trouble with is the Bluetooth connection. I am using it with Nexus 6P and streaming music gets muted very shortly after the car starts and Bluetooth gets connected. The music is still streamed but sound is not coming through the car or the phone. I need to turn off Bluetooth on my phone and turn it back on to fix it. After that all is well. Also, if I use Waze and Audible through Bluetooth, Waze interrupts the audiobook, but there is no sound coming from Waze, so I know that it was trying to tell me something, but not what it was trying to say.",5

6011, on 05/20/16 11:31 AM (PDT),Jeff ,2016 Audi S3 Sedan 2.0T Premium Plus quattro 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),Couldn't be happier with it," Third update: Still love it! To be fair, however, if I was thinking about purchasing a new S3 today, I'd probably wait and compare it to the upcoming RS3 first, which my local Audi dealer has told me is due to arrive in November. That said, if it's in as short supply as the BMW M2 continues to be - and negotiating any sort of discount off of MSRP would be unlikely - I'd likely stick with the S3, assuming I could successfully negotiate as strong a discount as last time around.Also, to correct an earlier remark I made about the car: its HomeLink system is apparently dealer-installed, and in my case it wasn't listed separately on my invoice, for some reason (despite being charged extra for the dealer-installed tinted windows). Finally, just to note the one feature my car doesn't have that I wish it did: memory-stored seat and steering wheel positions. Considering my 2003 BMW had them, as do numerous vehicles priced less than even a base-level S3, this seems like an admittedly unusual instance of Audi cutting corners.Updated review: 3/12/17Still couldn't be happier with it! It's still quite literally in a class of its own: it's better than the CLA 45 despite being $15K cheaper, and BMW's smallest sedan is a size up from the A3/S3 (comparable to an A4). Yes, it has most of the same underpinnings as the VW Golf R (minus the magnetic suspension, which is absolutely a must-have item), but VW still has the lingering question of how badly Dieselgate will ultimately impact resale values.Updated review: 9/10/16It's now been four months since I bought my S3, and I remained as enamored with it as ever. Really, the *only* issue I have with the car is that it takes the A/C a while to get going, though note that I live in Texas and have to park it outside all day while at work. Still, the cold blast doesn't kick in until about 15-20 seconds after I start it, or at least it does when the temp's 95+ (which in my part of Texas is nearly every day between June and September). I also wanted to comment on remarks made in a few reviews posted since I wrote my original one. I've also had some curious issues with its Bluetooth system and my Nexus 6P phone, but much different ones than ""Barmoley"" apparently had. Rather than streaming music getting automatically muted, I've found that the car's Bluetooth system automatically activates the last music app I used even if I DON'T want to listen to music (and don't have *any* music apps open on my phone). The problem's not limited to either that one phone or merely Android phones; I also have an iPhone, and the *exact* same thing happens with it as well. In both cases the only way to prevent it is to turn off the phones' Bluetooth connection altogether. That said, I've never had any problems listening to either Google Maps or Waze navigation directions through the stereo. Finally, I wanted to correct one error in Jim Glass's otherwise-excellent review: the S3 does include HomeLink, and I'm pretty sure it's standard equipment. It's located in a slightly odd spot -- to the right of the driver-side visor, facing the left *window* -- but it's definitely there and has three programmable buttons.Original review: 5/20/16As a longtime BMW aficionado, I had some doubts at first about switching my allegiance over to Audi, but after owning my S3 for a while, I have ZERO regrets. While BMW seems to have lost its way in recent years -- at least in terms of offering vehicles that truly *connect* with the road -- Audi has gone the opposite route, upping its game with its S-series of cars as BMWs have gotten increasingly bloated (in terms of price *and* literal bloat, as in curb weight). The S3 is a pocket rocket in the truest sense of the term, with razor-sharp handling and incredibly quick acceleration for a four-cylinder vehicle. BMW doesn't even *make* a comparable vehicle; its closest competitor is the M2, which is only available as a (fairly impractical) coupe. The Benz CLA 45 is the S3's only direct competition, and I found it to be subpar in nearly every way, most of all in terms of price: while I managed to negotiate a final purchase price of under $40K for my vehicle -- and that's *with* a number of options, notably the Black Optic performance package -- most of the CLAs I saw had sticker prices north of $60K! (Much like BMW, Benz goes way overboard with its options pricing.) Even a Benz C450 AMG is difficult to procure for much under $50K (and a C63 obviously costs far more.)Furthermore, the S3 is the only one of the bunch that offers a measure of practicality to go with its sportiness. Good luck trying to fit anyone over 5'10"" or so in the back seat of a CLA; its roofline severely constricts rear head room. It has a surprisingly commodious trunk, with seats that fold down *far* more easily than those in any BMW I've ever owned. To be fair, rear leg room isn't great, but it's certainly better than that in a BMW 2-series (and only slightly less than that in a 3-series).",5

As well, the magnetic ride is a farce, I get a “banging” noise on the rear passenger sides strut, which bother my passengers as well as me. The dealership says “they don’t hear anything, and this noise is normal” but other forum posters say it’s not normal, as they are in the same predicament...

After driving it I was very impressed, and traded my 2011 Corvette Grand Sport for the RS immediately. The RS has acceleration equal to the Corvette's up to about 80 mph, is far more maneuverable, and much more exciting to drive. It probably would not be at its best on long road trips however, since the ride is somewhat stiff and the exhaust noise can be bothersome. I have also owned a Porsche Cayman S in the recent past, and the Audi is superior to that car in nearly every respect. Any prospective Cayman buyer should give the Audi serious consideration. However, after six months of ownership, the check engine light came on. Due to the rarity of the vehicle and its sophisticated engine, it took two weeks for my dealer to find and fix the problem.

I bought from Cary Audi in NC, and received excellent service from them, especially from the salesman, Jonathan Christie.I am very pleased with my new car. I had been driving a 2017 Porsche Cayman S, and I think that the RS is superior in nearly every respect. My only reservation is the exterior styling. My car is white, and it looks somewhat like an angry refrigerator. However, one spends most of one’s time inside the car, not outside looking at it. There is no better interior than that of an Audi, both from ergonomic and styling points of view.The car that turned me against my Cayman was the 2018 S3 that I bought last November.

The noted 0-60 speed has prob been underestimated. Acceleration is smooth throughout the power band, with only a hint of initial turbo lag.

The handling is outstanding, the 4 wheel-drive makes it glide on winding roads. The acceleration and take off feel like flying a rocket. Driving a TTS is a real pleasure. The TTS will not let you down, period.",4.875
6034, on 03/03/17 09:28 AM (PST),Andres ,2016 Audi TTS Coupe quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),The Lower Cost Cayman S," This is Audi's version of a Porsche!  Probably the Cayman S is the closest competitor in my view in terms of performance.  The Audi brings a fantastic quattro AWD system and rear seats for people under 5' tall (and I do mean UNDER 5' tall).  Audi has been making uber-reliable cars lately, and this one is no exception.  In fact, the only problem I've had is with the dorky blind spot monitor sensors.   I recommend sticking with the OEM 19"" or after-market 18 or 19"" wheels.  The 20"" look great, and are high quality wheels, but will give you a harsher ride.   I love this car.  A true sports car.",5

6036, on 11/10/15 19:41 PM (PST),Bailey Smith ,2016 Audi TTS Coupe quattro 2dr Coupe AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),Excellent for an enthusiast," Disclaimer, I purchased a TTS but this information is still pertinent to a TT buyer(Dynamics) With the recent refresh, Audi brings the TT more inline with its yet to be released R8 big brother. The new IE8888 2.0 liter turbo four cylinder works beautifully with the S-tronic transmission (the only one available in the U.S.). There is just a bit of turbo lag below 2500 rpm, but once in the boost power is of no concern at all. The acceleration is more than enough for the average driver, and at freeway speeds even the base TT passes other cars with ease (but be sure to let the S-tronic downshift a couple gears first). With Audi's Quattro system, grip in poor conditions is not a problem if you're being reasonable (note: I live in a very snowy area of the U.S.) but I have gotten it to intentionally slide at low speeds. In dry conditions you'd have to be quite reckless to get this thing to lose grip, but it is manageable when the rear steps out of line. It handles well, but, (and this is a critique of all Audis I've experienced) the steering is pretty numb and doesn't provide much in the way of feedback on the road surface. The steering is, however, well weighted and is direct enough that I barely even need to think about where I want the car to go. The suspension is on the firmer side but it isn't harsh or jarring at all on decent road surfaces, body roll through corners is negligible and the chassis feels rock solid. Fuel economy is also better than advertised in my car, at freeway speeds I have achieved 29 mpg (US cycle) when I was told I should be getting 27.5 mpg or less(Technology) The Virtual Cockpit is undoubtedly the star of the Interior. It does take some time to get used to controlling almost  everything through the steering wheel, but once acclimated it is quite intuitive and easy to use, even on the move. Safety isn't too much of a concern since the system is mounted very close to eye level (also of note I'm only 5'8"" or 172 cm) but don't be too distracted by it. Also, the screen provides a good enough viewing angle to allow a passenger to use the entertainment system without struggle, but they can change the layout of the guages if they go into a submenu. The one critique that I have for the Virtual Cockpit is that the control buttons are somewhat small even with my diminutive hands and I could easily see somebody with larger or gloved hands struggle with the steering wheel mounted controls. This is remedied with a more conventional MMI control set up intended mostly for passengers, but it is somewhat disappointing given that it's a selling point of this car. I also have the technology package and B&O sound system, the first out of necessity and the later out of desire. The parking sensors and rearview camera are a must for this car as judging distances can be somewhat tough. The blind spot monitor is also a must have option because the C-pillar is simply massive and obtrusive in everyday driving. I could foresee an instance where a driver cannot see a motorcyclist behind them due to the size of the C-pillar, and backing out of parking spaced makes me nervous. My only real complaint about the technology is that active cruise control or front collision prevention isn't even offered. Of note, I believe this is offered in Europe but not North America for some reason. (Interior) Audi is known for their excellent interiors and this is no exception. I opted for the sports seats and the leather quality is superb, as is the comfort they provide. It is quite easy to make a long journey in this car without being fatigued or uncomfortable. The dashboard is made of a pretty high quality soft touch material that lends itself well to the aesthetic of the rest of the interior. The vent mounted HVAC controls are also pretty intuitive and in my opinion look stylish and futuristic. As for the rear seats, they really are an afterthought. They are basically reserved for children and the most petite of adults, although I have gotten people of 5'5"" in the back for short periods, but they did complain about the space. In my experience they serve better as an extra storage space but they do have child seat mounts. One additional note, ingress and egress are difficult in this car not only by the long doors typical of coupes, but also by the wider side skirts and fairly wide door sill. Overall the interior is a great place to be as long as you do not plan on having more than one other passenger for long periods of time. (Storage) Despite its small size the TT actually impresses in the amount of storage it offers. There are numerous small cubbies in the main cabin and the trunk is surprisingly large, particularly when the seats are folded down. There is also a full size spare tire too(conclusion) This is a fun small high tech sports car that one can easily live with every day and enjoy. If you live in a colder climate and can justify having microscopic rear seats, this is a great all-weather sports coupe",4
6037, on 03/12/09 01:23 AM (PDT),Bruce ,2009 Audi TTS Convertible 2.0T quattro 2dr Convertible AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),Awesome Vehicle," I recently purchased my 2009 TTS convertible and could not be happier. The exterior look is a unique combination of sophistication and a fun roadster (I get a lot of head turns driving it).  The interior design is not only smartly laid out but the quality is obviously of the highest level.  It has great acceleration and a very smooth ride and handling at high speeds. While some may say the AWD feature (which is great for northern weather) may detract from the rear wheel drive sensation of speed and acceleration, I have not noticed this.  Overall, I cannot find a bad thing to say about this car.  It truly is a winner.   ",4.75
6038, on 06/21/10 18:16 PM (PDT),Reece ,2009 Audi TTS Hatchback 2.0T quattro 2dr Hatchback AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),Happy," If you're looking for an car that will turn heads then this is your car. I think in the Audi family r8s, s5s, ttrss and ttss turn heads. I would like to say rs6 and rs4 but you need to be an Audi fan to know what there about. I purchased our new car and instantly feel in love coming from an 2001 a4 then an 2006 a4 2l tfsi quattro, we are slowing working our way up. Our car is polar orange and its stunning. Manual gear box and upgraded leather package. New Zealand roads are perfect for these cars as they are mostly hilly and winding roads. You feel feel safe when driving them in all conditions. Hopefully one day we will move into an r8 or similar. Audi rocks ! ",4.875

I knew I was in trouble when I test drove it at the dealer. Wasn't looking to buy that day, but after the drive I knew I was taking it home. I've had it for almost a year now and very happy with my choice.  The car corners and handles with supreme confidence. It's unbelievable coming from a 2001 TT - what I can do with this car!  Coming from a manual I was a little skeptical of DSG. But the ability to paddle shift (key when engaging in spirited driving), the smoothness and quickness of DSG sold me pretty quickly.  Very rare to see the a TTS too. I've only seen one other in the Bay Area.  ",4.875
6040, on 06/11/09 19:48 PM (PDT),KMK ,2009 Audi TTS Hatchback 2.0T quattro 2dr Hatchback AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6AM),"Very Pleased, Came From Porsche, BMW, MB"," What a great vehicle.  Replaced a Lotus Exige which I mistakenly thought I could manage as a daily driver.  The Exige is brilliant but was simply a car to be endured to be enjoyed.  What the TTS loses to outright track performance from the Lotus it more than makes up with overall reliability, fit & finish, & comfort. I've had an R32 which the Audi is essentially a sexier, more powerful & luxurious, version.  Some alternatives are faster, sharper, cheaper, etc.  But, the Audi TTS is a brilliant fast, four-season sports car that can coddle you in luxury, large cargo area, and is a modern classic.  Price & Performance alternatives: BMW 135, 370Z.  STI/Evo are decent near-luxury considerations",4.875

No one believes that its a ""4 banger"".  Drove the 370Z, G37, M3, Cayman, Corvette, WRX, etc.  Nothing compares to the TTS.  this is now a real machine.    I'm glad Audi does not advertise in the mainstream market and keeps these gems to true car enthusiasts",5

I really like the transmission, the Corvette was a 6 speed stick, the TTS is a 6 speed dual clutch auto, it shifts really quick, both up and down, the Corvette transmission wasn't even close.The car itself seems very solid and rides well when not in the sport ride mode, the sport mode has very little damping.So far I would recommend the Audi TTS. I now have 16,000 miles on it, no problems so far.  But, the orginal Toyo tires wore out in 12,000, I put on Michlin Pilot Super Sports, they are wearing better and hold on in the corners better than the Toyos.",5
