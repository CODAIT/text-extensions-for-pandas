0, on 07/31/10 20:43 PM (PDT),Aldo ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Convertible Limited 2dr Convertible (3.2L 6cyl 6M),She is 100% Merc & Chrysler in name only," She & i say She, is a Peregrine Falcon. On the highway, all other cars for her are pigeons,  with the exception of a few eagles. She is 100% pure German Mercedes, with with nothing of Chrysler in her, except the name. For those that don't believe, lift her hood & check out the 12 spark plugs on her 6 cylinder engine. And what a fine engine she has! It pulls like a turbine fed small locomotive, just like her 8 cylinder big brothers! Love her!     ",5
1, on 12/22/09 22:05 PM (PST),george bobella jr. ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Convertible Limited 2dr Convertible (3.2L 6cyl 6M),Great Bang for Buck," This was wife's car became mine. She's gone. Love being in this machine. A real headturner, get's a lot of attention. The cupholder does work once you get used to it. Yes, the Console isn't a high point, yet you can upgrade to almost any material ie wood. Legroom is short and I'm maybe 5'10"". Still it's seats are good for a roadster. Put aftermarket Chip in and yes it was quicker but electric fan always stayed on. Took it out. Don't miss the little extra HP. Drove SLK 320 liked Crossfire better cause it looks better yet could not find extra price value with the MB. Ex wants car back. Would like to buy it. NO WAY MAN",4.75
2, on 12/22/09 11:29 AM (PST),bigdaddy0345 ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Convertible Limited 2dr Convertible (3.2L 6cyl 6M),poor service," I have had this car for awhile and have no problems till I brought it in for service. Had the oil changed and now I have a leak. Twice in about the leak and they said no leak, till I gave them the paper with oil on it. The car is great, but the service stinks. Don't trust corporate, they will avoid fault. I think I will stay with a Hyundai",3.5
3, on 05/22/09 14:39 PM (PDT),glmiller ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Convertible Limited 2dr Convertible (3.2L 6cyl 6M),What a Car!," The car is fun to drive.  The power for such a sample car is unbelievable.  The gas mileage is reasonable and the craftsmanship is outstanding. Some of the problems is that it only has one cup holder in the cabin.  Also when getting the oil changed, if you don't do it yourself, be ready for a shock.  The filter is $31.00.  The engine takes 8.5 quarts of 0 W 40 which is not cheap.  So the total cost for a change will run between $110 to $120.  But the enjoyment of the car is well worth the price. ",5

The car is great once you get it out of first gear (they should have combined 1st and 2nd, you have to shift too quickly), has styling that gets a ""Nice car!"" at least once a day, and has gas mileage that is much better than I was expecting of around 22-24 mpg.

In my opinion, Crossfire is by far more top tend than Miata, cooler then Z-4 and others.  I drive this car to work, 24 miles a day, and love it.  Head turner for sure, glued to the road, great average full economy of 24 mpg, and drives like it looks.  Great value.",4.875

This car is the most fun to drive vehicle I've ever owned!  It turns heads everywhere I go.  Great craftsmanship and handling. I hate to see Chrysler stop building them.",4.875
8, on 09/26/07 19:55 PM (PDT),Larry ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Convertible Limited 2dr Convertible (3.2L 6cyl 6M),Crossfire Limited Convertible," Purchased Spring, 2007 for daughter. This car has it all; looks, ride, power and safety features. For the price, we could not find a similar convertible with all these features.  The dealer incentive was the selling point.  We are pleased with the gas mileage, upper 20's on the highway and lower 20's in city. The only negative point has been a small water leak near the top and drive window. Expect to get this repaired easily.",5

I look forward to many years of driving this sweet little beauty.",5
10, on 06/18/18 15:44 PM (PDT),Clyde Bailey ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),sporty vehicle but with problems," This model car has a history of electrical problems, and mine is no exception. I've spent over $4000 trying to solve one problem that it still has--it frequently won't start on the first try--turn the key and you get nothing--no lights, no sounds, no start. I've replaced every item in the starting system without changing the no-start situation. Hot/cold weather, long-term parking, frequent use, all have no effect on the starting problem. I've discovered that when it won't start (about one time in a half-dozen attempts), pumping the clutch 2-3 times usually solves the problem. Twice I've gone outside and found the flashers working on the left side of the car without being turned on. Had to disconnect the battery.",3

Get a seat cushion for long trips if your back end is bony like mine. Use high-heel gel pads for your elbows (at the obvious places).

12, on 05/16/08 17:12 PM (PDT),Kim's dream ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Coupe Limited 2dr Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),Kim's dream realized," I began my quest for a sports car in the fall of 07 and was sold and ready to buy a Saturn Sky when a friend suggested that I give the Crossfire a try Thank God for suggestions, the car is such a great ride. Driving this car is like becoming part of the vehicle, you become one with the seat and thus the car itself. I am so glad I found this vehicle. The car is a brand new 2006 with  13 miles on it and I have only had it for 2 weeks but the car is sexy, curvy,sleek and so retro in design. I love this car and I absolutely love driving it. It is a true head turner. Thanks for the dream come true. ",4.75

14, on 02/23/08 19:03 PM (PST),Johnnie Mack ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),A supercar for most folks," Coming up on a year with this car, and have had nothing but good experiences. No glitches, just a nice commuter vehicle for my wife and I. Very nimble, and fast enough to suit me-the numbers suggest it will accelerate as fast as my old '89 Trans Am, but I'm out of the ""rat race"".  Tires are still in very good shape, and just 2 oil changes for maintenance.  A few negs-the seat is probably better in the Limited model, so maybe a retro fit is in order-this one generates complaints from my lovely wife of 31 years.  And the radio is annoying.  As we know now, the car has been killed by the new Chrysler. I guess a notchback version with a removeable window is out of the questions now, eh?",4.625
15, on 02/10/08 08:53 AM (PST),rampage ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),What a deal," I bought this on a whim when I was looking for a Mazda 3 wagon a year ago. The $19k price tag was a deal maker.  Driving it is a treat and I'm still impressed with its handling, braking and looks. The 6 speed manual taps the power in the engine efficiently and it feels great to be pressed back into the seat upon acceleration. The only drawback is that is does not go up icy hills well so it's garaged when it snows.  My 6'3"" tall husband cannot strech his legs out straight, but he is very willing to make the sacrafice. Cargo area is plentiful for everyday and weekend jaunts. I swore I would never own a Chrysler product but this is the best car I've ever had.  ",5
16, on 04/20/07 19:38 PM (PDT),Cincinnati Slim ,2006 Chrysler Crossfire Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),A fun loving beauty!," This is such a cool little car! Beautiful, impractical, cramped and hard to see out and I'm just crazy about it. Like a super hot girlfriend, you overlook her bad habits because you're having so much fun!  Some car reviewers have said the car's chassis and brakes are so good that It could use more power. I'm sure not complaining. I think it's a blast to drive yet, unlike most performance cars I've had, it is very forgiving. The ESP/Traction Control/ABS systems work very well especially in bad weather. It really makes you feel like a hero.",4.75
17, on 10/11/17 07:57 AM (PDT),Scott Isitoro ,2004 Chrysler Crossfire Hatchback 2dr Sports Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),Scott loves this baby !!!!," This '04 Crossfire Coupe is rare...alabaster white with special-ordered red interior....awesome looking ! I constantly get asked about my baby at gas stations,stores, etc....For 215 horses, this thing can fly. Premium gas adds up as does expensive oil change with 8.5 quarts of rare 0W-40 oil. Good thing, though, is oil change isn't for 7-8,000 miles. Overall, highly recommend for speed, fun, goo-looks...am trying to get the SRT version now. Scott, Elgin, Il",5
18, on 04/13/17 11:37 AM (PDT),Dave V. ,2004 Chrysler Crossfire Hatchback 2dr Sports Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),Best Car For The Money," I bought my 2004 Crossfire not long ago purely by chance. I had pulled into a used car lot to look at a Porsche Cayenne when my wife spotted the Crossfire. Turns out the dealership had just repossessed the car and offered it to me for what was owed on it. The price was so reasonable I couldn't turn it down. I have had many sports cars and my last toy was a Jaguar XK8 but have had several Porsche, Jags and others that cost much more. While at 60 it isn't the easiest car to get in and out of it isn't too bad and somewhat expected. I had loved the way the XK8 had performed and I was surprised that the Crossfire actually performs even better. It is just a great looking and fun car to drive. Me not being content to leave any car alone I have replaced the stereo with one that has bluetooth and have done a few other things and will do more as I am looking at putting in a dash kit in carbon fiber as while okay I think it will dress it up inside a little. I have also ordered a performance chip although the car is already fast enough without it.Looks, style and performance at an affordable price, what more could you ask for.",5

20, on 06/19/16 09:36 AM (PDT),Mike ,2004 Chrysler Crossfire Hatchback 2dr Sports Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),Awesome car for the price," Bought the 04 model because everything was standard that year. Not a daily driver for a guy 6'3 (6'0 probably the limit) but I bought it for weekend use on backroads and getaways .  I like it's uniqueness in my area and it's rarity in the world. Yes you can find better performers, but not for less the double what i paid. The brakes approach supercar status with it's stopping power and the Mercedes drivetrain is a big plus. My car has 93k on it but most of those miles were between 04 and 2012 so I had it inspected by my mechanic and he found no issues.  A fun car and well worth the price if your looking for a coupe on a budget.",4

I got a manuel 6 speed on the floor and love going through the gears again...my wife and I enjoy going through the windy country roads...this car is fun fun fun....get one if you can and have some fun and feel like a kid again.

24, on 09/03/11 12:38 PM (PDT),ronfor1 ,2004 Chrysler Crossfire Hatchback 2dr Sports Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 5A),Beware," Car is product of bad marriage and even worse divorce between Mercedes and Chrysler. Chrysler unable/unwilling to fix warranty item, tried to buy back for half value. Dealer claimed no responsibility, deferred to Chrysler. Both unwilling to do the right thing by consumer. Car same as Mercedes SLK under skin but Mercedes also unwilling to assist in repair. ""Bastard child"" to both manufacturers..don't get suckered.",3.125
25, on 08/01/11 13:58 PM (PDT),bluefrog2 ,2004 Chrysler Crossfire Hatchback 2dr Sports Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 5A),Great car!!," I felt compelled to review based upon a touch of misinformation I've seen out there; if you want this car you should have no worries about buying a well-maintained one. I was not looking for this car but, when I found it I instantly fell in love! The car is fun to drive, plenty powerful (you won't be beating Corvettes in it - if you want to race high-power sports cars get something else), and handles much better than my BMW 330 did. Two issues I'd like to speak to: the engine mechanicals are a bit loud - relax, you're not about to throw a rod! Rearward visibility obviously isn't like a mini-van, but you'll acclimate to it quickly. If you want one, buy one, you be glad you did! ",4.5

The spoiler, which is similar to the Porsche, just makes the car! I'm a 20 year old student... this car is perfect for me. You tend to see older people driving them... for what reason I have no idea. This car is definitely for younger women!! It's stylish, sexy, reliable (except the darn cup holder), and fun! I will never sell this car! It is irreplaceable due to the fact that Mercedes will no longer take part in the make of this car! ",4.875

They can't be replaced unless you buy the entire light assembly at $400+ each. The back hatch door rattles real bad and mine has etched through the paint where the hard rubber has worn through it.  I wish it had an off switch for the back fin.  It's distracting, embarrassing and blocks your view in the rear view mirror.  Other than that it's been a fun driver!",4.375

Due to our snowy Canadian winters, I had to park it for about 5 months, but cannot wait to uncover her and hit the freeways again. It turns heads wherever I go, and people just stare and ask what it is constantly. I am only 5'8"", so getting in and out are a breeze. It handles like it is on rails, and makes every trip fun! I know it's not as fast as the 350Z or TT, but I feel it is a much sharper looking car, and lives up to the Mercedes name in every way. I have driven Jags and high end Acuras, and this car feels and looks more expensive. If you have the chance, buy one and hold on! This is a future collector's car for sure!",4.75

While I honestly do miss some of the Mustang's personality I absolutly love my Crossfire! This vehicle surpasses any other car I've owned to include a BMW z3. It's not the fastest but then again who really is?!  The car handles flawlessly and Ive found myself pushing upwards to 80mph on back country twisties. It gets looks everywhere I go and best of all there aren't a lot of them around unlike the ""me-too"" Mustangs. Only problem was my own doing as I put an aftermarket exhaust which causes occasional vibration/resonnance but the car sounds like it should for the looks. It's destined to be a classic!

Ruled out Infiniti and the Nissan 350 for this wonderful Crossfire. I purchased my 2004 in 2007 at a really good price were it only had 25K miles on it. The body had no nicks or scratches and looked brand new. It has been a fun car to drive and I always get positive comments on this looker.

After 25k miles there are no rattles or squeaks, mechanically it hasn't missed a beat, and the factory original tires (Continentals) have only just given up the ghost. The car is a sports car, not a grand touring car, and as such has some sports car short comings, chief of which is a slightly cramped interior package. Anyone over 6ft will find that this isn't the best long distance car on the road. But for short jaunts and weekend escapes it is pretty much unbeatable. Excellent (but not superb) handling combined with ""one of a kind"" styling makes the Crossfire a joy to own. ",4.625

There is no doubt about who built this car, it's German heritage shines through in performance and design. Simply stated, this car is absolutely fantastic from its brilliant skin to it's impressive manners and a plush interior that isn't found in many cars 3 times it's price.

37, on 04/10/08 14:56 PM (PDT),ugetcaughtupinthe ,2004 Chrysler Crossfire Hatchback 2dr Sports Coupe (3.2L 6cyl 6M),Just awesome," I love this car. I have tons of fun driving it on the highway, but the real rush is on country back roads. The car hugs the road. I drive hard and fast, and I almost never hear the tires (especially over the more than ample stereo). The wing that comes up at around 60 mph lets me know that I might want to back off the accelerator, but I usually don't. Its interior is small, but I mean come on look at the car. The controls are difficult to figure out, but easy to use, and there is a cup holder hidden in the center console. The vehicle isn't that bad in the snow and ice either (it has a winter mode, but don't try busting through snow drifts). Overall, its a steal for any true 2 seater.",4.75

Thanks to them, the value of my vehicle was greatly lowered.  (they drove down the value of the vehicle.)  Because of that, I purchased a luxury sports car at the price of a Kia!  The car is perfect for me, and I paid less than 1/2 its value when it was 1.5 years old, with only 4000 miles on it.  It is better than any other sports car I tried:  better than 350Z, Madza, TT, Honda, etc.  Only the Porsche Boxster was better, and it would have cost me 2x as much.  The car has speed, great handling, great looks (everybody stares when I drive by), and  great gas mileage.  It also has great trunk space no other sports car can match.

As many reviews state, it is not a high performance sports car.  It is, however, a fun sporty ride for an aging car enthuiast like me.

I picked up my 2004 Crossfire autostick with 5400 miles on it for under $18K. Immaculate condition. Considering that is the price of a boring old Civic, I grabbed one. Since this is a Benz SLK with pretty sheetmetal, it does inherit some of the old SLK's shortcomings. The interior is cozy, but I am 6'1"" and 270# and am very comfortable in this car.

I have only had to problems with this car. One was the door had rust building up due to the weather striping not being properly put on. The warranty took care of this. The other was the car has no spare tire. I had a blow out and no way to fix it. Since Chrysler does not offer a good road side assistance program on flat tires for a car that they make with no spare tire, I had to leave it on the side of the road and wait for help at 3:30 am . At the end total bill was $995.00 including the tire. Don't get me wrong I love the car, however I will never buy a Chrysler again due to the warranty leaving me stuck out.

Steering is a little old fashion-recirculating ball instead of rack and pinion.  However this is a solid car with Mercedes running gear, driveline and gauges and switchgear.  So if you are looking for a Mercedes vehucle without cash outlay then this is the car for you.  I paid $7000.00 for each one- the coupe is a 2007 and has 78000 miles, the convertable was  a 2005 and had 105000 miles.  I would recomend that you buy the lowest milage car you can find.  Also check service records and make sure proper oil changes are made .  8.5 quarts of Mobile one full synthetic.  Also make sure that it has always been filled with premium gas-otherwise can cause engiene issues.  Also might want to replace the Key Fob cases- can be had on Amazon for 10.00 each.",5

This is my daily driver, but stock tires (Conti's) are not good on any snow, wet driving is good; you'll need better tires if driving in winter conditions;rims are staggered but you can go with staggered tires if you can find the right ones.

The sticker states that this car has 90% German parts, all Mercedes. Great car for sure. It will only see sunny days.",4.75

That is not a problem with the SRT-6 with silky- smooth 330 BHP supercharged V6 - Daimler/Chrysler should have kept the AMG nameplate on the engine.  The car is really quick and, because of the suspension and braking upgrades, handles much better than the conventional Crossfire. I was worried about the ""rough ride"" described by numerous reviewers, but have not found that to be the case.  Overall, a great car for the price ($29k - brand new).     ",4.75

Wish it had ""tunable"" suspension like I hear the corvettes have, or SOME cushioning in the seats from the road.  Gets LOTS of looks, like folks say!

It pulls hard & upshifts from 3rd to 4th around 105 or so at full throttle. Trust what the reviews say about it & ignore the very few negative reviews because it's a superb performer.

I bought the car with 5,600 miles on it and was told the woman who traded it in had a bad back. Now I do too. I had a Nissan 350Z and there is absolutely no comparison between the two cars in performance or comfort. The trunk is useless too.

It's is comfort and performance and most of all, THIS CAR STILL TURNS THE HEADS OF EVERYONE 3 YEARS LATER!  Corvettes and Z's are normal cars, the Crossfire Roadster is still an eye opener.

This car, built on the SLK chassis handles as good or better than any other car I have owned! It sticks to the road thru tight turns and the ride is solid and extremely peppy!

I bought this car to replace a well worn Toyota Highlander. I wanted something fun to drive and a C5 or C6 Corvette was just out of range for my cash on hand. I happily stumbled across a 2004 Crossfire in Amethyst Silver metallic and fell in love immediately.  She used to be somebody's baby, and was turned out of her warm garage into the harsh desert sun for unknown shortcomings. They must have just fallen out of love, hey, it happens. She was dirty, her boot filled with the random flotsam and jetsam of life including uncashed checks and dirty socks. A few hours of derailed cleaning, a good scrubbing, and she was shining like a diamond in a goats ass. She just needed someone to love her again and she has responded accordingly. This car is truly a blast to drive. The 6 speed transmission is easy to work, clutch throw and pressure are exactly right on and the cockpit is laid out finer than your church clothes on a Saturday night. It is my first German car I have ever owned and it just makes sense, frightening really how much it makes sense. The only drawback I have discovered this far is my golf clubs do not fit in the boot. I have not come up with a solution, I'm considering building a small trailer that looks like mini Crossfire that would hold my clubs, cool and functional. I am averaging 25.8 mpg with the a/c on full blast, and a couple of quick jaunts at just over the speed limit. I do recommend using the cruise control on the highway, it is way too easy to lose yourself in the guitar riffs coming out of the speakers and allow your right foot to rest heavily on the responsive accelerator.             Day by day,night after night,Blinded by the neon lights.Hurry here, hustlin' there,No one's got the time to spare.Money's tight, nothin' free,Won't somebody come and rescue me?I am stranded, caught in the crossfireStranded, caught in the crossfire.Tooth for tooth, eye for an eye.Sell your soul just to buy, buy, buy.Beggin' a dollar, stealin' a dime,Come on can't you see that II am stranded ,caught in the crossfireI am stranded, caught in the crossfire.I need some kind of kindness, some kind of sympathy oh, noWe're stranded, caught in the crossfireSave the strong lose the weak,Never turning the other cheek.Trust nobody don't be no fool,Whatever happened to the golden rule?We got stranded, caught in the crossfireWe got stranded, caught in the crossfireWe got stranded, caught in the crossfire",5

Not only is it fun to drive but I get compliments on it wherever I go. People want to know what it is! I think Chrysler/Daimler made a big mistake when they quit making these cars, but on the other hand, mine is or will be a collector car. It is in excellent condition and it is better looking and faster than anything on the road. It was made in Germany and can do the autobahn with speed and agility.

The Crossfire is not at the same level as the Z3, but it is great fun, and such an unique design.  Definitely NOT just another boring plain vanilla that makes up the bulk of cars on the road. Plus, because the basic chassis & engine is from Mercedes (when they were still married to Chrysler), it drives solid as can be.

A lot of people down the Crossfire because of its 215 hp as opposed to the 350z's 300hp. It also loses in its 0-60 time about around .5 seconds or less. I blame this on the very poor first gear of the car, it's week and short. But other than that all of the other gears feel torquey and strong...and with the good suspension and huge tires think twice before you down this car.  People also fail to realize it has more torque than it does hourses, unlike most other 6cl cars.  It takes some bumps hard but the seats are comfortable and the sound system and toys are also really good.  I also very much like the exterior design.",5

You have BMW coupes, the 350Z, the G35 coupe, the S2000, to name a few.  And those cars are phenomenal in their own rights.  But I got my Crossfire for about $20,000, and it wasn't even a year old.  And be fair, which of these cars looks the most exotic? I think that as good as the other cars look, the Crossfire is in a different class. And it is fast enough.

I have had this car for the past 8 years and can honestly say, it has been a reliable family car throughout.  Plenty of storage in the rear with seats down, which comes in handy for anyone needing extra interior space you wont find other than mini van.  The car has had low maintenance over the years other than oil changes and wiper blades.  My Pacifica has over 150K. and has been a good car.  One of the reasons I bought it when I did was for the safety ratings it had with side air bags etc.  Most cars then didn't even have side air bags.  The Pacifica was rated very highly for safety regarding side impact and I have had my kids ride in it all over creation and felt safe.  It has a deep console for storage along with sun glass holder and the arm rests along side the seats are great for long trips.  The Pacifica was the precursor to the hybrid SUV style cars and many manufacturers seemed to have copied much of its function and style over the years to a bit more modified versions.   I also like the placement of the things you need access to while driving... key on dash (easier to access) than on the column; manual shift option; lights and wipers and radio channel changer in steering wheel everything at your finger tips.",4

It's a great family vehicle and kids love it. Coming from a 2dr wrangler, this was a huge gain in interior space although huge decrease in coolness. It accelerates ok but transmission can be jittery in changing gears. fuel economy ok for an 06 car. Took it on a long road trip and performed exceptionally great. Have only changed the oil and replaced back rotors. It's a huge vehicle with plenty roominess, but sucks to park in the city parallel parking. Driving it feels like you're driving a sedan - sort of.  Seems like i got one of the good ones as many other reviews claim issues with transmission, motor mounts and rusting engine cradle. If i ever have to fix any of those issues, will just trade it in or sell it for cheap. Kids love it. It's a popular vehicle on used car market, so much so Chrysler brought it back as a new full fledged mini-van which looks like a giant chunky 200c , apparently they are killing off the Town and Country and the Dodge Caravan. I have the base version with the 3.5L engine which is ok. I can imagine the 07-08s with the 4.0L have much better acceleration and have a 6 speed transmission as opposed the 4 speed on mine, but those cost more and look like are less reliable. Would recommend if you buy it with under 100K miles and make sure to inspect motor mounts and engine cradle are not rusted out, otherwise you will be stuck with moneypit no one will buy.",4

I’ve had to fix a host of other things that i’d rather not recall just had it tow to the shop again -evap codes- possible why its shutting off.

313, on 10/09/15 18:54 PM (PDT),sbernal ,2006 Chrysler Pacifica Wagon Limited 4dr Wagon AWD (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Great... Sometimes," I bought this car in July 2014 with exactly 100K miles, maybe a few over.  It is now October 2015 and the car has about 118K.  I'd say it's appearance is good and holds up decently in terms of newer vehicles.  People ask the year of the vehicle and are surprised it is a 2006.  The quality of the ride is excellent due to the attention Chrysler put on the suspension and the spaciousness of the cabin is enviable in the 6 cylinder class.  That said, I think the engine is too small for the vehicle.  The acceleration is terribly sluggish and I always think I'm driving faster than I actually am.  I think I'm doing about 50 and look down to see I'm barely breaking 40.  I feel like a V6 engine should be adequate, but the way they did it in this car is NOT adequate.  The transmission is fully functional, but I kind of fear for it.  It can be slow to shift and occasionally give an ugly clunk upon both acceleration and deceleration.  I think 118K is far too early to be fearful of a transmission replacement.  The AWD feature on most models is a huge positive.  After the torrential New England winter last year, this vehicle performed exceptionally well.  I drove the car for the first 10 months of our ownership.  However, my wife works in a location where the driveway in is nearly a vertical slope -- and the Pacifica made it up regardless of the quality of the weather.  She asked me to borrow it so many times, I eventually told her it belonged to her.  In terms of instrumentation, I am disappointed.  Chrysler had always billed this vehicle as one with luxury styling.  The dash display is nearly identical to a Town & Country years older.  We had a friend who drove a 1998 T&C and the instrumentation was nearly identical.  Very basic, as far as I am concerned.  Speedometer, gas gauge, tachometer.  Where is the engine thermostat?  I've never owned a car that didn't have one.  How about a display showing the temperature outside?  Miles to empty display?  I realize there are different ""grades"" of this car, however this was is not the total base model.  I replaced a 2001 Volvo with this one also labeled ""luxury"", so I figured 5 years was enough for Chrysler to catch up.  Not so much.  It's sorely lacking and seems like the primary place Chrysler cheaped out on.  Speaking of ""cheaped out on"", Chrysler installed a DVD player in my vehicle beneath the radio, but did not install a monitor.  So... you have exactly half a unit.  I have looked into installing a monitor multiple times.  The cost is astronomical.  If you have a third party do it, the cost can be in the thousands (on a now-9 year old American car... I'll pass).  If you attempt it yourself, you'd be better no less than ""Level:  Expert"".  The number of items you have to disassemble inside and the number and cost of the parts you have to buy is enough to destroy your will to live.  You need to be both mechanically and electrically inclined with precision -- this requires replacing the headliner with a brand new one and re-cutting the fabric to match all the things sticking out like it did from the factory.",3

We bought it in July, it was finally cleared from the dealer's service bay in November.  That could be a record.   The issue was an EVAP code that eventually led to having both fuel pumps replaced (the car has two).  The dealer began with the easy stuff (replacing valves and the gas cap). The vehicle is an overall very good SUV.  It is spacious and the ride quality is on par with higher-end SUVs.

Yes, Space is cleverly designed with seat or cargo compartment under the leg floor. There is a plenty of power under the hood and acceleration is really good. You will never get disappointed on the power. Keep in mind fuel economy thus shies a bit around 17mpg combined and 22 on highway. (all readings actual on long runs)The autobreaking on pre-collission is a bit tricky since it is depends on the speed if they are active or not.  Chrysler does not precisely say at what speed it starts monitoring. It definitely will not work while parking. But Automatic rear breaking starts working ok-ish  after I clocked 4000 miles.

Let me state upfront I loved the pacifica’s styling and features.  It’s a beautiful vehicle.  All the interior controls are well thought out.  I loved the one touch button to move up the drivers seat, which assisted in getting the kids in and out quickly.  Stow and Go Seats cannot be beat.  However, I had my van in the shop more times in the under 2 years I owned it than I had all my previous vehicles in the shop, Combined! Every time I brought it in was a whole day lost, and I had to remove out three car seats and reinstall them in a loaner (if I got one) or just go without car for the day.  I had problems with electronics, transmission, doors, and more.  The vehicle does not shift properly.  It fails to shift up a few times a week and just gets very high rpms and then brakes weird when this happens.  The dealer cannot figure it out.  This really disturbed me because we were 20,000 away from the transmission warranty being gone too.  20,000 miles is about one year for our family.    I cannot even remember all the problems I had.  I know the service manager by name and he knows me.  This is not good or desirable.  I finally decided to cut my losses.  Just after my initial warranty ended, I of course had my first repair to pay for out of pocket at about 37,000 miles.  We looked into the lifetime warranty at this point through Chrysler, as it was clear to us that it would be needed.  The cost was $4,500 plus $100 deductible for each repair.  We decided not to throw more good money after bad.  I traded it in for a 2018 Honda Odyssey and am so happy!!!!  Will never ever buy another Chrysler Jeep Dodge vehicle.",2

Tow truck came to take me to tire shop. The driver said those inflators never work. At the tire shop I was toldthat they could not repair the tire because the sealer was pumped into it. So the cost of a new tire was very close to $200.and two days to get an exact replacement. Then I found out that I had to replace the inflator sealant , another $80 some.and on order.  So a simple flat was going to cost me about $280 something and wait for sealer refill. When if I hadn't used the sealant it might have been repaired. To me this is a very bad system in order maybe to keep cost down  or milage up. Also believe it or not I can't turn off the radio. I can only mute it. Fine except when you restart the vehicle the radio defaults to unmute state. Every one in the vehicle says it annoying.",4

It tools along without vibrations and tracks true. Road sounds have been my biggest complaint not noted in the Pacifa at all.  Of course I have maintained my car extremly well with synthetic oils and replacement of mechanical accessories when they fail but NEVER touched the engine save for a rebuilt transmission and a valve and oil pan gasket change. It has been safe and comfortable and hauled tons of people and gear, furniture art and all manner of materials in and out (roof rack).  I have gotten my moneys' worth and more.

Really a color that absorbs heat and holds it, then shows every speck of dirt or debris possible. The transmission sometimes has a lag or can not decide what to do when you need it to, or you squeal the tires when you did not mean to. The engine has power but at higher altitude it needs to take a breath before moving. The second and third row seats are uncomfortable for extended road trips, not enough adjustment in the head rests on all the seats. Second row seats need more support and rests for adults with third seat removed. Infotainment system needs some improvements with ability to bounce between unset stations while scanning stations without having to set a station. Navigation system is a complete waste of every ones time from the guy who picked the navigation program service; to the guy who installed it and the owner.

416, on 08/07/17 06:58 AM (PDT),James Autry ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Limited 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),DVD troubles," After one year and 4000 miles we are still very happy. We still find the electronics a little too complicated but feel if we drove it more we would be comfortable with it. We would like more cup holders in front and back.We much preferred the console in our 2012 T & C. We especially like the collision avoidance, lane change and active cruise control features. We averaged 29.6 MPG on a recent trip from Philadelphia to Raleigh, NC. We still average around 18 Mpg for our normal driving routine.Almost totally love my new Pacifica. Only problem is the DVD/CD system. Loading and playing a new disc takes at least 60 Seconds and can take more than two minutes if it is a well used disc. There is no hour glass or spinner to indicate it is working but there are pop ups that you end up futiley pressing on the touch screen. When it finally starts playing, on screen prompts like ""fast play"" or ""extras"" do not respond so you are forced to wait until they time out and watch the previews every time you play the disc.OK, so now I have had the Van aboiut 7 months and have driven it 2200 miles. Still love it. Turns out the DVD problems were almost all me. I finally found a salesman that understood and shiowed me how to use it, then it was good.Only problem now is the auto emergency brake release doesn't always work. (does always work in the shop.)

420, on 06/19/17 12:48 PM (PDT),Floyd Sense ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Touring-L 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),A real surprise!," I traded my 2016 Honda Odyssey EX for this second-hand 2017 Pacifica.  The primary reason was the poor human factors in the Odyssey interior design.  For example, if you wear polarized sunglasses and live in a sunny climate, you can't read the speedometer in the Odyssey - white numbers on a bright metallic background.  And, my 5'2"" wife could never find a comfortable driving position.  The rear lift gate was difficult for a short person to open and close.  The Pacifica has none of these problems and clearly Chrysler spent considerable time with the interior design and came up with a winner.  The dashboard design is just about perfect - the large screen is tilted towards the driver so as to be very easy to read and all the control knobs/buttons are easily reachable by the driver.  The controls are all logical and well laid out.  The navigation system is the best I've seen and is the first I've used that is better than my stand-alone Garmin GPS.  Destinations can be entered by voice and the system does a great job on interpreting what I say.  In addition, you can control the radio and other systems via voice commands.  The center storage bin assembly is very well thought out and provides a convenient place to store a purse or box of tissues so that it doesn't roll around when cornering.  There's even an additional USB port for charging phones, etc.  The rear lift gate has a power assist that raises and lowers the gate with an accompanying beaping tone.  The stow and go middle seats are fairly easy to store and when they're raised and in place, you can use their storage compartments to store other items.  The seats do not seem to be as comfortable as the second row seats were in my Odyssey, but they may be perfectly adequate - just haven't tried them on a long trip yet.  Shorter members of the family say they're just fine, but they seemed a bit low to me.  On the other hand, the third row seats are a bit deeper and seemed to be more comfortable than those in the Odyssey.  The biggest surprise for me was the gas mileage.  On the 128 mile trip home from the dealership, we got an overall 30.6 mpg average and that included the 2,000 foot climb up the mountain near home.  Over the first 115 miles, we saw 33 mpg over rolling hills at 70 mph.  Over the same route, the Odyssey usually averaged 26-27 mpg, never exceeding 28 mpg.  The new 9 speed transmission is as smooth as a CVT, but without the noise.  Braking response is more positive than that of the Odyssey, i.e., braking begins higher on the pedal with slightly more resistance.  The only negative I've seen thus far is the windshield mounted rear view mirror.  It gives a somewhat closed-in view to the rear.  We live in the mountains with very few straight and level roads and the Pacifica handles every bit as well as the Odyssey did.  There's very little body roll and you're never reminded of the large metal structure behind you.  If you're considering an Odyssey, please go drive the Pacifica before making the decision.  Hopefully, the Pacifica reliability over the long haul will be the same or better than the Honda.Addendum: Some models do not come with a spare tire, just one of the slime patch kits and a pump.  You can add a donut spare (it comes un-inflated) in which case it's stored in the compartment in the far rear on the left side.  Without the spare, there are two smaller compartments, so when you buy the spare you'll want to buy the new panel that covers the spare storage area as well.  These items are not inexpensive, so it's a good idea to try and get the dealer to throw in the spare and panel if the model you want doesn't come with it.",4

I have had electrical issues for my van for months - rear door on driver's side will not shut and lights flicker throughout the van.  Has been in the shop since 11/28.  Chrysler Corporate won't even return my calls.  This vehicle is a lemon and I hope to have it declared that soon.  I am really wishing I had bought a Honda or Toyota - honestly anything but a Chrysler.  I read negative reviews before I bought this van, but wanted to give Chrysler a chance.  I love this van, but am done with it and Chrysler.  Take it from me, no matter how good this van seems, the support is not there.  They do not know how to fix issues that arise and the parts are always backordered.  STEER CLEAR!!!!My review from when van was new:I can't review on reliability or maintenance yet, since I just bought this van on Saturday, but so far I love it.  My kids and I agree that a mom must have designed this van.  Every single feature on the vehicle seems to be so nicely thought out and planned.  There is lots of storage room in the whole van and lots of cupholders!  My almost 16 year old son was unimpressed with the cool factor of going back to a minivan after mom driving SUV's for years but after he rode in and drove the Pacifica, he changed his opinion.  The safety features, including adaptive cruise control are awesome as well as the auto high beam headlights.  The theater system in the van is great and keeps the kids occupied and happy with games, music and movies.  The 2nd row heated seats are also wonderful.  I have owned both Honda and Toyota vans and this one is my favorite by far!  As a matter of fact, my plan was to test drive all three, but I stopped after I fell in love with the new Pacifica!",1

In my opinion, the factory roof rack is too small to accommodate cargo like two kayaks and/or bicycles and/or cargo boxes.  For me, a longer roof rail, as normally provided by third party companies,  is an absolute necessity. Unfortunately that is a major limitation of the Pacifica and therefore a show stopper for me.",3

434, on 02/12/17 15:04 PM (PST),Paul ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Limited 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Not for me... trading in for a grand caravan GT.," My wife always leased a town and country and we have always loved them. Well Chrysler decided to kill off their best selling car and replace it with this and I knew I should have just bought out of old van. First of all, we do a lot of traveling. The town and country had overhead storage bins that we used all the time and it also had halo lighting like a limo above our heads. It was pretty cool. I was already disappointed that they dropped that feature. Another feature I miss from the town and country is the power vented 3rd row windows. This van cost so much more money and it already is missing 2 features I frequently used. Next, the 9 speed transmision (which I already know is a disaster) is awful. It will be totally fine for a day then the next it is shifting all weird and hard. When this happens the car literally will jump forward and it scares the daylights out of us. Have taken to the dealer 3 times for this and they tell me it is 100% fine and there is nothing wrong with it. This is very aggravating because I do not trust this vehicle on a long road trip or even driving in general. Also, another thing this van is missing is the 3rd row tailgate seats and flashlight from my old van are missing. I don't understand why they dropped some of the best features from the old van. The uconnect system works ok, but freezes every once in awhile which is aggravating. Also I don't know what they did for this van but it is not nearly as insulated as the old town and country. I hear every road noise, every chip, every sound on the outside. It's almost like you can't even enjoy driving it because it's so loud. I do know about the active noise cancellation but it truely does nothing. I had the dealer look into this too and they told me everything is working as it should and it is normal for Pacificas to have ""some road noise"". It's like they admitted this car was loud inside. And reading about the sunroof letting in all the noise is absolutely true. It's terrible. I basically do not like this car at all. Even the way it looks is ugly compared to the town and country. Now for the good: the sound system is great despite the loud noise while driving. If I'm on break at work I like to sit and listen to music in it and it does sound pretty great. Also the ventilated seats are nice in hot weather. It is nice to have a big touch screen compared to the smaller one on the town and country. And having a 3rd row charging port is great too. Also having a button to move the driver seat forward for stow and go is very convenient. Second row seats are very comfortable also. Overall, this car feels like an expensive downgrade from my town and country. My wife wanted another town and country because we have never had any reliability issues with them and we also like the look and features much better. We were disappointed to find out they killed it off. I did complain to the dealer about this car and they did tell me many people are going from the town and country to grand caravan because it's not for them. I just don't like the huge bulky look of the Pacifica either. I know it's a minivan but they really could have done better with the looks on it. I am taking a huge loss but I would rather drive a grand caravan then this van. Ordered a grand caravan GT and should have it by early spring. Can't wait to get away from this vehicle.",2

440, on 01/19/17 13:23 PM (PST),David Reinke ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan LX 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),"Bought to use as a 100,000 mile/year delivery van."," My opinion through experience of buying American cars is that they are sub par quality. I switched to Honda over ten years ago and have had great luck with them... AI drove a 2017 Chrysler Pacifica as a rental vehicle for vacation (needed a gear hauler) and fell in love. Quiet, most comfortable seats in a vehicle I have ever experienced. I have a severely herniated disk in my lower back and, thanks to the inflatable lumbar, tilt seat cushion and general cushion feel (soft but supportive), I was able to drive 700 miles in a day with only the slightest stiffness versus my partners Honda Element that has decent seats but I’m sore after an hour (same with Civic’s Accords...). The general driving dynamic are that of a mid range luxury sports car. The steering is both tight and responsive while the ride is soft and cushy. At nearly 300 horse power, it is faster than my 2016 Civic 6spd was (20% more power to weight)... and yet, with a couple hundred pounds of gear in the back, two passengers and two kayaks stacked on their sides on the roof, driving 70-90mph all day returned 24mpg. Now, owning one for a couple weeks, I have gotten 26-27 on highway journeys though this is winter. The stow and go seats are well designed, the general feel of the vehicle is minimalist but quality (LX base model with no features) with the exception of the hood which I can lift on while shut and it moves and clanks slightly. I think the latch has a little too much slack or the weather stripping could be thicker. It doesn’t make any sound while driving. Another critique would have to be the dash interface which is mostly horrible. The rental one was better being a higher trim, it had more and better organized features. With mine, if you turn the radio off (at least there’s a knob for this), it turns back on automatically the next time you turn the vehicle on. This is not a problem if you’re listening to the radio as you can just turn the volume down. But I hate that I turn a podcast off half way though, stop to get gas and it starts back up when the car is started again!And, if you’re listening to a podcast or song and you want to scroll to another selection in the same folder, you have to go back to the beginning, hit menu, scroll down past ten options to folder, hit folder, then from the top, scroll down to the selection number which for me could be number 179!!!... or you have to manually scroll through the folder one by one. So to skip from episode or song number 179 to say 112, it takes about a minute to do and incredibly distracting while driving. I had a 2012 Civic with a much better interface for external audio. Similarly adjusting the heat requires hitting up or down about 40 times manually, holding the button in which it takes about 20 seconds for the digital arrow to go from all the way cool to all the way hot or you have to go through two or three screens to get to the climate adjuster icon and tap the area on the vertical line where you want the level at!! I know I will get more fluid with it but you can’t help being frustrated with the distraction from driving. I hate people who play on their phone but I feel like I’m texting just to change a song. An area of concern is that the transmission is a little jerky when hard launching (not flooring it necessarily), as well as at speed acceleration. Sometimes it seems to argue with itself about which gear to select and will go up down up shift within a second sometimes mid acceleration. So I might be going 45 and need to accel to 60 quickly and it will downshift, speed past 50 then upshift a gear or two, downshift back again and continue accelerating to 60 even though my foot on the gas hasn’t changed. I don’t know if it’s anything to do with it being a 9 speed...As for price; I got a base price of 24,117 at Falls Motor City (Cleveland). Though it was a two hour drive from Pittsburgh, they were a good 3-4k cheaper than anyone here and the cheapest place in the country!! The hitch is you have to finance through Chrysler and they gave me an 8.6% rate even through I have a 740 credit score. So I gave up $500 of the incentives to get a 4.6% rate also through the dealership through Huntington bank. And they charge $200 loan origination which is unheard of with other brands (bought three Honda’s new and got 0.9to 1.9% APR on every one). Total price $24,617 plus loan fee = $24,817. I have AAA so my $250 dealership doc fee was $75. Tags at $36 for a financed grand total (less tax) of $24,948. Still a great deal. Note, you can get your own financing or pay cash but you lose another $1500 in incentives. Lastly, finance will try to sell you an extended warranty through Mopar. Don't get it. I read through the terms and you pretty much have to go to the dealer for every oil change and make no mods (aka after market hitch) or warranty is void. If you own your van long enough for value to drop below repair cost, they will pay only value! If you're in an accident, yep, void!",4
441, on 01/13/17 16:08 PM (PST),Tony G ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Limited 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Change of Mind," We went from being extremely excited about our new minivan, to increasingly frustrated.  First of,  this van shows off well.  The features, the ride, and its looks we thought set it apart from the competition.  It wasn't until we drove off the dealership when the headache began.  Driving off and seeing the engine light come on is the most disheartning thing an owner of a ""new"" vehicle can experience.  So now, we are stuck with a loner as we wait and see whats wrong with our new Pacifica.  I reached out to Chrysler to see if they can expedite this process (its going to be a week before my van gets looked at the dealership), but they didn't seem too concerned with the idea of one of their products coming off the lot and going straight to the shop.  I'm hopeful our situation gets better.  At this time, I would tell others to beware of Chrysler products.(initial review)After owning our van for a year and 9000 miles, we are extremely pleased.  There were a couple hipcups in the beginning with dealership service being the primary concern.  The van had a few minor glitches as well, but reasonable considering it was a first year model. My family and I would buy this car in a second if we had to do it again.One year and a half later, I would buy this van again.",5
442, on 01/10/17 18:47 PM (PST),Gerald ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Limited 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Love/hate relationship w/ my Pacifica," My 2017 Pacifica replaced my 2014 Odyssey. From a driving perspective, it’s a class or 2 above the Odyssey. It’s so much quieter and smoother to drive. However, from a functionality and reliability standpoint, it fails compared to the Odyssey. My Uconnect has many quirks and does not functionally normally. I’ve spent over 3 hrs on the phone w/ tech support but there are still many quirks that tech support can’t fix and they recommended that I take it to the dealer. Who has time for that?! The Pacifica’s interior is stylish, but it lacks many nooks and crannies for storage compared to the Odyssey. Also, all the seats are extremely difficult with car seat installation – seat bottom reclines too much, headrest protrudes too much, latch and tether difficult to use and limited 2nd row width to accommodate 3 car seats together comfortably. The Odyssey was 1000x better in this respect.  So far I’m enjoying the drive. But I miss the day to day functionality of the Odyssey.",3
443, on 12/26/16 14:47 PM (PST),Johan Keet ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Limited 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Bad fuel miles," I bought the Pacifica Limited edition and did not want the entertainment system since we have no children. We listen to CD and radio. All our previous Chrysler products had radio &CD /casette players. When we received it and we could not find the CD player, the dealer was quick to point out we did not buy the entertainment package...wow. sirus radio does not play the music we listen. On the open road FM radio is not always good. Now we need to purchase an external device to rip our CD too. Interesting that Honda, Toyota and all other manufacturers does have CD players as a Standard. Chrysler, you caught me on this one  but unfortunately I will tell everybody about this bad move!02/09/2017Chrysler claims  their 2017 Pacifica  will give one +- 19 mpg in-town, up to 29 mpg for highway driving with an average of 22-23 mpg combined.                                       I bought  my new Limited edition Pacifica van in December 2016. The vehicle is very nice but the gas mileage sucks. In town with no stop and go traffic and with no traffic and driving slow and no hard braking or hard acceleration, I get 13 -15 miles per gallon. I took the vehicle on two road trips where only my wife and I were in the vehicle  not loaded. We drive a 3-hour trip to a remote town ( no hills or wind at 70 mile/hour) and three hours back home the same way we went and the gas mileage was 21.5 miles per gallon.  So far I have to fill up the Pacifica  two tanks of gas / 500 milles-- a tank 18 Gallons. My average gas miles for these trips (town 10% of mileage and Highway 90%) were and is  +- 15 to 16 miles/gallon.  I have 1150 miles on the vehicle and Chrysler insist that only after the third oil change the vehicle gas mileage will get better ....wow...third oil change( 15000 miles). This vehicle is a gas guzzler and nearly as fuel inefficient as my 2002 V8 Dodge Durango. I cannot get Chrysler or the dealers to move and fix the van. If I listen to You Tube videos, everybody raves about the good gas mileage they get from theirs or the test Pacifica. What must I do????I have now been driving this Pacifica for 11700 miles and its fuel efficiency is not good---dealers say it is normal---I get in town, driving like an elderly  person, between 11 and 14.5 mpg. On the Highway driving 70-75 miles per hour I only get at its best, 25 mpg.  The vehicle is nice but I will not recommend it to others due to it bad fuel efficiency!08/13/2018The Pacifica is really a gas guzzler nothing changed, it is still very uneconomical and fuel thirsty even after 16,000 miles it  sucks gas! I have spoken to several Pacifica owners. All say it is a nice vehicle but it is not fuel efficient! Chrysler lies about fuel millage!!!!!!!!!!!",4
444, on 12/15/16 16:07 PM (PST),minivanman ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Limited 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),The Ultimate Road-trip Machine," This is by far the best van I’ve ever owned.  I opted for a fully-loaded Limited so it’s also the priciest.  I currently own a 2016 Odyssey and previously had a Chrysler TC and Kia Sedona.  Drive:  Overall, the Pacifica handles very well.  It has the Advanced Safety Tec and the default settings for the lane departure are helpful without being obnoxious as is the adaptive cruise.  Leaving the park assist on can be annoying though because it sometimes beeps when stopping behind another vehicle at a red light or driving close to an ATM (you can quickly turn it off with the push of a button).  I expected the van to have a blind spot camera that would activate when changing lanes given the price range, but it does not—just the lights on the side view mirrors that light up like in my old TC.  I had to drive the van back from a 120 mile trip through snow storm and it handled well.  While driving in the white-out conditions, I wished it had AWD, but the Sienna is still the only one with that feature.  The snow covered the external sensors and the lane markers on the road so lane departure and adaptive cruise could not function.  A heating system for the sensors might be a good idea to deal with these issues.  The rear backup camera is low res—lower than my mid-trim Odyssey and when you’re paying a premium, you don’t want a fuzzy image.  The ride is fairly quiet, but I expected it to be quieter given how Chrysler touts the noise dampening features.  The unconventional gear shift knob is fine, but it stresses my wife out because she’s afraid that she might absentmindedly shift the car to park when trying to adjust the radio volume.    Interior:   The interior is very comfortable with lots of storage throughout.  In my previous vans, I’d get annoyed when my wife reduced the center console to a counter for her massive purse.  The Pacifica addressed this with a space in front of the console big enough to accommodate a spare tire or her purse (but just barely).  The three glass panel roof is great and gives the already roomy van a very open feel.  I like being able to shift the second row seats up with car seats in place to allow easier access—especially for adults—to the third row.  A warning to morons like me, don’t try to shift the second row seat while your toddler is seated lest you meet the business end of the aforementioned massive purse.  It’s nice that the third row passengers have controls to recline the seats, but it would be nicer if both sides of the third row had USB charging ports.  I’m the last person to advocate for kids to have their faces in screens, but I’m even more opposed to hearing my kid piss in my ear about how it’s not fair that his sister can charge her device while he can’t.  Also, if you have the vacuum, that side of the third row has no cup holder (the other side has two).  Basically, the third row passenger sitting on the driver’s side gets screwed.  I like being able to kick under the sliding doors and tailgate to open them when my hands are full, but you can’t kick to close when you’re unloading your cargo/toddler.  The second row stow is the one thing I’m glad that was carried over from the earlier Chrysler vans.  I love using the compartments for extra storage when taking long road trips so the main cabin is less cluttered.   The lack of this feature made the hybrid version a nonstarter for me.     Tech:  The nav system is ok if you’ve never used one, but the nav screen looks 10 years old.  I’ve always opted out of getting nav when I had a choice because I assumed it would be inferior to Google Maps or Waze on my phone.  The Pacifica’s nav only confirmed that practice.  Otherwise, the UConnect Infotainment system is very good.  It’s fairly intuitive and takes a few minutes of playing around to figure out how to control everything.  It would be nice if the theater allowed you to play two different DVDs on the two screens, but that’s not too big a deal.  I like being able to play movies off a USB drive that plugs into a port next to the DVD player.  You can play different movies off the same USB on the two screens.  mp4 format does not appear to be supported, but it plays avi files fine.  I was able to use my Roku mini (both screens have a usb for charging and HDMI ports) to watch streaming content by tethering to my phone.  I believe you can pay extra to have the van itself serve as a wireless hotspot, but it’s only 3G.  I ordered an HDMI lightning cable for my iPhone and will see if I can mirror to the second row screens.  Bottom Line:  While it may seem like I’m critical in pointing out deficiencies in the Pacifica, I am extremely pleased with it and have no regrets (so far).   I got this van to do more road trips with my family and I am certain that we will travel in more comfort and have more fun than in any other minivan on the market.",5

This wouldn't be a huge issues, exept that the computer is horribly underpowered and the response time is extremely slow. I have also noticed a few mechanical issues with the transmission. Doesn't seem to shift from park to drive or reverse very consistently. The van drives very smoothly but the seats (all of them) are not very comfortable.  The van is extremely flexible though. Its very easy to load and unload kids, strollers, and carseats. Tons of space behind the 3Rd row and lots more with the 3Rd row down.

446, on 12/07/16 13:41 PM (PST),Abraham Miller ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Touring 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Pacifica Update after a year.," The driver seat height adjustment was deficient for short people (needed a cushion). Required an expensive after market window tinting because of glare, and heat through all windows. Dealer charge for tinting windows excessive (got the tinting done at less than half the dealers charge). Never needed such a tint on my trade in 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan SXT, and neither was there any problem with the driver seat height adjustment on latter vehicle.  I went thru USAA for an extended warantee which was half the price that the dealership offered. I somehow feel the dealership has no interest in accommodating me, because I paid cash.After one year, I am overall happy with our 2017 Pacifica except for one issue which is quite annoying, but not critical.Recently, I noticed a parking sensor problem issued on my dashboard.When I brought the car into the dealership, they said that one of the four sensor on the rear bumper was defective, and was probably caused by a rear end collision, and it would not be covered  by the 3 year warrantee, and  it would cost me over $400 to replace. Since there was no noticeable damage to the rear bumper, I disputed their diagnoses to no avail.   Needless to say, I still feel  the dealership should have taken responsibility for this repair, but I have no intention to handle this replacement on my own, and therefore, I intend to just live with this problem, which doesn't seem to have degraded the performance of this vehicle in any way. This is an update on this vehicle as of 12 June 2018.Currently this vehicle is getting very little use as my wife suffered a stroke back in February of this year, and she was the primary user of this vehicle; however, I will be taking the vehicle in to the dealership to address for a second time the rear sensor problem, and see, if they are willing to fix the problem under the existing warrantee coverage.

447, on 11/30/16 09:07 AM (PST),Scott ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Limited 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Excellent vehicle!," I would start by suggesting that readers cast a critical eye toward some of these ""reviews""--their validity is questionable.  A few things I'd debunk.  First, I'm 6'3"" and have no trouble getting in and out or finding a comfortable driving position.  My Pacifica Limited is my work vehicle and I bought it party due to it's long haul comfort.  I find no lack of interior storage.  From the center console and door pockets to the glovebox and the empty Stow N Go compartments--there's considerable storage.  Someone suggested that there is no discernible difference between the new Pacifica and the former Town and Country.  Absolute rubbish--after spending considerable time in a previous gen van I can tell you that the differences are considerable.  You'll notice the same sentiment from professional automotive reviews as well.  I've accumulated just over 4000 miles in 2 months and performance, fuel economy and ride/handling are excellent.  I had questioned getting the 20"" wheel and tire package but am pleased with the appearance.  They also have no adverse effect on the ride/handling balance.

When I was trying to reverse the car, it was stuck and not able to move back. 3. 2nd Day, it stuck middle of the road and completely stopped the engine. ""Driving"" mode came back to ""Parking"" mode and engine completely stopped. Didn't start almost 30 minutes. After that it started again. 4. After towing the car to the dealer's place on Sunday, next day which is on Monday, Technician drove the car to reproduce the issue. While he was driving, ""Driving"" mode came back to ""Parking"" mode and engine completely stopped. I did return the car to the dealer. It was really scary. Life and death issue. Thank god It' was not on the highway.  Again, I really like this Pacifica 2017 minivan but wanted to hear your experience. Please let me know if you run into similar issue.",1
449, on 11/28/16 10:38 AM (PST),K-anon ,2017 Chrysler Pacifica Minivan Touring-L Plus 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 9A),"Paid a lot, got a lot"," My wife and I spent months researching and test driving almost all minivans on the market. The clear winner was the Pacifica. We purchased a brand new blue Touring L-Plus in September 2016. We've been driving it for nine months and have had a fender bender (rear ended) and had the van repaired. We've been on three big road trips and have over 9,000 miles on the van. We've been averaging around 17-18 mpg in the city and about 27 mpg on the highway, so pretty darn close to the manufacturer specs.One annoyance is that the transmissions has to really kick into a much lower gear when you want to accelerate on the highway. Say you are cruising at 60mph, the transmission will be in top gear, but say you want to accelerate to 70 mph, it'll hesitate for a second, then shift anywhere from 1-3 gears lower to provide power to accelerate. It doesn't feel smooth or sound smooth, but if that's what it takes to get me better mileage, I'll sacrifice the 'smoothness'.The storage space is just wonderful; the van is quiet, handles great, and has so far been very reliable. We learned that the rear hatch is made of partly magnesium alloys, so in our fender bender, they had to order a whole new rear hatch (it was expensive, but our insurance covered it). The Blueray/DVD entertainment system is super popular with our kids. Be aware though, they young kids (under 5) have no hope of figuring out how to listen to their movies on the headphones. We just use the 'listen in' feature and have to listen to their movies/shows wherever we drive. I recommend the van; we have no regrets about our purchase to date.Update (May 2018) - We've had some electrical problems (door chimes not sounding, part replaced to fix) also, the power windows don't work consistently. We haven't been able to find out why this is happening or have it fixed. It's really annoying when it happens, and you have to cycle the van off/on to get it to work again. But overall, the mileage and the features have outweighed some of the annoyances. I am concerned about the transmission, but no major problems yet. We now have almost 30,000 miles in about 20 months of ownership.",4

I purchased this car new in 2004. The plan was to take lots of fun road trips with the grandkids. I made sure we had a DVD player and a good sound system. With adapters, they could even play their game consoles. The car has been very reliable and has never given me a problem. I always had the scheduled maintenance performed and as various things needed repair, I did that. Everything was great and I loved this car. About a year ago when the car had just over 100,000 miles, my mechanic told me there was a little rust forming on the undercarriage. I was shocked! The car has been garaged since the day I purchased it. I had the car washed regularly to remove dirt, snow, and salt from the under carriage. During the past year everything has gone wrong. The air conditioning went out, probably the condenser, they said. The DVD player started making a screeching noise whenever I started the motor. That needed to be disconnected. The fan won't stop blowing at high speed, even when turned off, and the final blow...the rust on the undercarriage has become so bad, my mechanic said it's unsafe to drive! Even though it's thirteen years old, it only has 112,000 miles. The engine is fine. The undercarriage is toast! I'm retired, now I can't drive my car.",3

However, I've been a passenger in a 2004 Pacifica for nearly 11 years. The car is incredibly reliable and I grew to love it so much that I asked my dad to give it to me as a first car, as opposed to selling it. (The value depreciated to a near-ridiculous extent.) It was purchased in 2006 with less than 50,000 miles on it. The space within the car is phenomenal with the back row of seats down. Whether you're hauling people or large objects (like other high school students or your practice gear), it fits comfortably. Leather interiors are a plus. Blind spots are a bit of an issue, but it's just a matter of being careful. Cabin noise isn't too bad. The car has only had one major maintenance problem: A computer bug with the air conditioning and windshield wipers (at the same time, I might add), though this was with 250,000 miles and 11 years of age on the car. It's made several road trips from Virginia to Alabama and back, and it's held up beautifully (mechanically and aesthetically). The acceleration can occasionally feel sluggish, but the brakes remain smooth and I feel very in-control behind the wheel. It's wide, though! This makes it somewhat difficult to park when I'm strapped for space. Overall, it's a solid 9.5 out of 10. I love the Pacifica dearly!",5

Front suspension seems a bit loose so every time we had to stop quick, the front would take a deep dive and when it went over a driveway that was higher then the road it would bottom out at 12 mph, which might be why the bearing plates broke (something our mechanic told us was common in them).

Very low power (even when new) from a 6 cylinder reported to be 250 hp plus really poor mileage (15 mpg). Then add stupid problems that are quality related such as an oil pan made of ""soft aluminum"" whose drain plug is easily stripped ($700 repair), air conditioner failure, lots of batteries (four so far), heater fan failure, rocker panel made of breakable plastic.

The 6 speed transmission is giving us around 17 mpg in mixed city and highway driving. We see better than 22 if highway speeds are kept at a reasonable level. I agree that the more powerful motor and extra two gears in the transmission help the car to be quick off the line but it is also one of the most relaxed highway cruisers that we have ever driven.

I don't understand why these didn't sell well. I know Chrysler didn't market them well but I've had an S class Mercedes, a 540 BMW and 40 other cars and this is my favorite. It is great on fuel if you consider it's 2 1/2 tons and gets 30+ mpg on the highway and about 20 in the city.

Needed more room for people, and displays. I traded in my Lexus which I just loved, I never thought that the Pacifica could ever compare with the Lexus.  Was I surprised. I got a 2007 touring model with the 4.0 and 6 speed trans. This is by far the quietest, nicest riding, comfortable car I have ever owned. The stock stereo with Sirius satellite is unbelievable with a pounding bass and clear sound even at high levels. The ride rivals that of the finest European cars. ( I have owned BMW and Lexus prior).

The back hatch is almost exactly 48"" inches wide (at it's widest) I just put a sign in it the other day with all 4 back seats down, worked great. The one major draw back is backing up.

Every seat has it's own cup holder and air vents. I like the captain seats on the second row with the console in the middle. It rides 5-6 adults comfortably. The air bag in the front seat is cut on/off by weight, which is great for the 8-year- old that likes to ride in the front. There's rubber in the bottom of the cup holders that pulls out, so it's easy to clean messes! Dual air is great. I'm seriously in love!",4.875

I'm a big guy at over 6 ft and 285 and I can comfortably get into the front and back seats, but I haven't tried the 3rd row (I own it so I don't have to ride back there.)  MPG has been around 21.5 since we bought it.  It has more of a car like ride than most SUVs but you still feel some roll on harder turns (it is based on a mini van frame).

The bad: in 12 months and 10,000 miles of driving, this vehicle has been through 3 torque converters, both sway bars links, a driveshaft, had a side view mirror come off and had a splash guard (the big sheet of plastic in the wheel well) fall off.

My 2003 Honda Odyssey finally took its last breaths (oh how I loved my Honda) . So while driving by a Used Nissan I was interested in I laid my eyes on her! The Pacifica, I test drove , got my hubby and FIL to come check it out. Everything looked great, interior was nice and polished looking. The engine and tranny sounded strong. I went home and started to do research. I was appalled by the many negative reviews. I looked at all the negative, positive and most helpful reviews. We took a look under the car and there was no rust. I ran a car fax and just knew this was no lemon. Well maintained and cared for by 2 main owners. Then sat for a while. I decided that for the price (1800) it was a steal plus it only had 157k miles. I have had it a week almost.  So far we have enjoyed the car. It needs an oil change , lower driver side control arm , a engine dip stick and hood opener. So far I have put in about 400$. Which is till great 👍. Not too bad.  Most people tend to forget these are older cars and not all will sound and run new. They had some hiccups in the beginning that seem to have been handled.

We now have over 165,000 miles on the vehicle - and it is going strong.  I must admit I was VERY nervous to buy this vehicle.  The engine and transmission have been flawless on this vehicle.  The one weakspot was motor mounts - replace 4 times! (but its a cheap fix).At 100K I replaced timing belt, struts, cv joints, and alternator (due to squeaky pully).  We had to get a whole new exhaust at 130K.   The car has been with us through kids elementary/middle/high school, and has been good to move the kids in/out of college.  We even did a paper route with this car for 2 years.  I'd say we got our money out of this car.  We replaced control arms as a preventative measure this year, and the other remaining issue is the the engine subframe rust issue on these cars.  In our case, I have been applying coatings to the affected areas - and keeping my eye on the rust progress.My take on this ownership experience is that with proper maintenance you can even keep a Chrysler (any car) going for a very long time. Update 09/28/2016: The Pacifica is still running strong with over 183,000 miles on the odometer.  At around 165,000 miles we decided to replace the o-rings between the engine timing cover and the cast iron block due to a small coolant leak from the water pump passages.   Since this work involved much disassembly, we decided to replace spark plugs, fuel injectors, water pump, timing belt, intake manifold gaskets, valve cover gaskets, all hoses, and the radiator.  Since this work was DIY, labor cost wasn't a factor, and the cost of the parts was only around $800.  We also needed to replace a rusty front subframe this year in order to pass Pennsylvania's safety inspection.  We were able to buy a rust free subframe from salvage in GA.  Total cost for replacement including our mechanic installation of 4 hrs was right around $1000.  With replacement vehicles of similar size and feature costing over $30,000, we believe these repairs were well worth the money spent, and hope to enjoy another few years of ownership.Update 9/28/2017:Just went over 200k ... And still rolling with the original engine and transmission.  The car is running great, but I do expect some upcoming maintenance on CV axles and possibly front bearings.  Something is making noise ... And it doesn't seem to be the tires.  Nothing is holding us back... Still taking long trips... But keeping a way eye on these maintenance items.",4

I bought it for the blind spot monitor, but I had to turn my head a full 90 degrees to see the mirrors which was unacceptable. The HID headlights were frankly unsafe. Although they were bright, the distinct dark-light boundary and limited forward projection made me feel extremely uncomfortable driving at any speed since I always felt I was ""overdriving"" my visibility. Both of those reasons led me to return the car within a week from buying it. I could not get used to it and took a big financial loss because the car was just awkward and unsafe for me. One of the features that had not been pointed out by the salesman (and had I noticed it I would never, ever have bought it) was the fuel and emissions saving feature during which the car shuts off when idling at a light for more than a second. It starts back up when you take your foot off the brake. This feature could be turned off by a button however it's ""on"" position was the default and you had to do push the button every time you started the car if you wanted to inactivate it. For someone who has always driven old beat up cars, having a car turn off at a light while idling triggered significant anxiety.

If I could get the second seat passenger seat as the drivers seat it would be great.  The driver seat only has one arm rest on the right side (they built it for a one armed driver I guess).  The seat is like siting on a slab of steel with a scrap of leather on top as a covering.  Living in Florida the leather is very hot all the time and cloth would be a much better choice.  I wanted cloth but could not get it with the other options I wanted.   The ""cooling system"" for the front seats does not do the job and offers only minimum relief.

The Car play is standard on the 2018 model which is a great feature, no longer have to pay to upgrade maps. Even though the Honda upgraded the engine it still has less power than the Pacifica.

But when we took a detailed look and test drive of the Pacifica -- we did not look back.  The Pacifica is a distinct step up in luxury and technology.  The ride is superb for a minivan -- the tight firmness of the Odyssey with the comfort and strong engine of the Sienna.  However, the Pacifica is better -- quiet ride, solid body, excellent technology.  We targeted our features:  Advanced Safety Tech pkg (for her) and Alpine / 8.4 in UConnect upgrade (for me) and Leather (both of us).  With the strong incentives, buying a new Pacifica vs a used XLE Sienna was $5K difference -- and fully worth it.  Both of us absolutely love our vehicle.

This is not available in the Honda, not sure why for such a large vehicle. It is a huge safety feature. The stop and go ACC is better than it functioned in the Odyssey (Which stops at 20 mph, unlike the CRV version). The 9 speed transmission also shifted much better on the Pacifica. The park assist function is so so. Hit or miss but helpful nevertheless. Between backup camera and 360 deg camera, you have more than enough assistance needed to park this big minivan.

After 3,000 miles, they tried to fix the dreaded chronic transmission problems . (do a Google search).The sight of seeing the tranny in pieces from my new car made me regret my purchase instantly. They never really fixed the problem, so I was frustrated for 48 months. This car is also a MAJOR GAZ GUZZLER. In cold weather, the ''dual-exhaust'' system makes an unbelievable racket. Radio controls (and sound) are worthy of a '70's Corolla, cheap plastic and all. The idea for this car was right, but implementation was an unfinished nightmare. Too bad, it was full of promises.

I was interested in it because I needed the 3rd row and was tired of being in a many van & I though it was cute. But having the 3rd row seat, it has no trunk room. You can't ride with the back windows down because of the noise the air pressure makes and it's a gas guzzler. I wouldn't recommend this car to my worst enemy. Also, when my batter died, I couldn't even turn the key to put the car in neutral to roll it back. To me, that's just not right. ",2.75

More so when cold than subsequent attempts. Starter replaced, problem not solved. Dealership is now saying the power steering fluid maybe thickening up due to the cold weather and the power steering maybe causing noise.

Both the exterior and interior are superb, and it seems as if they have practical engineers on the job who designed the car for everyday cost-consciuos people who want an SUV to envy! The features in the Aspen make it worth way more than its cost. The features rival those of pricier car-makers but with a no-frills price. As a VP in marketing, I believe the Aspen was created to boost Chrysler's SUV appeal, so they put all these top features as a repositioning campaign and more folks need to discover the secret.",4.875

It's an excellent SUV: it's safe, the interior layout is perfect,the steering is light but feels great, it's quiet when you're cruising but really roars when you give it a few or more rpms. MPG can be good when you're cruising at highway speeds but watch out for stop and go traffic - then it's a different story altogether. Reliability has been great so far.

AWD, J package, 20"" wheels. It's beautiful to look at, to sit in and to drive. Bought it used with 72K miles. This is a real SUV although it looks like a luxury car. I live in the mountains of Oregon down a long winding gravel road,  and have to go over a 4300 foot pass on I-5. It handles like a dream, especially after getting new and better shocks and tires. The hemi has awesome power, even carrying a heavy load and going up a 6% grade it can accelerate like a sports car to pass trucks. Smooth, comfortable handling. The firm heated seats are great on my injured back, as is the remotely operated rear lift gate. I've had many other SUVs, from Subarus to the old Jeep Grand Wagoneer to a 99 Durango with the 5.7L hemi. The Aspen is far better than all of them. I need to tow a horse trailer and it has more towing capacity than bigger SUVs that cost a lot more. It is almost perfect, I just wish they still made them.Update: I've owned this Aspen for 9 months now, and I still love it.

It has not a squeak or rattle, and the engine still runs without a trace of vibration. The interior still cleans up like new after detailing even after eight years of kid/dog abuse. Our dog goes on the leather seats a lot and her nails haven't so much as scratched the leather. My factory brake pads lasted past 60k miles. The 5.7 Hemi doesn't exactly sip fuel, but it sure does tow when needed. Other than seeing the trailer in the rear view mirror, I can hardly tell I'm towing at all. Off road handling has been good on mountain dirt roads and beach sands. Other than scheduled maintenance and battery changes, I've not had to shell out a dime's worth of maintenance for the Aspen. AC is still as strong as ever; no seals, gaskets, belts or hoses have needed replacing; no degradation from wear and tear yet other than cosmetic items. As the original owner with a lifetime power train warranty, I don't see much incentive to replace the Aspen any time soon.",5

So far I've driven it 40k and it has NEVER had any problems of any kind!  After owning it for 2 years I bought 2 more.  The ride is extremely quiet and smooth and seats are comfortable. Leather interior is VERY high quality. Gas mileage is great at 22 mpg on the highway.  This vehicle does VERY, VERY well on snow and ice.  I tow a large boat and haul 6-7 adults with it regularly.

We have had Durangos in the past-- although nice they do not compare to the Aspen--especially in looks!  The Aspen's ride is incredibly smooth!  These vehicles do EXTREMELY well on snow and ice! We put 37K miles on our Aspen, and it has never had 1 problem of any kind. We have had Nissan Armadas in the past which only get 16- 17mpg on the highway whereas the Aspen gets 20 mpg.

My wife saw an Aspen at a dealership and asked if I would test drive it so I did and I purchased it the next day. I got the fully loaded limited. We love it. I don't have a heavy foot so when I drive I can get in the city 17mpg, on  the hwy going 70 mph got 25 mpg. I think that is great for a big SUV.

I'm 12 months into a 36 month lease but I know that I won't buy once lease is over. I previously owned a Durango so the Aspen was a logical progression in staying with Chrysler. I love the luxury of the Aspen over the Durango (lots of cheap plastic in Durango) but the Aspen is not as nice to drive as the Durango.  For some reason my Aspen feels sluggish at times. It also doesn't seen to handle as well as Durango. Aspen's looks and standard equipment are great for the money.

As for the gas mileage its great. If you're going to complain about gas then a SUV isn't for you.

875, on 10/17/16 06:08 AM (PDT),Bill R ,2000 Chrysler Concorde Sedan LXi 4dr Sedan,A Nice Car," I own a 2000 Chrysler Concorde, 2.7L engine, gold exterior, beautiful black leather interior, center console, bucket seats, 150,000 miles on the odometer.  I purchased this car in 2013 when it had 75,000 miles on it.  Pros: Excellent handling, excellent highway gas mileage for a large car (I average 27-28 MPG traveling monthly from Baltimore to Scranton, Pennsylvania, and 30-31 MPG on my return trip. The distance one way is 220 miles.).  Plenty of interior room, especially in the back seat.  Large trunk area. Beautiful, sleek exterior styling, and the interior leather seats, console, instrument panel, and dashboard are very attractive.  Very reliable....I've never had a breakdown of any kind...save for a bad battery and the need to replace a transmission sensor on a previously owned 1999 Concorde.  The 2.7L engine provides plenty of power on the highway but is somewhat under powered for city driving.   With good tires (I currently have Michelin Primacy P225/60R16) the car is fairly quiet and very smooth on a blacktop highway, but is quite noisy on concrete highways and concrete bridge overpasses.  I am hoping that a new set of Michelin Defender tires will lower the road noise on concrete roads.  Overall the noise in the cabin is probably about average. Most noise coming from the road, with some wind noise and a slight amount of engine noise.  Cons:  Limited interior head room for a tall person (I'm 6'-2"" tall and must slouch down to see properly).  Limited visibility which make parallel parking very difficult.  It is very difficult to judge where the front and back of the car are when parallel parking.  The transmission will buck a bit if you slow down for a red light, but then accelerate if the light turns green before you come to a complete stop. Consequently I make sure to accelerate very slowly in this situation. (I did have to replace a transmission sensor in my previously owned 1999 Chrysler Concorde because of accelerating before coming to a complete stop).  The 2.7L engines are known for having sludge build-up problems so be sure to replace the engine oil every 3000-5000 miles.  I use Castrol GTX, an anti-sludge oil. The battery is hidden in the right front wheel well and is very difficult to access.  The headlights and bulbs are very difficult to replace. Braking is well below average and feels mushy (I've been told that this is normal but I have my doubts).  Overall a very reliable, beautiful, fuel efficient, roomy, and well-handling car if you properly care for the engine and transmission.  More specifically, replace the engine oil frequently (due to the sludge build-up problem) and accelerate slowly. Do not accelerate quickly from a stop or before coming to a stop and the transmission should be fine.  The overhead cam sensors on these engine will go bad before 100K but can be easily and inexpensively replaced within 20 minutes if you have any mechanical aptitude.",4

A/C failed, power windows failed, rubber seals around the doors were falling off every time I opened the door, and don't dare take it to a car wash. And if that wasn't bad enough, the 2.7 engine started to ""tick"". Come to find out that this engine is famous for SLUDGE. It gets trapped in the top of the engine and kills the horsepower and overall performance of the car. Very disappointed in this ""American"" car.

I got it in 09 with 280k. I still runs...and sprints, beautifully. People rap on the engine a lot and admittedly mines broke two, and interior rod snapped but that couldn't stop this car.

Faced with this option I decided to replace the car.  Research over the past few weeks has revealed that the Chrysler 2.7 liter engine appears to have many problems.

Then the door locks started to make a bad noise when you use them. Then the engine blew.

Now the Front End Bumper has completely fallen off as a result of the low to the ground design, when parking in stalls and approaching the parking stop. I have to pay $2600 to have it fix. I blame myself-for trying to spur the US Economy and not following my orig. feelings of buying a Non US vehicle. I would like to sell it - but have about 6k invested in after market products and services. I like the style of the car and the okay with the interior comfort. I will be getting rid of it this coming year. What a waste?",2.5

The only downfall is the mileage, but what do you expect with this size of engine. When parking, you have to be careful not to hit the front due to the bumper being low.

Keep in mind that this is a very heavy car at 5300 pounds that will do 0 to 60 in around 6 seconds stock. Mine has 128,000 miles on. It and is still putting 298 hp of the 340 hp to the rear wheels. As for comfort and ride around 75 on the interstate and the 300C is as comfortable as sitting in your favorite recliner. Now I will say this as good as this car is there are a few things that you can be sure to address but it's mainly cosmedic. The exterior door handles are poor design and break easily (not cheap to replace). The PCM that is mounted to the fuse box under the hood gets hot and will go out (fixed by mounting an old computer fan to blow air directly on it). The fact stereo display will go out and is not easily replaced. Google it and check some of the forums and make your own decisions.

1313, on 07/02/16 10:23 AM (PDT),Jason ,2006 Chrysler 300 Sedan C 4dr Sedan AWD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Love the car!! But has issues," IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN BUYING A HEMI 300 READ THIS FULL REVIEW FOR THE TRUTH!! I read online about these cars before I bought mine, I found countless reviews about the 5.7 hemi completely failing at 100k miles, I thought I could avoid this if I was careful, so I went ahead and bought one, and the engine completely failed and needed a full rebuild at 145k, my machanic did it for 6k cash, I have had no trouble with the engine since other than the check engine light poping on and off all the time randomly for no reason (which is common with all 300s) the biggest problem with this car is the front end, all 300s have this problem, and there is no way around it. The entire front end is the most unreliable setup on earth, you can put 1500 into brand new bushings and control arms and a few weeks later it will start makeing noise again, I have owned mine for 5 months or so and my car is currently in the shop for front end repair for the 4th time! No matter what u replace, it's only going to fix the noise for a month or so, then you will hear a new noise, every single 300 owner I've talked to has had the same problem, one of my friends even had it happen a month after he bought his car brand new, it's simply part of the life of a 300 owner. The rear suspension is bad too, but not nearly as mutch as the front. I have never had this happen, but a few of my friends have had electrical problems with theirs causing the car to burn out its own battery, or even turn itself off in the middle of the road. I am yet to experience this with mine. The transmission in my 300c AWD has been pretty good to me, have only had one problem with it, I would be driving and pull up to a light and when I try to start again the transmission would rev up to high rpms and I would only crawl  forward at about 3 mph, so I had to restart the car in the middle of the intersection and it fixed its self, but then happen again 5 min later, and again and again, I brought it in and it ended up being a 10 dollar sensor, that was in the tranny instead of on top where it usually is on a car, so I had to send it in to a rebuild place which charged $850 for the job, no problems since, the tranny is different for the AWD cars, mine is still running strong at 148k miles, I hear the rwd  tranny fails at about 100k miles. The Chrysler 300c hemi AWD ( and rwd) is a mess when it comes to rely ability and  maintenance, but when it is running right it is the absolute nicest car I have driven or rode in, I get complements on the car every were I go, it looks fantastic, it sounds mean, it rides amazing, it shifts smooth, and you have endless power under your foot, its like driving a Mercedes with a bad ass American v8, It's mustang gt/camaro z28 speed in a car that is full sized,comfortable and weighs an extra 1000 lbs, plus with the AWD it's good in the snow, and actually handles really well, the suspension is firm for a normal car but it feels plush and expensive, the interior is very nice, actually really good quality materials, feels and looks very nice, this car is extremely unique, and there is nothing else on the market like it, I went with my heart and bought one ignoring all the bad reviews, and even though the  maintenance  is insane, it guzzles gas and has endless problems, I'm still glad I did. If u decide to buy one, u can get extra life out of your hemi by changing the oil every 3000 miles, using high octane fuel like 93 (I was using 87 when my engine failed) and investing in an oil catch can, to prevent oil build up inside the engine, which is commonly what cases the HEMIs to eventually fail.",3

The hemi is very responsive and has plenty of power when needed or just for fun. I get a lot of compliments and the design of the car is unique but not overstated. It is definitely made to drive swiftly on the highway but can still corner well for a vehicle that's as big as it is. With regular maintenance and minimal abuse this car will last a long time.",5

The only maintenance required was routine (oil changes, transmission flush, replacement spark plugs...). Amazingly, at 120,000 miles the car still had the original brake pads with 40% of the pad remaining. I've never had a vehicle this reliable, and have nothing but praise for Chrysler's build quality.Ride was quiet and smooth, but also nicely balanced through the corners, making it as pleasurable on a back road as on the highway.

It is clacking again and it can drive you crazy.Park to Neutral lockout mechanism broke so car could not be driven.

The dealer was incredible and so supportive in every way.  The price was greatly appreciated and made my experience at the dealer all that much better.  Now as far as the care it has delivered beyond my expectations.  I was a little aprehensive because I went from the 5.7 L Hemi to the 6 cylinder engine.  I hasn't disapointed one bit and I do appreciate the increased mileage.  The ride is tight and with the 300 S version the car is glued to the road.   I love the performance tires and the overall look that is the 300 S version.  The interior is every bit as incredible if not better than my old 300 C.  This vehicle blows me away!

1385, on 06/26/17 11:42 AM (PDT),Brian S. ,2017 Chrysler 300 Sedan S 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Large American car better than hoped," I bought this car after being in mid sized SUV and large pickup trucks for the past 9 years. Coming from that background, this is an amazing car. I have the Sport model and you cannot be put off by the editor's review here. They reviewed a totally different car than mine in totally different circumstances. I was a little afraid of the comments of the ride and handling but I have not found any of that to be the case. The Sport is a tight, smooth, powerful car in mainstream driving situations. During normal driving it exhibits none of the floatiness or undesirable body roll described here. The seats are bolstered and firm so that one is held tightly in position during turning. They may be a little too small, as many of the Dodge/Chrysler products tend to be. Braking is firm and straight for a large car. In fact, one has to be aware of all the automatic systems in place to help you drive. I brake moderately coming to stops and I can feel the system apply more pressure as one of the safety systems thinks I am not stopping fast enough. Either that or the brakes really grab after a few seconds warm up. The engine is smooth and responsive, especially at passing speeds. And I am getting 28MPG right out of the box at moderate (65-70) highway speeds, which is incredible. Visibility does not seem to be a problem, again coming from a truck background. The quietness is also amazing as is the sound system. My wife bought a new 2016 Charger, the sister car to this and while they share platforms, there are distinct differences that are worth the $10,000 difference. I opted for the AWD system, which may be the only models available here in Minnesota. If all-weather capabilities are what you want or need, this car seems like it will provide them and be a worthy premium choice for large cars available.",5

Comfortable ride and so far am getting 23.5 mph average town and road.  How great is that?  :-)  Rides like a dream and is easy to drive.  Looks great to boot!  I HIGHLY recommend this car!  I bought the Velvet Cherry with the linen colored leather seats.  Am sooo happy!Update:  I've had this car for 1 year and have had to take it in for repairs 3 times.  The warrenty that I paid $1,200 for is no good.  My back wheels started rattling horribly.  Took it into the dealership in Opelika, AL for repair which should have been covered with only 10,000 miles and 11 months ownership.  They said...  not original wheels and they would not honor Chrysler dealership in FL where car was purchased during a move after hitting a deer that totaled my last car (A Chevy which brand I should have gone back to) and I tried to get car wheels fixed under my ""purchased"" warrenty.  They would not honor that either and I would have to pay $1,200 per wheel to get fixed.  A friend told me to take the car to a tire place in Valley, AL which I did and they took off the wheels and put a small piece of cardboard behind the hubcaps and no more rattle.  And, they did not charge me a thing.  I called Chrysler customer service and they would not honor the warrenties either.  I will never buy another Chrysler and would trade the car but my mother loves driving it.  I'm currently driving her 2012 Chevy Acadia and she's driving my 300 (She drives alot less that I do).  Long story short - I will never buy another Chrysler and do not recommend to my friends and family.  It's a pretty car but without my car being wrecked or any damage, the wheels just started rattling and I could get no service from Chrysler or the dealerships.  No wonder the company about went under years ago.  :-)",3

Rides like a dream, gas mileage is acceptable for a big car and in sport mode handles really well. Chrysler has made significant improvement in their electronics, infotainment and interior materials.

Beats audio is wonderful and the styling of the ""S"" trim constantly gets compliments. AWD only available with the V6, which is fine. 300 HP is plenty to move this car.

1392, on 11/29/17 19:46 PM (PST),Jim ,2014 Chrysler 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Nice ride horrible transmission!," Purchased the car used with 4500 miles on it and only had it a year and sold it with 26k miles.  During this time the ride of the car was outstanding, very smooth with very little road noise and a great interior with everything in reach.  The AWD was the best I have driven in the western new York snow.  However, there were a few things that were pretty annoying about the car.  First, if you were using the navigation system, it would just start to reset itself at the most inopportune time for no reason.  Once the navigation came back on it would pick right up where you were and continue.  Second, the heated seats is not a button, you have to go onto the display into climate and press the heated seat.  I would expect it to be a button right there on the dash or gear shifter area (petty I know).  Third and most important, the transmission is horrible.  I had the car in the shop 3 times during the year of ownership because of the shifting of the car.  The first issue with the transmission was first thing after starting it.  The car would rev up and finally shift into third gear with a very heavy shift, into the shop for a reprogram of the transmission.  Service tech at the dealer says that this is common with the car and they need to re-program to learn your driving style.  It was fixed and no issues for 3 months.  Second issue came when I started to slow down.  Every time I would come to a stop  the car would jerk forward on every down shift.  Back into the shop again for a reprogram for a fix.  That one lasted 3 months and then another issue came up while driving at highway speeds, while traveling 65 plus MPH the transmission would decide to down shift for no reason and then after about 5 min would go back into 8th gear.  Back to the shop for that, and the comment by the tech was “this is odd never heard of the highway speed issue, the other two are known issues”.  Good bye car before the warranty expired.  The transmission ruined the entire car experience (duh).  The car is beautiful and comfortable inside, great features for a “base” car and it was depressing to have to trade in, but the transmission issues would have cost $450 to reprogram outside of the warranty; no thank you.",2

Again, my opinion, both great cars. I chose the 300s for 1) Quite comfortable ride 2) Style 3) Gas mileage was equal on both.

What I do not like about the car is  the creaky dashboard  creaky door panels  the armrest is too high some panel trim not lined up correctly and the seats are too narrow. Under warranty so far I have replaced  the windshield cowl  the right rear shock  the rear sunscreen . Fuel economy is average. Traction is non-existent in the snow. This is not all wheel drive. The rest is the original review I did two years ago and still stands. Traded in a pristine 2011 Buick Lacrosse without batting an eye. Finally, a big car that rides with the comfort I have not had in years. The fact that it is rear wheel drive lets the front suspension do its job by handling road imperfections very well. Not much wind or road noise in the cabin either. Some feedback from the road can be felt in the steering wheel however it doesnt have that annoying torque steer like front wheel drive cars. Garmin nav system is better than Onstar hands down and without the monthly fee. Very little clutter on the dash which makes for a cleaner look. Go for the loaded version if you can because with the base model you will be missing out.",4

My review now is: I have the safety-tech package and it works flawlessly so far. The city ride could be softer, there is some road feedback thru the steering wheel (has 18"" tires), the rear sunshade was replaced once because it spooled up and tangled. 6 months later it did it again. Right rear shock leaked, failed, was replaced. Windshield wiper cowl was replaced (warped out of shape), IMO the front seats could be wider by 2.5 inches. I use a seat cushion. The dash board and rear right door creaks over rougher surfaces and is annoying to hear.  U-Connect and Nav features are good. Map updates are expensive and I don't think worth the money unless you travel other cities often. The center arm rest is too high for me. USB port could be located outside the center storage area for easier access. City gas mileage is average. Shifter is finicky and one needs to pay attention to its position when parking. It rolled on me a couple times when I thought it was in PARK and there is a recall for this issue. I looked at the 2016 300C and think my 2014 300C is better due to looks and interior colors. Don't know why the new ones come with white seats, will dirty quickly. As a long distance cruiser my 2014 300C is a very good ride and gas mileage on the highway is better than average. Original review:Got this in June 2014. Gladly traded a 2011 Buick Lacrappe for this car. This 300C has a great ride, good accelleration, very little road noise, coushy heated and cooled seats, and handles road imperfections especially around Philly well but could do better. Gas milage is excellent as long as you dont pound the pedal. Mine has all the bells and whistles. On the down side there were interior trim detail items that should not have been there. Moulding doesnt line up in some spots along the dash, some dashboard noise going over some bumps. Cowl over the speedometer was loose. Shifter needs practice to get used to. Other than that this is a very good purchase. Too soon to tell if it has mechanical issues.",4

At that time it had 70K miles. I've added another 10K, and so far the car has performed beautifully. Other than oil changes the only expense has been to buy a spare key ($315) and new tires ($700). I've taken a couple of short distance (150 miles or so) trips and the car rides like a dream. City mpg runs about 17.5-18.0; highway about 24 mpg. I feel very secure driving the car. I would recommend the Chrysler 300.I've now owned the car for over a year and can still highly recommend the 300. It's very reliable and comfortable to drive. Only normal service work, i.e. oil changes, has been needed. The car now has 92,000 miles on it. Still providing perfectly reliable service. The only repair work I’ve had to do was to replace the drivers door handle. I still highly recommend a Chrysler 300.",5

Just over 38k miles now, it's still brand new in every way. Power on tap is un-limited! Extremely quiet, ride is ""sporty"" for such a big car. Never feels heavy, really nimble actually. You do get jostled a bit, but when hitting curves, there's a sense they aren't even there. Talk out there in blogs has this model pinned for being collector car worthy in the future. Chrysler got it right on this one. The re-style is nice, but not comparable to this last beauty produced.

The dealership was pleasant to do business with, and had the vehicle delivered in a timely manner (built to order).

Luxury is a word that must be aquated with this nicely presented sedan. It's styling on both the exterior and interior leave very little to want. For your buck the 300 Touring AWD edition with the 5.7 liter engine is the best of the several purchase options. It has enough umpth for your lead foot, and leaves room in your budget to add some of the best options that Chrysler offers.

The 300 is a great highway cruiser but in any turns at 15+ mph the tires begin to squeal. The car heaves around corners like a boat and visibility makes reverse maneuvering difficult. Gas mileage is also poor at 17 city. The Impala has just as much punch, handles better, and gets 20 city/29 highway. Also, for $32k I would expect the leather to be real and not vinyl made to look like leather. When accelerating there is a brief lag between hitting the gas and the car accelerating. Most US manufacturers have this issue, would be more precise with drive by wire technology. ",3.5

I am a professional Livery driver and spent many hours in this car. First the best aspects of the car: -Even with my 3.6L engine, this car is fast and I think this is what the designers focused on mostly; never had a car that peeled out before. Great torque and fairly responsive. The torque also allows the car to get up to speed without revving too high so in that sense the engine is quiet. Exhaust is quiet. Transmission is fairly good with some inconsistencies and quirks.  Car is large and roomy (except for maybe the ceiling height) and passengers in the back comment often on how comfortable it is back there. Now some bad: My biggest gripe about this car is the suspension. It feels OK over small bumps but it feels like you crashed into a truck if you hit a small pothole or go over bad roads which are numerous here in NYC. The suspension is unrefined, but still better than my friends Cadillac XTS which also has a horrible suspension. The build of this car is not very good. Pieces vibrating, creaking sounds coming from the rear and my sunroof, ceiling and other places, which gives the impression that it is *not* a solid car. Even the right side of my top panel, next to my windshield keeps popping up. This in combination with the feeling of the harsh suspension makes it feel like the car is falling apart. For the few years I have owned this car, I had tons of trouble. I had to change the battery twice, the entire front suspension, rear shocks, water pump, fuel pump, and a bunch of other minor problems. The suspension being the most costly. My airbag light goes on and off. The rear windows screech as they go up and down. Anyway, you get the point. The entertainment and touch control system is great, I like the screen size and the way it works. However my Bluetooth connection stopped working and I cannot connect my phone anymore. Sound system is very decent. Sunroof is great and can vent it without the rain pouring in. Wheels are fake chrome with a plastic facade. Steering wheel is just ok and can hurt the hands after a while. Leather seats are decent, with a solid base but still a bit unrefined; can still sit comfortably for a long time. Still a great deal if you get close to the base model price with a warranty which is close to the price of a Camry. Would still rather own this car over a Camry and other similar price range cars any day.",3

This is our 4th Chrysler between me and my girlfriend and this 300 hasn't failed us yet. Previously I owned and 1999 Chrysler LHS (Brought it in 2001), an 1999 300m and a she had 2006 Dodge Charger R/T purchased in 2007. The 2012 Chrysler 300 Limited hasn't had not one issue and it has 68,000 miles on it. It has on had oil changes and brakes. The brakes took 3 years to wear down. We room a road trip in it from Chicago to Bloomington, Mn and I reset the fuel data to see how many mpg the 300 got per gallon. We filled up the tank and made it to Minnesota with 3/8 of a tank of gas left. The mpg read at 39.3 which blew my socks off. I used cruise control almost all of the trip that's probably why but the vehicle is also comfortable and can seat 5 adults. It glides through traffic and the engine is powerful. This was a great choice because I have friends that own Toyota Camry's (ignition coil issues $1900 to repair and Variable valve timing problems $2,200 repair) and Honda Accords and they have had major problems and constant recalls. The 300 has little to no road noise and the interior design is a thousand times better than those boring Asian interiors.

That proved less than satisfactory, so I began looking for a vehicle that was comfortable, good on gas, equipped with spirited engine to pass the big rigs, some convenience features plus a decent sound system and, of course, competitive price.

Teenager- hot rod. newly married with no kids-a 4 door sports car like a Nissan Maxima,  having little kids- a minivan or a mid size SUV like a Highlander , purchased a house and will be doing most repairs yourself- Truck, Midlife crisis -Convertible. Well I've been through all that. Next car for me on Lifes  Bucketlist is a ""Old mans car"", there are many out there, from Cadillac , Lincoln, Mercedes etc, I bought myself a 2016 300C, and I love this car!  1st of all, you can get alot off the sticker because they have some tuff competition. Next compare the features in this ultra loaded car to a Cadillac and you can see it,s easily a $10-16000 bargain. Chrysler tries really hard to compete against others by putting a lot in their cars, Michelin mx v4 tires, double  sunroof, nice looking chrome wheels, front and back heated seats(who does that !) a Mercedes looking interior layout, a car frame that was used in previous Mercedes E series, 8 speed transmissions. AWD. huge trunk. Accessories Galore. Driving this car with the V6 I find it to have plenty of power and zip. I drove both the V6 and the V8 Hemi on 2 different days and I honestly could not tell the difference. The ride is very comfortable with the 4 wheel independent  suspension.the car also has a quiet interior.  My only complaint is I find  the middle arm rest is set too far back, your elbow is almost falling off the front of it. Small complaint considering their are a hundred things in a car that could bother you. I have been buying Toyotas, Nissans and Mazda,s  for 30 years now and it feels good to come back to an American car that I can say I really love.

I did not think it would be anything special, but the 300 absolutely shocked me, so much as to think, ""why doesn't everyone have one of these?"" The ride is so soft and easy-- absolutely effortless to drive. The UConnect system and entire control system is so easy to use; everything that should have a button or knob does and there's no unnecessary cluttering. I love the way the navigation system appears on the driver's dash and decreases the volume of the music only on the driver's side to give an upcoming direction. I do wish that the navigation system allowed the passenger to type while the vehicle is in motion, but I understand why it doesn't allow it. It is such a comfortable car, and if it isn't, there are a multitude of ways that you can adjust the seat to make it most comfortable. The Pentastar engine is fantastic. It's funny that I had the same engine in my Wrangler, yet in this vehicle it seems entirely different: so refined and reliable. I can't tell the auditory difference between when the vehicle is on and when it is off-- that is a great vehicle. I do wish there was more backseat room, but for someone who rarely has backseat passengers, it's hardly a complaint at all and the massive trunk more than makes up for it. I am so happy with this car-- sporty, classic, bold, luxurious and goes like hell, even without the 8. The panoramic sunroof is gorgeous and hardly makes noise when opened, something a lot of other sunroofs fail to do. I'll be running this vehicle into the ground!",5

I always buy a car that is at least 1 or 2 years old, so I don't get hit with the depreciation the last poster was complaining about on new cars. Test drove and researched many pre-owed vehicles (including Lexus LS, Infiniti Q70, Benz S, BMW 7, Audi A8) before deciding on a low mileage pre-owned 300c AWD v6 for my next car. To say I'm impressed after 500 miles would be an understatement. It is truly the best combo of comfort, performance, safety AND value. Those were my priorities, and this car knocks the ball out of the park. I wanted and found a 300c with the SafetyTec2 Package with adaptive cruise. After using this option for a bit, I wonder how I ever survived without it. It makes driving even more of a pleasure in this car. If you are considering pre-owned in those other big European sedans, do your research... right here on Edmunds. Reliability issues and quirky problems abound in those cars. Even if you pay a fortune for an extended warranty, you'll likely be inconvenienced with multiple trips to the dealership for repairs. Side note: I purchased a Chrysler manufacturer's bumper-to-bumper extended warranty to cover me up to 7 years and 75k miles.... for $1300. Try to get a price for that warranty on one of those Euro sedans. You'll be lucky if you only pay 3x as much. The 300 was also by far the least expensive of all vehicles I tested.",5
1493, on 09/19/16 12:21 PM (PDT),throw73 ,2015 Chrysler 300 Sedan C 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Poor beneath the surface," I purchased a 2015 300c 5.7l v8 hemi brand new. First, the cars seat comfort is excellent. The cars driver side seat ventilator motor gave out on its first use. If you want a smooth quiet ride I would avoid the 20"" wheels, they are very noisy. The 5.7 hemi is fast but by todays standards not really... Plus the tradeoff of horrible gas mileage. What people who don't own one don't really know is that you have to get the rpm's pretty high in order to take advantage of the torque on the 5.7.   I waited for the 2015 model so that I could get the 8-speed transmission. The shifts are jerky and inconsistent which was a concern but livable. Also when moving to 'drive' from 'reverse' and vise versa there is a loud pop when engaging into the gear. The big problem occurred when I was trying to merge on the freeway and under semi hard acceleration the transmission popped into neutral, then downshifted to a gear too low causing a major jerk reaction. I almost got rear ended because of this. This was all before the first oil change at around 8000 miles( the minor issues were present from the beginning). When I took the car in to the dealer they performed a bunch of computer updates. This did not fix the issue and the car did the same thing upon merging on the freeway again. Second trip to the dealer they had to replace the valve body. This car was just bought back from Chrylser through the lemon law. This car is garbage. Which is reflected in the resale value. May car was worth ~$25,000 in less than 1 year with low miles, I purchased it for $40,000! I did research and the Chrysler 300 is #1 in depreciation! This is why you see so many wankstas in used 300's. Save yourself and your wallet from this car and learn from my experience.",1

1495, on 07/30/16 15:04 PM (PDT),Scott G. ,2015 Chrysler 300 Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Outstanding," I think this is an exceptional Sedan. Thick wrapped leather steering wheel, large leather seats and plenty of cargo room in the trunk. I look forward to driving this car everyday with it's crisp handling, supple ride and near perfect engine/transmission combo. The base stereo in our Limited has more features and better bass response than any other vehicle we have ever owned. The rotary shifter does take a little getting used to, but is a non-issue and actually makes the center stack feel a little more spacious. This car certainly has it's limits in the corners, but is far more nimble then given credit. Yes the transmission is programmed for fuel economy,  yet it responds quickly to downshifts and will hold a gear when summoned to. If you do any mixed driving like me expect 27-29 MPG, if you drive strictly around town like my wife you will be in the 22-24 MPG range. If you drive hard, all bets are off and fuel economy should not matter to you. I am extremely impressed with the fuel economy for a car this big and heavy. Chrysler dealers are willing to negotiate on these vehicles, especially the RWD V6 models like ours and that just sweetens the pot even more. I was also impressed with it's winter handling here in Michigan, it felt planted and traction was decent on really bad roads with the stock Michelin's. I had Discount Tire put 4 Hankook iPike winter tires on my wife's car and we could practically conquer the world in this thing. Test drive one and you will be impressed.",5

Top of the Line," I bought this car after my 2015 Dodge Durango Limited was totaled by a drunk driver. My number 1 necessity was to feel safe in a vehicle again.. The Durango save my life, my husband's life, my 1 month old son's life, my toddler's life and my best friend's life. I really wanted another one but at the time these were still new so there were no used Durangos and I did not have the same amount of money to put down that I had previously. So I had no choice but to take a higher payment or get a cheaper car... so I chose to buy the 2015 Chrysler 300s -V6. Let me tell you.. this car does not even compare to any other sedan out there! I have driven Nissan, Toyota, Honda, Chevy, BMW and Mercedes. This car is by far more comfortable and smooth than any of the vehicles listed above!! I miss my Durango every day especially because we have 2 kids, 2 dogs and the 2 of us. We manage to squeeze all of us and the dogs in our 300 but it would be nice to have the SUV again. I have contemplated many times over the 10 months that I have had this car on trading it in for a used SUV. But the amount of money I paid, my car payment and the luxury this car has does not compare to the cars I would qualify for. I AM NEVER TRADING THIS IN!I get pretty good MPG, although my Altima got almost 10 more MPG in City and Highway. I do wish the backseats had a better AC vent system. They are behind the center console so when its 110 degrees outside it takes a minute for the back to get cooled down and when someone is sitting in the middle their knees will freeze off before either sides will feel air. This car rides like a cloud, the stock speakers are better than regular (Beats Audio), I have tinted windows and I get so many compliments on my car. I highly recommend this car to anyone! I have the V6 and in sport mode I have raced a street bike, a Lexus sportscar, and a couple others. It has speed, comfort-ability, luxury, and it is one heavy vehicle!  I feel safe in this car and I have confidence driving down the road. The remote start and trunk lift are really awesome! The only flaw is sometimes when you turn the car on with the key and open the trunk from the inside of the car the truck wont close, it pops back up until the car is put into drive, which sucks if you're alone. It is a mechanical/safety concern but it was a glitch and I have not had a problem since. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR IF... if you want space or have 3 car seats! The backseat is large but the two side bucket type seats are perfect for car seats, the middle is too narrow.  All in all, this car is a 5 out of 5!",5

I traded in my 2012 Dodge Charger for less sport and more luxury. The only disadvantage is the 300 does not have EcoBoost. You will run your a/c and loose gas quickly. I could run my charger and get ice cold air without ever using the a/c and it barely used gas. I stay with the same manufacturer but forgot to research the EcoBoost.......that says a lot too!!!!

Ride, handling, and features are very good. Love the styling, both inside and out; controls are very logical and easily understood. Handling and performance are good for what this car is. My biggest disappointments with this vehicle are as follows.1) Backup camera guidelines are off about a foot to the left side when backing straight up. Took it back to the dealer twice, once after getting Chrysler Customer Service involved. I was told that this is normal, and due to the lens being mounted off centered on the real center mounted light. I've owned cars costing half as much and never had an issue like this with the rear guidelines. My previous 300 had the same setup with the rear camera (although I was told it was mounted directly in the center of the vehicle!) and I did not have this issue. 2) The navigation system seems to be rather mundane, especially the display in the center drivers information area that shows the turn coming up-it is always the same graphic, regardless of the actual intersection you are approaching. For the price of the nav system, it really should be much better. 3) There is an annoying rattle somewhere in the backseat area that no one seems to be able to eliminate.",3

Couldn't get any happier when I first saw this vehicle on the lot, it looks incredibly good looking for its price. Then, I've learned a very valuable lesson to not ever judge a car just from the outside as this garbage keeps letting me down. The 8-speed transmission is a freaking joke. Poor downshifting from 3-2-1, very clunky coming from the transmission. Every time I drive this vehicle, it's mandatory to crank up the sound system so that I won't hear any unwanted mysterious noises that's coming from the transmission. The car only has 8000 miles at this moment and already felt like its transmission is about to fall apart when driving it. When I paid $45k for a car, I would expect it to work like a charm and satisfied me as a consumer. But this car fails so bad in that aspect to the point that I can't wait to pay off the loan and get rid of this junk forever from my life. My previous 2007 350Z that I traded in drives so much better than this crap. So if you value your money, please don't ever buy any Chrysler products.",1

My wife asked me if I had any other cars on my list and I said ""yeah, the Chrysler 300 but I don't think it'll hold up against the other 3 we drove"".  My wife convinced me to go drive it since it was on the list.   We didn't even get 1/4 mile and we both were simply blown away!The Chrysler 300 for some strange reason is compared to other American sedans and a Japanese sedan or two, but for some reason they are rarely compared to the 3 Euro models I listed above.  Why?  I have no clue other than it might be political because the 300 puts them to shame.   Yeah, the others have a couple interior things that look a bit better (not by much and prob not noticeable by most people) but when you compare the engine, the ride, the bang for your buck it's not even a comparison.Once we were done test driving the 300 it was a easy decision, we weren't going to spend $5k-$10k more just to have the BMW, Audi, or Mercedes name on our car.....we wanted the best riding, most spacious, and most upgrades we could get and save $5k-$10k!We ended up getting the 2015 300S in Black and absolutely LOVING IT!!!",5

Interior is well laid out, other then the cruise control stalk, but material quality could be better.  As far as performance goes, this car easily keeps up with the German performance sedans and annihilates the American and Japanese ones.

1520, on 02/24/16 07:35 AM (PST),Matt ,2007 Chrysler 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.7L 6cyl 4A),Best Bang for Your Buck!," I bought my Chrysler 300c around 6 months ago with 73K miles.  Its by far my favorite car I've ever owned.  The power is good but it is a heavy car.  I had a single cab 05 Chevy Silverado Z71 with the upgraded engine putting out 290 horsepower before the 300c and it felt like it put you back in your seat more than the 340 horsepower Chrysler 300c.  It might be because the ride is so smooth in the 300c or because the center of gravity is lower.  I do a lot of city driving and I'm getting around 15 mpg average which is a little lower than the 17 advertised (90% of the time I have my daughter with me and I drive like Miss Daisy) but with the hemi that was expected.  What I wasn't expecting is how good the gas mileage is on the highway.  If I reset my MPG average setting when I get on the highway it calculates quickly and gets up over 32 mpg.  There are major blind spots though so you really have to check twice and know your surroundings.  Also the comfortably of the driver seat could be better.  It feels like its made for a much larger man.  I'm 6ft 200lbs and it doesn't hug my back at all.  I have a 2,200 mile road trip coming up and I'm not looking forward to the foreseen back pain in my future.  I'm looking at replacing the front seats with Challenger seats with hopes they will be more form fitting.  The traction control needs some work.  If you give it to much gas when accelerating the traction control kicks in and controls your launch.  I've learned to turn the ESP off every time I start up my car.  From what I've seen on older models when I was searching the market is looks like the clear coat on the faux wood grain on the steering wheel and interior door handles flakes easily.  With theses negatives being easy to fix I'm planing on keeping this car for life and adding a stroker kit and or a supercharger.  If I ever trade this car in it will be for a newer SRT8.  Its a little slow on the launch but when you hit 60 is when It really wakes up and gets scary fast.  It just keeps pulling!  Even at 120 mph you still feel like you're riding on a cloud.  Another down side is the speed limiter that is set at 126 mph due to the tires put on from the factory are only rated for 130 mpg.  From what I have researched it looks like the actual top speed is 175 mph.  Now I know I will never go that fast (maybe once) but it would be nice to brag about being close to super car speed.  Putting a speed limiter so low is kinda like a kick in the balls.  Handling is great for such a big car.  Its a true American muscle car with all the luxury features you'd find in your Mercedes, Lexus and BMWs at an affordable price with great reliability.  You also wont have to take this car to a specialized mechanic and pay extremely high repair costs.  The perfect combination of reliability, luxury, and power on a limited budget.",4

First the cons: issue with one of the rear heated seats switch, it would turn on and start flashing, then shut off. The lighting for both front seat heater switches went out, along with the variable fan speed switch and the analog clock. Navigation flat out sucked...I paid for the new navigation CD/DVD and had nothing but problems with it, so I stopped using it. Plus I would receive an error message every so often saying the disk had failed to load, and it was hell to eject it. The pros: everything else. For the model year I had every option but bluetooth and adaptive cruise control. he car purred like a champ, that is until I ended up in a flood (a foot of water running down the road) and sucked water into my air intake and hydro locked the engine.

It want pass the Ohio aim test because of the check engine light being on. The 30 day temp plate has expired.

The Salesman along with Chrysler repair man says that Chrysler is aware of the ""thunk"" sound and that is has something to do with the ""Tranny"" and since the car has 3 computerized components, each components has different functions and they are playing catch up to each other when you hear that slight thunk.

The multi-displacement engine, so far, is getting better mileage than I expected. I previously owned a 2004 Concorde, which I liked, but this is a much higher level of luxury.",4.875

Handles great!  Only one problem - had PO430 emission code pop up once at 1,100 miles.  Checked pending codes and reset.  Code has not returned.  I suspect it is due to break in issues.  This is a very fun car to drive, and very comfortable.  The Nav system works great, and the upgraded stereo system is awesome.  This was worth the 43K I paid for the car.

It has power to spare, to go with the good looks, and it handles well for a large, domestic car. It is not in the same class as the Europeans as far as handling is concerned, but for the thousands of dollars less your paying, I'd say it's a fair trade off.

It has a very smooth and quiet ride, gets good fuel mileage and it Sparkles!  But two issues makes it a Love/Hate relationship:  First, the climate control has been doing it's own thing for some time now.  Now and then it starts blowing out super-hot air, no matter what temp it is set on.  Going back to the dealer for second repair.  The front windshield is extremely pitted after only 34k miles! aerodynamics? cheap glass?  ( I do not tailgate). At the current pace, I will have to replace it by 50k miles.*update June 28 2016:  I have owned this Chrysler 300 for a little over 2 years, and 45,000 miles.  It has spent way too much time at the Dealer for major repairs. And getting the repairs made are extremely frustrating.  Apparently, Chrysler does not like to acknowledge defects.  My entire Dash had to be removed to repair a faulty climate control system.  This was only completed after 2 prior visits, where I was told that the system was working per ""Chrysler specs"".  And then the Transmission!  Oh Boy!  This started early on, maybe after just 10,000 miles,  It was shifting quite roughly, sometimes not knowing what gear to go into.. and heavy clunking (like a bad U-joint on an older model car).  Numerous complaints and visits to the dealer, just to be told that the mechanics found it within ""Chrysler Specs"".

I cant say enough good things about the quality and reliability of the 2013 Chrysler 300S. I test drive the Hemi, which was my preference at the time, and decided the difference in power from the V6 was so negligible that it wasn't justified. I actually had to ask the salesman if he was sure I was in the V6 at the time because of how well the power delivery was. Plus the 31mpg highway rating is a conservative estimate. I quite frequently get 34-36 miles per gallon on 7-8 hour trips between Texas and surrounding states. My driving Around town stays around 22-24 mpg. ",5

I love that it is so unique I will never run into another one on the road. It's an unmistakably gorgeous car and it's a blast off the line with the 5.7 Hemi.

Our main priority was a quiet highway ride, and the Chrysler delivers that in spades. Two days after we purchased the car, we left on a two week, 4,000 mile trip through NM, CO, WY, MT and SD. The car performed flawlessly, was extremely comfortable at all times, and delivered highway MPG that was incredible. During two days of primarily interstate driving, the MPG exceeded 32 miles per gallon.Update: After 50,000 miles, this car continues to amaze us. Great fuel mileage, quiet as a Monday morning church, 8 speed ZF transmission is a delight and plenty of luxury touches. Big screen navigation system is easy to use, and climate control features are great. Love the heated steering wheel in the winter, and venyptilated seats in the summer. The leather interior is holding up well, no worn bolsters or front seat cushions. The Saftey Tech features were well worth the investment, although Chrysler has split it into two packages on the newer 300's. The depreciation curve has been pretty steep, but is not abnormal. The only feature that was somewhat negative was the life of the original equipment Firestone tires. They were extremely quiet tires, but the soft tread compound was only good for about 22,000 miles. Failed to plan ahead on the first replacement, and the only tires available same day were the Firestones. Second set wore down at 45,000 miles, and were replaced with Michelin MXM tires that carry a 55,000 mile tread life warranty. We will see if they make it.Update: Now at ~60,000 miles and the 300C is still doing great. Michelin MXM have over 10,000 miles and measured 9/11ths at the most recent oil change. Looks like they will last much longer than the Firestones, and the ride and quiet running are even better. We are still extremely pleased with the car. So far only routine maintenance, no major repairs. Still getting 30mpg on highway driving.",5

Better gas mileage than a 6 cylinder Caravan and a lot of other ""ECO"" branded vehicles. The car will have the power to pass just about anything in normal or heavy traffic especially on the  tight distances on two lane roads. The downfall: not much leg room in the rear if your driver is more than 6' and Watch for hydroplaning with stock tires. Launch Control is touchy and aborts unless on a perfect and flat surface, otherwise get ready for a wonderful rear tire smokey show while impressive; it cuts the 1/4 mile and 0-60 time to about 12.5 quarter mile and 4.3 for a  0-60 with junky stock tires, get good tires and this car will be with the big leagues at the time trap. For older people this car may be too much to hang on to in Track Mode while on the normal road. 170 MPH seems like a cruising 80  MPH in this fine ride.And  this is where you leave your neighbor (who had to go get a raise at work to own a Buick), you can pass him up  and leave him far behind, and probably pump the same amount of gas as he does.

For the price of the disc required to update I can buy an after market unit that has all of these features & it will fit right into the dash w/o modifications. There are outstanding airbag recalls that I will have to take care of & the worst thing is that when you fill up the car all the way it stalls. This is a known problem with this & several Chrysler cars & fortunately about 2 years ago they finally agreed to extend a lifetime warranty to the gas tank which will need to be replaced. I have arranged to take it in to dealership & this work will be free of charge. Overall for as nice as this car is, with only 75,000 miles & for the price I paid...$8750 I believe its a bargain. They are out there to be found but some dealers think they are worth $10-12k...Don't pay that. Find one & stick to your guns. Many of the dealers who initially laughed at my offer are now calling me ready to sell after sitting on there cars for a couple months...but of course they are too late.",4

Five years of ownership and all I have replaced is a EGR Valve last May and a rear speaker that I blew out myself. To compare this car to a Audi or Honda or Toyota is a huge mistake. They have no where near the same in-cab room and feeling of comfort on the surface of the road. The low-long body allows for tight turns and an excellent grab on the pavement. The small V6 is well enough for highway and in-town acceleration.

Can you say oxymoron. I am so disapointed. I am looking at Nissan and Toyota. This really hurts because I am a UAW employee. ",3.375

Went for the big 20 inch wheels and upgraded sound system too. This car is by far the finest I have ever owned and driven in its class. It has power, is very quiet, handles great, and is loaded with a lot of electronic features. The exterior styling along with the LED daytime running lights are exceptional. The sounds system also rocks! My 17 year old son even likes it and says the big wheels make the car look very sporty, yet executive like. It rides like a dream and I'm getting much better than advertised gas mileage so far - about 25 in mixed driving and 31+ on the highway. I have nothing negative to report about the new 300",5

I have owned several 300's and Chargers, they are just great cars.  Driving comfort, great style and power o'plenty are this car's greatest attributes.  The C&D and Edmunds reviewers always complain about body roll and other handling characteristics that the vast majority of drivers, including enthusiasts couldn't distinguish from dog doodle--people that buy this car do so for it's all too uncommon style and comfort--not to put it on the track at Road America.  The 300 is a great ride for your daily driver, even with the Hemi it gives respectable fuel economy.  A skilled driver can squeeze 20-21 mpg for a typical mix of city and highway driving.

All the ones that came before this 2018 model were good solid cars with excellent technology. This 2018 model is a great ride with comfortable seats and modern safety equipment. The one drawback is the entertainment system. If you need to adjust the controls, make a call or do anything that requires the controls to be seen, the radio has to be turned on. My previous 300's never had to be on and the system would always show most of the controls while the Radio was off but this new one has to be turned on to use any other function the entertainment system gives you. When the car is in reverse and the camera goes on, you can't turn on the radio. The car has to be in park or driving forward for the radio to be turned on.

I had to take it back to the dealership the first time because the passenger side door panel was bucking up and coming off.  THAT was fixed under the warranty (oh, and let me mention that I paid $800 extra for the warranty that was supposed to cover the car as long as I own the car).  I moved from FL back home to AL 3 months ago.  Last month (with 10,000 miles on the car please keep in mind), the back driver wide wheel starting rattling like a bucket of bolts.  I took it to the dealership here in AL confident that would be fixed too.  Well, guess what?  The warranties are VOID because the dealership in FL swapped the wheels and the original equipment wheels are not on the car anymore.  This swap was never mentioned to me and now that $800 warranty I paid for is not worth the paper it's written on.  I am probably going to trade this car that rides and looks good and take a loss on it because the little things are aggravating me to death and it's not worth the aggravation.  I am going back to Chevy products.  I never in 40 years of driving had this problem with Chevy vehicles and they always stood behind their products.  I even called Chrysler yesterday and today and was told this was a ""dealership"" problem.  Well, it's not going to be my problem for much longer.  I am sick and tired of getting nowhere and listening to ""excuses"".  Chrysler customer service and reliability is nothing to speak of.  I paid a lot of money for this car and the warranty.

The total black dash with tortoise-shell accents is great, but the headliner should either match or be contrasted with something softer.  The two-toned dash looks off somehow.  Also, a body style like this craves darker colors, like maroon metal flake, to show off the lines.  Color selection is so limited. Right now, only black looks good enough to buy.

Between the front roof post and side view mirrors...look out on turns.  The interior was spacious but bland, with nothing to recommend or criticize too hard.  I had the V6, which made the car's interior sound like a truck, and was the noisiest I've driven in years.  It did provide good acceleration, and was well matched to the car's below average handling.  The engine was not as thirsty as I feared.  I got 22-24 mpg in mostly suburban driving.

Even with the base LX, you still get a well appointed semi-luxurious ride with an adequate engine.  It's tough to complain about the 2.7L when it delivers gas mileage in the mid to high 20's.

The car rides incredible, the fit and finish is the best of any Chrysler I have owned by far.  The road noise is minimal and the look is just sleek it looks like a much more expensive car.

It's now 11.5 years old and has 73,000 miles on it.

1799, on 03/28/16 07:24 AM (PDT),Alex ,2006 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan 4dr Minivan (3.3L 6cyl 4A),The practical people mover for the long term," This is my third Chrysler Product. I had a 94 Grand Caravan. Great engine but poor transmission that required rebuild at 90k miles but the car lasted as a whole until 180k miles with routine maintenance and was still drivable when I donated it to charity. I then had a 2001, where they added a transmission cooler and fixed the transmission issues. The 3.3 Liter (and it's cousin the 3.8) are now powerful engines especially if moving a nearly 5,000 lb car, but it's not meant to be fast. Good torque and the O.H.V engine design keep things simple, and costs down for repairs. This simpler engine has been around for a very long time, and it's fairly easy to service.  But at 180 HP for such a heavy car, it' s very slow.  I now bought my Mom a 2006 Town and Country,  the upscale version of the Dodge Grand Caravan. I feel that in the used car marketplace, the Town and Country is priced nearly identical to the Dodge Grand Caravan but in initial purchase, they are 10k to 15k more in price for not much more in features. I think that if you are buying it without power sliding doors (less that can break) and without a lot of fancy electronics there is less that can break. The best feature of this car is the stow-and-go. You can convert it to a errand car for trips to Home Depot very easily. Another thing not often mentioned is that if you have large dogs, like German Shepherd, or Mastiff, this car's ability to put the rear 60/40 bench seat down and put a dog carrier in the back, is a great way to carry large pets, especially with a lower step in height. Did you ever try to help a 12 year old arthritic dog into a cross over or SUV and help lift such a heavy dog into the tall load floor? For me, my Minivan is my go to car for long trips, or for trips to get paint, or sheetrock. The cost of not renting a truck is very handy.  I think it's a fantastic practical car. It's not particularly fast, but it's a well known design and it's been around forever. I had to replace the water pump at 60k miles. I strongly recommend any new owner change the transmission fluid at 60k miles and again at 120k. You need ATF+4 and make sure Chrysler does it, not some cheapo oil change, as this car is very sensitive to having the correct transmission fluid. Stay on top of your fluid changes for the tranny with these cars.  I have over 100k miles and I mostly had little annoying problems, like door switches and window regulators, but not major break downs. Basic upkeep of new tires, brakes, frequent oil changes. I recommend changing the PCV and EGR valve at the 75,000 mile tuneup, as these parts are not expensive, and can keep car running smoother longer. Overall, it's one of the lowest cost-of-entry in the used car marketplace and cheaper than a Honda or Toyota Sienna while offering all the same value. I like this older body style compared to squared off new version. I also like the fact that they kept the same engine and transmission around for a long time, unlike Kia that went for a well known 3.8 DOHC engine to a 3.4 Liter with variable valve timing in only 10 years. To me, keeping the same basic engine and transmission around for 3 decades helps keep costs down both during purchase and repair time. Overall, not a fancy car, but a very practical car. I recommend.",4

Calling Chrysler consumer hot line doesn't seem to help.  They say they'll check on things and call you back but they don't.  I'm getting frustrated.  How long do I have to wait for a part?

It goes through brakes every 20K and now has a brake vibration that the dealer can't figure out. It pulls to the right and the dealer (Danbury Dodge/Chrysler in CT) told me ""they all do that a little"". Thank goodness I bought the extended warranty. Even so, the sway bar and end links were not covered under the supposed ""bumper to bumper"" extended warranty. I'm a slow driver and I've never gotten more than 20 mpg from it.

The 2001 brakes lasted 60,000 but they had original ceramic all around. That convinced me of the value of ceramic. Now for the good points. Most of miles are on the highway where believe it or not I drive at 67-70 mph and get from 24.5 to 31 mpg. Believe it.

At 70,000 miles, the driver side CV Axle broke internally (boot not torn at all); had to tow van home & replace. The passenger side is popping; plan to replace this week before I get left on the side of the road again. Maybe a recall is necessary, since the dealership parts guy admitted that he's sold allot of them?  The lifters are noisy, maybe I should try a higher octane gas, as a previous review suggests? Hard to, with gas prices the way they are...",4.5

For whatever reason they don't have our short-wheel base model in the latest (2008) T&C, the design also took a step backwards. We prefer our ""bubble"" design look.  The fuel economy of the 3.3 L engine is better than of its competitors (even the Honda Odyssey), but we barely get 20 mpg on average out of it. The motor is responsive and well- balanced. So far no issues with it.  The only design flaw we found is an unusual brake configuration: Our minivan has disk brakes on front and drum brakes on back - most brake job places have an ""all disk brakes"" in their database!

1862, on 12/02/15 08:44 AM (PST),Erin ,2000 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan LX 4dr Minivan,2000 Town & Country Limited," We bought this van used 3 years ago with about 160,000 miles on it. We had to replace the alternator within the first month, but that was the most major repair it's needed since we've owned it. Needless to say, that leaves me very satisfied with the van's overall mechanical reliability. Starts right up every try. It's not the zippiest van I've ever driven, but is a very comfortable ride.  Shortly after we got this van the back hatch quit opening, over the years the passenger doors quit opening from the inside, both annoying issues we haven't really looked into getting fixed, so I don't know how expensive it will be.  At some point the left turn signal started acting up. Randomly it will not work. Our best deduction is that there is a problem in the switch (at the steering column). The flakiness of the turn signal was my biggest safety concern with this van, however. Handles well on snow, ice, and rain. We have 5 kids ages 7-16, and found the roominess left some to be desired, it's not terrible, not great.  Sound system was great before two of the speakers got blown out. Heated seats never worked right, drivers side didn't heat at all, and when the passenger side worked it felt like it might set you on fire. There was a recall on heated seats that year. After 30,000 miles, I can say I enjoyed driving this van and would recommend it for it's reliability. It is primarily my husband's van now, as we have gotten a newer Toyota Sienna for the family. Previously we owned a 1998 Nissan Quest, I loved our Quest, it went to 219,000 miles then it was stolen. Comfort and overall sturdiness of the interior of the Chrysler were better than our Quest, tho. We considered getting a newer Town & Country when we decided to upgrade our van, but after much research found the Toyotas to have the best overall reviews. This year of Town and Country was a good one for us.",4

Road noise could be lower, but car has nearly 130k miles, so some may be due to the normal aging of car.

Ours van came with Kumo tires, which are really crappy.  Two of them were date coded 2010 and two 2012, we did get 65k out of them, before the sidewall cracked.

1919, on 07/17/17 20:11 PM (PDT),Patty ,2014 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan Touring-L 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Big Mistake," I like this vehicle because of the front visibility and the space availability. That is where it ends. Seats are not comfortable. The AC broke at 50,000 miles and I live in NY where I rarely use the AC. The repair was $900 and the next summer it was broken again. What should have been fixed the first time was not fixed correctly and it cost me another $700. Chrysler Corporation was no help whatsoever. They do not stand behind their poorly engineered product. In the winter, this vehicle is worthless at best and dangerous. It performs poorly even with a tiny bit of snow or slush. Update: I replaced all 4 tires with snow tires ($600.00) and this winter, it does perform better in the snow. I will have the expense every year of switching tires from winter to all season. Another glitch with this vehicle is the tire size. The vehicle has a 16 inch wheel but the book car service shops consult states a 17 inch tire, so when I buy tires, I have to make sure to tell them 16, not 17. I once waited 3 hours only to have them tell me the tires did not fit and they had to order 16 inch tires. Not all 2012 T and C's were created equal. I understand they no longer make this vehicle and have replaced it with the ""Pacifica"" I will NOT buy another Chrysler. The ""stow and go"" seats, although and improvement, are not as easy to operate as you see in a tv commercial.  To stow or re-seat, you have to move the front seats all the way forward, move all mats, and then pull very hard to get the seat up out of storage. I am over 60, but very strong, fit and active. I honestly can't see some of my age group friends having an easy time of this...so senior citizens, beware. On the plus side, it is a roomy vehicle and with all passenger seats stowed, I can fit a full sheet of plywood or wallboard,which is nice since I can haul this stuff even in bad weather. I also fit a full size couch in it. If roomy is what you need and you don't care about comfort and reliability (hahaha) then buy this van.",2

1921, on 07/02/17 14:48 PM (PDT),June Keck ,2014 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan Touring-L 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Good Family Van With Some Negatives," Owned a 2003 for 14yrs. So decided to go with another Town and Country. Got a 2014 30th Anniversary model. Has some advantages over the old girl: back up camera & sensors, rear cross-traffic sensors, blind spot sensors, improved acceleration and braking, great turning radius, stow-n-go seats, sliding doors are much improved, keyless entry, remote start. Has some disadvantages: the frame below the front doors hits me right on the ankle bone when I get in and out which is aggravating, transmissions shifting is a little rougher and I can hear a bearing noise when driving which might mean a rebuild down the road, seems to have more road noise as my 2003 T&C, sound system is definitely not as good as the 2003 T&C. My Biggest gripe are the tires, they suck big time. The tires on my 2003 T&C were Bridgestone Turanza EL42Bz. They were a little expensive when time to replace but well worth the price. Didn't matter the road conditions, they didn't lose their grip. The tires on the 2014 T&C are Michelin Energy Saver A/S. They are honestly one of the worst tires I've had on any vehicle I've owned. Braking is great as long as it's on dry pavement. If you have to take off quickly from a stop I chirp or spin the tires almost every time, even when trying not to. Horrible on rainy roads, not looking forward to winter. We'll be changing them hopefully to Bridgestone Turanza before winter if they have them in the new size. If not, probably will still change them, they're that bad. Dealership of course won't do anything to help with running boards or the tires.",4

It had just 36K miles on it .Comfortable to drive lotsa bells and whistles..Likes: ride, comfort, Auto Start and push button start, Heated front and rear seats and wheel, Lane change assist very helpful for blind areas in rear ,Rear power stow n go seat is power, Back up sensors,camera etc great for warning something is approaching, Stow and Go all seats makes for a lot of room for hauling stuff. Needs improvement: Navigation is Garmin Cant see it very well from drivers seat, slow to respond when you miss a turn, colors poor and hard to see in light, did software update and radio blew up, luckily Chrysler Uconnect covered it with new radio under extended warranty, maps outdated and limited ability, Nav not worth extra money nor updating maps which can be done usually every June from 3rd party company on usb for $150.00. Wipers have auto sensors and go crazy in rain sometimes wiping so fast you think there gonna fly off windshield. When lights on auto and come on at dusk the entire dash goes dark ...have to adjust interior light knob. Rear view mirror has all kinds of stuff rigged into it ..very small in size would like it to be bigger to see more. Vehicle came with a can of air and jack and empty cage underneath with no spare ! $255 to purchase on Amazon. Dealer way higher .Had a Class 3 Hitch put on vehicle for towing trailer which it does nicely. Overall good bargain for used vehicle. When shopping pay attention to options listed as these vehicles all have different options I found many of these used vehicle sales people have no clue about them and the dealers list options that actually aren't on the vehicle. Recommend you go online and research VIN for original window sticker which can be had for free and then check vehicle to make sure it actually has the options listed. Check underneath for spare tire ! Check to ensure all options are actually working before purchasing ..2014 was last  year Chrysler gave the longer warranty on the engine and transmission rust roadside assistance etc 5 yrs or 100K This is our 3rd Chrysler Mini Van and by far much improved over the 2001 model we still have.",4

I get 27 mpg overall.  I tow a 35000 lb boat with no problems - I have the towing package.  The heated seats and steering wheel are great in the cold weather here in Wisconsin.  I have no problems with snow, ice, and rain.  I just replaced the Michelin Energy Saver tires with Defenders.  These tires have better traction.  With the Energy Savers, I got a lot of tire squeal when I started up briskly to fit into traffic.  The Defenders do not squeal - I just go.  The 3.6 engine has a lot of power so I can get into traffic easily.  This is the best of seven Chrysler minivans that I have owned since my first one in 1988.  I have never had a problem with any of my vans.  I do change the transmission fluid every 30,000 miles and change the engine oil on this van at 4,000 miles.  This maintenance has kept my vans from repairs on engines and transmissions.  Now, with 85,000 miles on this van, it runs like new.  My new Michelin tires get me through the snow with no problem.

1928, on 12/09/16 09:06 AM (PST),Darin B. ,2014 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan Touring 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),The vehicle you buy for all the wrong reasons," The Chrysler Town and Country is awful in nearly every single way, right down to the stupid key FOB that makes you feel like a toddler every time you start the van (hint: it's built entirely out of plastic, even the part that goes into the ignition). There are only three reasons people buy this vehicle: 1. They are a die-hard Chrysler supporter or they are under the false impression that it and its sibling the Dodge Grand Caravan are the only way to support domestic jobs (the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna are both more American, according to parts origin, than the Town and Country). 2. They don't have enough money to buy a better van and get the same features. 3. They haven't done enough research to know that there are better options. We fell under the second category. Since we were buying used and the Odyssey and Sienna actually hold their resale value, the Town and Country was the only like-new used vehicle we could afford. After owning it for awhile, I wish we would have just purchased an Odyssey or Sienna with 100,000 miles. First and foremost, it is horribly uncomfortable. The front seats are adequate. Beyond that, you're going to be miserable. It is a traditions that the captains chairs in minivans are like a king's seat. In this vehicle, they're awful. This is because Chrysler wants to sell vehicles on lingo such as Stow N Go because they know they can't measure up otherwise. Stow N Go is convenient. However, it means the seats are thinly cushioned and oddly inclined so they can fit into the floor. The back seat is even worse. I'm 34 years old and I can barely get out of it once I sit there. It's like it sucks you in down hill, and you're stuck.  We have two rear facing car seats and have to put ridiculous amounts of padding underneath the seat for it to sit level enough. The lack of leg room in the third row makes it so, with the car seats, any passenger outside of the first row is going to be miserable. I can't peg it down to one particular thing (other than possibly too high of windows and black seats and trim, but the interior also feels like a dungeon, like you're trapped in some sort of cave. I drive most of the time and appreciate the seat controls and that the steering wheel moves up and down as well as in and out. Despite seemingly limitless driving positions, my neck always hurts severely after long drives. It's one of those vehicles where you just can't get comfortable period. On the road, the Town and Country seems to be relatively quiet and handles bumps decently. The handling isn't great. When I'm locked in at 70 m.p.h. on the interstate, I feel like if I had to attempt any emergency handling, we would end up in a pile of rubble.  My Mom, who has never had a panic attack otherwise, has a panic attack when she has to ride in the back of the van because it feels so dangerous. The transmission is clunky and has extremely hard shifts sometimes. The motor seems to be strong and runs smoothly. However, the fuel mileage is horrible. Don't trust the overly-optimistic information the vehicle gives you. Your mileage will almost always be 2-3 MPG worse than the van's information center tells you. Looks wise, the only uglier minivan is the Nissan Quest, but of course that opinion will differ from person to person. If you truly research it (and believe me, I over research everything), a minivan is safer than most vehicles. Therefore, the Town and Country overall is very safe. However, it failed miserably in the IIHS small overlap crash test. That type of crash is rare, but if it happens to you you'll probably lose your leg and maybe your life. I think about that every time I enter the van. Competitors such as the Sienna, Odyssey and the new Kia Sedona all passed this test. If you buy this vehicle, you will regret it. I know I do, every time I climb behind it's wheel. The only people who may like it are empty nesters who are only going to use the front seats. Anyone else who likes it is likely ignorant about the better options that exist.",1

Lifetime maps should be included even if it adds to the price.  It is a safety issue to not have up to date maps.  A reasonable price like $25 wouldn't be bad but I will not pay $149 + to update maps.  My TomTom has free map updates and only cost $89.  Also all available safety features should be standard.

Brought  car in for brakes system slipping on stop and feeling bad like they're not working  properly since December 2014. Brought car in again for the 10th time  as instructed by Chrysler Escalation Customer Service Dept.  they said brakes were perfect.  but breaks still slipping at a normal stop or  slow down at stop  signs and to slow down to make turns. Called customer service been dealing with them since last year in August I have had eight different representatives five escalation department representatives and nobody has helped me at all.  Engine runs very rough and starter legs at start and feels like it won't start randomly service dept  says can't be duplicated but it is happening constantly for me.

When you call Chrysler for help they just tell you to take it back to dealerships.  Chrysler Customer Service is not there to help you they are there to just keep giving you the runaround and tossing you to different people making you waste your time at dealerships trying to get it fixed until your warranty runs out at 36,000 miles my issues have been since I had 2000 miles on my car and now I'm at 21,000 miles on my car and still nothing is been fixed except for my power steering gasket and bearings.  At this point I'm at fear that my brakes will go out that is my opinion but everyone else seems to think that nothings wrong with my car except for me my husband and other people that I've had drive my car ask me what's wrong with your breaks so I know something is really wrong even though Chrysler in the dealerships are giving me a stupid feedback that there's nothing wrong one dealership says brakes are great a week later another dealership says rotors are warped another dealership says rotors are great  I want after that Kreiser says there is no warrantee for your rotors even if they go bad after four months from when you bought your car. So if your rotors are bad from the day you buy your car I was told by the Chrysler Escalation Customer Service Department tamara that if it is the rotors that were bad from the day I bought my car that I would have to pay the $500 to have them replaced. Chrysler will not cover the rotors even if they were poor quality or already bad the day you bought your car FYI",3

They don't tell you that when you buy the car.    What a rip-off.   What's worse is that you can only get firmware updates IF you buy the map updates - no other way.    This cost is never mentioned by the salespeople nor does it appear on the website or in the sales brochure.Reality check - You can buy a Garmin hand held GPS with lifetime maps and live traffic updates for less than the cost of an annual update on your Chrysler T&C.----------------WINDOW DESIGN FLAW -  Here's another thing I HATE.  The WINDOWS on the 2nd and 3rd row as well as on the tailgate are very DARK.  It's noticeable in the daylight but not a real problem.   However, at NIGHT - visibility is absolutely awful - you can barely see through the dark glass except in very well lit areas.   The engineers who design these cars should be forced to drive prototypes under dark conditions before manufacturing and releasing them for sale to the public.   Our two previous minivans - A Chevrolet VENTURE and UPLANDER both had tinted windows but they were perfectly fine at night - the Chrysler is not.UPDATE:  Having owned the car T&C for about 2 1/2 years, I am still very happy with it except for the two issues detailed previously.   Love the excellent daytime visibility through the big windshield and front seat windows.   The car handles well and we have gotten as much as 31 MPG on the road IF I keep the speed at about  60~65 mph.   Great engine, excellent brakes.   The T&C is a far better vehicle than its Pacifica replacement which feels much smaller and has too many gimmicky features and is overpriced.At 3 1/2 years, two other problems have developed.   After heavy rain and sub-freezing temperatures, the sliding doors have frozen up and could not be opened either by the motors or by hand for at least 15 minutes.     Also both key FOBS are failing.  One is almost useless - tailgate and slider buttons do NOT work at all and the LOCK/UNLOCK function works about 70% of the time.    Replacement cost including programming will be almost $400 for the two FOBS.   In the past, on 5 other cars, I have never had key FOBS fail.  The longest owned was 15 years and when I sold that car, both FOBS were still fully functional.",4

The back seats have headrests that angle forward, making about a 140-150 degree angle with the seatback. Additionally, they're about as receptive to human heads as frying pans and are not adjustable. One would think back seat comfort would be important in a car where buyers will almost definitely be buying the vehicle specifically for the purpose of having comfortable back seats, but alas, Chryster disagrees.

First thing I noticed the steering is now more precise and firm. A rearview camera has obviously been improved as images look much crispier.For me, the biggest complaint for the '13 model was a late shift from 3rd to 4th gear and back while in stop and go traffic which felt like a delayed acceleration. I drove several of these having the same issue. This is no longer the case, so obviously the engineers have made software adjustments and it now drives perfect.",5

The seats are rock hard and I just could never justify spending 30k on this vehicle. It does have great tech inside, along with a more than adequate engine for a mini van.

The van currently has about 217000. It has been very dependable. The only real issues have been the lining around the door  in the back has pealed on the right side and the left is just starting. This is causing wind noise to come in. Also the switch for the driver window broke. You can't just get a switch you have to replace the entire unit. Still looking for a good price.

I'm only 5' 9"" and I need to have the seat the all the way back and my legs don't rest on the seat. the rear seats are even worse for adults not tall enough and head rest in bad location. folding seats in to the floor is a great feature. no more dropping a nut for throwing your back out lifting and moving the seats and finding somewhere to store them. over all, I am NOT buying another one in the future. sad to say having the Chrysler badge on the front does not mean luxury. it means quickly and cheaply made. if it wasn't for the room I would have sold this darn thing about a week after buying it.",3

About a year into owning the van the engine light would come on.  A day or two later it would go off.  As the years have gone on if the van idles too long the next time I go to start it it won't start.  Now it just decides when it wants to start.  It's a computer problem with a cost of over $1000.   Other friends that have this van have the exact same problem.  One fixed it and it still has the same issue.  I don't recommend this van at all!  I'm looking to get rid of this one and go back to a Chevy product.  ***UPDATE...Still will never purchase another Chrysler product.  It's to the point during the summer that I can't even run my A/C otherwise the van won't start. I've taken it to numerous mechanics and no one can seem to find the problem. I've contacted Chrysler and they can't seem to help either.  This van is nothing but a joke.  I'll have to keep it a few more years due to having teenagers now driving but as soon as I can get rid of it I WILL!!!  I'll go back to Chevy.  I just if you're looking for a van find a Chevy or Ford product!  *****UPDATE 7/18/2017- This van just kept getting worse.  I could drive it then would have to let it sit for atleast 45 minutes before it would restart.   Each mechanic told me something different including dealerships that ""could possibly"" be wrong with the van.   I decided that if I was going to for out hundreds to thousands of dollars I'd rather put that towards another vehicle.    So a month ago I traded my piece of crap chrysler van in for a Chevy Equinox in which I LOVE.

The first time I had a problem was at 900 miles I was driving and went to push the gas after being stoped at a light and the car would not move . I had to have a tow truck come get my car . The second time this happened was only 4 days later and again my car would not go , I am told it is the solinoid. My first van was junk and this one is even worse, buyer beware !!

So, this is our third Chrysler/Dodge minivan since 1992, and the best yet. We have three children who come fully equipped with friends, pets, etc., and as they are learning to drive we wanted a safe easy-to-drive ride for them to learn on. The stellar safety record outshone others, especially Toyota, which was far more expensive for a less capable vehicle.

It started out wanting a SUV that could seat 7 or 8. We tried and driven many to always conclude that space comes at a premium with an SUV. To name a few such as the Journey, CX9, Veracruz, Pilot, Odyssey, sienna,Outlander,MKT,etc. No, a minivan was not the thing to do except when looking at it, it always had plenty of space. A showroom model of the T&C eventually convinced us that features with the options of Luxury made the decision. Stow and Go, power folding back seat, power doors and powered hatch, two Indep. video displays was the ticket for us. The real winner was a very acceptable price.

We needed a vehicle with more space and easy for the kids to get in and out of and our SUV just didn't have the room (or MPG) we were looking for and no crossover that we looked at could match the space and comfort of a minivan. We read the articles that talked about the quality of the interior but I love how it is designed and looks.

She wanted all the bells and whistles. Ended up with sirens in addition to those whistles.  Faulty door switch caused the car to go up in flames when it was a year old. Chrysler tried to do everything they could to shift blame but ended up doing a recall on all the Town and Countrys. They had a poorly designed switch. Next came the cylinder and another recall. At least the fire department did not have to be called this time. Not the van is going on six years old and there is a drive train issue... the drive train warranty is good for five. Overall quality of the car is poor.

2074, on 03/27/18 16:39 PM (PDT),Leon C. ,2012 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan Touring 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Fun piece of Machinery," I am the second owner of this 2012 T&C. I bought it with 118500 miles on it. It was in good shape but needed some TLC. The engine was misfiring on the #2 and #6 cylinder. Turns out that the head was defective from the manufacturer. They extended the warranty on that part to 150000 miles and since have replaced the head, no longer having misfire issues. The 3.6 Pentastar motor is a powerhouse except when turning right or left like when entering a freeway or taking off from not a quite complete stop like when the red light changes to green just before you stop. The engine idles rough and I will have that looked at. The transmission was shifting poorly due to the fact the previous owner never did a service on it. I had the trans serviced and it is working better but still takes awhile to shift down from the passing gear. I drive for a Rideshare Co. and put 350 miles on it a day, 5 days a week. Gas mileage couldn't be better at about 23 mpg in the city. I get great comments from my passengers about the seats being comfortable and the amount of leg room they have. Everyone loves to watch Anchorman on the DVD player. they think the electric sliding doors are cool too. Over all, this is my vehicle. It is in very good shape.

But they just didn't fit with our lifestyle. Four kids, two dogs, cargo space, towing and off-road capabilities (off the grid camping). The stow and go is a thumbs up, reclining second and third row also a big plus, in overall way better than the other brands i mentioned. My T&C is at 150,000 highway miles now and i expected the tranny to start giving me problems around 50-70,000 miles just because when it comes to Chrysler/Dodge for some crappy reason their tranny are just not that great. I still have warranty on it and i'm sure it will be covered 100% on hard parts meaning i have to pay at least 300 in soft parts ie oil, gaskets etc. I love the van and i'm hoping to keep it for a long time to come after i get the transmission fix.

Dollar for dollar, after much research, we found the Chrysler T&C to be the best value. Great interior, comfortable leather seats, wonderful Bluetooth and hands free system. Love the stow and go options for my 2 growing boys and 4 golden retrievers. Every time I miss my sporty 4x4 days, this mom is pleasantly surprised and reminded why we changed to a minivan. What a secret we minivan mamas have over the rest of those moms driving around in little cars stuffed with everything. And the safety ratings are great which are reflected in the insurance premium. We are an active family and I was able to stow and configure the seats to fit an adult kayak, kid's kayak, and kid's paddle board in the van WITH my boys, a cooler, beach chairs, and life jackets this summer regularly. Winter months have us piling our ski gear in the back and heading to the mountain. How nice it is to have so much room to work with! We bought this van with 36k miles on it, it now has 79k miles and the only maintenance (other than oil changes and tire rotations) is brake pads and a transmission issue that was under warranty. This is our choice for long distance driving, and we've seen 30mpg on those trips (2000 mile round trips). Now, Chrysler seems to be putting cheap parts in brake systems and u-joints, but we've only had to replace brake pads once in the 40k+ we've put on this van. Not so lucky on our Dodge Durango (u-joints, brake pads and rotors) or former Jeep Patriot (electrical issues that left me stranded several times) so I would expect that you could see these issues on any Chrysler once it reaches a certain age or mileage. All in All one of the only cars I would give a great review for. Fits a family's needs very well!*Update 6/02/16 At about 78,000 I started having a loud noise from the engine when I would accelerate. Took it in and they discovered that part of the transmission had actually cracked and come apart (the fly wheel?). After 3 weeks at the dealership and a tiny rental car, I finally got it back. Was happy to have the van back but began to question what other problems were ahead of me if this was just at 78k miles. The head mechanic said he had never seen anything like it in the 30yrs he's been there. Because I had traded in a Jeep Patriot at just over 100k miles because of several electrical issues (including a small fire) I decided maybe Chrysler cars are not my best choice for reliability after all of this. I no longer have the van but really miss the space and stow and go seats!",5

I cross shopped with Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyseey and only reason I picked this was for its entertainment system. Although it works as promised, it is difficult to use and almost impossible to operated while driving. I never do because it takes away too much of my attention, TOO dangerous.

The mini van offers the versatility of stow and go seats, tons of space for flea market purchases, great visability and a back-up camera. I don't like backing up a vehicle, so any safety aid helps me. We became first-time grandparents this year, so comfortable, safe seating is important. The DVD player is there to entertain. Must haves of heated seats and steering wheel warm my backside and hands quickly! The Town & Country  is no sportscar, but rides smoothly and I feel confident behind the wheel.

The options for the transmission are : Park, Neutral, Reverse, and Drive. There are no lower gears to assist in braking when driving downhill. On a recent trip, we were returning from a family trip to Pagosa Springs in southern Colorado.  When driving over Wolf Creek pass on Hi-Way 160, I could not shift to a lower gear when descending from the pass so had to ride the brakes to keep the speed down.  The brakes apparently overheated and each time applied a loud rumbling from the brakes occurred.  This is not a necessarily steep decline and is a well used Hi-Way.  I was very concerned and will try to avoid the Colorado mountain roads while driving this vehicle.CORRECTION:  I HAVE NOW LEARNED HOW TO DOWNSHIFT.  When the gear selector is in the 'Drive' position, tap the gear selector to the left to downshift and to the right to upshift back to drive. It is amazing that I did not know this feature even after researching the web and the drivers manual. It is an electronic shifting system.Now, I like the van but wish the NAV system was better much like the Jeep Nav and phone system.",4

We started looking at the Sienna because I wanted AWD.  Unfortunately, it lived up to my previous experiences with Toyotas.  When it comes to driving excitement, Toyota doesn't have a clue.  We had to push the pedal half way to the floor to get it to move, and even then the acceleration was pathetic.  The Honda was better, but for the money, I felt both Toyota and Honda interiors were just okay.  When I saw that I could get a fully loaded Town and Country for the price of an entry level Toyota, I was shocked.  I was also pretty impressed with the Napa leather quality in the Limited.  Sure the fit and finish is typical domestic with plastic interior parts that have uneven seams, but it was hard to argue with the price.  The acceleration is actually quite peppy for a mini-van as well.  My wife quickly fell in love with it, and we made a great deal.  My fears of quality came true one week after we bought it when the TV console developed a nasty rattle.  We took it to the dealer and they said, ""they are all made like that"".  Sad excuse, but they made a rubber gasket for it, and it seems to be better for now.  We don't seem to be getting the advertised gas mileage at this point, but it is a mini-van, not a Prius.  Our plan is to keep it for 3-4 years, and I think it will be more than adequate for that period of time as long as things don't fall apart.*Update: Over a year and a half into it now.  Wife still loves it, and we haven't had any major issues.  At a year old, opening and closing the sliding doors sounded like we were rolling marbles down the side of the van.  After fighting with the dealer a bit, they lubed them, and for now that seems to have worked.  The transmission shifts a little funky sometimes, but I plan to extend the warranty as long as we keep it.",4

Dodge/Chrysler has the van down to a science.  We have had several of these, and each time we get a new one, Chrysler has added the one thing I said, ""Gee this would be perfect if only it had...""   Example: More USB ports. Everyone has their own phone and on long trips they always need charging.  There are at least 2 in the back seat and 3 up front.  Maybe even more I don't see. If you remove and/or tuck in the seats, there is no reason for a suburbanite to get a truck.  It' amazing what fits in there.Only complaints: 1. The interior materials are very cheap looking, and just over all ""blah.""  It seems so flimsy I almost think it will crack.2. The Bluetooth.

The six before this had over 100,000 mile on them with no engine or transmission problems.  My 2002 went over 250,000 miles with no engine or transmissions problems.  My present 2014 has 45,000 mile on it.  It gets up to 31 mpg on the road and averages 26 mpg overall.  I love the spacious interior and the way it holds the road.  There are two things that are not to my satisfaction.  The sliding doors do make noise when I drive through parking lots over the small bumps etc.  The other is the chrome all over the dash that reflects the sun into my eyes.  I painted over the chrome and now love the layout of the dash with the readout for the vehicle speed.  I have the trailer tow package and have no problem pulling my 3200 lb boat.  The engine is powerful enough for this as well as getting up to speed and entering the highway on ramps.  You can't do much better in a minivan - great value for the price.  Reliable and comfortable and great on gas.  I get 27.1 combined gas mileage at this time.  (6/16/16).  I will  be getting new tires in November before winter.  I now have 56,000 miles on this van.  In November I will have around 66,000 miles and the tires will be worn out.  I still love this van and enjoy driving it.  What a great van!  The noise from the sliding doors has stopped.

Town and country is not a bad car, but notwithstanding some sprinkling of some technological features, it feels dated in many aspects.  The interior materials are so-so, the thin rear passenger seats are amusing.  But the biggest surprise to me was the transmission used on that car.   Even the AT transmission in 2009 Toyota Camry is more advanced and intelligent then in this ""luxury"" van.   The transmission has no hill grade logic at all.  Going up or down the hill or during the times when  engine braking would be beneficial it acts as all the old typical AT transmission do - it either doesn't do anything at all or  constantly hunts gears.  The engine power is adequate however and the ride is pleasantly comfortable and smooth.",4

The van was very comfortable. The reason I am giving it a 2 star is because of 2 specific reasons. Number one, is sometimes it didn't switch gears so smoothly. It only had 40,000 miles on it. I made the mistake of buying a car that doesn't switch gears smoothly. And believe me, if it's doing this at 40,000 miles it's not worth your money. Number 2 is because my friends fiancé happened to be road tripping with the same exact minivan (similar mileage) to Florida with some buddies and their alternator blew on the way back. We loved the stow and go seats though! As well as the technology in the van, although I didn't love the way the steering wheel technological controls were set up. Overall, it lasted us on our trip and was a smooth ride for the most part but didn't last her fiancé and his buddies so I don't think it's an investment to choose. I regularly drive a new Toyota Sienna for work and I would think the average person would get the better end of a deal with that or a Honda Odyssey (which my parents used to own).",2

I was extremely happy about this because I was driving a 2006 Dodge caravan at the time.  When I switched to the new Town and Country I noticed such an improvement in luxury and technology.  The immediate negative I noticed is how the dodge had a more consistent transmission.  The town and country had weird hiccups when changing gears.  It wasnt a huge issue but it was noticeable.   I drive a lot for work so the audio was a big improvement for me.  My personal car has bluetooth and a decent sound system.

The suspension mainly the front is light weight flimsy steal and all the components fail because this is a very heavy vehicle with light duty junk parts.  The windows will not work due to shorting out and you guessed it cheap window motors made in some third world country.  Tires are destroyed by this vehicles poor suspension.  Try a set a year!  The rubber seals around the windows will work loose and fly off down the road. You will pay dearly for gas!  The motor is loud and rattles.,2

2193, on 11/30/15 20:53 PM (PST),joseph humphrey ,1999 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan LXi 4dr Ext Minivan,My experience better than most reviews," I bought this used for cash when I needed something to transport my elderly father in a wheelchair. I also haul a lot of gear in my jobs as a freelance photographer and part time live sound engineer.  Other than std junk that needs replacing like starters, brakes the only issue has been some odd electrical quirks. The remote door control stopped working, not because of fob, but the onboard computer. The alarm would trigger about 1/3 of the time when entering. Finally gave up and pulled fuse on horn. Utterly boring vehicle to drive, but its a van. Mine way more reliable than reports suggest. I did run full synthetic oil and think that may have helped get 200K+ miles on it. You can haul a ton of stuff and it's fairly comfortable. The Infinity sound system is not bad at all. The 3.8 makes decent power. But it's a bit thirsty. With conservative driving I could only manage 20 mpg. maybe not terrible considering size of vehicle.  And for a minivan, I think this version looked pretty good. I like the curvy design better than the new ones.  I had some fancy SUV's prior to this and while they may have looked 'better' the van was ultimately more practical. Serously, way more usable space than  'midsize' SUV  I didn't enjoy driving it, but it totally fulfilled it's mission.year later update. The van is being stored in a garage at the family farm. It needs an alternator, but it still will be useful down the road, so I'm going to keep it. I stand by earlier review. Boring to drive, but comfy, tons of cargo space and really pretty reliable. I expect things like alternators and starters to need replacing. But never any major engine or tranny problems. It leaks a little oil, but does not smoke even with 200Kplus miles. But I take care of my cars. I replaced with a 2012 VW Sportwagen which I love. It's pretty much my dream car. Practical but a riot to drive. I always wanted a GTI but the wagon handles great. I have GTI sport suspension components ready to install. Sorry off topic.I can highly recommend the Chrysler van to someone needing that type of vehicle. Maybe not as slick as the Honda or Toyota, but you can pick em up used pretty cheaply. If you get one that was serviced properly they seems to last. I do think Chrysler unfortunately tends to build vehicle that seems sort of cheap and tacky, but I've been impressed by usefulness and reliablity of this van. My VW may be entry level, but it just exudes class. Doesn't have all the luxury features of audi, but every bit an nice of interior and ride.Same as before. Still parked. but I haven't sold or junked because it can still be useful when I get it fixed. Great vehicle for the intended purpose. I can't say I 'enjoyed' it, but I have no regrets on purchase. These can be had on the cheap. Even the new ones, as no one wants them. (which is too bad IMHO)Well, the van has sat now for nearly 3 years. I'm finally going to sell it for scrap. RIP. To paraphrase Tolstoy....'it was the worst of cars, it was the best of cars'. Boring to drive, tacky interior, but very practical, comfortable, cheap to own other than fuel consumption.  Still have no regrets on purchase. It was a tool that did the job.",4

It is a solid road vehicle, but when you need to pass or get extra power quickly - it will immediately gear down and give you the appropriate power and drive you need; better than any other vehicle I've owned.

The first thing to go wrong was the passenger sliding door.  It gets stuck sometimes and is hard to open. The wipers have a mind of their own and will usually come on when I turn on the blinker. The ceiling lining is falling down. The passenger window has come off track, but the window motor is still good. I recently took it for a diagnostic check and found that my 2 sensor and EG valve needs replacing. This was the reason that my ""check engine"" light was on.

After appx. $1000 in needed work it started to come around. Didn't last long, transmission went out to the tune of $2400. Had it replaced. One major concern from day one. The engine will shut down for appx. a second. If running at highway speeds it will restart. If very slow or stopped it will die completely. But it will restart immediately.

My wife is the primary driver and she loves it. This vehicle replaced a 2004 Pacifica, which I loved. After 30,000 miles, the only maintenance other than oil changes has been front brake pads. Visibility is much better than the Pacifica. We have the navigation system, the DVD system, the satellite radio, leather interior, and sun roof. Lease ends in May and my wife likes this van so much, she wants to buy it rather than get a new one.

After searching internet sources we settle on an 07 T&C with 15,000 miles. The day we went to see it a last minute check turned up the same model with only 5,000 on it. I was skeptical to say the least. It turned out to be a Chrysler exec car with 5,000 miles and still had the new car showroom smell. You can't fake that. We love it. Our other car is a Caddy Deville and while our van is not a Caddy, it is equally comfortable on long trips.

Air conditioner poblems from leaking inside to blowing all kinds of ways, the shocks are horrible they actually squeek with every little bump. I went to have them replaced but are on back order.

I just moved my daughter into her college duplex.  We had her things in storage over the summer, and I moved her things to the duplex.

Not only that, but there are no air conditioning vents in the back!! We had to get a clip fan from an autoparts store so my son wouldn't be so hot. Nobody warned me, also, that half of the van's value is lost in the first year, I paid 17k (+ some neg. equity) and a year later, I can't get more than 9k for it. 9!!! That's terrible.

The seat belts on 2nd row seating make it hard for people to get to the 3rd row seating. Probably because its a bench seat, but that was bad engineering on Chryslers part. The side view mirrors are manual. Hello this is the millennium. So is the clock, you have to put a pen in the clock to change the time. Again, I was rushed, wish I would've taken my time.

Note to Toyota - your stock tires supplied were horrible for winter driving.  Do you not know where the vehicles are being delivered to - hello.  Handling is a little sloppy but since we use it for highway not such a big deal.  Don't try to use this vehicle in the mountains.  On our first try, even though we used the shiftable auto transmission to slow the vehicle, the rotors warped after one trip.  The 4.0 liter motor is an improvement from our previous T & C - decent power and mpg.",3.25

Gave it to my son and we bought a 2013 loaded Chyrsler T/C with 50K miles. Bad decision. The van is lighter so it bobs over the bumps up and down and has a tweaky bouncing ride up front.  Then tranmission lines leaked and could not be tightened to they had to be replaced at 70K.  The 6 speed transmission always wants to jump up to the next gear with the lightest touch on the gas. I am always shifting it down and holding it in that gear so it won't keep upshifting. The battery died at 60K. One key fob died. The computer board died so every electronic device in the car plus the wipers and AC was on and off hundreds of times per day until we got it to the dealer.

When the car is new, the nav system (Garmin design) is super.  It doesn't have voice command function, but otherwise is very good.  Eventually, you'll want to update the maps and point-of-interest information with the latest.  Chrysler does not sell the updates, you have to go to the source - Navteq (now known as ""HERE"") and purchase the update for $149 (there is no lifetime update option).  That's the same for most nav system updates today, regardless of make and model of your car.  For all other makes and models, you just order the update at the Navteq website and they send you a DVD or other media and you apply the update yourself.  But, for the 2013 Town and Country equipped with the 430N radio with a code of RBZ (found on lower right hand corner of the radio faceplate), you are forced to go through a strange procedure where you insert a  USB drive into the front of the radio, initiate some commands via the radio menu and then the radio is supposed to write info about the navigation package to the USB drive.  You then plug that USB drive into your PC and the website analyzes the information (looking for what, is undocumented) and decides whether you need the update.  The problem is, many of the radios do not write the info to the USB drive due to some quirk in the radio software.  I had the dealer update the radio software to the latest level, but that made no difference at all.  Many calls to Navteq and a Chrysler support line got me nowhere.  Navteq says that the problem has been reported by many other owners and they sent reports to Chrysler, but with no response.  When I raise the issue with Chrysler, they again tell me that they don't sell map updates.  For the price of an update ($149), you can purchase a stand-alone unit from Garmin with lifetime free map and POI updates and not have to deal with Chrysler at all.",3

Maybe because its just very popular to be down on America these days.  But they're sadly mistaken if they think the Chrysler minivan is anything other than top notch compared to all other similar minivans.  When we looked for a minivan we looked at all manufactures and this van was clearly the best dollar value.  The options Chrysler offers as standard features is awesome and not even a comparison as foreign cars have become outrageously expensive in their base model form.  One critique I often read too is how long foreign vehicles last, and all I can say to that is any vehicle will last if you take care of it.  Our last Town and Country has 200k miles on it and still going strong.  Keeping it for a secondary vehicle too.",5

I convinced my very skeptical wife that a brand new 2013 T&C had to be decent automobile and that we'd be saving several thousand dollars by not buying Japanese.  I cannot tell you how much I regret this.  This vehicle is an absolute lemon.  The transmission is worse than anything I've every driven, it clunks into drive & slingshots forward with the slightest acceleration.  Chrysler is well aware of the issues, but refuses to fix.  The low tire pressure light will not turn off even though  nothing is wrong and the dash board's developed quite a rattle.  Dealer wants to charge a hefty diagnostic fee to remedy.  Update:  Was driving car with children to dance recital when van somehow goes into low power mode.  Low power mode means it only runs about 10 miles per hour and has no acceleration.  Luckily we were in the right lane of a very busy/fast road and were able to pull over and call for tow truck.  I had to force it into park at which time it made a huge banging noise.  Finally sold it to a dealer for $16,500 and bought a slightly used Japanese minivan from one of the leading manufacturers.  By the way, nobody wants to buy a used T&C for anywhere near Kelly blue book value.",2

UPDATE 6/2016So 40k miles in, still no real issues.  Complaints are still road noise and rougher ride (could be OEM hard tires however).  Fuel mileage isn't the best around town, but good power is a trade off.  Have an issue where the nav won't update, paid (yes paid, no free map updates) $150 for an update and the unit would 't accept it, Garmin couldn't figure it out and actually said to have the head unit replaced so they can inspect.  Still haven't had the time to do that so no word on how it worked out.  Bought an inexpensive HDMI media player that I could plug into the rear 110V power and use an IR extender so I can load a bunch of our movies I put on an SD card, so we don't have to mess with changing DVD's and Disney super long menu intros - so we love the media connectivity!  It'd be nice to be able to directly load movies to the HDD, but I'm sure that's to come.  Transmission: haven't had problems other than when using Econ mode.  Then the reverse to drive and vice versa are delayed and very hard.  Coupled with the very low 3-4 (I think) gear shift RPM and no torque, we usually don't use Econ and it's fine - use it for road trips and we get 1.5-2 mpg higher and don't worry about the low speed shifting so win-win there!  Stow-N-Go has been great, lots of extra storage on trips if the mid row is up, and rear seats can be configured for nice holding spots or jump seats, whatever way we want.    All-in-all very happy!",4

The engine is strong; the transmission too. But check underneath for suspension wear (tie-rods, etc.); have the alternator checked before you buy, and listen for power-steering pump sounds. Like most US cars, the headlamp covers get crazed; they can be polished down once. Unlike a lot of cars, the paint will last without peeling--avoid metallic colors especially silver. Electric windows are twitchy and you can't replace individual components--all or nothing. You can't attach a hitch; live with it. Take out the rear seat for a useful cargo carrier. Go over the car for mis-aligned panels which mean accidents. Change the oil religiously and this car will serve you. In 10 years I've replaced one radiator core, an alternator, a headliner, window motor, and a radio. The instrument panel is ok; it could use a tach, and check the fuel guage so you don't have to use the odometer. Fuel economy depends on care and highway speed.

The ride is pretty hard, but not much more so than my 2008 Sienna.  Road noise, acceleration and braking were similar as well, though the Chrysler has slightly better steering.  It's much nicer in every respect than the 2008-2015 model Chryslers I've rented, but hoping the new Pacifica is better.  By the way, it's just now on its second set of brakes in all those short trips, so I'm not sure what to say about reports of poor brake pad life--could be driving habits or could be theirs had a defect of some sort.

The electric system dies without warning, electric doors work sometimes (only one key entry on driver door), a/c has to be fixed every summer, drivetrain nothing but issues since warranty was up, goes through brakes every year because of faulty design.

After 2 years, I have just over 71k.  The only problems I have had were an issue with an engine head that was taken care of by Chrysler as a known issue (including extending the warranty on the redesigned head) and the rear blower for the climate control system is getting flaky on me.  Overall I love this thing!  the engine is POWERFUL and has lots of good low end torque.  I put a class 3 receiver on and I can tow 3500lbs with NO STRAIN.  MPGs are terrific.  Around town, when using ECON mode, I can get 20-22MPG.  On the interstate, I can average 29MPG.  If I use cruise control, and keep my speed to around 55MPH on the interstate, I can get 36MPG!!!  Stow and go is a game changer.  Frankly, it is the main reason I didn't go with Toyota or Honda.  Within about 2min, I can transform my 7 passenger family hauler into a cargo van, or any stage in between.  The backup camera is amazing and the stereo may be the best non-premium option stereo I have ever seen as an OEM build.  FCA really thought things thru with this design.  Starting in 2011, the internal redesign is gorgeous.  The previous version of this generation has an interior that reminded me of a 1986 LeBaron.  My 2 kids have plenty of space in the middle row captains chairs, but could have used some better cup holder options, as the only ones actually made for that row are at the bottom of the sliding doors, and cant be reached by small kids in car seats.  As for cup holders, there are 6 available up front (not including the doors)!  Plenty of storage (especially with stow-n-go).  Also the interior has green light bars in the ceiling that spread a nice glow at night that makes it far more comfortable for small kids who get scared in the dark.  Handling is great.  I only with it had a AWD option for winter weather.  If you take ECON mode off, this thing has some guts to it, and is at home doing 80MPH.  Acceleration is really good for a heavy van, too.  I personally think that this vehicle may be the best value available in America today due to its price, features, performance and versatility.",5

Yes, there are issues with parts such as a/c, sway bar bushings transmissions. However, we have owned these since 1987 & we have never had to replace a timing belt (They have chains), never any exhaust work, never any CV boots. Most parts are pretty reasonable too. Brakes jobs run about $200 per axle, whereas they cost about $700 on our Previa! It is critical to do preventive maintenance on these. Use snthetic transmission fluid & change it every 50K. Change your fuel filter too. Plugs, antifreeze & water pump should be done at 80K. We did our first brakes job at 78K & we sold it with 157K & the brakes were still good.

Told the door to shut (didn't matter which button was used.) The door would start to shut. About 1 foot from closing it would bounce back open. To get it to shut we had to get out and shut it manually. Then it wouldn't open. So had to manually open it. Every time we took it in, the Dealership said they couldn't duplicate it. They finally fixed one door after I videoed it. Of course the other door went out of warranty before I could get them to fix it. I do love the safety sensors on the doors.

Some cons are, that the column shifter is too big, it blocks some radio controls, and sticks out like a sore thumb.

I had previously owned a 1995 Town and Country van and the transmission went out at 90,000 miles.   They assured me that Chrysler had fixed the transmission and wanted to restore their reputation by warranting it for the life of the car.   They told me I would never spend another dime on transmission repairs.   So I bought the car.   At 45,000 miles the dealer told me the transmission cooler lines were leaking and wanted $490 to repair it.   Chrysler refused to cover this citing the fine print in my owners manual which doesn't include this part.   I asked the Chrysler headquarters how often this line starts leaking at 45,000 miles and they said they never heard of it.   And this was one of the $3000 in repairs needed to this van at $45,000 miles.   Needless to say, I will NEVER buy another Chrysler.   And you shouldn't either.   They do not hold up very well.

After purchasing it we put new yokahama tires H rated for that little extra security, all four brakes ,brake hoses , replaced plugs flushed coolant changed all wiper blades fixed the typical heater hose issue behind the exhaust manifold replaced the rear blower motor and changed the air filter as well as run nothing but Mobil 1 5w 20... I did this trying to start off with the van somewhat reliable so far I notice slight oil usage but considering the miles I'm not complaining it could be seeping from the rear main seal but not enough to make spots on the driveway. I bought an egr valve bc I heard that's a common failure but over all I think if you do good maintenance and replace parts as needed these vans can be great machines for a family. They are roolol affordable and just handy. We plan on dropping another engine and/or transmission in it and keep running it for a long time.

Including Swivel n'Go, and Walter P Chrysler Package. Well Our journey with it was OK. But it started to have issues I mean a lot of issues. Down to the point of it having a poorly made suspension. My families almost death experience was because of Chryslers poor engineering team. The story of this start in March of 2013 when my family and I were on our way to Myrtle Beach, SC for Spring Break. They trip was going fine for the first four hours of our trip but once we got around the Louisville, Kentucky area; we got a really bad shaking in our suspension so we pulled off at the nearest rest area. We checked all the tires to find that they looked perfectly normal and had no bulges in them. So we proceed to drive down the Interstate going about 75 MPH and all of a sudden it felt like the rear axle had fallen off the vehicle. The van goes immediately into a fish tale and luckily didn't flip over because at one point we were completely sideways going down the interstate. After the Van had come to a stop my family completely in utter disbelief get out of the van to find that our wheel had sheered off the wheel hub assembly. After a tow truck was called and the van was taken to the Chrysler dealership we found out that it was caused by a manufacture defect that wasn't able to take the load of six people and luggage; that the stress on the axle was to great. We no longer have this van and no longer feel safe inside a Chrysler product. We now own a 2013 Ford Flex SEL and it has taken us a lot more places with a bigger load with no issues. Anybody reading this review DON'T BUY THIS VAN Especially if you have kids. I recommend looking at the Ford Flex best car we have owned. Learn from our Mistake and don't buy the van.

2706, on 07/18/15 00:12 AM (PDT),Angela ,2008 Chrysler Town and Country Minivan Touring 4dr Minivan (3.8L 6cyl 6A),BUYER BEWARE!! DON'T BUY!!!," Run away as fast as you can from the 2008 Chrysler Town & Country Touring minivan.  We purchased this vehicle pre-owned in July of 2013 and we are currently in the month of July 2015.  Since we have owned the vehicle, we have had to change the front brakes 3 times and the rear brakes once, as well as, the rotars for the front braking system.  We use a 5w-20 Synthetic Blend oil and we are always needing to add at least 2 quarts before the next oil change. The minivan only has approximately 77,7xx miles. Which is still relatively low as far as mileage is concerned on a vehicle.  I called the dealership and I was informed that this is a common problem for the 2008 Chrysler minivan.  For some reason after it reaches 50K miles, the vehicle is designed to burn more oil; per Technician.  (What a funny man, right?) Anyways, since March of 2015 to July 17, 2015, our back rear top brake light bar stopped working and it caused our check engine light to trigger.  Of course, according to 2 major, well-known auto parts store that it is a Dealship repair. I was given the estimate of $200-$400 for a replacement part. Next the top radiator hose blew a nice, quarter size hole to the plastic connector piece. We weren't able to replace that piece, because it required the entire assembly to be replaced, which was very close to a $500 repair. I can not forget to mention all the squeaky noises the vehicle has during the winter months. Such as the dvd compartment area rattles and squeaks, something on the the passenger row door squeaks (similar noise to a torn cv boot). The plastic bracket that holds the sunvisor in place, has fallen out, because the screw appears to be stripped. The A/C blower fan was operating loudly. Once again, was informed it was a common problem for this type of vehicle and a $250 repair cost. The day before family vacation in May 2015, the cable for the passenger row door snapped. That was quoted at approximately $700 for THAT repair. Then today, as I was doing errands, the check engine light came on. I had a diagnostic test performed and now I have 2 more issues. 1) The ECM has detected that brake switch 2 is applied while brake switch 1 is open. 2) EGR position sensor rationality closed. Meaning The ECM is detecting EGR flow or movement when it is not expected. Probable cause: Failed EGR Solenoid, Failed EGR position sensor, & Failed EGR valve. Yes, another expensive repair. Estimate is between $200-$400 and we also have 2 separate recall notices, which neither have been repaired. The dealership doesn't know when the parts from the factory will become available and it could take anywhere from 3-5 years before the repairs take place. Unfortunately, this is absolutely the worst vehicle we have ever owned!!!  A disheartening factor is I was a previous owner of a brand new 2001 Chrysler Sebring. It was the best vehicle with very few problems. When we decided to purchase the Chrysler minivan, I was elated. I was certain we had made a great choice based on my previous experience. I was so wrong on so many levels.  Sad to say, but with relief, we will no longer purchase another Chrysler!!  I'm looking forward to a much better, less stressful experience  that will not become a money pit witin 2 years.",2

No blue smoke, not leaking on floor. The first week we owned it the EGR valve went bad. The brakes are new so haven't replaced them yet in 6 months. Seems to wear the tires pretty quick. Sounds like a wheel bearing is going bad lately. The interior has some cheap spots as the handle for the gear shift fell off as did the sun visor.

This vehicle only has 90,000 miles on it. Too say this vehicle has been nothing but a stress would be an understatement. It has since purchase spent on average every 3 to 4 months in the shop for major fixes of one sort or another. Now struts. What are the odds if I just hold out these too will be recalled? argh!!!!!! A warning to anyone considering buying this vehicle used, do not Purchase. The only reason I have not sold or traded this vehicle in is I refuse to pass this lemon on and void the Lifetime Powertrain Warranty. Chrysler is gonna honor that for life and I'm not gonna let them off the hook for putting out such a piece of crap product by selling this POS to some poor unassuming sap who doesn't know better. :( :( Never will I buy another chrysler product and I have been a faithful chrysler owner for over 20 years.

Chrysler cant fix the problem because they cant reproduce it during test drives, even though the vehicles monitoring system returns several error codes. The dealer and manufacturer dont want to throw parts at the problem and are unable to do anything else to fix it.  Efforts to resolve this issue through Chrysler's Impartial Service Group have been ineffective.",1

My husband has a V8 Nissan Titan and hauls a huge gutter machine in a 16ft covered trailer to the city every day and gets better gas mileage than my van. I am paying more for gas to ride the kids around for their nap during the middle of the day than my husband uses for work all day. It is insane! I can't even believe how bad it is, I thought someone was siphoning my gas. After reading the reviews I can say I haven't had any problems with the electronics yet, but my brakes went out at 16,000 miles too. Just like others here. I was told it was because I was a bad driver. Yah, with three little babies in the back seat, I am so wild and reckless, right? OMG!",3.125

By and large we like this vehicle due to its design, great versatility, its strong performance, and many nice features.  I was disgusted to have to change brakes and rotors at 17K then pads again 6 months later.  Scary when the computer went AWOL 4 times  Suddenly the lights were flashing, the horn was honking and the windshield wash squirting then the doors opened and closed, then locked us out.  I am worried for the future because the transmission clunks when it shifts into 2nd under no load or if you try to accelerate just as you come to a stop.  I will likely not buy another Chrysler because the company and its dealers just don't stand behind their products, they make excuses",3.625

I could probably drive it another 50k miles but the deals on the '09 300C are just too good to pass up. I'll be saying good-bye to my LHS tomorrow when I turn it in for my new 300 hemi.

I expect to drive it for at least 2 more years.  To avoid a new car purchase, I recently detailed the interior and ordered $400 worth of replacement trim, including the hood molding and a pair of speakers to replace the blown front right woofer.

Plenty of power for the freeway passing and dusting kids in lil toy cars like Hondas. Smooth but noisy and bumpy on bad roads, almost rides like a sports car and feels better in high speed corners than my Charger R/T. Gas mileage for me has been very poor really, about 16- 20 average.

Comfort is second to none, although road and wind noise is a bit sub-par.

It started 3 times then the battery cables were shot. It had power surges before I had it fixed. The motor is really good only because I can fix the car when it breaks. The A/C leaks on the floor of the interior. Thats because of a blocked vent. Easy fix. The heater doesnt work at all and costs too much to have fixed. ,2.875

Bought it with about 25K on it. Super comfortable seats, very roomy, my passengers are always very impressed with the comfort of the back seat. Huge trunk.

I did all of a sudden have problems with the paint, starting on the roof and it deteriorated fast.

BWas told by the body shop the problem I have was only with certain colors being affected by the sun uv rays.  Don't want to give it up, but am going to have to decide if it's worth the cost of the paint job.  Hate to give it up. Great car, so right now I'm undecided.",5

This auto looks classy from inside and out, you would never know it was 10 yrs old from the design. Rides great, and definitely comfort was in mind when they designed the interior. The only thing I am finding wrong with this auto is the gas mileage, I average about 13 in town and 21 on the highway.  This must be just my auto though because the other posts here say they get around 20 in town? This is one great looking auto and the ride is smooth and soft.",4.625

Ten cars later, I couldn't get this LHS out of my mind, so I bought one with 100,000 miles on it last month. New tires and $2500 in mechanical repairs made it just like I remembered it.  Too much? Sure, but I LOVE THIS CAR! It's a dream to drive, the seats are comfortable, the cabin is huge and so are the moon roof and trunk. The styling is timeless.

On top of this, the gas mileage was better than I or most people thought it would be.  The car was reliable and I enjoyed driving it quite a bit.  I had to give it up when the expenses to repair it were more that its value.  Shouldn't complain....it had 221,000 miles on it at the end.  It was a great car.

Oh, one minor nuisance is that the gasket on the passenger door occasionally slips off track. The car runs perfectly on regular gasoline. We have it serviced regularly at Dover Chrysler.

I had expected the interior to be a bit quieter on the Highway given that this is a lux sedan - but folks share that when I change the ORM tires out (about another 30K miles) that will change. No wind noise to speak of which was a big improvement over the last auto. Even today it still is a sharp looking auto -  haven't seen anything else that zings me to trade it in.

Just replaced the 3rd radiator. First clutch went out at 20,000 miles and Chrysler would not cover that because they said it was wear and tear.  No I don't ride the clutch, either. The vehicle weighs 3300 pounds and drives and feels heavy, in fact it has a truck chassis. i just bought a top of the line Toyota Avalon 2015 that weighs about the same as the little PT.  Expect the PT to have  a very poor turning radius, but comfortable inside.  Very disappointing gas mileage for a 5 speed, I never got better than 21-23 in the city, I expected better.  Overall I have spend more on repairs and rental cars over the years than I paid for this car, keeping the car only because I had no other options.  Just spend over $2000 on a timing belt (I just have 120,000 miles) and another $450 on a radiator, the third one.  I guess I'm a glutton for punishment.  Some things I do like, the back seat folds down and the storage capacity for a small car is excellent.   If your considering this car, I would totally stay away from the 5 speed at any cost and keep in mind the older model cars (like mine) have timing belts instead of timing chains, much more expensive to replace, so make sure you check that out before buying any PT model.",1

Had for just 5 months. In that time, the 1st time we turned on the a/c the car would shudder/stumble and then almost stall. They replaced the compressor. After that, it did the same thing (which they said was normal, ha!), but then it didn't even blow cold. They replaced the fan control module. Then the lower control arm bushings needed to be replaced. And now the car is going out of control in traffic! Step on the gas, it doesn't kick into gear, and when it finally does go, the power steering goes out and you're lucky you don't die! But the dealer gets no codes and it test drives fine, so it MUST be fine according to them. NOT!",3

You can't see traffic lights if you are the first car because of the sloping roof. The seat feels like you are on a bar stool and about to fall off, and is so narrow you have to sit on top of the bolsters, and I am thin! Front end drags when you hit the slightest dip. When cornering, tornado effect throws all loose items around car. Passengers usually complain of motion sickness. If something falls off the seat you will have to pull over to retrieve it. If you try to get something out of the passenger floor, the seatbelt will stab you in the ribs quite painfully. The removable seats are so heavy you can't remove them, or but them back.

Difficult to handle on the highway which wasn't a problem in beginning. Met other 2006 owners who travel a lot experiencing similar problems.

The headlights are bright, unlike our Caravan. The local gas mileage is at 18. Highway, well I've travelled across state once and the mileage wasn't much better. Probably due to the fact I couldn't contain myself. The car is a pleasure to drive. The mid-range acceleration is so smooth and quick. Yikes!!! Maybe the next road trip I'll set the cruise.

A crack in the dashboard (which was completely preventable had I only bought a dash cover), both hydraulic pistons which hold up the rear lift gate need replacing, The headliner is just now slightly peeling back from the front window edge, and the cruise control failed which is caused by a module which Chrysler has known for years was faulty yet continued to produce and install in many Chrysler models including its mini vans.

3084, on 01/20/16 18:25 PM (PST),Brent ,2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser Wagon Limited Edition 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Love/Hate relationship with my Cruiser," I bought this car from a coworker after some financial difficulty forced me to get rid of a car with a payment.  I paid $1500 for it, so thankfully I didn't spend much up front.  The previous owners had not driven it for a few months, so they put a new battery in it for me.  For the first few months, I really had no complaints.  The car definitely showed its age (it was 11 years old with about 120k miles on it when I got it), as the interior was pretty worn out and the bumpers were faded, but overall the car looked good for its age.  I noticed one day that my air condition started blowing hot and looked at the dash and saw my car was overheating while sitting at a stoplight.  Took it to my mechanic and he replaced the radiator, after telling me that I should probably get rid of this car, as they are notorious for radiator and cooling system issues.  I wish I had taken his advice.  I'm currently on my 5th radiator, and I've had the thermostat, the radiator cap, the fan, the fan switch, numerous sensors and wirings, two batteries, new tires, and an alternator replaced.  The car still overheats, and I have to keep antifreeze with me at all times.  My mechanic believes it's leaking out through the head gasket, so it's most likely torn to shreds.  The A/C went out completely last summer, and the compressor has a massive hole in it.  I've spent about $5000 on a $1500 car to keep it running.  Now, for the good things.  Honestly, I enjoy driving my car.  It's comfy and roomy.  I drive in town and on long drives (1+ hours) and my legs don't get tired like if I'm driving a car.  I enjoy that it sits up a bit higher than most cars, so it's much easier to get in and out of each day.  It's quite fun to drive, and has plenty of power for a car it's size.  The car has tons of extras and options, like a moon roof, PW/PL, tilt/cruise, premium radio, and heated seats (which is super nice in the winter).  It's not loud driving it on the highway, and it drives very smoothly.  It handles snow and ice like a champ.  I am looking into getting a more reliable vehicle quite soon, but in a way I'm sad to get rid of my little headache of a car.  It's not very reliable, but in so many other ways, it's a perfect fit.  Be wary buying a used PT Cruiser.  They have lots of issues among all the model years it was produced.  If you need a reliable daily driver and don't have time or money for frequent repairs or breakdowns, I'd avoid it.  If you're looking for a fun car to drive or as a second car to play around with, go for it.",2

The things I have had done since I have had it: 2 radiators, 2 coolant fans, new wheels because they were leaking and causing my tires to go flat, shocks, timing belt, brakes, head gasket, fuel pump, water pump, thermostat (engine overheats, AC broke, fog lights wouldn't go out (removed the fuse box), hatch broke twice.

Oil drain plug was way to tight and had to beat it loose and rubber seal on plug was gone.

The stereo speakers sound nice and my stereo came with the AUX input so I can connect my phone to stream my Spotify playlists. The interior is gray so it can get dirty at times although I don't struggle with keeping it tidy.  The only things I would have liked to see on this car would be better fuel mileage (I average around 24 in city and 26 in highway) and it can have loud cabin noise whenever I have to drive on train tracks.  As for repairs, I've only had to replace all my brakes since it made a screeching sound but if you keep it on constant watch, it'll take care of you!

Regular maintenance (especially changing the timing belt every 100,000) is important with any car, and this one is lasting because of it.  Fuel mileage could be better for a car that has a 4 cyl, but overall it isn't bad.  Has just enough power to pass and accelerate aggressively, but isn't overpowered by any means.  The transmission shifts smooth and crisp and the ride is what you'd expect from a smaller car.  It's not had to have any major repairs outside of regular maintenance and basic wear and tear stuff that goes wrong with every vehicle.  I've seen many reviews stating that these cars chew through brakes, but that's not the case with mine...I believe driving style has more to do with that than anything else.  The rear doors open farther than any other car I've ever owned and getting in and out of it is very easy, almost like getting into a small SUV.  With all the positives are some negatives.  Mine does have a little shake to it between 45 and 50 MPH, and the turn signal lever has caused me to flash my bright lights at a few people.  Overall though, everything about this little car has been up to par and well exceeded my expectations.  I will be buying another one of these when I need another car.",5

My explorer again could hold a tight curve much better, and the turning radius was tighter. However, the car looks cool, with nice amenities. For replacement, I will be looking at the Kia soul or forte, or the Hyundai elantra touring.",3.25

In town it has excellent flingability. On winding roads the brakes could be more powerful and the handling less flexible.  Unfortunatly, I paid a premium price for a car that, aside from the drive train, only has a few extras (and leather) over the base model. No, I wouldn't buy it again, but on the whole its been a good deal thanks to the premium extended warranty.  Despite low mileage, the turbo eats CV joints and there have been other early, more minor, mechanical failures.  Gas mileage, highway and city, is unacceptably poor.

I have a 96 Voyager with the same 2.4 4 cylinder and 3 speed auto, and it gets better mileage in town than the PT. I only have 6k on the PT, so maybe it will improve. My wife wasn't crazy about the PT at first, but she drives it all the time now. I think when we finally get rid of the van, we will go with a ragtop PT. Seating is up high, with a good view of the road. The seats are a bit hard, and get somewhat unconfrontable on long trips, as there is no lumbar adjustments.  Otherwise, this is one Red Hot PT that rocks!",4.5

This car is not user friendly when it comes to roadside emergency. the way the engine is set up, its almost impossible to simply replace a tire under an hour. the spare tire retainer is bolted under the car that must be accessed from the trunk. If you ever wanted to replace your spare tire with a full sized tire, the retainer is far to small.  The thermostat retainer is very poorly designed. Chrysler has made it in such a way that its almost necessary to remove the intake manifold rather work around/under it. When the thermostat seizes -- rather than have a high-pressure release, it will just rupture a hose (usually the smallest near the air filter.)",4

Better yet, they have an exchange policy that allows you to get the new parts up front and return the old ones for a credit.

I took it to my mechanic, he tinkered around with it, but said it wasn't his area of expertise and he was going on vacation. The next day the air conditioner went out. I took it to another mechanic and it was the compressor, of course, and cost $1200 to fix. By contrast, the air on my 96 VW just went at 15K miles! And, I still haven't fixed the top.

If they could improve the fuel economy even a little it would make this car the best in its class.  Having the Glove Box lock and unlock with the doors would be a really nice feature. ",4.625

We can't seem to get a remote to program, but are content to unlock the passenger door and use the electric lock function to open the doors. The car's only problem since we purchased it is a sticky ignition that sometimes locks up. Other than that, no problems. The car is comfortable and performs reasonably with the 4OD transmission. There is a ton of cargo space and the interior configurations are amazing. It's great around town and great on the highway, cruising nicely at 70-75. It's tight and there is virtually no wind noise.

3379, on 09/14/15 17:59 PM (PDT),Kimberly ,2001 Chrysler PT Cruiser Wagon 4dr Wagon (2.4L 4cyl 5M),"The design is poor, not a good snow car"," My ex got this car used, at about 100k miles, for around $4k. From the beginning, I noticed that it seemed to have very poor suspension, and within a short time period the control rod and the tie rod ends started to fail on it. The car is now at 143k miles, and while the engine in it is still excellent and in good shape, the real Achilles heel of this car was its design. It was made for looks, and for mild climates; it's not made to last. The giant rear end on it seems to have proved too much for the frame design. The control rods went out twice over the 43k miles we had it: the suspension and ride were terrible, like a crackerbox really, and now that I'm dispensing with the car, the ball joints have failed, the tie rod ends (again), the CV joints have failed, all in the back of the car. Once it gets older, a bumpy road can cause steering to be tricky. The steering often pulled to one side, and the electrical system was also glitchy, failing several times in the rain, along with dead brake lights from time to time. I really don't recommend this for snowy climates. It's very bad in the snow; there isn't much clearance under the front bumper and it had a tendency to get stuck pretty easily. The high profile didn't handle wind well.As others have mentioned, the rims had a constant tendency to peel, and the tires lost air constantly. On the upside, it had good gas mileage and it never did break down completely on me. It was a dogged car, a good engine in a poorly made body, and if you're a car type in a warm climate who has the time and inclination to fix its little foibles I'm sure it might even be a good deal. The engine is still just cherry in it, it goes at a nice clip once it gets going. I don't hate this car, but it's been very expensive and troublesome mostly due to the frame, electrical and tire issues.",2

First of all the gas mileage on the PT Cruiser is a joke. It is a Chrysler so it has a plastic cheap looking dashboard but it doesn't look too bad. It has no front center console or rear folding center console for rear seat passengers. The back seats are uncomfortable because they are very straight and not reclined back. The rear power window buttons are basically on the ground so anything on the ground can roll the window down without you knowing. Other than those its very nice. ,4.125

My only complaint is that I keep my cars a long time (10 to 12 years, over 150,000 miles) and my little PT isn't holding up to age like I'd hoped. The wheels are a chronic problem for mine and several others I know. They corrode from the inside out and lead to slow leaks in the tires. The chrome peels away if the wheel is fixed. Radiators also seem to be a common problem. Body trim is popping off. So while I love my PT, Tom just isn't aging as well as I'd hoped. ",4.5

The engine is well suited at 150 HP to motivate our 4 speed auto PT just fine, low R.P.M. torque is pretty standard for a 4 cylinder car.

So far Pros:  Stick shift has great pick up and very fun to drive. After 9yrs of driving this car, the seats are still super plump and comfortable and offer plenty of back support. The back seats are very simple to remove so I can haul an amazing amount of stuff. My gas milage seemed to improve substantially after I broke in the engine over time. I've gotten as high as 27mpg hwy and as low as 19. I thought this car was a tin can in the beginning and considered it to be a temporary car for me, but to my surprize...it's really held up pretty well for such an inexpensive car.Cons: So far I've had to replace the cam shaft, hub bearings, clutch and the fan under hood. Needs the starter replaced or ignition switch...not sure which. Oxidation on roof only. Claying and waxing helped make it look a bit better. I have noticed so many cruisers have this paint failure problem. Not sure if there is a recall on the exterior paint. If there isn't...there should be.I clayed the exterior and waxed it.

Sliding doors will open when car is placed into park, liftgate does not want to stay open, blind spot indicators are intermittent, power windows are intermittent, transmission does not want to come out of parking gear, cannot adjust brightness of the dash lightsor the interior lights.

The Mopar voice connect is not great often not recognizing what you say and navigation is a bit off when compared to navigation with your phone. Don't get or add the Mopar wireless charging station as it requires you to then get a new case for your phone for it to work, they offer one free but then you would pay around $45 for another case unless you wanna switch back n fourth with you spouse. Second is that the cases only work or fit specific phone types and we have Moto G phones and they won't work. It just isn't worth it and the charging plate is far down on the floor of the car, honestly it is easier to just plug in with a USB cable. I love the triple pane sun roof, get it if you can, the hands free opening of doors is great. Not sure on cost savings for hybrid charging vs. just gas usage. With the included 110v charger it does take about 13 hrs to fully charge and gives you about 30 miles. The third row back seat could be a bit cramped for longer legs except for the middle seat. My 3 yr old likes the video aspect but it is too hard for him to reach controls for the other touch pad options on it unless we move the seat forward but then his legs get smooshed against the back of the front seat. If you can, order urs from factory with the 18"" rims etc because if you want to switch from 17's to the 18's after the fact it will cost about $425 per rim alone to do then you have to buy new tires too!

The interior rivals that of a high end luxury vehicle and the technology is second to none. We can even remote start the van through an app on our smartphones! The trip computer is telling me that we are averaging 48 MPG on the gas engine, so even if you run out of electricity the van is extremely fuel efficient due to the hybrid technology. This is my first Chrysler product that I've ever owned, but I'm seriously thinking about buying another after owning this for a month.

Your mom and dad drove minivans, but let me tell you, this is not their family hauler. We started out looking to replace our Honda CRV. Convinced by the 2018 CRV reviews, we were pretty certain the color of the replacement was the only choice we had to make. Then a Pacifica advertisement caught my wife's eye. First, we read the full Edmund's review. Convinced, but skeptical, we went shopping. At first, we zeroed in on the gas only version, then switched over to the plug-in hybrid. In what seemed like no time, we were sitting in front of the finance manager, anxious to get the keys! Here is what we love: quality materials inside and out, beautiful and logical instrument panel, noiseless drive train, excellent torque (aka ""pick-up""), smooth/quiet/solid ride, extraordinary visibility, easy in and out, unbelievable mileage (the 30 mile range on the electric motor alone equates to10,950 miles/year!), incredible storage, hands free rear doors and tail gate and, although the price tag isn't cheap, the cost savings on annual fuel bills offsets the upfront price considerably. Here's what could better: the second row seats could be a little softer, the tires are a Korean brand - Nexen (stay tuned on these); and the frequency of repair and re-sale value have yet to be determined. All in all, the Pacifica's a home run, if not a grand slam. We love it and seeing the CRV in our Pacifica's rear view mirror!",2

This van is a joy to drive. Limousine like comfort with all the doodads. I purchased the subtle red with a beautiful mocha interior that rivals any luxury car.  The seats are perfect for the mid size male. The height adjustment for the drivers seat barely suffices for the 5ft tall female driver.  The lack of a memory drivers seat is a minor nuisance. The visibility is superb for such a large vehicle.  The driving dynamics and the hushed sound levels and the comfortable ride make it the ideal vehicle for the over 65 tweeters who schlepp around their 90 year old parents as well as their adult children and grand children. The EVT transmission and the range blow away the gas only version. You will need to install a level 2 charger in your garage to get the most out of this vehicle.  I am getting 34 mpg in combined city and highway driving. The infotainment system is second to none. I think this vehicle is a game changer and puts Chrysler back on the map. A great Uber Black Vehicle if one is so inclined. I am 65 and this is probably the last vehicle I will purchase. It exudes competence, excellent build quality, esthetics and comfort.

With the federal and Colorado tax credits and the mfg. and dealer discounts the car only costs me a total of $310 per month on a 36 month lease. With gas savings its even better.

The car weighs 600 lbs more than my old T&C but actually feels lighter, more responsive, and quicker. A delight to drive. The car is very quiet but road/tire noise and ride quality are similar to my old T&C (which is good). Wind and engine/transmission noise are non existent.  Handling and acceleration are much better. Its impressive that they were able to improve the handling while not degrading the ride quality. A Level 2 charger is a must though (15+ hours vs. 2.5 hours to charge). So you need to install 240 volt service in your garage (added cost). The seats are a little to firm (my 2005 T&C front seats are more comfortable). The lack of Stow-N-Go 2nd row seats is a noticeable loss but an acceptable trade off. The dial shifter is awkward as is the Homelink in the visor (minor issues). The interior is quite luxurious (not a good as a German car but good) The touch screen is very good and the various entertainment and driving aids are excellent. The 33 mile electric range (I've actually gotten better) with a Level 2 charger covers 90% of my driving so its almost as good as a pure electric with the benefit of being able to drive long distances. And it can carry a 4x8 sheet of plywood! The combination of luxury, utility and efficiency(and eco-friendly) can't be matched by any other vehicle. If they fixed the few issues mentioned above and increased the electric range to 50+ miles this vehicle would be perfect.",5

I go weeks at a time without stopping for gas and average 75-80 mpg local driving. Using a/c and heat cuts down on the mileage. The electronics makes you aware of maintenance needs and cars performance. The second row of seats pop out and with the third row down i fit 2 twin mattresses and box springs and frames with room to spare. My only glitch seems to be the control panel screen goes out occasionally and I have not had it back for service yet to get it checked out . Would liked to have had the memory on front seat position. The driver assist features are great. I don't see any significant change in my electric bill.,5

As of today the government website, https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml   shows only the 2017 model with a tax credit.  The dealer misled us if we don't get the tax credit.(2) No driver memory seat even in the Limited model - pain when drivers need different seat & mirror settings(3) The ""REAL"" hybrid mpg once the stored electric charge is depleted after ~35 miles, is ~30 mpg with a mix of freeway and city(4) Tailgate opening height is not adjustable like the Odyssey - tailgate intentionally opens high for tall people and will likely hit the garage door when parked inside and then automatically close(5) Many of the controls are embedded in the display - in some cases would have preferred actual switches(6) The 120 volt charger that comes with the car will take 14 hours to charge fully depleted batteries.  Will need to spend ~$600 for a 240 volt level 2 charger and have someone do the wiring for a quick 2 hour charge. (7) Very limited on storage compartments.(8) Mixed reviews on the 3rd row seat head rests and access.  (9) The driver seat is not comfortable for short folks, edge of seat hits in the back of the knee joint(10) The U-Connect display has failed 8 times in two months, so far display recovers after ignition is turned off for a period of time.  Failure modes include (2x) totally blank non-functional screen (ironically back-up camera display still works), (1x) back-up camera locked on and did not turn off when driving, (1x) vertical blue and white strips - could see icons but couldn't select, (4x) display asked for radio security code blocking rest of display. THE GOOD:(1) Handles well, nice interior and exterior design(2) Looks like we will get the CA environmental $1500 rebate and qualify for a CA green HOV sticker(3) UPDATE 7/2018 - We received the Federal $7500 tax credit, a CA environmental $1500 rebate check, $400 from SCE and the HOV sticker.  (4) UPDATE 7/2018 - After multiple visits to Chrysler dealers and communicating with the Chrysler U-Connect rep - after 6 months Chrysler replaced our radio which had been frequently failing.  Chrysler installed a refurbished replacement radio and we have had no further problems.  In addition Chrysler gave us a reasonable cash compensation for our inconvenience with the radio.",4
3648, on 11/23/15 00:25 AM (PST),B ,2000 Chrysler Cirrus Sedan LX 4dr Sedan,I regret buying this car.," I bought this car back in April 2015. 2000 Chrysler cirrus. With 193,000 miles on her. It is now November 23 rd 2015 and I'm ready to drive this car into the river and let the fish make it their new home. When I first got it we had to replace the sway bar, then the tie rod end in August. Come mid to late October the car starts cutting off. Everything dropped to 0 the transmission would jerk and she was back firing and missing pretty bad and I had about 20 seconds to get off the road before she cut off. But she would start right back up and go again.  So I had several different mechanics check it out. The fuel pump had gone out so we replaced it and put spark plugs in it. The car still shut off again but this time nothing dropped to 0 it just straight cut off, and the missing and the back firing stopped  It didn't matter if I was in a intersection or on interstate doing 75 mph ( I had both happen)  so we replaced the manifold air intake censor and the map censor and she did great this morning going to work but coming home she cut out on me again but did not turn off. They said next thing to replace is crank censor. Sooooo before we started replacing things, I looked up this car and read issues with it etc. so basically from all the posts I've read, around 200,000 miles the computer chip screws up. I can't tell you how many posts I read trying to figure this out. Those folks replaced everything and some including the computer and it still didn't help. Soooo I'm going to replace the crank censor if that doesn't help. I'm getting rid of this car. I can not afford to put a computer in it and I only paid a 1000 for this car I've put a 1000 into it. I'm a single mother and i can't afford to keep doing this. If anybody out there has a solution please let me know.  [contact info removed] I'd greatly appreciate help. I'm really sick of sitting on the side of the road or taking a bus to a certain place and having to walk the rest with a 1 year old. I just for once would give anything to drop my baby off and get to work on time and not have to worry or beg someone to pick my baby up and take us home. Thank y'all. Love and light to you all.",1

I am having a tuneup done on it to see if that will fix the problem but I'm not getting my hopes up.  The parts for this car are very expensive and you have to take out the entire engine just to get a tuneup done.  Stay far away from this bucket of junk and buy a Toyota Corolla or Chevy Prizm.

3677, on 06/10/18 17:23 PM (PDT),Chuck ,1999 Chrysler Cirrus Sedan LXi 4dr Sedan,Great little ride," I bought this car a year ago from a college student who had just graduated.  It was given to her by her grandfather and had extremely low mileage but lots of bumps and scrapes from shopping carts, nothing major.  It was advertised low mileage 67500 but that the rear power windows did not work, knowing a thing or two about cars this did not scare me at all.  She was asking $2300 I drove it on a short run and offered her $1900 she took the offer so rapidly that it scared the crap out of me, thought something has to be wrong with this car.  After a year of part time usage it now has 73,400 and runs like a top, no problems just yet, but I'm afraid to brag as that will certainly bring the bad luck gods after me.  The window problem was simply a lack of usage and the motors needed to moved slightly to clean off the corrosion and they've worked perfectly ever since.  This car does not do anything outstandingly well, but it does everything in an above average/okay manner.  It doesn't handle like a sports car doesn't accelerate like a corvette and doesn't stop as well as many cars that I've owned.  But it does  everything in an above average manner. Absolutely no complaints, the leather interior is like new as a car of this mileage garaged most of its life should be.

I have had so many problems. The AC and heating went out and after over $800 spent no one knows why. The transmission crapped out in 2007 and had to be replaced. When it gets hot outside the door panels stick and you can't open the driver's side door. Now the horn goes off whenever I turn the wheel and the only way to fix it is to disconnect it all together.

Still running well 10 years later with just under 77K miles. Only non-routine maintenance need was a glitch with the electronics for the automatic trans at around 30K miles. Trouble-free since.  The 2.5 liter V6 engine is a winner - great mid-range torque for highway merging and passing, still gets great fuel economy in mid-20s mpg in mixed highway and city driving. Paint has held up remarkably well. Leather interior has held up well. Sunroof still works great.  See no reason I won't be driving it another 2-3 years. If Chrylser had built all their models this well, the company would be in a lot better shape!",4.375

At 171,000 miles now, its no luxury vehicle compared to what's on the road today but it is cheap to operate and and gets pretty good gas milage for a car built in 1997.

I'd have kept her for another 10 years if I could have.11/2016I still love my girl!  More now than ever, because there is no car payment.

After just three weeks of driving the vehicle and with 1300 miles on the odometer, I have already had to replace a tail lamp bulb (not that big a deal) and now the engine light is on. The seats on this vehicle take some getting used to, the interior looks nice but the materials are cheap. Engine in my vehicle is actually the 2.7 V6, and as V6's go it is unrefined and sluggish. Gas mileage is average for a vehicle this size. My company had a choice between this car and the new Taurus. The Taurus is bigger, more powerful, better built and more expensive...the Sebring proves the old adage, you get what you pay for.",3

The 2010 model year eliminated the grooves on the hood, which results in a much cleaner look. The interior is very stylish with a two-tone beige/cream. The ride is very smooth and quiet and all controls are easy-to-use and where they should be. Apparently the base price has been reduced for 2010; even the dealer did a double-take when they saw the sticker considering the equipment included: heated leather, 4-wheel ABS disc brakes, satellite/6-CD changer radio, power windows with auto down AND up, automatic locks, etc. Overall a very nice car.",4.75

I have no regrets with this purchase. The car overall is a real head-turner. With the top down, children love staring at it as you drive by, and adults often give you the thumbs up or start conversation. So many people want to go for a ride in the car as so many people have never ridden in a convertible and with the comfort and space you can easily take 3 people with you on the ride. Trunk space is plenty for a convertible with the top down. And the top goes up and down in like 6 seconds or so quietly and easily. Unlike some cars you can even operate the top up to around 10 MPH. There is no roll over protection so... don't flip it! But it's got a nice low center of gravity anyway so chances of flipping are low. The aerodynamics in this thing is phenomenal! Driving over 70mph on a windy rainy day on the countryside was a breeze. You can hear when the wind hits the car but it stays the course very well. And I personally get a kick out of the sound of the wind getting sliced by the wipers as it wipes. With a good, tight top on the car (like new) the noise level with the top up is very minimal and similar to a standard hard body car. Warning though, when I got mine used, the back window on the top was separated from the cloth causing a leak in the back into the trunk. Chances are you'll need to replace the top. There's a site that can sell you one for around $500, that's where I got mine, and put it on myself. Took 2 people with no experience in convertible tops but we got it done and it looks great! Took us a whole day lol. One of my biggest complaints though is the electronics. The headlights are not very bright so I recommend getting one with working foglights. And also I'm having a fight with my headlight switch as it seems to now be tied to my foglights. Headlights turn on, foglights come with for no reason! I've gone through several switches and eventually each one either ties my headlights to the foglights, or fog lights stop working altogether. I'd rather it stay on all the time which is my current issue, I can live with this. Also my door locks sometimes don't lock/unlock with the key fob... other times it does. And there's a connector under the passenger seat tied to the airbag system that frequently lights my airbag light. I every so often have to get out and push it together to get it to turn off. This car has gremlins I swear. But still when everything is working fine its a great car I still recommend it greatly!",4

It doesn't bother me to have the light on so I leave it alone.  The only other problem I had was with some small piece in the system that cost about $100 (it caused the car to shut down at stop lights).  I got that fixed and everything is ok again.

The back wheels would slip horribly in the snow. There was almost no control of this vehicle in those conditions. I went off the road twice with it driving 5 miles and hour.

Loving it so far *updated**," I picked up my Jxi a few months ago for a mere $1400. The engine had 165k miles on it, but I was baffled at how well it was taken care of. This is now a 15 year old car, and I'm amazed at how many looks and compliments you get in it. I drive quite a lot, and have put a good amount of mileage on it already as it's currently @ 176k. Haven't had any major issues with it so far. As others have said, there's odd little electrical problems that pop up, but nothing too serious. The dash lights work when they want to, as do the mirror/dome light. Blower motor works on high speed only (this is an easy fix, though). The trunk lid hydraulic lifters also fail, so watch your head when you open it. Updated 4-5-2016 (Edmunds sent me an email asking for an update on this review). I do still have this car, and drive it every so often. I did run into some issues shortly after my initial review. Oil leaks were (and still are) one of my main issues. The valve cover gaskets failed, and it took the distributor/rotor/cam sensor assembly, and camshaft sensor with it. Oil seeped past the gaskets and ruined the components. I can't fault the gaskets for failing, because it can happen; especially on an older car with this many miles. What I can fault is the engineering of the engine itself, and how horrible they made it to work on. The engine bay is very cramped, and there's little room to work with. The craziest thing is having to remove the intake manifold just to access the rear 3 spark plugs. I've never seen such a crazy setup.Anyway... Getting the aforementioned parts changed out was a major pain in the rear.  The valve cover gaskets were caked into the covers, and I spent hours digging them out, and trying my best not to bend the delicate covers (it's a very thin metal, and any warps in it will cause leaks). The distributor, rotor, and cam sensor are in one assembly, and it was very difficult to remove it. Also, since all three of these components are in one big chunk, it's an expensive part, and these engines are very picky about which ones you put in. You take a big risk putting a re-manufactured assembly in, and they have a high fail percentage if you do. Many Chrysler forums recommend you buy an OEM or new one. Same applies for the crankshaft sensor.Even after repairing the leaks there, I still have odd oil spots on the driveway. These cars are prone to oil leaks, and you can read around about it.Still, I'm satisfied with purchasing the car. It's been a very fun little car to take out on the weekend with the family.UPDATED: 10-18-16 (Edmunds sent me yet another email asking for an update)Currently my sebring is not doing so well. I started noticing a serious transmission fluid puddle under the car. I assumed perhaps the pan gasket was bad, and I had my mechanic friend look at it. He called me back soon after and told me to ""come down and take a look at it""... never a good sign. He had it up on a lift and rotated the front wheels back and forth. Both driver and passenger axles were loose and rattling around in the differential casing, and fluid was leaking past them. He didn't fully diagnose it, but told me it was likely serious and possibly required a new transmission. Not being able to afford such a repair, I limped it back home and started tearing apart under the engine. Pulling the inspection cover off,  it looked like the differential bearings went bad, caused play in the drive axles, and ruined the seals, causing the leak. I'm still in the process of fixing this, and hope to have it back up before winter. Hopefully I won't have to replace the transmission...This has turned into a massive review, but it's the culmination of two requested updates, and me wanting others to know what you might be getting into. One last thing I'm going to mention: This engine is an ""interference engine"" design.  If you're unfamiliar with what that is, basically it means if the timing belt breaks, the engine is completely ruined. I did not know this until after I purchased the car, and I want others to know this beforehand. Every car has a timing belt, or chain. Chains are more reliable and rarely break or cause issue. Belts however, go bad and need to be changed after so many miles/years. It's another bad design, and expensive to service.Breaking it down to pros/cons:PROS: - It's a convertible...-Still a nice looking car 17 years later-If you find a loaded Sebring with the Infinity radio system, it's really good-Very spacious seating-No seriously, it's back seat leg room is more than my Buick sedan... how is that possible??-Pretty sharp handling for a larger sized vehicle-The Auto-stick feature is fun, and gives you more control of the gearsCONS:-Timing belt on an interference engine...why...seriously....-Not the best engine design in terms of user repair.-Odd electrical bugs here and there-Cheap plastic on the doors rattle with the radio turned up",4

I have driven this car daily since the purchase. 2 weeks after purchasing it, the transmission went into limp mode. I spent $300 purchasing a used transmission and another 300 to have it put in. I have not had any problems since then. There are other mechanical things that I need to fix, but these are things that were wrong with the car when I first purchased it. This car is amazing. I have not had a car that has been as economical, fun to drive, and reliable as this has been.The two mechanical problems that I spoke of earlier are the lower control arms for both driver and passenger side.There are no other problems with this car.",4.875

No snow, I live in the Sunbelt. Can cruise at better than 75 mph and still get over 30 mpg. For those that have problems with their dash lights, gauges, etc. I solved it easily by waiting for to warning bells to go off before cranking the starter. A few extra seconds and never had the problem again. Yes, I had to replace the trunk lift shocks, rear window motor, struts & bushings but for a 15 yr. old car I shouldn't complain.

Unless you can do your own work or have a second car to drive while your Chrysler Sebring is in the shop, I would recommend looking around before you buy this car. This is an unreliable car and will need serviced more then you may like. The good side of that is replacement parts are cheap and easy to find. For the people that do their own work, you may need to try a few times to be able to get to where you need to be. Considering the front wheel drive, the engine compartment is very cramped. I still enjoyed my Sebring.",2.75

I have had the car in the shop 4 times, since I bought it 1 month ago. The car has been severely random misfiring and they have replaced the computer, spark plugs, valve cover, manifold, distrubuter, and they are now changing the EGR. In addition to this the car squeaks terribly at low speeds. Not only this the car has electrical problems, the cruise quit working, lights turn on and off when they want to and the remote keys only work when they want to any will randomly set the car alarm off.

So far, it has been running great. I put the top down as much as possible living in Edmonton, Canada and that adds up to maybe 100 times a year (May to September is great weather-warm and dry). 285,000km (178,000 miles). In 9 years, I've changed the timing belt, a few sensors, couple of headlights, a windshield and a ball-joint once. It has always handled great.

Sometimes I will start the car and none of the electrical will go on-lights, radio, heat, headlights. ( Which is usually fixed by turning the car off and turning it back on)  The only benefits of the Sebring are that they are cheap larger convertibles that are good for local driving or high school and college students.  Not many problem with the engine and they get decent gas mileage about 20 MPG.  Power steering makes noises even though fluid is not needed.

Every mechanic I took it in to gave me a different explanation and a different price. I drove it for a year with the light on. The rear window broke and cost around $1000 to replace.

If you have the ""Flooding Problems"" & ""Standing Water"" inside on the floors, just keep the drain holes along the frame under each door uncloged, that should solve the problem with water on the floors.

The unusual tire wear was taken care of by a wheel alignment and all four tires were replaced (again under warranty).  The MPG (Miles Per Gallon) issue which turns out to be a non-issue as the former owner lived in Chicago which is a lot of stop and go traffic. In the week that I've owned the car, the mileage is up to 27 MPG of Highway driving- pretty good for having the 3.5L V6!!!   The one issue that I don't really care for is that the leather seats are very slippery!!!  But....after paying $4500 for a 2007 with 35,800 Miles on it, I'm not going to complain.   Overall a good deal!",4

4339, on 11/20/15 19:53 PM (PST),Brianna ,2007 Chrysler Sebring Sedan Touring 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Save Yourself The Trouble!," I have the 2.7L V6 engine. Let me start by saying i haven't had many problems but the problems I do have are ridiculous. As previously mentioned by others, the car randomly stalls out on you whether you are moving or not... Especially in the rain! It is absolutely horrible on gas. My gas cap seems to be an ongoing issue as the car chooses when it thinks the gas cap is working properly and when it isn't... I've been through 2 or 3 gas caps so far. I've gotten water stuck in the door during a rainstorm which drained out over the course of a few days. If you're looking for something that handles nicely and is good in all weather, this is absolutely not the car for you. My car slides all over the place when it's wet or icy out... I dread driving it in the winter. I've had to replace the brakes twice in 6 months because they don't seem to hold up well and this car takes what seems like days to stop. I LOVE the acceleration in the car though! I must conclude by saying the car is 100% plastic and I was recently in a very minor accident (rear ended another vehicle) and the front of my car SMASHED. $4,500 in damage. Cosmetic parts are entirely too expensive for such a horribly made vehicle. The airbags also did not deploy. I could go on and on about why I hate this car but my advice to you is to skip out on it and look for another vehicle!!!",2

Took it to several places to get fixed, spent thousands of dollars and still not fixed. The gears get stuck in park, sometimes the keys don't want to come out of the ignition, so make sure you have a spare.. And just recently I've discovered that when it rains water gets inside of my doors. Do not waste your money on this car!",1
4341, on 09/08/15 20:27 PM (PDT),william ,2007 Chrysler Sebring Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 4A),would never buy a Chrysler product again!," My car (2007 base model Sebring 2.4l) was the worst purchase ever!I bought my 2007 used in 2011 with 94k. First appearance was great! Very specious, decently large trunk, excellent sound quality from the speakers, sharp interior and exterior, minimal road noise. Everything cosmetically was great for a compact car. The first two years I owned the car I did regular maintenance which include a new starter, new tires, breaks, alignment, new belts, air filter, oil changed with synthetic oil every 3000 miles. After the second year everything went down hill.First was the car would shake when I traveled on the freeway and lightly tap the break. It was so dangerous I had to pull over immediately! I was told first by a mechanic that I need new breaks and rotors. I purchased new breaks and rotors which cost me around $300! That wasn't the problem it ended up needing new break calipers which are 150 a piece i needed two.After that I had a coolant leak I needed new clamps for the hose. That was a $40 repair.  The fluids had to be constantly observed especially the coolant. this car had a coolant problem the entire time I owned the car.the breaks needed to be replaced every couple of months! Then the engine failed during winter which cracked the block which lead to me purchasing a used engine with 66k total installation cost 2000. Chrysler dealership wanted to charge me 2000 just for a used engine so that forced me to go else where. The engine failing also lead to the heater coil failing which lead to no heat! With was a 1000 dollar fix OUTSIDE the dealership. The a/c control would not stay on high. The interior no matter how many times I got it detailed would never stay clean the stains just soaked in the fabric. After that my car kept making a loud popping noise when I turned the wheel, then I took it back to the mechanic and it was the complete hub assembly  which cost me over $300 dollars. Then the back door stopped working from the outside . The antenna  flew off. The headliner fell down. Then I thought I could at least get another year out of the car. After 20,000 miles from when I changed the engine, the car over heated blew the radiator hose. Then I had to get it towed to the mechanic where he replaced the hose the part was 55.00 not including labor, he checked the head gasket, compression test, checked for air in the line, replaced both thermostats in the car that cost me over 300 dollars. And it still didn't stop over heating. It would over heat at idle and go back down when I drove it. Also at this point the car had 164k and the linkage kept sticking and transmission was slipping. Plus I had to replace at least 5 sensors on the car  Finally the mechanic told me he recommends selling the car which I did. I hardly got any money for the car I practically gave it away since the car depreciated so much.Just a reminder I did a full carfax report the previous owners also maintained it ever 3000 miles and the car has never been in an accident.Chrysler should be ashamed for putting a car with this many problems on the market",1

A couple of years ago - I saw the newly designed Sebring and decided I'd get it this time. I have regretted it since the first fuel pump replacement within two months of driving it off the lot. Since then, the thing has been in the shop to get the ECM and TPM system replaced, took three tries to hold an alignment, has random electrical problems, and most recently got stuck in park for no apparent reason.

In this time it only needed one minor fix to the trunk release. I have the 2.4l 4 cyl, and no issues with pep. I'm a bit surprised by some reviews that report lack of pep. I travel a lot, and have driven many rental cars with 4 cyl. engines. I don't think any of them have as much go or more power than my Sebring. On the highway it's quite and handles far better than I expected for the price I paid. On one recent highway trip I got 35 mpg doing mostly 70 mph. My only concern is if Chrysler will stay in business to honor the life time power- train warranty that came with my car for no extra cost! ",4.75

I'm a college student, wanted to get something I wouldn't have to pray would break down on me. Test drove a few Nissans then I test drove the Sebring, and then took it home.  I love the way the car looks.  It's great on gas, and the sound system is great. People have been complaining about the pick up,  I think the car is quite peppy, and when I'm on the highway I don't even realize how fast I'm going sometimes.  The inside feels sorta like a airplane cockpit, but I love my car ! I love the gas mileage it rivals a Honda, or Nissan . Not bad for an American made car",5

It sounds terrible. Never know what noises I'm going to hear each day. Kind of fun to drive but so noisy and uncomfortable it's hard to get past anything else. Please ask if you can take car for a few days and drive before you buy to make sure it's what you want. Wish I would have. Not fun just sick to my stomach that I'm in this car for a long time.

It was a great car that handled well, has great features like Sirius satellite radio, 6 in dash CD player and most importantly UConnect.  I found it so much easier to use than the Trailblazer I had.  The four cylinder engine had more than enough power to take us where we were going and in the year and a half I had the car, no problems to report.  The greatest concern with the car is safety.  The car was in an accident which rendered it a complete loss.  The car was hit head on and the air bags never went off.

Twice the ignition made a sound when cranking as if the starter was getting ready to quit on me and the brakes makes a funny noise only when I'm backing up.  Now today it rained while i was at work and i hear water swishing around in the back, my husband says it sounds like it's coming from the back passenger door.

Reason: best ride for the money.  More substantial with better drive and road handling than the Sonata, Milan or Altima.  The Charger and Sable are the only ones that could compare to the Sebring. The Charger is very solid but more money and less MPG. The New Sebring introduced in 07 is far better than the old Sebring with improved ride and handling.  I purchase the Limited with the four cylinder 2.4 L engine.  Good power for a four banger and far less noise that the Altima. ",5

Very sporty looking and for a 4door family sedan, when paired with the 3.5 V6 and 6 speed automatic, you tend to forget your driving a family vehicle. The engine is whisper quite and provides plenty of pep around town and on the highway.  Be careful 80 feels like 40. This is my third Chrysler in a row. Before these last three vehicles I was exclusively a European car buyer.  I was originally in the market for a Pasat or Audi A4, but the value in the New Sebring Sedan was too much to pass up.

Meant for being a boulevard cruiser rather than a racecar. Got the touring with every option except leather, and got the 2.7 V6 for the E85 capability.

The interior is well designed and presents well. It's cruise control, remote entry/trunk release and power locks/windows/mirrors provide the basic luxury you'd expect, but that's about it. The MP3 stereo is a nice touch. The MPG is as advertised. There is a recall on a part that can cause a high pitch whine while driving, though its not advertised anywhere (my car has 24k miles on it). The 4 cyl is surprisingly spunky, offering some thrill factor, but not off the line. The 2007 Sebring 4 cyl offers basic luxury in an attractive package for a reasonable price. In today's gas market, it's not a bad alternative to the V6's.",3.75

The major imports we looked at seemed to be getting bloated and were just plain boring(No spark). The car is just the right size, has great styling and handles extremely well. Twisty roads are a real blast with the precision steering and suspension.  The 3.5l engine has lots of power and has a pleasant tone when you get your foot into it.  We've had the car for about 4 months now and it has been trouble free.  The build quality is excellent and the interior design is pleasant and unique with high quality material.

I love the Inferno Red color with the chrome accents and the interior with the MyGIG navigation system looks sharp.

I liked the 2.7L V6 in the Touring with it's E85 capability and the 18-inch wheels are definitely a plus.

The break sometimes wouldn't be able to be pressed, which is a problem among Chrysler, but was fixed. I bought this car for 3500 and put more than that into it with repairs. This car handled damage well. I had hail damage which was almost unnoticeable due to the metallic paint job. I was in one minor fender bender when I slid on ice and hit another car. My car only had scratches on the bumper where the other car was dented in.  I had my second accident in it which totaled it when I slid on ice and collided with 2 other cars. This car is very sturdy and kept me safe inside the car while taking the impact of 2 cars, one of which was while I was stationary and was a head on collision.

But the tie-rod ends go bad and then break, yes I said break, so you cannot steer when they break and could cause an accident.  So have them replaced as soon as you buy one of these cars, or have the owner do it before you buy. The cross over tube in your cooling system deteriorates and needs to be replaced, kind of pricey.  The rear defogger hasn't worked since I bought the car.  The tranny is geared high so you don't get the full effect of the 168hp V6.  And the computer puts the engine at idle once you hit 105mph.

Transmissions are an achilles heel so ensure shifts are smooth at numerous RPM settings.  The 2.5 V6 is silky smooth - just be sure to replace the timing belt around 100,000 miles to ensure everything keeps going for another 100,000.

This car has little power and was built with the cheapest parts they could find to forestall bankruptcy. The rotors will need to be replaced under 20000 miles. If you need roadside service, be prepared to wait several hours past the time allotted as the vastly reduced number of dealers is completely overburdened by volume of calls from their unreliable cars.

It is the second one I've gotten. The first, a 2002 model, was traded at 75,000 miles.  No problems - ever! Why does Edmunds slam the interior? Look inside a Malibu, then look in a Sebring. I've driven both and I can say that the Malibu is built like a Yugo compared to the Sebring.  The interior of the Sebring is very well screwed together and not all all cheap looking - try to say that about any GM car. Brakes are excellent!!! Torque is a bit lacking.

If you're a tall person, good luck in attempting to fit into this ride, head room is at an extreme minimal.  I'm short, so no complaints here !

A low roaring wind noise comes through the top front and a whistling noise from around the windows. Sounds like you're at the airport watching jets take off! Loud wind noise is due to poor seal with the top front clips and the rubber seals around the windows not sealing tightly. Dealership adjusted windows and the top front clips which greatly reduced the noise but it came came back after a few days of driving. It's actually quieter driving with the top down! Before you buy take it down the freeway with the top and windows up to make sure yours doesn't also sound like you're in a wind tunnel.,4

Since it had less than 70,000 miles on it, I had the dealer look at it, and with a computer upgrade, now it shifts perfectly.  I run Prolong in the engine and it gets around 26 mpg on the freeway at 65 mph.

Contacted Chrysler, they said couldn't help  me wasn't under any warranty. They said it was because we were parking the car outside. I politely told them I have a 1966 Plymouth Sport fury  that has always been parked outside and the paint has never peeled. Also have a 2005 Chrysler P/T Cruiser that has always been parked outside and do not have any paint peeling problems. So if you want a car that looks like it has leprosy them by all means buy one. You would think a $40,000 car would not have this kind of problem. But if you want one that looks good years down the line I would not suggest this car. There are other things but I am not going to go into them. This is the major one.",4

It is fun to drive and has plenty of performance. I would like to add that the performance and handling of the Sebring improved greatly when we installed a set of General Altimax RT43 tires. The previous tires made the car harsh riding and were very noisy. The difference was amazing! We get great mileage on the road 27 to 28 mpg. We live in the country so almost all our driving miles are on 60 mph roads. With the windscreen up the car is quieter with the side windows down. I have had many convertibles including a 1958 Morris Minor and the Sebring is by far the best.,5

I traded my 2002 Sebring Convertible GTC (2.7 L, 6 cyl) in for this one -- the GTC was a lot lower to the ground and more stable, a little more sporty, the LX handles more like a sedan.

Before purchasing drove a Toyota convertible, used with 10,000 miles and a $25,000 purchase price. Frankly the cars were comparable in all respects exept Toyota was faster with larger engine.

It's FUN to drive and it's economical on gas, getting 32 mpg on long trips over the road.  We've had no trouble at all with it, and we love its styling and hideaway top which is always an attention getter!  The engine runs smoothly, quietly and seems vibration free. There are no body shakes or rattles or squeaks that one usually expects to find, even in the most expensive of convertibles.  Its power won't win any races, but it's very adequate for most situations.  We liked this car SO MUCH that we bought a silver one for my wife!

Quiet, stable ride and strong brakes. Wind buffeting strong at interstate speeds, buzzing the back shoulder belt straps. Annoying cruise control stalk. Trunk very heavy and not counterbalanced enough.  You can strike your head on the trunk edge if you lean over before ensuring it is fully raised. Center armrest short and too far back. Wheel too far away compared to pedal position. Problems with the temp control. No matter what position, it would suddenly blast full heat. It had to be moved to full cool to cancel max heat. 12 V plug too close to shift lever in P. Seat back spring is too powerful: releasing lever makes it slam forward. Engine loud at full throttle.",4.125

The 2.4 engine is quite and economical; averaging 30 mpg (55% highway/45%city).  It's got plenty of power for all around cruising.  The interior is fantastic with easy to read gauges and very comfortable seats.  The Sebring has been 100% reliable with every feature/option.  Sirius radio and UConnect are wonderful and the 17"" rims make the car standout.  As mentioned in other reviews, this isn't a hot rod or a sports car - rather it is a solid frame with a comfortable ride & good handling; competitive with any other mid sized car available today.

However, it is a heavy car. The doors and trunk door are heavy. I have had minor problems when the car is riding at a slow speed it jerks. I think an improvement would be to add a place to put your sunglasses when your top is up and they are not on your face( sexy shades is a must).

It never came! Finally it got here. They put it in and radio was worse. The installed a new radio. It wasn't new it was a refurbished. What a laugh. It was worse then the first on plus the switched hard drive capacity.  It still didn't work. The bluetooth locked up with the phones and your party could not hear you.

The ride is incredibly smooth with very little road noise. The feel of the car is very solid; not like a typical convertible.  Ive negotiated corners much faster than usual and found that it corners like most other cars that Ive experienced.  The dash and instrument panel is well appointed. The 3.5 is great and the extra power helps handle all kinds of traffic situations.  Top goes up & down 3 times a day, no problems.  Washing is a breeze; I use the drive-thru carwash & have no water problems whatsoever.  Test drive this car and I think you will be hooked.  This car is a beauty; I love it! ",4.875

With the mygig in the car all my play lists are loaded and at the ready as i head over the Sunshine Skyway with the top down.

The precision of the steering, the brakes and the standard audio system are the best of any car I've owned. It gets 24-26 mpg & I have gotten 28.3 mpg  mainly hwy with some city driving. Acceleration is decent but seems to be slower than it really is because of the smooth ride. Even though the cabin space is bigger than my '97 Sebring ragtop, there is less front & almost no rear legroom compared to the '97. The fit & finish of the interior & the materials make the car look retro-futuristic. As for the design, it is comparable to the Japanese cars. The ride is as good as an Acura or Scion and the interior & trunk space are better than the VW Eos. ",4.125

After a few months I still love it but it's not perfect. With the hard top, when it rains, the water tends to flow along the edge of the seam by the front part of the roof and off the sides. So when you open the door you will get wet. Not a big deal for me but I could see other people having an issue with it. It requires two hands to put the seat back. This is stange...you have to lift the level with one hand and push the seat back with the other. The spot between the windsheild and hood tends to collect leaves in the fall.

It is a cruiser, not a  sportscar . Comfortable, quiet, and classy! Ride quality is great. All the professional reviews do not give this car justice. I am really glad I got the electronic stabilty control as  we live in the snow and it really makes winter driving safer and easier. This is our everyday car in Minnesota winters. It's a car  for people in their late 40s and up who want a convertible but not all the hassles to go with it.

One thing I notice is the brakes are squeaky when the car is first used. It goes away after 5 minutes.  I bought an extended warranty for $1185, which covers 45K more miles. Do your shopping on third party warranties before accepting a dealer one. That way they have to compete.  The car looks and drives as nice as my snobby neighbors that have Accord or Camary.",4.75

With 5-Star crash ratings, stability control and side airbags, you can't buy a safer car! Handling in winter conditions was fantastic, the front wheel drive and stability control performed great.

Research online about this car and recalls and if you are one of the unlucky ones that have this car, beware- it can stall at any moment causing an accident out of no where.

The upright driving position is good and visibility fine. Controls are all easy to reach, and the gated shifter makes it easy to reach the gear I want without looking down. I am using the Sebring as a commuter vehicle 45 miles each way, and my fellow carpoolers have commented without being asked on the roomy rear seat, a real strength of this car as compared to many of its competitors.

Like the review below mine sometimes it doesn't turn over when starting like it should. This happens randomly and for no apparent reason.  My only major complaint is the rear bumper. I think it is made poorly and within the first month I noticed a rock had hit the underside of the tire casing and made a notch in the paint. After closer inspection I noticed that there is another part where the paint is pulling away where the metal body and plastic bumper of the car meet. You can hardly see it now but I fear in time it will grow. My biggest suggestion would be to examine your bumper before purchasing this car!,4.375

As for the interior, yes its a bit 'hard' in spots, but in my experience I've found that in the long term, Chrysler interiors hold up very well.

I couldn't be happier with that. The car has nice features, but not the luxury I was used to. Even so, for about 21,000 sticker price it is a good value. The engine has plenty of power, although the transmission is not very smooth. Overall, if you're looking for an economical midsize car, I recommend at least test driving a Sebring.",4.375

The Chevy Malibu gets a lot of press, as do the Japanese competition.  But for the money, I think the Sebring is underrated, and overlooked. The Limited or Touring with Leather is the way to go.

As an example, compare the Sebring's three knob HVAC controls to the mess of buttons that now plagues the Accord.  The Sebring has an ultra rigid body and the touring suspension has the travel and damping required to navigate America's deteriorating roads. The 2.7 touring model is a very capable driver too.

Have had car since March this year .. Got it with just 12K miles.  .. Have taken it from Charlotte, NC, to Michigan and back ... Milwaukee, and back ... And just completed a round trip to Cincinnati... These (2016s and '17s) are available with wonderful rebates, now ... Get the V6.  Get the V6, get the V6!  Not because there's anything wrong with the 2.4 liter  -> It's an awesome motor .. But they (on some 200s) didn't build the 9-speed automatic transmission, to the motor well ... Also since mid-model year 2016 can get the middle grade car, the Limited, with the V6 motor.Mine's a C  - top of the 200 sedan food chain ... It is absolutely AWESOME!  All wheel drive package.  300 horsepower (It isn't said, anywhere, but the AWD has a smidgen more power, than the non .. Has different exhaust.) ... Love the dash, in this .. How you can sift through all the different things, in the car, with the button on your steering wheel ... Mine is jet-black, black leather inside had granite grey rims; 19 inch ..  The dial transmission works, just great!  Some 'expert' car review places have gone on that ""Geez it has too many speeds .. Who wants to shift, nine times?"" ... Well you DON'T shift, nine times ..  in regular driving.  Speeds 8 and 9 are highway cruising gears ... and are why with my V6 I got an incredible 31 & 1/2 mpg, on my trip to Ohio.My car also has the manual shift mode with steering-mounted levers, for if I want to really fly, off of a light.  8.4 inch touch screen is rhe best, I've ever seen ... Better than my friend's, in his Camry (He even says this .. lol) ... I do miss a CD player. ... But I'm getting my albums on a couple USBs, to stick in and pull up and play.  One has about 40, so far.As to the flap about the rear roof line [That Sergio, head of Fiat was waayyy too sensitive about, in that interview he gave ... He was not recognizing that Consumer Reports just doesn't like Chryslers, and has been biased against Chrysler, for a long time]  [I mean kids getting in and out of the back is no problem ... And really how many people who drive these have (other) adults, getting in and out of the back, all week?  C.R. took one item and hammered the whole car, because of it.  And a lot of people are quickly influenced by Consumer Reports.  Thankfully, I wasn't]So, this car is derived from an Alpha Romeo ... It's cool I'm driving something with some Italian blood.  Summing up: Car is terrific ... Wonderful power, takes the curves with aplomb ..  Seats could be slightly more comfortable, but they're ok. ... 100K mile powertrain warranty. .. Awesome tech  :) ... ... ... Update - Chrysler made, in the marketing of this car (In part leading to it's demise. - FCA, you want me to sit in on your next new car marketing meeting?  Send me a note  -> You need me) ~ They did not promote this car {200C and 200S V6} near enough.  In their TV and radio advertising they did not spell out differentiation between the lower LX and Limited models, and my car. .. Most people thought it was just 'the Chrysler 200' ... While they would have had a lot more buyers for the high end ones ... if they advertised them.  .. They are jam-packed with features found in Audis and BMWs, which cost thousands and thousands more.  2. They SHOULD NOT HAVE called it the 200.  The last 200 car was starting to have some really bad things said about it (yes, some unfair) .. But the point is if they would have dropped the name, associated with a struggling, marginal vehicle - And came up with a brand new name, and presented the car it would be a different ballgame.  Sergio is an idiot, and I'm glad he's leaving - - Because he really believes that if Consumer Reports says you made a crappy car, you made a crappy car. ... Point is put this car out with a new name; it's a NEW CAR ... People wouldn't mentally have to get the bad taste out of their mouths, from the last model - to step in the car, objectively, and take it on test-drive.  Yes also making sure the 9-speed trans was better synced to the 2.4 liter motor, would've been a good move .. But if they do those two things, they didn't - sales would have been huge, and the bad word of Consumer Reports' review wouldn't have had the effect on the perception of the car, it did. .. They may not even have written it.  (And I keep referring to it because go look at sales, of the 2015-2016 200  - They were pretty good; and when that hit they dropped off the cliff .. literally overnight)... The car is NOT one of the worst investments they ever made .. Not itself ... It became a costly mistake, because of the way they mismanaged it's launch, and initial promotion of the different models.  Lots of stupid things ... Like they should never have let any 200Cs be made with the 4 cylinder.  Keep it at the lofty perch, at top car of the line [It has the V6.  This is a 300 horsepower car .. Period.] ... They confused everything. .. I still love mine  :)",5

Love the European styling too. Sadly they are discontinued,  however I bought new so I'm upside down. I suggest buying them used much better deals and more affordable.

I do not know why people give this car such harsh reviews because it's a great car. The acceleration and its road manners make it a pleasure to drive. I love the Uconnect system it is the best in the business. The gas mileage has been great I get up to 40 MPG on the highway and usually around 28 MPG with mixed driving.

However, after sitting in for a minute or two and realizing how comfortable it was, and how I didn't feel cramped in it like I did the Mazda, and how great it handled on the highway, I was hooked.  I have a 14 year old who had his heart set on getting the Jeep when he was old enough to drive, but came in after hubby took him for a ride in the 200 and said ""I like it WAY better than the Jeep!"", so I imagine that he is going to steal this car from me when he turns 16.

Most of those reviews are kind of silly and are not going to effect how you like or dislike the car. The only fault I can see with the car is if your over 6 feet tall the back seat will be a little tight getting in and out but since everybody in my family is under that height no complaint from me. In fact I love the roof line it make's the car look very nice. Gas milage has been outstanding getting 40mpg on the highway and 28mpg in town. Drive this car and make up your own mind and don't let some guy sitting in an office somewhere make it for you. I've had the car long enough now to confirm my positive review from day one. Have had no problems but needed a new battery under warranty no charge to me, service was fast and friendly. Some of the negative reviews on this car make me laugh, things like not liking the color of the lights in the dash, no headroom in the back. seats uncomfortable, rough ride, road noise and on and on. Are they serious. I drove a lot of cars before I found this one and in my opinion it's right up there with the best of them. Drive this car up the freeway and when the transmission shifts into ninth gear watch the RPMs drop 400 and the milage jump up to around 40mpg, wow. The only other car in my opinion that was it's equal was the Buick Verano. I'm biased though I will not buy a foreign made car with a foreign name on it. People told me I could buy a Toyota they're made in the U.S, sure but most of the money goes to Japan and most of the parts are shipped into the country.

Plastic parts,hoses,front bumper...bumper snaps back in, though.  Cheap plastic accessory parts that break off. Rubber seals popping out around windows and convertible roof.  Windshield seal is separating, causing floors to be wet.  Infamous water in the dash from ac.  Ac fan is now making noise.  Dash lights flicker on and off.  Rear tires continue to have cupping, despite alignment.  There is a whistling sound when windows are up, probably another faulty seal.  Power windows USUALLY work.  If you are a smoker, there is no way to crack windows in the rain without interior doors getting soaked.  Extremely windy when roof is down.  Have to take off tires and other stuff to replace headlights.  Finally found the battery!  Have to take off tire to get to it. Really?  I feel that all the great technology went into the engine and the sound system/computer (which is actually impressive) but no where else.  Very cheaply built, probably why it was listed as the most affordable convertible.  The car is a beast,very disappointing :/",2
4921, on 10/28/15 10:42 AM (PDT),Lorri C ,2012 Chrysler 200 Convertible Limited 2dr Convertible (3.6L 6cyl 6A),averaged- not the quality I was expecting," I actually sought this car out; it was everything I was looking for. I purchased my 2012 200 Limited convertible in April 2015 with under 30,000 miles on it for $21,800.00 (a bit over priced but at the time I was ok with it). We test drove it at high speed on the highway, with top down and up, as a driver and a passenger. Since we travel one of the top things I was looking/listening  for was noise, and the only noise at the time was a small wind coming through the rear driver’s side window- I decided to deal with it since it wasn’t in my ear as a passenger, proving I’m not unreasonable.  Then the fun began.  I used to have a 2008 Mercury Sable Premier, so I was spoiled. Even though they were both priced at almost $30,000 new, the 200 has nothing on the Sable. I have had several issues since buying it and after several trips to the dealer I’m left with ‘It’s normal’. The top squeaks when it’s up, sometimes worse than others and after a rain I can NOT put my windows down without a flood of water coming in… consistently.  Not drips, a flood. The drives side window would catch on the trim but they adjusted that. I have a bad wind noise in the car now, not sure where the hell that came from but… IT’S NORMAL, so they say! During this process I had been emailing Chrysler and they were getting back to me and following up regularly. After I got the final exam done on the car with the same ‘it’s normal for a convertible’ I then responded to Chrysler telling them I expected more from a 30,000.00 car. They did talk to the dealership and agreed… here’s a quote.  “ they drove your vehicle and found the noise was the air rush on the outside of that car that would be due to it being a convertible. It is a normal noise. He stated you may experience a creek noise as itwill move due to it being a convertible. They found no water or air leaks.  He stated there is nothing wrong with the vehicle. He stated the body shop adjusted the windows. Some water will come in when the windows are put down. This is a normal condition when dealing with a convertible sports top. After thoroughly reviewing your request and the files on this matter, we respectfully concur with the decision rendered by the dealership.”So I’ve owned a hard top and a soft top, the hard top was a Mercedes so I can let that slide but the soft top was either 96’ or 97’ Sebring. I wanted a better car and a quieter car which is why I got the hard top AND the Limited. What a waste of money! I could have spent less money and got the same quality. Other issues:Delay in transmission- after you accelerate then let off the gas it will hesitates and drag back down. I was also told this is normal.Uncomfortable- even if it’s listed as ‘premium’ leather. Navigation- Pain in the butt to use.     Gas millage- not so good I wish it had memory seats and retractable gas peddle (I'm, only 4'11"")  Pro's: Drives nice, little actual 'road noise', takes bumps wellTight steeringLooks niceHeat and air work wellHeated seats go up the back",2

Have done regular maintenance on this vehicle over the 3 years I have owned it. No matter how easy I drive this vehicle I have yet to see overy 24 MPG. My average since owning the car is 21. This IS a 4 cylinder. Next, the acceleration is terrible. You press the pedal expecting it to go, wait 3-4 seconds of almost standstill then finally some movement. Not safe if you ask me when defensive driving is important. Braking has never been good. Any quick stop results in the entire vehicle shaking from its horrible anti lock. I have already been told that the brakes and rotors are good so again just terrible mechanics. There are many other things but my biggest pet peeve is the tricks Chrysler uses to force you back to the dealership for maintenance. For example, if you want to change the battery you must remove the front bumper, remove the headlight and then the battery. Even just changing the headlight bulb requires the same thing or removing the plastic in the wheel well. Ridiculous is putting it gently. Just look elsewhere at all costs. Buyer beware.",1

It still did the jerking after many transmission shops and talking with the dealer it took about 6 months to a year before the would believe me so they had me bring it in after about 6 hours they called and the bearing in the transmission had failed. Would have thought that they would put a new transmission to my surprise repared new parts a year later the same jerking and sluggishness when driving and yes I called the company and no help the dealer (galeana Chrysler of Columbia South Carolina  was no help sales men said it was my moms fault for signing the paperwork.

I purchased the extended warranties thank goodness.  The heater core went out on the passenger side a year after I purchased the car.  I also had a recall done on the drivers side head rest in 2014.  In 2016 while driving home the drivers side head rest deployed hitting me in the back of the head VERY hard while driving.  I'm lucky it didn't knock me out.  All I wanted was my car fixed and Chrysler has sent their person over and did a review and sent me a letter stating it was nothing they did on their part.  So of course now I have my attorney involved.  I could have went to the doctor and built up a million in doctor bills because I know I have neck damage and it's causing issues with my arms but I just wanted my car fixed.  I really like my car, but it only has 69K miles on it and it should not be having these issues.  It handled really poorly when I first got it but I put good Toyo tires on it and now it handles great.

They have a fleet and they all do the same thing, I was told.  It makes it feel like I am constantly making small acceleration/deceleration changes but I am not. Very uncomfortable when driven more than a few miles.  Rides is bad but can't tell if its the transmission or suspension.  Layout of and type of controls is nothing short of goofy.  The shift control is a knob right near all the radio knob controls, making it easy to reach for the wrong one.  Plus counterintuitive controls so it is uncomfortable to use. Emergency Brake is electric.  Seems entire car is dependent on a computer for all controls so, nothing manual.  Hate to know what would happen if the car's decided to accelerate on its own.   There would be no manual control to intervene.   If you are six feet or taller your head will rub against the ceiling in the back seat.   Does look nice though...",3

It's been in for repair way more than a car as new as it is with as low miles as it has. Cylinder head back in February. Then they rebuilt the transmission in May, brought it back in July because it was doing the same thing but they supposedly didn't find anything, then because it obviously didn't change brought it back in August they replaced a valve in the transmission, September the torque converter(which is something I told them to look at the second time they didn't find anything) AND the Cylinder head AGAIN. It's all under the extended warranty that THANK GOD I purchased. I bought it with 53K miles, it now has 70K miles. A car in my opinion should not need all those major repairs with those miles. Plus I kept asking them to look at the torque converter The buying exp. was terrible too, I was pressured into buying the car and he didn't give me a chance to look at many other vehicles. Outside of the major repair issues I love the car. I think it's sharp looking, rides smoothly when it's working, has great features and amazing power.

I was told the tires were not balanced. They were factory tires but are not covered. Also make sure you check your alignment often as this destroyed my front tires.

I will say that the transmission is rough, but I am a car person, so I looked up the gear ratios and noticed how far apart they are from first to second gear and that seems to be the reason.

I looked at and researched mid-sized cars for 3 months before I decided on the 200. I liked the exterior looks of the malibu, but the interior seemed dated and the 2.4l engine was too underpowered for my taste. I finally decided on the 200 for two reasons, the 3.6l Pentastar is amazing 29mpg with 283HP. It is very quiet and docile at low throttle, but give it some gas and it feels like a rockestship! This engine is an absolute joy. The second reason was price, I walked out of the dealership at $20200.00 after all rebates and negotiations.",4.625

Gets good mileage (30-35 mpg hwy at 70-75 mph), comfrotable, with pretty good quality. I think its a great new gen Chrysler vehicle for anyone.Has a surprisingly sporty feel to the suspension, hugs corners very well and feels pretty flat in the process, but soft and absorbing at the same time. Very nice interior with a majority of it soft-touch materials, gets lots of compliments from passangers. I4 engine feels pretty crude, opt for V6. As driving enthusiast I find it fun to drive.",4

The Chrysler 200 was not even on my list until I had driven the Optima and Sonata, found that I was not happy with the standard 2.4 liter engine and the 274hp turbo would not fit in my budget. It was the 3.6L V-6 that made me try the 200S.

Since that time, I've had issues with the car shutting sown because it's low on oil.  this is bi-weekly.  the car drinks oil like it is a dessert. I put at least a quart to 2 quarts of oil in the vehicle every 2-3 weeks.  It's not leaking out so where is it going.  It has been to the dealer at least 7 times.  It will shut down on you in the middle of traffic if the oil is low within the 2-3 week period (very dangerous, especially when you're on the freeway0.  the dealer says it does that to protect the engine.  well how about finding out why it consumes so much oil..and where is it going.  In addition, I ALWAYS have a check engine light.  It's intermittent and of course the dealer can't get a reading if it's not on.  the light popped on 2 weeks ago, I took it to auto zone for them to get a reading (because it was closer).  It said it was the catalytic converter.  I took it to the dealer the next day, it read the same thing.  I returned a week later to have it repaired (mind you, it was determined that it was still under warranty)..Wouldn't you know, it didn't read catalytic converter, it read a misfire so they didn't replace the catalytic converter. How can both places have the same reading and it turns into something else.  the acceleration is poor.  It slows down when it like and has to catch up to go up a hill.  I have not had this car a year yet and have spent most of my time with it in and out of the shop. I DO NOT recommend this vehicle because it is not reliable and it's costly.  I may as well have an oil pump in my back yard.   #verydissatisfied",1

Great Price- bought used, 2016 model purchased 2017 with 9800 miles & paid $16,000 with dealer provided finance co.                2. Mechanical- still under warranty when purchased (1 warranty service replaced entire rack & pinion at 30,000 miles after i went off road,  shhh). Motor, transmission,  brakes,  a/c, starter,  alternator,  etc. performing great holding up strong now at 49,000 miles. using as company vehicle                     3. Performance- not a big fan of 4 cylinders, but surpassed expectations,  as expected has slow acceleration but have tracked highway mileage at over 49 MPG at 1800 RPM flat highway. Cold air.  Brakes average,  but i have stomped them hard several times and still has firm pedal but does not stop quick like truck brakes. Fully expect motor and transmission to hold out well until trade in at 125,000 miles. No complaints about 9 speed transmission shifts smooth for me.  starts easy,  idles and runs smooth.  Driven hard in Texas climate from hill country to desert terrain to Saltwater Gulf at 40,000 miles i have driven in less than 18 months.  Runs strong and durable.    4. Comfort/ features- interior is loaded as are most 4 cylinders to hide economy of the power train. Bluetooth,  stereo,  automated controls,  etc best i have had but newest vehicle i ever owned as i assume power ports,  etc.  are now standard equipment as phone,  computer,  audio,  video technologies merge.  Looks expensive based on dash (back uo camera, programmable features,  monitors for MPG,  air pressure,  temperatures,  etc. ).            Good driving experience for balance of economy cost for purchase  price,  maintenance costs (american made parts & labor),  operation (1 gallon of gas over 40 miles highway), & enough power for climbing hills,  entering freeway speeds, and carrying people and cargi load capacity. The back seat headroom never an issue for me as front extra roomy and just put kids or shorter passengers in back (mom slept in back on road trips).

Yes, the transmission occasionally (rarely) jerks in low gears 1st or 2nd, but not a big deal. It rides great on highway. I have the 4 cylinder, so it's not super quick, but it gets up to speeds fine and doesn't feel bogged down except for maybe when you stop and start a lot in city with AC running. I would have gotten the 3.6L if it was my only car, but it was a second car I bought to use as a daily driver. The 2.4L is fine for me. The looks, features and interior are good for the price. I don't know why people have trouble getting in, I'm 6'2"" and I don't struggle at all. The only interior rattle I've had is from the sunglasses holder, which I fixed with a piece of stick on vinyl to eliminate the plastic on plastic rubbing that was occurring. If you want to compare it to a luxury sedan, yeah, it's going to lose. It's also half the price and still performs great for a daily car. I purchased mine with serious rebates, so I paid only about 2/3 of sticker price, so I'm very happy with it. I have leather, heated seats, cruise, rear camera, blue tooth, touchscreen, usb, power seats an much more for under $20K. I also own a mint condition 2008 CTS, yet I don't feel like I'm slumming when I drive my 200. I think Chrysler is making a mistake discontinuing these. My wife drives a loaded Chrysler Town & Country that has had several issues, but the 200 has been problem free. I have no plans on getting rid of it as it looks and rides like new.",5

Mine is jet-black, black leather inside .. Has granite grey rims; 19 inch ..  The dial transmission works, just great!  Some 'expert' car review places have gone on that ""Geez it has too many speeds .. Who wants to shift, nine times?"" ... Well you DON'T shift, nine times .. in regular driving.  Speeds 8 and 9 are highway cruising gears ... and are why with my V6 I got an incredible 31 & 1/2 mpg, on my trip to Ohio.My car also has the manual shift mode with steering-mounted levers, for if I want to really fly, off of a light.  8.5 inch touch screen is the best, I've ever seen ...

One has about 40, so far.As to the flap about the rear roof line [That Sergio, head of Fiat was waayyy to sensitive about, when he gave an interview ...

It was under warranty so I had that replaced. Then a few months later I started having transmission problems. Needless to say I am done with my Chrysler 200.

4980, on 02/24/17 21:31 PM (PST),Anthony ,2016 Chrysler 200 Sedan S 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Great Value on a Great Car!," Although I have owned my 2016 Chrysler 200S V6 AWD for 2 weeks and have a little under 400 miles on the odometer I can say with certainty that I absolutely love this car. Due to my job and being in the North East I needed an AWD vehicle and this Chrysler more than fits the bill. It has a nice and aggressive exterior design and the interior is absolutely fantastic.  The front seats are comfortable and supportive while the controls are within easy reach. I purchased mine fully load with every option available. Heated and ventilated leather front seats, heated steering wheel, blind spot detection, navigation, panoramic moon roof, alloy wheels, rear seat vents and auto start. I traded my Honda Accord Sport for my 2016 Chrysler 200S and have been smiling ear to ear since. Previous to the Honda Accord Sport I owned a Mitsubishi Lance Ralliart that had a turbo charged 2.4 liter 4 cylinder engine yet my Chrysler 200S performs almost as well. Bare in mind that the Ralliart was a sports car and the Chrysler is a family sedan yet the 295 horsepower V6 has plenty of power when needed and the Sport mode will push you back into your seat if you get hard on the gas. 0-60 in about 5.8 seconds is plenty quick for me especially when my Ralliart went 0-60 in 5.5 seconds. Its basically an AWD family sedan muscle car that has a sweet sounding exhaust.   I will say that this car is by no means perfect. The 9 speed automatic transmission can be a bit clunky at times, the stock tires are terrible and rear seat headroom is an issue if you have passengers over 6 feet tall riding in the back. I'm not in love with the braking either as the car is heavy but it my opinion the braking should be more responsive. Perhaps I just need to get used to it. However, when you take over $10,000 in incentives into consideration and can buy a car like this for under $30K it's an absolute no brainer. 3 years 36,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty and 5 years 60,000 miles on the powertrain. If you're like me and are looking for an AWD vehicle that has sharp looks, plenty of cargo room, have little ones and want a vehicle that can get you from 0-60 in less than 6 seconds look no further than the Chrysler 200S AWD V6.

4986, on 10/30/16 15:46 PM (PDT),Ernie ,2016 Chrysler 200 Sedan LX 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),An accurate review from an OWNER," my credit is not good and it was hard finding a used car that was in great shape. After 5 hrs I was ready to give up. Then they bring out this 2016 black chrysler 200 with 10k miles. I drove it and LOVED the experience. I was approved and because they used the same bank as the one I financed my ford in, I was able to get it with NOTHING down. I've had it for 3 months now and I have to say, I LOVE this car. FIRST the drive... I sometimes think my car is off when I'm waiting at a light because it's very quiet but it roars if you mash the gas peddle. It's such a smooth drive and the seats are comfortable. Sometimes my wife drives it and I end up falling asleep. The gas mileage is okay. I just tried ethanol e85 gas after I found out it can take it. Needless to say the milage is much better and the gas is cheaper! Inside the car is great too. Volume and station control are behind the wheel. USB ports, cup holder that slides and reveals a hidden compartment aka STASH SPOT, LOL. Love the touchscreen and my xm/sirus radio. Climate control is amazing as well. Other than the gas which now is better with e85, I can't think of anything that I DON'T like about the car. Beautiful headlights and a beautiful body, I get compliments about my car. I read some reviews and laughed. A guy said he was 5'10 and heavy and it was hard for him to get in and out the car? I'm 5'11 240 lbs and I have no problem. Maybe is seat was to high, and you can change the elevation of the driver seat..some ppl don't care to look at these details and judge it. YOU have to own a car, not rent it, to get a review that is worth reading. I mean, like others have said,I see this car everywhere. if it was a lemon or a bad car,we wouldn't be seeing them a lot.",4

(Note: be careful when renting a car that says something like ""Toyota Camry or similar"" - the ""or similar"" may be a Chrysler 200) The driver's seat took two days to put into a quasi-comfortable position.  The grip to enable the driver to close the door was virtually unreachable, requiring you to nearly get out of the car to reach it. Worse, there seemed to be no way to turn off the radio, only mute it. This became problematic when I'd paired my phone to the entertainment system - the radio had to be on for me to hear my phone's GPS directions, but they were drowned out by whatever station the radio was on. And the radio (as well as the AC) came on as soon as I started the car, no matter how I tried to defeat it. The most incredible thing about this rolling disaster film was the transmission. It was beyond automatic; it was undecided. The car seemed to vacillate as to which gear it most preferred when going up a hill, shifting from low to another gear to another and back to low in a sort of random, capricious style similar to when our then-teenage daughters chose which lipstick to wear. Worst of all, the transmission is controlled by a knob on the center console. A knob! And right next to the transmission knob is another knob that controls the fan speed. It was quite easy to turn the fan up or down and instead turn the transmission knob. I'm confident the designer of the car is named ""Sparky.""",2

4991, on 07/24/16 09:59 AM (PDT),Bill Tabor ,2016 Chrysler 200 Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),A Sporty Sedan That Delivers," Had just purchased this vehicle on July 15th 2016, and at time of purchase really didn't know much about it, but considering the great looks inside and out, a great warranty, and of all the bells/ whistles this vehicles came with, although a little more expensive than the Ford Fusion and other vehicles in its' class, its' cost was justified depending on what you were looking for in a new sedan. The exterior of vehicle is sporty and luxurious in appearance, great body fit, and a flawlessly applied metallic clear coat paint job, not the case of which I ran in to w/ other new vehicles that I've purchased in the past.  Entering the vehicle can be a tight situation depending on your height, this is due to the 200 sedans low roof line which is low/ slopped, and further creating a space/ headroom problem once inside the vehicle for driver/ passengers six feet and taller.  Once inside/ seated I found the design and quality of materials used to make up same was of higher quality vs. competitors, again it was a mix of sport/ luxury which complimented overall appearance of vehicle inside/ out.  The seating was very comfortable and supportive, and making long drives less stressful and satisfying, and short drives fun.  The dash/ console are cockpit like design, and a dial for gear selection inspired by jaguar has taken the place of the traditional hand shifter.  Placement of instrumentation is good, all is within easy sight for driver.  Lighting of same is a nice touch that is easy on the eyes/ enhances the driving experience when driving at night.  What I am disappointed in are the speakers for stereo, I love music and these speakers are only adequate, I soon plan to replace them w/ aftermarket speakers of higher quality/ function. The sliding arm rest on nice sized floor console between driver/ passenger was a nice touch/ convenient, and since my limited lacked to presence of a cd player inside the console will be the right place for me to have one installed. Noise level inside passenger compartment while in operation is near zero other than the normal/ anticipated road noise of tires which is hard to muffle on any vehicle.  Wind noise is absent, ride is super smooth, steering precise along w/ a good feel for the road. Yes, the interior of the Chrysler 200 is smaller/ cramped than Ford Fusion and others, but once inside it's a great driving experience, up-scaled and nice to be in depending on what you're looking for in a sedan as this sedan is not for everyone. Trunk space is large for a sedan of this size, and just getting back to one more exterior feature that I love is the projection headlights that automatically self adjust for night-time driving.  Despite past complaints of the 2015 200 sedan of computer improperly processing commands to the 9 speed automatic transmission while in operation and creating an unpredictable driving experience, ie; lack of acceleration, hesitation of transmission to shift and adjust to normal driving conditions during city/ highway driving, for 2016 it appears Chrysler did correct this matter as from a standing stop from 0-50 mph my 4 cylinders performance is normal/ adequate, and while highway driving the 4 cylinder has more than enough power thanks to the 9-speed automatic, rpm's remain low, top speeds can be unthinkable, drive one and see.  But in ending keep in mind this is not a muscle car and expectations may vary as to performance standard of others.  To me the 4 cylinder engine is ample and responsive, it provides good performance for what it is intended.  If you want more power in this sedan the V-6 comes highly recommended, the call is yours to make, drive one and see.  Although new, I'll remain optimistic of my purchase and overall experience, this is one nice sports sedan that turns heads and meets my present expectations, I would recommend this vehicle to a friend.",4
4992, on 07/14/16 15:34 PM (PDT),oldschool3000 ,2016 Chrysler 200 Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),My 2016 200 limited has the V6 not listed," This car is really handsome.  I bought it from an Audi dealer where it was used as a courtesy car.  Only has 2,600 miles on it and looks brand new.  I really like it.  Mine is black with black.  On the Audi lot it fit in so well among the Audis I couldn't find it when I first showed up to look at it!  The interior is stunning.  I have the moon roof and the largest touchscreen, too.  This is the 90th Anniversary Model.  The seats are cloth but have a very high end look as well.  I did a lot of research before selecting the 200 Limited.  As far as the 9 speed transmission is concerned, my works just fine.  I think issues people seem to be having are more with the 4 cylinder engine which may not have enough torque to really power this tranny.  Another possible explanation could be that we just aren't used to a 9 speed.  It definitely is a different experience than a traditional 5 speed.  The point of this design is fuel economy.  The trans uses the highest gear possible to have the engine run at the lowest RPM possible.   I took it up to 90MPH for a short spell and the tach read 1400 RPM.  There is a slight lag if you suddenly jam down on the gas from cruise speed but the trans sorts it out quickly and let me tell you, it is one powerful engine!  Goes like a mother.  The engine is very quiet at low speed but when you punch it, it lets off a great sounding snarl!   The best part so far for me is that I rarely see another one on the road despite traveling 50 miles per day to and from work.Follow up: It is now June of 2018 and I still love this car.  No failures, no issues , no complaints.  Oh, and it still looks just as good and even better than many newer cars in the parking lot at work.   This is a lot of car for a great price.  Such a shame Chrysler, (and now other brands) are abandoning cars for SUV's and Trucks.",5
4993, on 06/13/16 08:48 AM (PDT),Brian ,2016 Chrysler 200 Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Great car," I really hesitated buying this car given the reviews of the 2015 and the transmission issues people reported; even with over $10,000 in discounts and incentives.  Eventually I had enough of my Elantra and figured I'd go for it.  I am VERY glad I did.  There really is a lot to like in this car.  It rides great, it's very comfortable, and the gas mileage is remarkable.  I'm getting 33 mpg in mixed driving.  Some of the drawbacks are there.  You have to duck a bit to get in because of the styling, but my Elantra had similar styling so I'm used to that.  The rear seat has a little less leg room than the rest of the class, but the only person I regularly put back there is my 9 year old daughter and she's comfortable so that's not a problem for me.  If you have a couple of 6 ft. plus people you regular carry back there make sure you bring them on the test drive.  Also, the A pillar is a little bulky, but it was so big on the Elantra that I could have lot an elephant in it, so again, I'm used to it.The only picky issue I would change is that each time you drive it you have to turn the cruise control on.  It would be nice if it stayed on.It seems that Chrysler has mostly solved the transmission issues or I was lucky enough to get a good one as mine shifts smoothly and most shifts are imperceptible.  Shifting from first to second at low speeds can be a little bigger of an ordeal than necessary, but not so much as to go online and complain about it.Chrysler's issue as I see it, is that they're always in a hurry.  Back in the 80's they NEEDED the minivan to keep the company afloat.  Then in the mid 2000's they NEEDED the 300 to keep going, and a couple years ago it seems they felt they NEEDED the 200.  Because of that rush there were some regular mechanical issues with the 2015 that could have been solved by waiting 6 months to launch the vehicle.  Now it would seem that either I have a good one, or those problems are mostly behind it.  From my experience with my 2016 I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone from a quality standpoint.....but ask me again in 50,000 miles, and again 50,000 miles after that.It's not a perfect car but it is a pretty good one and it fits me and my family just fine.  Especially given the ENORMOUS rebates available now you owe it to yourself to go drive one if you are considering a mid size car.  Just remember with huge rebates comes huge depreciation.  Get gap insurance and plan to keep it for the long haul.UPDATE 8/20/16:I have about 4500 miles on the car and I wanted to update my review.  Everything is still going great with my 200.  Some of the drawbacks are still there; the rear seat didn't get any roomier, but my daughter didn't get much bigger either.  I still have to dip down a bit when i get in, but it's still not a big deal to me.  The cruise control switch still doesn't stay on when you turn the car off, but I've mostly gotten used to it.  Overall it's still doing great.  I had mentioned that some shifts could be rough and indeed they still can be.  The switch from park to drive can be a bit rough.  Generally however I have gotten used to how to apply the throttle to mitigate most of the rough shifts.  It's a quirk but one that is generally manageable. That's something I'd like to expand upon.  The 200 may not have the best test results at the track and because of that it doesn't get great reviews by the experts, but for day to day, go to the grocery store, go to the golf course, drive to work needs, it's perfectly fine.  Some of the quirks are noticeable on a test drive, but are something I've gotten used to and not something I would even consider a problem at all.  I dare say that if I gave you my keys for a week you would notice some quirks immediately, but after the week is over most would not be a huge issue.  Some things may be, if you regularly shuttle around tall folks in the back it may not be the car for you, but overall I think 90% of people will find that it meets 90% of their needs.  No maintenance issues except I'm going in for my 5K service shortly.  And gas mileage is still great; generally around 32-33 combined and easily pushing if not exceeding 40 on the highway.Overall still going great especially for getting such a great deal; over 10K off the sticker price.  I'll try to keep updating this review, maybe at 10K intervals or so.",5

I wasn't looking for an expensive car, need met. The car drives ""OK"", handles, brakes, and features the same. The big problems with this thing is the computer/transmission relationship. IT SUCKS!!!!!  This car doesn't know which gear it wants to be in and at it's worse will just stop for a few seconds (when you need acceleration most) to think about it. Three times I've nearly been in an accident as a result of pulling out hoping for a quick acceleration only to find out that this car would rather think about it. To that I have found a solution should you find yourself in a similar situation (until you can buy yourself out of this dysfunctional relationship). I've been driving in ""L"" or low gear and while my gas milage has suffered a little, the power and acceleration are there when I need it, particularly in stop and go traffic or around town.  (On the open highway, ""D"" works fine.) In low, the computer takes over far before ""red line"" so no need to worry about blowing ANYTHING and it shifts a if it had a ""sport mode"", which it doesn't. SOOOO, now I just hate the car rather than loathing it. Beyond that, given that it's rated the worst car two years running the depreciation is horrific. I hope this helps.",2

(Navigation-Sound Group 1) With my Sirius XM subscription, the touch screen offers a current weather map with forecast/severe weather warnings and nearby gas prices!  I also have the ""Comfort Group""  that has heated seats, steering wheel & remote start.  What is AWESOME during winter months,  when you auto start the car, it automatically activates the heated seats, steering wheel & ups the blower speed on the fan control so your ride is TOASTY when you enter!  Also, you can keep your FOB in your pocket or purse and when you get near the car and place your hand on the door handle, it's unlocks automatically so you don't have to fumble around to open it!   I have the 200 S  model that has the 19"" Hyper Black factory rims with stiffer sport suspension and my choice of vivid pearl blue clearcoat and people don't know if my car is an Audi or a BMW! (snicker)  Let me tell you that V-6  is freaky fast with the 9-speed trans.  Some people complained of ""hard shifting""  which can be fixed with a re-flash at the dealer and the trans will adapt to how ""you"" drive and not the previous owner. (I had that done)  Yes, the back seat is door area is small for adults but this is my personal car and have no problem with that issue. Furthermore, most ""newer"" cars recommend full synthetic oil in their engine designs but thanks to  FCA engineers , only regular conventional oil is required saving $$$ on oil changes!  The front seats  are nice and comfy and the Alpine sound system has a ""surround sound"" mode placing you in a concert hall while motoring around and the 8"" factory subwoofer thumps pretty decent.  I put 3K on my car so far and I LOVE it!    FCA Sergio Marchionne made a mistake by ending production of this car.  FCA should have done a better job in marketing this car to the public by comparing the quickness and sporty lines of the 200 to Audi, BMW and the Suburau WRX as mentioned earlier.  The younger generation would have jumped on this choice of car big time, by advertising the 200's prowess as a sporty racing machine and not a droopy 4 cylinder grocery getter......",5

It seemed adequately powered and comfortable. The back seat at the time was a non-factor, it was really where I just tossed miscellaneous items. I was impressed with the ease of which the infotainment and driver-assistance features worked. In fact, I think it's the best controls and layout I've ever used in a car. It's so simple, clean, and easy. Honestly, I wish I could rip off the center console and put it in a Ford to combat their tiny buttons and confusing features. This car is floaty. Every bump keeps me moving for seconds after. This car, at the end of the day, has its natural habitat on the back of a flatbed. I should've foreseen it. The first week I owned it, my friend hopped in the passenger seat and realized the floor was soaked. The A/C system was leaking from under the glovebox. Once that was fixed, I ran into more serious problems with the car's computer systems. I had to be towed when my car wouldn't get out of first gear. In a 6-speed, I could limp to a dealership. In a 9-speed, that first gear only just gets you going. I was revving in the red going 12 mph. But hey, that was the one time the car was actually moving with one of these problems. The other THREE times it ended up on a flatbed, I couldn't get the car out of park and all these errors were popping up on the driver's display. I'd be the first to admit I drive a lot. I have nearly 70k miles on this car of mostly long road trip thruway miles. But every time I approach the car now, I wonder if it'll start, get into gear, and get me to my destination. Not comforting. I've doubled my car payment and am looking to sell as soon as it's worth more than I owe. Can't wait.",1

I've been driving cars for over sixty five years and most of these new cars today drive very well although some are pretty ugly. My judge of a good car are it's looks, handling, reliability, interior looks and Comfort.  Consumer reports has always from day one beat up on Chrysler products mostly unjustified. Over the years they have pretty well brainwashed car buyers against this brand.  There are always going to be buyers out there who aren't going to be satisfied with what they buy for one reason or another hell some of them told me back in the day I never should have bought my new 57 chev 2dr hdtp so I don't listen to them anymore, I make up my own mind. I will not buy an import though, buy strictly American brand.

Now for the bad: I'm 6'4"" and I can't sit up straight in any of the seats, there are so many blind spots it's actually terrifying to change lanes, the transmission is weird and finicky and the RPMs jump up to 5,000 when going down even a small hill (also if you want to switch from drive to reverse while making a three point turn the reverse won't engage for a couple seconds), all the knobs in the middle console, including the gear shifter are the same size, so it's easy to throw the car into neutral on the freeway if you want to turn the AC down, the temperature controls are buttons so you have to hold them down forever if you want to change the car's climate, the AC also either blows too much or not enough, there's a button on the steering wheel to do voice activated phone calls and if you hit it on accident it goes ""THERE ARE NO PHONES CONNECTED"" super loud over the speakers and takes ten seconds before the music starts playing again, the interior lights and headlights stay on for way too long when you get in the car and don't turn it on, there's no CD player, the backup camera screen is tiny, the car automatically locks when you start driving so you have to constantly unlock it, and it gets terrible gas mileage.",1

Just opt for the bigger engine if buying used.  The higher S and C packages equipped with the V6 and the same 9 speed transmisisons seemed to have mostly 'Dodged' this issue, pun intended.  I still am taking my V6 in to the dealer (unavailable until late October) for the recall maintenance, just to be sure.  The interior and electronics are top notch, especially the upgraded Alpine sound system.  Safety Package (adaptive cruise control, blind spot monitor, lane departure warnings) were valuable included features.  The engine is punchy and provides the power you want and need, but is not anything meant to be ""sports car worthy"" as this is the ""luxury minded"" Dodge branding.  The exterior look and design are what sold me on the car, the rest was icing on the cake.  Me and my wife literally fit inside the trunk (long held cargo space test we use) and we liked the two front seat compartments and additional (lockable) glove box.  Have only had the car for about a month, so no long drives or use of the Navigation yet... but all seem fine.  Yes a 9 speed transmission will have you ramping up and down into many gears at a time, but I wouldn't describe it as ""jerky"".  Resale value on these things suck, but that's mostly due to the stink from the 4 cylinders ruining the great job they did withthe V6's.  I would scrap the 4 cylinder option alltogether...

I've had the vehicle since November of 2014 and it has been a nightmare! The guys at the dealer know me by name as I've been there so frequently. Got a minute? I'll start the list of things I've been dealing with with this nightmare of a car. First, there's been at least 3 recalls which I had to waste my time taking to the dealer to get fixed, but okay, not too upset about that. Next the radio needed to be repaired once, and then replaced the second time it crapped out on me (I have the full package, navigation etc.). Again, I was pleased with the interior design of the car, and accepted that this ""is what it is."" However, what I'm still dealing with is this horrible 9 speed transmission! My car is currently at the dealer being fixed for the FOURTH TIME, for the same issue! The car jerks going from park to reverse or drive, jerks again going from first to second and back down to first, and they just don't seem to have the answer to how to fix it. First time I brought it back, they claimed to have fixed it. A few weeks later, same issue. Brought it back,"" and they attempted to fix it again. Before I left the parking lot of the dealer I was just playing with the gears to test it out, SAME ISSUE! I walked right back inside and said I'm not accepting this car. They took it back in and ultimately replaced the tranny. Now about two months later the problem is back and even worse. I'm about to get a third transmission and the car has less than 25,000 miles on it! The WORST part about this whole ordeal is that the last time they needed to take my $30,000 car for a week for repair, the rental I received was a $17,000 Hyundai Accent. And now they have me in a Chevrolet Spark! (If you don't know, this is Chevy's Smart car) I contacted Chrysler's Corporate and they assured me they would work with my dealer to give me an adequate fix to the car this time (4th times a charm I guess). They also said they would do their best to influence the dealer to put me in a nicer rental, and I ended up with a clown car! So, what do you guys think? You think I can trust that my car will be completely fixed this time around? If I dare brought up that I wanted some type of reimbursement for the fact that I keep being put in a car that is far from what I pay for, they say they cannot help me. I'm just so aggregated, and I'd say rightfully so. Chrysler, I ask you, is this how you stand behind your product? Do you expect to retain customers this way? I used to have a Dodge Charger, and I wanted a Jeep next, and now I think I have to stay away.",1

Engine sounds good when new, beautiful style, feels much more expensive than it is, at first. Then come the never ending rattles, from door panels, pillar panels, vibrations of the engine making cups rattle in the cup holders. The 4 cylinder engine that now sounds like it has a heavy piston tap when at idle in gear with the AC on. ( Don't worry they say, that's the 'Multi Air' System its perfectly normal.) Then comes the real problem, the transmission. Driving the car in the 500 mile ""re-learn"" period after they ""update/flash/reset"" the car drives as normal as it can with so many gears. Once it ""learns your driving"" ( I don't race my car, I drive like a responsible adult, however racing it around like an idiot does make the car seem a bit more normal) the transmission does have a number of lovely added features such as; sudden lunges when downshifting, getting stuck in 3rd gear when coming to a stop to prevent you from accelerating normally through an intersection, half way through it will suddenly drop the transmission into second giving you burst of acceleration (almost like you have turbo lag accompanied by horrendous noise ) , loss of power while making a U-turn on busy roads, lunging forward into garage walls once its put in park. Harsh shifts, are a common experience with this car, if you decide to buy it know that you will often feel like someone is kicking you under your seat as you are driving down the road. You will also experience the loving surge the car has acquired since the last ""reset"" when cruising along at any consistent speed in 4th or 7th gear. I've decided it must be part of a driver alertness package my car wasn't purchased with. Thanks Chrysler for the free upgrade... The car has also had its fair share of ""phantoms"" with the 8.4 Uconnect system,  AC couldn't be controlled, freezing when phone was plugged in to the USB port, now randomly the ghost of Chryslers past (hackers) have come out to allow the Uconnect to mess with my phone if it is plugged into the USB system. I can tell the car to be on radio and it will shift back to play my phone every 2-3 minutes. If i need to charge my phone now I drive in silence with my phone turned off as well. You will meet many new people with your Chrysler 200, if its anything like mine the 10 visits to service in the 15k miles (nearly every 1500 miles, but whos counting I love being without my car, or a loaner) have allowed me to meet nearly every service advisor at both dealerships with in 35 miles of my house. In addition to talking with  number of agents working at Chrysler Customer Care. My newest introduction was to a lovely lady named TRIVIA who works for the customer resolutions department, in a review of Lemon Law dispute with the car. She has a wonderful habit of not answering ANY phone calls, returns voicemails when its convenient and makes appointments with you (at your request) for phone calls which she never makes, or takes when you call her at said time. She must be incredibly overworked at Chrysler in light of the companies poor build quality, and poor customer service standards. It all makes sense now why Chrysler is discontinuing the 200 and Dart. The company will be bleeding money by the time they are done with recalls/ buybacks/ and bad public relations but America will just bail them out again... Your Tax dollars hard at work.",2

Two months later we were back again and they replaced my radio this time, then applied the same updates to the transmission. Every since then the transmission has continued to get worse with the shifting but the service department indicates that Chryslar has to tell them what to do with it.  The radio has started having the same issues and had to be repaired again as well. I understand some of the issues that are beyond the manufacturers control, like the component to the radio that seems to frequently fail but the transmission issues have almost caused me to be hit by another vehicle. This is no longer an issue but it is a safetly concern at this point. As of today the service department has submitted a request to Chryslar for guidance - we will see if anything comes from it.",3
5042, on 06/24/16 19:01 PM (PDT),Middleaged Professional ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Just drive it.," The Chrysler 200 is a step above its competition, especially at this price point.  It’s smooth, stylish, elegant and well-engineered from every aspect inside and out.  My impression is that it is quiet, efficient and a genuine joy to drive.  Being frugal, I drive my vehicles for a long time before replacing them and bought one immediately after a test drive.  I encourage anyone considering a luxurious, fuel efficient classy sedan to simply drive one before passing judgement based on the oddly conflicting reviews (some rave about aspects that others claim to be abysmal) I’ve read or seen here and other places after buying mine.  As for my perspective, I’m a 6’, 200 lb, 40 something professional ($100K+ annual salary) with a graduate degree and most of my family and friends are in the same socio-economic circle.  Myself, family and friends all own, drive or at least ride in sedans ranging from Cadillacs, Mercedes, Buicks and Chryslers to Fords, Chevys, Dodges, Subarus, Kias and Hondas.  Some are brand loyal to a fault and I don’t begrudge them for it.  This is despite the many issues they’ve all experienced privately but don’t speak of openly and certainly don’t write on-line.  Things like serious suspension issues with Cadillacs to catastrophic transmission, engine and electrical failures with Hondas, Mercedes, Subarus and Toyotas.  It’s as though all a dealer or manufacture has to do is call the repair/replacement a “service update” to satisfy them their car is still the best.  Besides, who cares that most of them are dissatisfied with or can’t figure out how to use their navigation systems and electronic interfaces with their smart phones which are designed to make life easier.  FYI – those interfaces all work flawlessly in the Chrysler 200 in my experience so far.  Since buying it, I have heard or read criticisms ranging from poor quality manufacturing (panel gaps? I’ve seen far worse in Hondas) and materials, to tight, uncomfortable interior (one was a ridiculous clown like attempt to fold themselves into the same back seat I can effortlessly get into, out of and ride in comfortably), a ride so bad you couldn’t stand in it for more than 30 minutes before needing an ambulance rescue and even a claim of dangerous handling characteristics.  I think if you just drive one and judge it for yourself based on the merits of your own impressions that you’ll be pleasantly surprised and may buy one, just like I did.  Update: 6 months and 6,000+ miles later, I like the car more than ever and have received nothing but compliments so far.  Although the ride and handling are excellent, I do feel the factory tires should give a more quiet ride in this car and I'll replace them with something else when the time comes.  My fuel economy has increased from an an average 27.5 mpg to 30.5 in the mixed driving do and I've seen a high of 35mpg on a mostly highway drive one weekend through the mountains.  That drive impressed me not only with economy but also with how much speed and power the car had at altitude and how smoothly the base engine and 9 speed transmission pair.",5
5043, on 06/24/16 11:11 AM (PDT),Richard Kelly ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan S 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),How can anyone like this thing!?," I am currently driving the 200 as a replacement for my Acura TL SH-AWD Tech+ (not an applicable replacement, but its free) during the airbag recall. Enterprise gave me this 200 for a 6 week duration and I absolutely hate it. The transmission in this vehicle had me scared the car was damaged, but apparently that is just how these transmissions are. Beware of the slew of knobs - including the gear select - that are all huddled together as well. I have also been having an issue with keeping the car at a steady speed on the PA Turnpike, the gear ratios seem seem to lag around and be unpredictable.  It is just a really cheap vehicle, I understand it is a mid-size and is not intended to be my TL, but this thing is just a cheap mess of bad build materials and quality, poor mechanics, and poor ergonomics.",1

I have had some American models but through this Chrysler 200 LX 2.4L is just a low type of vehicle I ever had. I do like the interior, lights systems, and instrumentals. However,  the engine handles not really good on the highway especially on the high speed (70mph+). I thought it is heavy type of sedan it should of handle pretty good, but nope it can't even beat 2.0L Ford Focus SE. Well, it is Ford so it might sound worse about how the appearance looks, but Ford now is a lot better and changed to the way the world supposed to.This 200 does give a hesitate during idling basically on the service road speeds, while you are stuck in the traffic, then when you try to idling to maintain speed, it's just immediately, woof out of no where that almost hit the car in front of it.Overall, I don't really like the car that much.",3

In drive mode traction control is present and shifts are geared to give the car it's excellent fuel economy. Power is also accessible in D, but the transmission sometimes has to think about it. I have learned to put the transmission selector in Sport mode when I need responsiveness. I love the fuel economy. I love the power, especially in sport mode.  Everything else is excellent.",5

But overall, it's just not there yet. There is an emphasis on outward style, without the inside matching what is outside. Yet, there are definitely things about this car that excel. Driving in slow traffic is easy. The acceleration is good. Visibility with the side mirrors is excellent. But it's simply not as refined as the BMW/Mercedes standard. It's the little things. Some things are unnecessary. Like the cruise control that tells you that it's ready to put the cruise control on. BMW and others have a symbol. That's all that's really necessary. The rear window visibility is poor. The acceleration on the vehicle is excellent, but not quite BMW. The main difference, though, and what makes this very American, is that driving at speeds higher than 60 or 70 in this car is dangerous and unstable. This is typical of American cars. It has electronic steering, which makes it very easy to steer and turn when making turns when backing in and out and in parking situations. But unfortunately, this translates to sloppy and dangerous steering at high speeds. You have to keep your hands on the wheel. You can feel the car go from side to side when you just turn the steering wheel very little, for example, when driving at 60 or 70. It's unacceptable. Because BMW and Mercedes have designed their cars to travel safely at high speeds for decades, it's not a big deal. But for American cars, this is make or break. There are some cars that do well at this. But not many of them are American. And this car is not one of them.",3

5051, on 03/10/16 08:56 AM (PST),Bodega Bay Bill ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan C 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Best Sedan I have Ever Owned," As a point of reference, my wife and I have owned many Nissans over the years, including the Maxima and Murano. Consumer Reports typically gives very high ratings to these two cars yet they hate the 200. Sorry, but I have no idea what they are thinking. The biggest gripes seem to be the transmission and the rear seats. Okay, the transmission has perhaps too many (9) gears, although I do get a perverse pleasure out of saying to people, ""what, you only have 8 speeds?"" I use the paddle shifters, which makes the transmission perform much better. This car is quite fast compared to similar vehicles. My car has AWD which adds a few tenths to the 0 - 60 dash. Consumer Reports never tested the AWD version, which handles superbly. The rear seat is not that bad and certainly is comparable to the competition. If you want a roomy back seat buy the 300! I have sat in the back of quite a few cars that get better ratings and there is very little discernible difference. Measurements don't lie. Compare the rear legroom to other cars and you will see that the 200 is right up there with similar vehicles. I love the interior. The 8.4"" infotainment system is hands-down one of the best you will find anywhere. Steering wheel controls (paddle shifters!) are intuitive and easy to use. Seats are very supportive without being too snug. I have the heated seats and all-wheel drive and have driven this car in the snow - no problems at all. Our Murano does better but of course it has much larger tires with deeper lugs. The suspension is a little soft, but then this is the ""C"" and not the ""S"" model. I personally don't want to be pounded by potholes and the 18"" wheels are a good compromise. And despite the 295 HP and all-wheel drive, I can easily achieve 30 to 31 MPG on the highway. Fantastic!This car seems to be rather polarizing but I have no regrets after 34 months of ownership.",4

It has been awesome since day 1, Dealer serviced every 5k miles, $75 to change the oil on this car. Purchased the lifetime oil change package and an extended 7y/100k warranty. It's very good, We love driving it got the upgraded 8.4 inch screen. We love the Technology this car has and great gas mileage took a trip to Idaho from Oregon and got 38 mpg. The 9 speed transmission can be a little slow and clunky sometimes but my 6 speed fusion was very similar. I swapped out the standard noisy poor riding Ecopia tires for better Les Schwab premium tires at around 12 thousand miles, tinted the windows, The ride is very smooth and quiet, handles better. I think this car was a Good value for the money and the features are outstanding.  Even though Chrysler is stopping production of this car soon. I will be looking at probably changing vehicles in the future; but overall very happy with this vehicle so far, looks stunning. only have had to go to the dealer for the uconnect system update other than regular maintenance. very on top of that",4

The transmission and electronics on the other hand need a lot of work. I had this car for a month and had to have it towed due to transmission failure. It was fixed under warranty but customer service was terrible. I called multiple times and was put on hold every time for so long that the sales department kept answering and retransfering me to the service department. It was winter time when i had the vehicle and the traction was terrible in the snow. The antilock brakes failed, visibility is terrible and there was front end problems. The transmission after being serviced shifted very hard in the cold weather. Fuel economy was not good at all. I was getting about 20mpg city and 29mpg highway with this car. I will never buy a Chrysler product again. I got rid of it and got a Subaru Crosstrek instead and I am glad I did because its a great vehicle.

I told them if they wouldnt stand by their own product, how could anyone else? They will not stand by their product, so neither am I. I will never own another, and am in the process of working out how I can get rid of every single one. The Honda CRV looks nice, I think we'll be going that route.",1

I have not had my car for a year and the check engine light came.  I went to pepboys the hooked the machine to it and told me it was a sensor.  I took it to the dealer.  My second issue was the fact that the shifter could move while I was driving.  I was trying to turn up the radio and turned the shifter my car went into reverse with out pause.  I explained this to the repair manager he did not respond.  Before I got home after them having my car a week the check engine light was back on.  Days after that the car dash said something about a throttle and the engine was overheating.  Now the ne light is the RED one that said trans trouble service the shifter.

5058, on 01/28/16 07:47 AM (PST),Stingraybike ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan C 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Fantastic car for money," I have owned this car since buying it new in August of 2014.  I was replacing a tired 17 year old car. I had looked at many brands and i just would find myself back at the Chrysler website.  I had a set price point and I knew what features I wanted and ones that i didn't. As i would look at many different brands they just could not hit the price point i wanted, especially when it came to a fully loaded car. I also love the design they really hit it out of the park. I bought her fully loaded with the tigershark engine in the mid 20's, nobody was willing to touch that price point.  I was a little hesitant to buy a four cylinder since i was used to driving a six. I will admit after testing it, it was a little underwhelming but I was willing to give it a shot. From time to time I wish I would have looked more at the V6, but now after owning it as long as I have I am used to the power and know when and how to give it the juice to get the right pickup that I need. I have had no engine or powertrain problems it has been flawless. the trans is can be rough from time to time and may hunt a little and when stopping and starting from a stop it is a little rough as it does not kick down to 1st quick enough in my eyes but if you are making a proper stop by the rules of driving than it is fine. I love the interior features and options. Seats are comfortable, the rear seating can be a little cramped for a taller person but I bought it for myself and it is great for me. The size of the 8.4 screen is perfect. I like that most of the features are accessed through the screen and are well laid out and labeled.  I have had a few hiccups at the beginning with the Uconnect  infotainment system but nothing that didn't fix itself within a few min but overall it is fantastic.   It will also read and write text messages for you which is great.  I like the digital gauge cluster, it gives you all of the info you need along with turn buy turn info to help you navigate. The buttons and switches are well laid out, I like the rotary gear shifter, a lot of people don't like it but from moving from a manual transmission car all the automatic gear shifters are toys and a waste of space. The  headlights and fog lights provide perfect visibility and turn on when needed due to the auto light feature.  In terms of driving,  It took me a little time getting used to visibility but i have 0 problems now.   If i had any bones to pick it would be the lack of a CD player, but i am just old school. I have the panoramic sunroof and I love that feature on this car. The premium sound system is great. I love the remote start on this car as the heated seats will kick on if the temp outside is below 40 deg and the A/C will kick on if it is hot out.  As for the exterior i opted for the 19"" wheels, I love how she looks with the 19""s, I did also buy a set of winter wheels and tires as I wanted better winter traction and I didn't want all the salt from the Chicago winters to corrode those nice wheels.  To me the AWD would be nice but for me it is not needed as I have been driving in chicago winters all my life. I have only had two warranty issues , one was a turn signal that was collecting water, and the sunroof cover would pop off track, both were replaced without a problem. Other than a few small things this car has been fantastic. I have seen some reviews with people experiencing some pretty bad problems with them but luckily I have not experienced any. I would not let those few problematic reviews keeping you from considering this car.  I feel they did their homework and the design is fantastic. I love driving this car and always have to give it the lookback when you are walking away from it.",4

The car has the means to fit anyones needs..Now I do wish this car had more room to breath with power the 4cyl 2.4 def has the get up an go but the 9 speed tranny really holds it back and keeps it clunky more than 40 per of the time.. taking corners can be alittle sketchy but overall not to bad.. road noise was good and it glides over imperfections in the road..I really wasn't a thrilled owner after 3 weeks of having the car and at barely 600 miles I had to send car in for a new tranny and headliner due to it buckled and creased front to back on driver side.. I was startingto think this was a bad purchase.. but I took a breath and figured all new cars have there hickups from time to time.. but now with the new tranny in I started to notice even more roughness with the tranny esp when coming to a stop it seems to want to buck u around like a bull at a rodeo now Chrysler says this is normal for this style and not to worry.. kinda makes you wonder with that response..now entering the car can be tricky esp if your a tall person.. I'm only 5'7 and have hit my head couple times already.. the a beams are very oversized and can block your view..  fuel economy isn't bad currently getting 33.6 highway so not far off from there projected 36.. rear seats and legroom.. this Is where your eyes can play tricks til you actually get in.. and tend to notice foot room is bare minimal and comfort lacks just alittle...My overall rating on this would be 6 out of 10.. style is great but I'm very unsure if Chrysler should stick with there 9 speed tranny.. For the money not bad but sometimes i wonder am i really getting what i truly thought i was.. guess only time will tell..,3
5063, on 12/01/15 12:19 PM (PST),john sweatman ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan C 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Word to the wise! 2015 Chrysler 200 c fwd," First 4200 miles car serviced for hard starting and two times for transmission failure. Before 6000 miles got recall to replace entire trans-axle unit; however, Chrysler advised it would be six months minimum before providing replacement unit. My car could not be driven but Chrysler had plenty of units for their ""state of the art"" assembly line. After much ado we managed to shorten time to about six weeks. 10/23/15 received recall on connector which may stall engine or shift tranny to neutral while underway with no warning. Chrysler has known of this since 2/13/15 according to NHTSA but still no part to correct this dangerous  situation.  Based on conversations and performance I am convinced their priority is assembly and sales- not the well being of those who purchased their product in good faith. This has been my worst new auto experience in my 70 years of life . Sorry for the wordiness but this is the SHORT version.  12/11/2016.  We've had four recalls so far and other issues as well.  Three of the recalls according to Chrysler could result in injury or death should they occur.  All have been resolved ( I hope)  but not in a timely manner or with any sense of urgency in my opinion.  Our feelings have not changed .  THIS IS OUR FIRST AND LAST FIAT PRODUCT !!!",2

5065, on 11/25/15 09:37 AM (PST),Ryan ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan C 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),1 Year Review," I am coming up on owning this vehicle for 1 year now.  I have the C level trim with AWD and it has not been disappointing.  Having come from only SUV's, I was not sure how well I would like adjusting to a sedan especially in snowy and wet weather.  I did my due diligence in test driving almost every car in this segment, and this one stood out more than any of them.  The most appealing for myself was having AWD and the V-6 as well as a very nice interior that is comfortable to drive on long trips and my daily commute to work that is 41 miles round trip.  I really appreciate the reviews I see on here that actually tried other cars for comparison and other trim models.  If I only went off the base model rentals cars I have had in the past, there would be some pretty terrible reviews but unjust reviews.  You really need to try the 6 cylinder versus the 4 to get your own opinion, but it has more power and boost than any v-8 I have owned in the past.Looks (Exterior & Interior):  Looks I feel are like comedy...very subjective.  At very first look, I loved the rear end lines and tail lights on this car.  I was not as much of a fan of the front end. What I did love about the front was the LED running lights that really stand out.  As far as the interior goes, I couldn't be happier.  The Nappa leather with heated/cooled seats as well as the hand stitched leather steering wheel that is heated is wonderful!  The remote start (which many other brands will have as well) is amazing for those hot and cold days, as your car knows what to automatically adjust to warm or cool the car.  The navigation Uconnect 8.4 is very easy to use and has great traffic and weather outlooks and updates, as well as letting you know when your favorite sports team is playing and the score.  The panoramic sunroof is one of my favorite options that really opens up the ride.Performance:  The quickness of the v-6 has been very impressive.  I have not had any issues with any weird shifts with the v-6 so I am not sure if that is more of problem with the 4 cylinder but something I would recommend driving both.  I drive mostly in dead stopped traffic both ways and will end up around 23-26MPG.  When I actually get to do more freeway and long trips over the mountains, I will average around 32-34 mpg. The second day of ownership I had to drive over the mountains to the central part of the state in very large snow storm.  I was very nervous coming from Jeeps that have always fared me well with their 4wd and ground clearance.  Again, I was very surprised!  This model uses the same base AWD system that the Jeep Cherokee uses and handles great.  I have had zero slipping issues and control as been spot on. I am not recommending this as an off road AWD rig, again this is just a 4-door sedan.  But if you are looking for something that is extremely safe and handles snow and other bad weather well than this works great.  The 9-speed that is made by ZF which also makes the same tranny's for Bentley, Rolls Royce, Maserati (sister brand) etc...  I was very concerned about so many gears, but this 9-speed has been 100 times better than my previous 5-speed Mercedes transmission that was always clunking into gear especially on hills.ConclusionThis 200 and a complete 180 from the previous generation and has made leaps and bounds to make it one of the tip rated in safety, and interior qualities.  The combination of the Jeeps AWD system, ZF transmission, same chassy and brake calipers as the alpha Alfa romeo Giulia (check out the 2017 model), and the award winning interior made by Chrysler has been a great combination.  The lane detection feature has been great, and will easily put your car back in the lane if you drift.  The park sense has many levels of sensitivity and has done a great job keeping me from scraping my wheels and has stopped my car completely in a parking lot when a car was rushing behind my car backing out.  The self parking either parallel, or backing in is a nice feature but not something I use too often.  The automatic cruise control has been great for long trips on the freeway as it will adjust your speed according to the car in front of you and the car spacing you set it too.  I have read a lot of issues with complaints on the rear head room.  This is another issue I have seen on other cars and is more of an issue if you plan to haul a lot of adults.  I am not a tall individual at 5'10 and have had no issues.  My friends are all around 6'3 and will definitely be more cramped in the rear.  Luckily we typically never ride together as we all have our own cars.  For kids, I have used this numerous times to haul my niece and nephew and getting the car seat in and out was not difficult at all.At the end of the day anyone's taste as far as looks are subjective.  But I would highly recommend at least trying to test drive this model, especially the C trim. MSRP was around 38K, and got it with no money down for $28,995 with every option.",5
5066, on 11/14/15 23:02 PM (PST),John Donaldson ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan S 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Rented for a week," I found the Chrysler 200 4Cyl to have noticeable shift points, poor gas pedal response, poorly placed controls (shift knob, headlight switch), the sound system turned on every time I started the car even though I turned it off previously. The rental car lacked basic features of most large cars today such as Auto climate controls.Trunk space was adequate, engine power was good after a lag when depressing the gas pedal.The driver's headrest was about 1"" too far forward for me, making this the drop dead feature for me not to buy a Chrysler 200.I would not recommend this car for purchase or lease.",2

The good and the bad: The upper backrest of the driver's seat squeaks. Every little change in throttle and braking elicits a reminder that Chrysler needs a wee bit more development budget. The seats are brilliantly comfortable and contribute to forgetting the noise. The sunglasses holder also makes an occasional annoying rattle sound. Everything else is still awesome. Engine, AWD, fabulous dash, huge trunk and head-turning bodywork and wheels make this a truly enjoyable daily driver. A Benz owner asked me if it was a Tesla! *******Purchased new in May '15 and have 12,250 as of Nov 1st so yes, I have piled on the miles. Traded in an aging '09 Audi A8L, so my basis for comparison is a highly ranked luxury sedan. Driving DynamicsThere is a bit of a mixed bag here. The star of the show is the engine. Step on it, and it pulls. Let up, step on it again, and it pulls harder. Cruising at 90 and stomping on it gets you to 110+ RIGHT NOW. It is amazing. Every bit as fast as the Audi A8L. The brakes are confident with minimal if any fade. Handling is good, not great. ""Sport"" mode seems to just make the steering feel heavier, not more inspiring. ""Sport"" mode does the usual transmission shift adjustments, and it does them very well. It also makes the car feel more like a rear-wheel driver as it disengages the traction control and makes it feel tossable. The 9 speed tranny does occasional hunting, and will sometimes stay in a lower gear going down hills. But it also turns less than 2700RPM at 110MPH. I remember my '86 GTI droning on at 3500rpm at 70mph all the way to Florida. On several Pittsburgh to Richmond trips, a rather mountainous journey, the 200S returned an unbelievable 31.5mpg, and that's with spirited driving at sustained 85+. The suspension is taught, and the 19"" wheels take a bit of the magic-carpet-ride feel away. But it is not unpleasant. Finally, there is the exhaust note. It is mean, nasty, gnarly, growlingly perfect. Perfect.ConcernsObviously the reliability issue rears its ugly head as we really don't know how this purring lion is going to hold up. I'm already experiencing a squeak from, of all places, the upper seat back of the drivers seat. At 6'1"" and 185lbs I am certainly not taxing the capability of the seat too much.My other concern is the rear view mirror is so big it can actually block an SUV sitting at an intersection. I am forced to duck my head down to see under it. And yes, I've moved the seat down. **June 2016** Chrysler once again screwed me by announcing production is moving to Mexico and keeping their lease residuals ridiculously high on this car, so my $35k car in 18 months is now worth $16k at trade in. Thanks!! In 2001 when I bought their brand-new minivan they then sold it in fleets and my trade in percentage was even less! Sorry, but never ever again Chrysler. On the styling front, sad to say I can't distinguish the 200 from the Kia's and Huyndai's on the road. Say hello to my new Cadillac CTS4 with Performance Package that runs circles around the 200, is highly distinctive, and not an embarrassment to hand over to the valet.**May 2017** Recently searching for a car for my daughter, I happened upon used Chrysler 200s' in the 35-50k range selling for $13-$15,000. No retained value whatsoever! Reinforces my decision to dump the 200 was a good one. Cadillac runs superbly...**May 2018 Sorry America, your cars just don't seem to last. Goodbye, CTS and Hello another Audi A8.... a car that epitomizes fine motoring.",5
5068, on 11/02/15 17:12 PM (PST),Rod Reichardt ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan C 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Great Car Flying Under the Radar!," We needed a car for my son who just got his drivers license. It needed to be safe, reliable, economical, and all the other things a parent looks for in their child's car. My son wanted a car with leather, nav, good audio system, good looks and ""cool wheels"". Oh, it also needed to be under $20,000. Impossible? I wasn't hopeful but started by perusing cars on Carmax.com. After a few hours I noticed a trend of nicely equipped Chrysler 200s right in the range I was looking for. I read a few online reviews and began to realize that this car is one of the few great deals of the current car market. I realize hat styling is very subjective but I think this is a great looking car. The MSRP of the 200C we settled on was $12,000 over the asking price at Carmax of $19,998. It had 3200 miles on it. It is front wheel drive with the 2.4 liter ""Tigershark"" 4 cylinder with the 9 speed auto and the optional 19 inch wheels. Not a fast car, but certainly not slow either. The full leather interior is good quality. Not quite Aston Martin or high end Audi but very nice. The 8.4"" Uconnect infotainment system is really, really good. I wish there were physical buttons for the heated seats but the menu is only one layer deep on the screen so it's not much of an issue. The optional Alpine stereo sounds decent. It has a claimed 506 watt amplifier which provides decent bass.  The voice control and Bluetooth are really good. I had the 8.4 Ucinnect in a 2013 Ram 1500 and the firmware seems much better now. It seems quicker and much less buggy than the earlier version. The messaging works fine with my Galaxy Note 5 but not with my son's iPhone 6S. This car will cruise all day at 80-85 (we live near Texas Highway 130 which only has two speed limits; eighty and eighty-five. After a few hundred miles we are getting an average of 26-27mpg. Most of my son's driving is around town so I am happy with the mileage so far. I was not expecting much from th 2.4 liter power plant but it seems perfect in this application. Acceleration is just fine and it s quiet. The little sound you do hear is nice. Not at all rough like some fours in midsize cars. The only complaint I have about this car is the transmission. Th 9 speed will occasionally throw out a rough shift or shift too slowly. Sometimes it will hunt for the right gear. Hopefully the software will get better with time like it did in the Uconnect system. The car was new in January of 2015 and there is no record of it ever going back to a dealer. I have no idea if there are any updates for this transmission but I will be looking into it. It's not a big issue though. I have never noticed it when I have been driving. My son is a little less decisive in his application of the throttle so that may be a contributing factor. You can probably tell that we are very happy with this purchase. We like it so much that my wife wants to get one. I think the low used price is partly due to the ""rental car"" nature of the previous generation of this car. I rented a 2014 just a few months ago and felt exactly like a cheap rental car. The new generation feels anything but cheap. The build quality seems really high. When you're driving it it does not feel at all like a generic mid sized car. It feels a little ""special"".  I was not expecting that at all. The 200C is punching way above its weight. I have been shopping new ones for my wife and AWD V6 models with radar cruise control and every option in the book are selling for under $30,000. The only negatives I can think of are the slightly balky transmission and relatively poor resale value. I imagine they will eventually get the programming right in the transmission. If you're worried about the resale just buy used. This is the best I have felt about a car purchase in years. I neve dreamed we could find such a great car for such a great price. Definitely 5 stars from us.",5
5069, on 10/28/15 21:44 PM (PDT),dccarshopper@gmail.com ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan S 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Rating from a long time Honda/Acura Owner," Totaled my Acura RL on the highway. This rating is based on a car rental of the Chrysler 200 for 2.5 weeks. I am a long time Japanese car driver. I have rented Ford Mustangs, driven Ford Fusions ect. I never thought once about a Chrysler and this is the first time I have driven one in my life. I have driven some american made cars like Ford Taurus, Pontiac Grand Am.  I have driven Lexus, bmw.I have to say, for a medium size sedan this car has decent acceleration, the drive is nice and the interior and body styling has a nice clean look. It does not have as much horsepower as my rl. But for a 4 cylinder this car can go when you need it to in traffic. I saw one on the road earlier this year and thought it looked great. I really thought this car was the size of my wife's civic. But, when I parked next to it, the car is almost the size of a Honda Accord. It takes up more space in my garage than the RL. The exterior body style has some bold and larger shapes to it than I am used to. So it throws me off a little when I try parking it. That is just a personal thing that one can get used to easily. The voice commands are easy to follow. The technology in this car is also easy to figure out rather quickly. Without reading any manual I figured out bluetooth, radio, media, voice calling ect. It is much easier to figure out than the Ford Fusion, which I am still baffled about. I didn't have time to read the owners manual driving 100 plus miles per day sometimes. I drove this car 1500 miles in 2 weeks. So, I put it to the test. The one thing I found quirky was in the voice command it is difficult to navigate to send a text message. It is easy to respond to one. But it asked me for some predefined responses to incoming text messages sometimes. And then sometimes the voice commands work, sometimes it shuts off and makes a weird noise.  I think this all could be cleared up if I had time to read the book. But for the most part, the systems in the car were easy to figure out. And this is my first upgraded car with newer wireless and blue tooth since 2004. The model was  a 2002 I last owned. Last new car we bought was in 2010. Cars have come a long way.Cons: the hazard light button is directly underneath the center graphic console where you access the radio/ media source ect. I found that while i was fidgeting in traffic with the radio the hazard lights would come on. I probably turned them on by accident about 15 times over the course of two weeks. They need to move that somewhere further away from a high traffic hand area. The other part that I don't necessarily like is the compartment that is underneath the console in the middle of the front seats. It is hidden underneath and a little difficult to access. Especially when I commute nearly 3 hours a day. I need to pay full attention all the time I am driving so this is not the best place for a compartment when i need to grab things. However, it does have a nice slick look to where you can't see that console. So, function is my main priority, but if you like slick looks then it does look very nice.Last thing I disliked, I felt like there was a lack of areas to put things I need access to. I commute a ton so I have to bring a bunch of things with me. I had piles of stuff on top of every surface. Even the cup holders that had cups in them had things piled on them. And when the wife took a ride I had to take the entire seat full of things out. The other cars ive owned have had bigger center consoles along with a slightly better thought out configuration that is a little more space efficient. Not a huge biggie for everyone. But when I drive hours to job sites. I need ease of access and efficiency. One thing I will say though, when I was younger I would have been in the market for a car more like this. I would say 20s to 30s. I can take a guess on price and personally I think this is  a great car for the money. The interior I had only had some trim leather. The seats were fabric but the wheel and some other areas had leather. The seats were very comfortable. The black powder coated metal along with the chrome accent inside has a really nice look to it. Aesthetically, this car is really nice. Even though much of the interior is plastic, the designers thought it out. The positives far outweigh the negatives and I feel this is a great family car. This rental has  given me a great first impression of Chrysler.  I never really thought much about a chrysler or even contemplated ever driving one. I will say, this makes me want to test drive a Chrysler 300. The new styles they have out look very slick. It is one of the best looking cars on the road.  The entire time I was test driving hybrids due to needing great epa for the driving. I drove a brand new 2016 Ford Fusion Hybrid. This is also a very nice car, drives well and has a nice slick look. I think both the chrysler and Fusion have a really nice look to the body style.  The car is peppy and fun.",4

5071, on 09/06/15 17:16 PM (PDT),Steven Wikoff ,2015 Chrysler 200 Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Love this 200 Limited!," I have only just started driving this car as I just bought it this week, but I am in love with this car! It has everything I want and need At a very reasonable price point. I have owned many cars over the past 25 years, and they all have had their good points, but this 200 has it all in spades! There really isn't much to get excited about in the midsize sedan market, but the 200 maybe the game changer. I have been a loyal Nissan customer for 20 years. Overall I have found their vehicles to be reliable, attractive and a very good price-to-performance value. Most recently I owned a 2013 Nissan Murano and liked the car, but the mileage was terrible. I went for the bigger smoother V6 with AWD, but the gas was killing me and really much more room than I needed as primarily I used it as a commuter. So, after my car was totaled in a freak accident (nobody hurt but the car), I unexpectedly came on to the new car market. I knew I needed to downsize a bit, but I did not want a compact car, as they are just too small for my 6 foot frame. I am a little spoiled and want and expect all the bells and whistles, yet I had to have good gas mileage as I have a long commute everyday. I rented a 2015 Nissan Altima, and was fairly satisfied with it, not excited, but it felt solid, so I was going to go ahead and get it. Then I heard about the Chrysler 200. We had one of the first 300's on the market in 2005 and loved-it, but had to sell it for a mini-van for the kids. So having had a very good experience with Chrysler in the past, I decided to check out the new 200 before I bought the Altima. Am I glad I waited! The 200 blew away the Altima in every way! The body style was modern, Euro-classy, yet sporty. The interior appointments made the Nissan look cheap and even bad in comparison. When I compared the 200 Limited to the Altima S, it was a no- brainier. I would have to go up to the SV In an Altima and pay fairly more to get the same in the 200 Limited for much less cash. The only area I believe the Altima was better was the 4-cylinder engine was a bit more peppy, but not by much, and the engine noise was noticeably worse in the Nissan. The Chrysler is so much more refined and the interior fits like a glove. Chrysler was also offering fantastic incentives that made the purchase extremely attractive financially. Mileage is great, the center console system is attractive and very easy to use. It maybe the perfect commuter car ever! If you are thinking about an Altima, Accord, or Camry, do check this car out first as you may find, like I did, that it really can't be beat, and even is exciting!",5

5074, on 07/22/18 15:31 PM (PDT),Steinar Andersen ,2013 Chrysler 200 Convertible Limited 2dr Convertible (3.6L 6cyl 6A),An upgrade to my previous 08 Sebring Tring HT vert," I previously had a silver/grey 2008 Chrysler Sebring Touring Hardtop convertible (with most of the Limited's options). So upgrading to a red/cream 2013 200 Limited Hardtop convertible was pretty straight forward (all controls and features are basically the same). Except, the 200's materials are much nicer than the previous Sebring's plastic finishes.  The 200's 3.6 Pentastar/6 speed tranny combination (with autostick) was a pleasant surprise compared to the previous 2.7/4 speed tranny combination from 2008. No more hunting of gears while on hilly terrain with the 200. The entertainment/gps system was also slightly improved and unlike the manufacturers constant need to further complicate infotainment systems (I have a 2017 Pacifica that has a HUGE manual needed to find everything for its infotainment system), the 730 stereo has enough fun features without being overly complicated. The 200 also rides quieter. The cherry red exterior and cream interior is a striking color combination, and looks nicer than most other convertibles. The hardtop feature of the convertible is what wins with me due to better security, quieter ride, and the ability to drive in the winter without worries of the snow load during storms (only the Volvo and VW Eos had this feature but like the 200 convertible, they also no longer manufacture a hardtop convertible anymore).... otherwise, I'd have looked at the Mustang or Camaro convertible. Unfortunately, Chrysler stopped making these Hardtop convertibles in 2015.... so I bought this used 2013 to last me another 15 years as there is nothing being sold now or on the horizon that compares. The 2013 is the epitome of the three and a half generations of the Sebring/200 convertibles (1996-2014), and unless Chrysler starts making another one..... all I can say to the person looking for a good used convertible, is to buy a good example of a 2013/2014 Limited or S Hardtop convertible. You won't be sorry (just make sure you get an extended bumper to bumper warranty for piece of mind). I bought this one with 96,250 miles for $13,250 (including the 5 yr/60,000 mile ""premium"" warranty)...... and I consider it the best buy out there for a hardtop convertible. Bar none.",5

I only have 2000 miles on it, so I can't comment on reliability. The powertrain is a gem - the Pentastar V6 is smooth and powerful and emits a nice thrum when accelerating, and the 6-speed transmission eagerly serves up downshifts. Fuel economy is so-so - 16 MPG around town and 29-30 MPG on a trip. The interior is impressively quiet with the soft top up - as quiet as many conventional sedans I've driven. My only complaint is the front seating - the lumbar bulge is much too big and much too high, which means I have to recline the seat, and the leg room is a bit skimpy for tall drivers. ",4.375

The rear window is small and the headrests on both right and left rear seats block two-thirds of your view. I have to keep the backseats down to see safely. The exceleration is unpredictable. From a stopped level position you can excelerate and the car will either lunge forward or barely excelerate.  The interior is cheap. My passenger side electric window control fell off the door and was hanging by its wires. The plastic chrome coating is chipping off the interior door handles and cut my finger.  With the front wheel drive in this car, you hear a lot of noise from the front suspension but checks out okay. I owned a 2002 Chrysler Concorde LXI for 12 years and it was a far superior product.  It saved my life when T-boned by a truck. This 200 Touring sedan is pure junk.",3

5088, on 06/12/16 17:38 PM (PDT),Matt Maloney ,2013 Chrysler 200 Sedan Touring 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Going on 3 yrs owning," I bought this car used from Armory Garage in Albany NY as a certified pre owned with 14,500 miles and paid $14,800.  It was previously a fleet vehicle, so there were a few minor scratches.   The dealer buffed out the car best they could, but I knew what I was getting considering what I paid for the car.  I'm 5'6"" so this car fits me pretty good.  It's quite peppy and accelerates excellently.   This car, V6, is quicker than the Camry and Honda sedan in my opinion.  It's performance is fairly decent.  I've owned the car for almost 2.5 years now and put about 30k miles on it.  There's been no repairs necessary to date mechanically speaking.  I did have the front hood replaced under warranty as it was beginning to bubble near the front.  I think the car was in an accident (and the fact hidden from me) thus the bubbling edges on the hood and low price I got it for it, but the body guy told me he's seen it on others as well.  The other clue was the gap between the hood and grill vary from one side to the other.  I drove this car from NY to FL and back and it did not let me down. Pros:Acceleration, handling, easy to maneuver and park in the city,  getting up to speed entering highways, stylish looking enough. Cons:  Rotors.  The rotors had to be replaced at 18k miles due to shaking when braking downhill, and now at 44k the pads and rotors are almost due again.  The warped rotors first time around could have been a result from the car being a rental prev.  Only 2 ports for charging/plug in gps .  (Touring Model)Blind spot.  This car seems to have more of a blind spot than other cars I've driven.  Extra caution must be used when changing lanes.Automatic gear selection.  At times it seems the car chooses a lower gear than I would like when going up an incline, it tends to bog a bit.  A quick step on the gas solves that problem downshifting the vehicle and delivering more than enough torque.  (Or slap shift is available as well).  Slowing down to an almost stop will occasionally make the transmission slam between 1st and 2nd gear, but no worries.Trunk Space.  The trunk is smaller than most.  I couldn't fit a snow shovel in it so it had to go in the back seat area. Seats.  The cloth seems cheap but nothing a cover won't solve.  They are comfortable enough and the power seat makes enough positions for most.Key fob.  Losing this key will cost you almost $400, but I guess that's on par with other makes and models.Overall:  I like this car.  It's quick for a middle of the road sedan, unassuming looking from a police pull over point of view, and has been reliable to date.  From other reviews of the next generation of 200's, I would keep this before trading up to the newer versions.",4
5089, on 05/22/16 05:51 AM (PDT),Dale ,2013 Chrysler 200 Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Fun To Drive With V-6," Of all the cars I've ever owned, I would say this is this funnest car I've purchased, and like my 1987 Chrysler Fifth Avenue I had 16 years ago, this is a car I like to be in. I have a 2002 Chrysler Sebring, which I'm selling and I do consider the 2013 200 a big step up in both quality and performance, although there is noticeably less interior space in the 200 versus my Sebring, which I believe is due to the seats having more cushioning and additional airbags within the cabin. I do like this version of the 200 over the current new version. My Sebring had the 2.7 V-6, while my 200 has the 3.6. Fuel mileage is better on the freeway with the 200, but I do get less mileage in town than I did with my Sebring. Once in a while I do get some torque steer if I happen to have more of a lead foot than normal, but other than that the steering is responsive and tight. I do wish I could raise the steering wheel just a tad more than what is allowed, because it's a tighter squeeze when I have to wear steel toe boots for work and the leg room in the rear is very tight, though I rarely have rear seat passengers.So in updating this review, I downgraded the performance of the car primarily because, even after having software updates performed on the transmission 4 months ago, I still notice the transmission seeming a little confused with which gear it wants to shift to, as well as an occasional clunk while shifting. The update improved the performance, notably upon climbing hills, but still needs further improvement. I also downgraded the technology for the fact that FiatChrysler charges customers $150.00 for a navigation update disc for it's maps. That's a ripoff in my opinion. Lucky for me I kept the Garmin GPS I purchased for my old Sebring, and I can update that for free on my computer and use it in lieu of the built in system. The traction control in the 200 is great, as it helped the car up a steep ice/snow covered alleyway leading to my driveway. I've purchased new tires earlier this year and recommend the Goodyear Assurance Comfortred tires. These tires perform just as great on this 200 as they did on my Sebring, both in noise reduction and overall traction. With regards to the few complaints I have about the 200, I still like the car and it's still a fun car to drive. The flaws are noticeable, but not so much it makes for a miserable ride.",5

Reviews overall said that it was a good car, although some outlined some bad things. Everyone will have a different opinion. My opinion is a positive one. I used to have a 2008 chevy malibu, and this was an upgrade. Its fairly good on gas,( i drive a lot). i have an all black one, so the looks is sleek and nice.

5095, on 06/01/13 15:45 PM (PDT),robcat20 ,2013 Chrysler 200 Sedan Touring 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),A decent car," I traded in my 2009 Ford Taurus SEL for a 2013 Chrysler 200 S Touring Sedan today. My first impression is overall positive. I have never owned a 4 cylinder engine before, and I am noticing a huge difference in power and speed. I brake tested the car by slamming the brakes at 45 mph. The vehicle did not loose control, but the stopping distance was sluggish. The vehicle is no comparison to the new Ford Fusion or some others in its mid-sized segment, but the overall value is far superior. I chose to save money and go for the chrysler. The interior is comfy and spacious which was a concern since I am a large guy and I traded in a much larger vehicle. ",4

It's a blast to drive and is way more comfortable than the new ones, I've rented a couple of them for work and have issue getting in and out of them without bumping my head.

I even tried to get them to replace the last 2 before the door locks failed and the warranty ran out but no luck.

Never had the rpms over 3000. Covers a lot of ground with comfort. Only car I have ever owned that is still fun to drive after 2yrs. If you haven't tried Continental tires,they are silent. Chrysler did a good job with this vehicle. It's a shame they stopped production. Would like to see a 5spd manual transmission. Check engine light came on and shop replaced a oxygen sensor.

The check engine light came on a few days after we bought it, so it went to the shop a few times and although the light would be off when we picked it up, it would always come back on- And remains on to this day. Tires need to be replaced soon, those will cost nearly $500. My husband says we're switching from Michelin to Yokohama. Love the moonroof!

I bought a 2002 model used. The styling is aggressive but not cluttered. Interior space is larger than expected, and the leather seats are very comfortable. Good support under the thighs, which is usually a big problem for me. Instrumentation is classy and simple. The engine provides a lot of power, and has a great growl at high RPMs. My 300M is a lot of fun to drive, as it hugs the road more like a sports car than a 4-door sedan. Steering is precise with a good feel for the road. There is an unbelievable amount of space in the trunk--larger than my old '95 Concorde! Managed to get 27 mpg on a road trip.

My only gripe has been having to repair the AC (an expensive procedure), and various sensors going bad over the years). The car has only left me stranded once when the battery died.

(And the first American car -- always been a Japanese car buyer.) Great styling. Huge trunk. Comfy front and rear seats. Lots of luxury for the price. Aside from routine maintenance, virtually no repair costs. GREAT bang for the buck.  I sorta want a new car now, this time AWD. Thought the 300C would be it, but I hate the skimpy windows. Guess I'll hang on to my beloved 300M a while longer -- FWD isn't great on hills in snow, but we've had a fairly mild winter!

The car is super comfortable which is nice as we travel down south a couple times a year from MN. I say almost because I feel the handling on our snow/ice roads was not the best prior to the purchase of my snow tires. Now it's been as good as a FWD vehicle could be. But I also had my first real issue with the car with the drivetrain (or drive shaft, I can't recall) going out. Lucky for me I know a great mechanic with a garage so it didn't cost me a fortune to fix. The worst part was it went out 300 miles from home on I-29 on a blustery (okay, for anyone that's been to SD - WINDY!!) winter day in SD. Fortunately the vehicle still ran so we were warm, even if we couldn't go anywhere. I'm still fortunate with only 130,000 miles on it, but I've been very happy with the vehicle considering the price paid and how reliable it's been for me.I'm now looking for something larger with my son and family, and have my heart set on a GMC Acadia (I am NOT getting a mini-van!) for the ease of getting to the 3rd row for my dog (not having to fold down seats or jump over a center console). Unfortunately the reviews are very poor so it sparked me to post a positive one for my very reliable, yet 15 year old, Chrysler 300m.
