We have put 50K miles on this car over the last 3 years and it is THE MOST reliable car that I have ever owned. I always get 22-26 MPG mixed, 70% city and 30% highway, and the requires the absolute minimum maintenance such as brake pads, rotors and oil change. The timing belt had been just replaced when I bought the car and since then I only needed to replace the rotors, brake pads, spark plugs other than the regular oil change. I always use synthetic oil, premium gas and some fuel additives. ",4.5
1, on 08/28/12 07:13 AM (PDT),slow_jim ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan E-Shift 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5A),"Terrible gas mileage, no back seat room"," Surprisingly little room for a luxury car. My wife's 2010 Insight had more room. We bought this hoping that the gas mileage would be better than rated, as I had heard some owners were getting 30mpg highway. We did not find that to be the case. Even without the 'PWR' button on, we were only getting ~22mpg highway on premium. Simply unacceptable for such a small car. Also the dash on these has a chronic melting issue on the passenger side airbag cover. Interior really does not hold up well over time. My car was an 04 but felt more like it was 15-20 years old. Got rid of it in less than 6 months and gladly took a loss on the sale. Maintenance at Lexus dealerships is expensive, take it to Toyota",3
2, on 06/23/10 15:17 PM (PDT),RJ Rafael ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M),Thank God i bought a 5 speed," I know this sound generic but ""I love my car!"" this was my first new car and it is still my daily driver. I currently have 88,090 miles and I am still running on the original front brakes, clutch, belts & shocks! Driving stick really extends the life of your car. Only had to replace 1 bad shock, the battery, rear brakes and everything else is from 2004. About to change the timing belt, water pump, etc. but I'm almost at 90,000 miles so my is 300 has done me proud. You expect quality and reliability from Lexus/Toyota and they delivered. Mine is is so much fun to drive, it's quick around corners and the ride is very smooth. The transmission is the smoothest I have ever driven. ",4.875
3, on 07/01/09 23:02 PM (PDT),not impressed ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M),Not impressed," Bought new in 04, hated it so traded my mom for her Audi, she's got 49K on it now and likes it. The car doesn't have the driver/road connection like my Audi or Saab and doesn't feel expensive like other Lexus cars. Around town speed is good but above 60 mph has no power. Original suspension had so-so handling & comfort. Suspension was replaced 3X by dealer bc it kept squeaking, now has K&N suspension & handles & rides better. Other then that no problems, not even brakes. Interior materials & design are cheap. MPG is pathetic. Auto trans is overeager to upshift into 2nd gear which dulls acceleration unless you stay heavy on the throttle- which eats more gas. Manual mode is worthless.",3.125
4, on 04/22/09 17:54 PM (PDT),Jon ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M),Nice!!," Drove BMW 3 series, G35, Volvo S60 and IS 300 just to be complete.  Expected to buy the G35 but after driving the Lexus, I just loved driving it.  It was by far the most engaging, quietest, and tightest ride.  The G35 was faster in a straight line but I felt ""one-with-the-car"" driving the IS 300. Feels much faster than it really is. And it is not slow.  Beautiful styling in and out and great build quality.  Was also sold on the reliability record. Consumer Reports listed it as one of the top 3 most reliable cars for 2004.  I hope that holds true with mine.",4.375
5, on 03/05/09 21:34 PM (PST),admanc ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M),Just got it," I test drove the 2004 IS300 against a beautiful 2004 BMW 328ci (that I really wanted to love and buy).  After driving both cars, I realized the IS300 was the much better car across the boards.  Mechanically, the Lexus ran smooth and sound, with a lot more get-up and go.  The BMW was sluggish and seemed to hesitate a lot more, with some choppy shifting between gears.  I had been told by many people that the BMW would have more problems than the Lexus and in test-driving both, I had to concede that they were right.  I bought the Lexus.",4.625
6, on 02/20/07 08:37 AM (PST),jbdusf ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M),WOW!," I was looking to buy a new car and was thinking Nissan Maximas, BMW 325i, Infiniti G35. I actually stopped at a dealership looking to see if they had any of the above models. They didn't, however I saw a silver Lexus IS 300. I knew this was the car for me! I am in Real Estate so I needed a 4 door sedan. I had a 2001 Toyota Celica. This was the best of both worlds. Luxurious sedan as well as high performance sports car. The steering wheel shift buttons are awesome! 0-60 in 6.7 seconds which is on par with a Porsche Boxster! It handles like a dream! The ONLY complaint is that the gas mileage is poor for the size car it is. Overall, it is a great car and I highly recommend it!!",4.875
7, on 01/23/07 12:30 PM (PST),Tom ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5M),Want BMW performance with reliability?," This car has superb handling as it almost begs to be thrown around. The fuel economy leaves much to be desired but if you cared about gas then you would have bought a Prius. Styling is very good, but the interior instrument panel could be sleeker. This car definitely turns heads, more so than a 325i. I wanted a sports sedan with actual reliability and you cannot go wrong here. This is my first Lexus purchase and I believe I will stick with them after being very satisfied with my IS 300.",4.75

Got it in black and when I first saw it, I loved it. Now the paint is kind of dull and some scratches are starting to show. I say my favorite color now is the white one, the charcoal and red color is nice too. The car is fast every now and then and very uncomfortable in long trips. The mpg is not so bad if the gas prices stay low. If the car came with 18"" or 19"" wheels it would be a 10 in looks.",3.75

After looking at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 I went to look at a Lexus ES.  Once inside I saw the IS and I said that is the car I want.    ,4.375

The last 2 of those years I was getting the new car itch. I would get excited about some other car models but would shortly lose interest. BUT as soon as I seen the IS300 - I KNEW it was the one! It was like love at first sight. I bought one in Feb04 and couldn't be happier. Love the fact that not many people have this car. People ask me all the time ""Is that a Lexus?""...or ask much or say how much they love it. Lexus out did itself w/ the IS300. It handles like a dream. It's the perfect combo of luxury and sport. Euro-car kids wanna race when they see me...LOL. I've never owned the same car twice, but when I do go to get a new car it will be ANOTHER IS300.",4.625

I would suggest to those looking for an alternative to the BMW and Acura to test drive this car!!  The reliabilty, along with the unreal pampering of Lexus has spoiled both my wife and I.",5

Luxury plus sportyfeatures, its just great.  Has greathandling, looks great, and built to lastwith that Toyota quality.  The onlything is gas mileage.  Your better offdriving leisurely with it to get bettergas mileage.  Driving it all city wouldhit you in the gas budget really fast. Otherwise, I love my full package dealall leather.  Comfortable and has goodspeed not great, but something amodifaction of an exhaust and intake canhelp.",4.75

It's fun to drive and play with. It surprises alot of people it being a Lexus and Lexus not being really associated with sportscars.  The hit the nail on the head with this one. Tons of aftermarket parts for it if you wish to personalize your ride.  No regrets here whatsoever.,5
17, on 08/28/04 00:00 AM (PDT),drivininaz ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan E-Shift 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5A),Fun car to drive , The car is very fun to drive.  It takes corners well with little to no sway.  E shift is fun but cumbersome to use on a regular basis.  The gauges take a little time to get used to - The speedometer is hard to read around the 5's.  The MPG guage is very distracting since it bounces all over the place telling you the instant MPG - not helpful over the long haul.   Looked at the TL and G35 as well as the ES300 they drove like a larger family car which wasn't what I was looking for at this time.  Inifinty dealership went old school w/me with the hard sale.  Lexus dealership was the easiest car purchase I have made to date.  ,4.375

21, on 07/10/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Mattrre ,2004 Lexus IS 300 Sedan E-Shift 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 5A),IS300 is amazing," This car is amazing in every respect compared to its competition (G35, A4, 325,  c230, etc). Although it is not as powerful as some in this list, it makes up for it in superior handling, better brakes, and a much more beautiful design, inside and out. Since these are not top sellers in this country, you can easily find one fairly affordable and at the same time have a car that you dont see everyday (like the 325i). I bought mine for 33k black/black auto with navigation. This car could easily go for 30k or lower. I suggest you check this out if you are looking for a car in the 30k price range. Also, this is the most relibable lexus.",5

The power is adequate and smooth, though it tends to lug a little at lower RPM's.  The E-shift allows only limited control over shifting (gears 2-5) and far too often down-shifts on its own.  A HESITATION PROBLEM occurs in many IS300's as a result of the vehicle's ICU (onboard computer) malfuntioning -- a major issue considering it is not detectable during the intial test drive, gets progressively worse, and according to Lexus, is not correctable.",3.625

The shifts could be shorter and just a bit smoother (less notchy).  Mind you, I am comparing the 5-speed shifting with that of the Honda S2000's.  Overall, the 5-speed manual drives very similar, if not better, than my friends 330ci.   Interior/Exterior:Very nice, except for the plastic dash.

But a car at this level should have memory seats! Very little storage in the large (on the outside) console. I did not order, or want, the navigation.

So it took some time getting used to getting in and out of when it first became my daily driver. I had no intentions of buying a Lexus when I stepped on the lot and the vehicle I was searching for ( Toyota 4Runner ) was sold the salesman showed me this with 143,000 at the time It was a 1 owner vehicle and the gal who owned it was more than a bit irresponsible of how she maintained the vehicle since she first bought it and it showed after I owned it for the first 6 months. Of course being a brand new vehicle and Toyota taking some time to get the kinks worked out with problems during manufacturing. I invested almost $3000.00 to take care of timing belt,water pump belts,hoses,tune up,valve cover gaskets,new muffler and new throttle assembly let alone the constant sight of the dreaded ""check engine light"" for numerous emissions issues which was included in the figure noted previously after going to lexus and 3 other shops no one could seem to narrow it down and then it was the stupid charcoal canister which I managed to figured out on my own. Granted I got a pretty good deal at the lexus dealership for it but in the end I gave the manager a piece of my mind for a price that I could have gotten a better deal on it after the  $$$$ invested when she became mine..I just threw up my hands and said I'm not sinking another cent into this and I'll sell it. Going on almost a year and all her neglect rectified,I couldn't let go of her...I'll admit,she's a fun car to drive and people still comment on her looks which has seen better days from the paint. Now that I've got a 2nd vehicle as my daily driverI just can't let go of my IS300 I drive her mainly on the weekends or if i have to go out on an errand. My 2 mechanics that did approx 90% of the work said...keep it,you'll have that car for at least another 100,000 miles. And so there she sits,in the garage and I admit,I look forward to jumping in and just taking off with her when the chance comes. And even at now 151,000 She'll stay a part of my family for at least a little longer.",4

I know the timing belt is due at 180k which will run at least $500 which I'm fine with due to it's extremely reliable track record. Drives super smooth, has amazing handling with tight steering- shocking for a 15 year old car with so many miles to handle so nice. If you are thinking about getting one go for it. Smaller back seat, cup holders are lame.Update October 2016. I still have this IS. Has 190k miles now. All I have been doing is oil changes, tires, etc. Did timing belt and water pump for around $700 but no major repairs needed which is great especially at the age of this car.

It was one of the first available in Southern California.  The car now has about 202,000 miles on it, with regular service by the local dealership.   The car has never had a single costly repair.  There are no squeaks or rattles.  Even with such high mileage, I wouldn't hesitate to jump in the car and drive cross country right now.  This is truly a worry free car.  I've owned cars from Porsche, Mercedes Benz, Jaguar, Saab, Ford, Chevrolet, Pontiac, Toyota, VW and Honda.  This Lexus has been the best car I've EVER owned, bar none.  Like a fine Swiss watch, it runs forever.  And Lexus provides the best car buying experience anywhere in this galaxy.  ",4.625

It is a blast to drive but still keeps all the refinements you would expect from a Lexus.  And with a Toyota powerplant under the hood, you never have to worry about reliabilty.

The IS 300 weighs 300 lbs. more than the Prelude but certainly doesn't drive like it. I was not afraid to buy one with over 100,000 miles because my family has owned several Lexus models. They rarely need repairs. I had to replace a cracked wheel (previous owner abuse) and found $200 for a re-manufactured one much easier to swallow than $500 from Lexus.

Also once you get going this car has all the power you need right at your foot.  This is one of the benefits of having a Supra engine even though it is downtuned from what it was in the Supra.

The Lexus name. Not saying I drive a Lexus I'm better than you but the Lexus name that says this car was quality built, reasonably priced and fun to drive.

While sport sedans today, including some of the others I tested before acquiring an IS, are somewhat watered-down for the most part, this one doesn't make compromises. It's a very comfortable place to be while still offering high levels of driver engagement, and it looks the part, too. Starting off, the sedan is pretty low to step into, which lets both driver and passenger know this is not a family sedan. It took me a couple of days to adjust to the step-in height, but it's certainly easy to live with. The seats hug you quite nicely and have soft Nuluxe upholstery - my example's seating is finished in Rioja Red, which contrasts nicely with the black surfaces on the dash and headliner. I love the analog clock and brushed-aluminum accents, which are sort of retro-looking. After starting the car the first thing you notice is the awesome F Sport instrument cluster, which is mostly a digital display. It looks sharp and is reconfigurable to show lots of trip data and even glows red when your RPM reaches a configurable threshold. The steering wheel is also fantastic and one of my favorite features of the car - it's wrapped in soft leather and is fairly chunky. The steering feel, too, is quite good for a modern car, providing enough resistance at speed to give me confidence around corners. Speaking of corners, this thing stays pretty flat and drama-free even at turning speeds I wouldn't dare attempt in my old Camry. And despite the V6 being detuned to 255 HP compared to the IS 350's 306 HP, this thing still has plenty of power and is satisfying to drive quickly. The intake sound amplifier also means the V6 really comes alive at higher RPMs - and it sounds quite nice! My only real gripes with this car have to do with the infotainment, which seems to have a lot of menus. The mouse-like controller can also take some getting used to - and I bet your passengers won't want to learn it. In addition, this thing rides well over most roads, but sometimes more broken pavement transmits some noise into the cabin than you might expect. The handling benefits of the suspension tuning as well as the composure on the highway far outweigh the slight downsides on crappy roads, for my taste - not to mention this thing is near-silent on any decent road anyway. All that said, this is a great small luxury car that seems designed to appeal to the enthusiast without overdoing it. If you're buying this car for a fun, engaging driving experience with some luxury touches, you won't be disappointed.",5

Interior room is snug, but not entirely uncomfortable (I'm only 5'9"" and 160 lbs).  My R32 probably shares the same interior volume, but feels more open and luxurious (for a VW of course).  The combination of an I6 and RWD just works wonders for handling and stability. Don't know why the automakers are abandoning this concept, save BMW.

It has a surprisingly large storage compartment especially with the back seats folded down. It has never broken down.  It survived being lent to my 20 year old son for two years.

At first, it was a dream to drive.  Very comfortable and solid on the road, plenty of responsiveness in corners and in braking.  As it is mostly driven by a little old lady on Sundays, I assumed it would be as reliable as the last couple.  I was wrong.  On the first scheduled maintenance visit, we noted the the Ac no longer blew cold and the brakes felt a little mushy.  After two days at the dealership, we were informed that rodents had chewed several wires, causing the AC to no longer work, the radio to act funny, and other sundry issues that showed up during a thorough inspection.  Also, asphalt had caked the underside of the car, causing the rotors to need to be turned.  They suggested that we contact our insurance agency to get all this fixed.  I think this is ridiculous, as the previous cars never had a problem with asphalt caking, or AC losing freon, or the radio stations not wanting to change after several minutes of scanning.

Without changing much about former driving habits I'm managing about 33-34 mpg in mostly heavy city traffic. And it's actually more fun/engaging to drive that I anticipated, given pro reviews.

390, on 08/23/18 06:34 AM (PDT),Floyd Sense ,2018 Lexus ES 300h Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),We love it!," I've owned the car for less than a week, and here are my initial impressions: I'm an average sized person and find the seats very comfortable on long Interstate drives.  My car has the leather seats, not the Lexus version of vinyl.  The mouse-like control for navigation and other display functions sometimes gets a bad rap in reviews, but I find it easy to use and perfectly positioned.  If you're used to using a mouse with your PC, it will be second nature to you.  The car's display is sheltered in a recessed cove on top of the dash and that completely shields it from sunlight and there is never any glare.  If it were a touch screen, you wouldn't be able to reach it, hence the mouse control.  The display is as clear and sharp as any I've ever seen.  The instrumentation is superb, and the Bluetooth operation and audio quality is perfect.  So far, my only complaint is rather minor: there's no storage spot for sunglasses in the overhead console as many other cars have today.  One thing to be aware of: the car is not absolutely quiet as many reviewers have claimed.  The gas engine noises are well muted but you'll still hear tire noise at 70 mph on the freeway.  On another car I own, I found that Pirelli tires are somewhat quieter than the Michelin Primacy tires that come stock on the Lexus.  But, the car seems to be quieter than the other hybrids I've tested (Honda Accord, Ford Fusion, Toyota Camry and Avalon).  If you're considering one of the better hybrids but are put off by the Lexus MSRP, consider the Camry or Avalon - they're very close in terms of comfort and noise levels.",5

Avalon Ltd hybrid," I read the reviews describing the Lexus 300h and Avalon ltd as comparable.  I shopped for > 1 yr.  I bought because of a good deal (thank you Edmunds for posting the incentives); in August 2016  the incentive on the Lexus was $3500 and the Avalon was $1000.  I test drove both cars and here are the differences I think that exist.    The Lexus was a little quieter, the sound system a little clearer, the wood finish clearly bamboo wood (and nicely finished), the seats a little more comfortable, and the interior a little bigger.  the Lexus Navi system is 1"" larger and recessed so it isn't as affected by sunlight.  The bad parts of the Lexus are the storage--less trunk space, glove compartment, center console space.  it doesn't have the number of ""nooks and crannies"" that a Toyota does.    The Avalon Ltd had these included--plus the rear windowshade.  neither trunk passthru works.  (the non-hybrid models have a trunk pass thru .)    the maintenance cost of the Lexus will be higher; my wife's Sienna has 24 mths free maintenace; the Lexuas has 12.  Oh.... the additional ""24/7 roadside assistance"" on the additional service package is really AAA so just join AAA.   compared to my previous car (an 8 yr old Acura RL), the Lexus has worse interior storage, much better mileage, better visibilty / smaller blindspot, and similar size trunk.  I had previously thought that the Acura had small storage space!  the Lexus' glove compartment, center console have even less storage room than the Acura!  the acceleration on the Acura is definitely much better but the hybrid is acceptable.  I wish the Lexus ES and/or the Avalon had a AWD AND hybrid model.  I guess my biggest surprise disappointment was that I expected more interior storage in the Lexus---especially since our Sienna has so many clever nooks for cup holders, console, etc.  update 7/31/17:  I've owned the car 11 months now.  it is a comfortable car.  the rear seating area is very spacious.  my favorite feature, however, is the bluetooth ""auto connect and play"" feature with my iPhone.  after the car starts, it automatically connects and plays whatever audio (music or podcast) through the sound system.  this is very convenient and meets my music content needs.  the most frustrating part of ES 300h ownership is not related to the car itself.  it is the Lexus ""e-mail reminder"" feature which reminds me to service my car depending on the time (estimated mileage) weather (wiper blades in the winter), etc.   the worse episode was when it ""automatically"" made an appointment for me (that I did not request and cancelled by calling person to person) and then sent me an admonishment that ""I did not show"".  Lexus really needs to fully test a software feature before activating it.   the navigation screen does not have as many customization options as the Acura (nor is it as easy to program a route) but it works.  the Acura is better suited for ""touch controls""---the main navigation screen knob with rotate and press feature is much easier (and IMHO, safer) than the Lexus mouse-like control.  Lexus should just provide a touch-screen (like the Sienna, and, I presume, the Avalon) which would be more intuitive.  The blind spot monitor and rear view camera showing the anticipated direction of the car based on the wheel position is helpful, as expected..update 1/31/18:  I forgot to mention that one of the features that I've delighted and still enjoy is the ""custom seat"" setting.  when you get in the car, there is a lot of space between the steering wheel and seat making it very easy to slide in.  then when the car starts, the seat slides forward and tilts to your custom settings, making you feel like you're in a spaceship.  I still believe the Acura navi system is more ergonomic.  I still think the interior storage is poor.  the trunk space is acceptable.update 8/4/18:  pleasantly mildly surprised that at low mileage (< 7500 miles/yr), I only need to take it in to dealer to maintain once a year.  (helps offset 50% higher cost of maintenance over Toyota; 30% higher than Acura).  Acura was a little more specific about what would be done at each service appointment needed; Lexus just says, ""needs service maintenance"".  car is still comfortable, still not enough storage.  voice command is hard to learn (haven't learned how to use it; easier to pair phone via bluetooth and use phone to call, etc.)  navigation system needs work; POI is not bad but if not in POI, then need to enter entire address, incl. city.  Using the 10 digit phone number to enter POI on the Acura is much, much easier.    I had 9am appointment for service; arrived at 8:45; met by initial service rep 8:50, told to sit; didn't meet actual service rep until 9:15.  She did estimate 90 min. for service to be done and it was almost 90 min. to the minute.  Changing fan speed  unlike Acura, service waiting area only offers coffee out of a machine and room temp water; Acura had small snacks too.",4

Don’t get me wrong, this is a nice car, well appointed and delivering a great ride.  It is just that the mileage is far, far off from what was promised.

Driven carefully you can get 42 MPG around town. I only have 1100 miles on the car and first trip on the freeway at 75MPH caused the indicated mileage to drop to 36MPG.  Complaints: trunk is rather small but adequate, no cubby hole space to store things except in doors. Console should have more storage as well.  One glove compartment- which is pretty much filled with the 5-6 volume instruction manuals. However, thanks for the manuals - much better than a CD/DVD that I cannot look at if I have a question when I am on the road. One complaint on the mouse system- it has three ways to select something (2-side buttons or push down on the joystick - it needs one button programmed to go-back instead of me having to select the go-back icon on the screen which is time consuming. It is a fairly long car but will be a good compromise car for trips on the road for comfort and town car for good gas mileage.

I like to open my legs a little when I drive and not have them straight in front of me (which if I did may not have been a problem). Another thing I noticed, that others have pointed out is that the braking was not too great. The brakes on my current car are pretty sensitive and responsive, but braking with the same pressure on this car felt like the car was sliding forward and actually alarmed me. It was sort of scary but did not have enough time with the car to see if I would get used to that. The ceiling on the car was sort of low so w me at 5'9"" I had only a half an inch above my head; same with the back seats, but the leg room is very good. Three large adults in the back would be very tight. What stood out as exceptional for the car was the suspension. Absorbed the bumps very well, even in the horrible streets of NYC. Another thing that stood out was the engine noise. This car revs very high when accelerating from 0-50/60mph and even with the sound deadening, engine is still loud due to the RPM.

The Sirius/XM satellite radio reception is TERRIBLE…music fades out every day, this makes me wish I had a different car. I had sirius/xm reset the signal but that did not help.July 15 2016 update: I took the car in to Lexus of Austin to research the audio problems described in #1 above. The service rep said it is a problem recognized by Lexus that affects a few (random) vehicles across all the Lexus models but they do not know how to fix it. It is weak reception signal that causes dead spots and also lack of HD reception which causes some stations to sound very bad, while other stations sound full and rich. They informed me it could be many months before the issue might be fixed. They recommended that I contact Lexus USA customer service to file the issue. I ended up putting Spoify on my iPhone and cancelling my Sirius/XM subscription.2. Voice recognition is not good, making it difficult to enter destinations into the Nav system. I would prefer Apple Play.3. Nav system directions (by Tom Tom) are not good compared to google maps or garmin devices. I would prefer Apple Play.4. In the summer, climate control defaults to “recirculating” air instead of fresh air from outside, so I have to press the climate control button twice every time I drive the car just to get fresh air! This seems like a design flaw.     5. Limited storage: Front side door storage bins should include a cup holder, but they don't6. Limited storage: The front cup holder along center console is TOO far back to reach with a normal arm position10.

406, on 05/26/16 23:25 PM (PDT),JGARY ,2016 Lexus ES 300h Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Love the car!," Performance does suffer a tiny bit because this is a hybrid (I say this most likely because I had a V6 car before), but it is meant to be a quiet, smooth sedan that provides plenty of luxury and superior comfort. You simply can't ask for a car that has V6 performance, a luxury badge, 40MPG AND an MSRP just above $40K. The car does provide instant acceleration because of the continuously variable transmission, which I am a big fan of. Step on the gas pedal and the feel is instantaneous, unlike a traditional automatic that has to constantly shift gears to get optimal performance. CVT is hated by many people because they think it is boring, not performance-oriented and can be very noisy. However, the CVT on this Lexus is nothing like this. The car's sound insulation is superior, you can barely hear the engine at all during normal driving, city or highway. It is also what helps the car gets the gas mileage because of reduced parts and better efficiency. Without even trying (as I said I had a V6 car before, so I don't drive very gently), I easily get at least 38+ MPG, sometimes even better (40-42 MPG), whether on the highway or in heavy traffic during rush hours, and I think this is really amazing. For my previous V6, in heavy traffic gas mileage easily falls below 15 MPG, especially for shorter trips. I had to frequently go to gas station every few days because the engine wastes too much gas when idling or starting/stopping in city traffic. This hybrid car however shuts off the gas completely when coming to a stop or driving at low speeds, and the car runs on the battery entirely. The result is extreme quietness and you won't feel the car's vibration when waiting for the light at an intersection. To me, I would even say the city traffic is now not as bad thanks to the car's advanced hybrid technology and superior sound insulation. I now seriously question myself why I spent the extra $$$ to get a V6, not needing the extra power, and spending more $$$ on premium gas that was not used to generate that power but was wasted. I am saying all of these probably because I have never driven a hybrid before and I don't really know how other hybrids drive, but I doubt the level of comfort, performance, efficiency will be comparable to these of ES300h. What's even better with this car is that it only requires regular (87 octane rating) gas.Also, the front seats are extremely comfortable and with the perforated seats and the safety features, so this is not just a getting-from-A-to-B commute sedan but will also be a nice place to spend time in if you are traveling for longer distances. There are interior cosmetic changes over the 2015 model - and I would say the steering wheel, dash and the gear knob look way better than the previous generation. Overall the interior is just elegant and beautiful.I would definitely recommend this car to anyone who is looking to buy a reasonably priced, entry-level luxury sedan that combines reasonable performance and gas efficiency.

The additional sound proofing and quietness are immediately noticeable. I have the Blind Side Monitoring  and the Lexus Safety System Plus packages and they significantly improve the driving experience.  When I got the car, it had 10 miles on the odometer and a full tank of gas. I drove it 18 miles to get it home and the instrument panel MPG readout was 24.7.   That was NOT acceptable so I implemented my 2013 ES300h technique for mileage improvement.   I put in 1.5 to 2.0 gallons of PREMIUM grade gas at every fill-up and increased, and rigorously maintain, 35 psi tire pressure.  I measure the pressure alt least once a month, first thing in the morning, when the tires are cold. I took those actions with the new car.  As expected, my mileage went from 24.7 to between 39.8 to 43.2 mpg in mixed city/highway driving!!  I am very pleased,   There is only downside I've encountered and change I wish they would have made -- there isn't enough storage space readily accessible   to the driver.  There isn't tray in which to put miscellaneous things I don't want to keep in my pockets when sitting in the car.

408, on 01/01/16 17:34 PM (PST),Withheld ,2016 Lexus ES 300h Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Inflated advertised MPG," Bought this 2016 ES300H in early December 2015 with a (at least allegedly) full tank of gas by dealer.  Fuel gauge did show full tank.  At 450 miles, ""Low Fuel"" light came on.   Assuming 3 gallons of gas still in the tank, mpg comes to 32.  The mpg calculator/indicator in the car shows 33.  I live in the mid-Atlantic area where the December 2016 weather was very mild.  I have been driving very gently, no hard acceleration or stopping, as I wanted to see what gas mileage I would get.  I've been driving about 60% in-town and 40% highway.  I've read elsewhere people getting 33, 37, or 40 mpg.  Does individual ES300H's have such large disparity in mpg?  Lax quality control?  Or the car should have low mpg during ""break-in"" period (first 600 miles) when the engine is ""tight""?After one year owning the car, I can confidently say that my ES300H never achieves the advertised mpg, even in ECO mode.  34~35 mpg is the norm, and low fuel light comes on at about 450~500 miles, and at 500 miles, need to add 14~15 gallons.  Also, actual mpg calculated from added gas versus mileage is always lower than shown in the dashboard.Jan 2018 Update: I have owned my 300H for 2 years now, at 18K miles.  Have been driving it in ECO mode for almost 2 years.  In pleasant temperatures (e.g. May or October), I can get 39~41 mpg reading on dashboard.  Actual mpg calculated from gas filled/miles run is always about 2 mpg below car reading.  In winter, mpg is much lower.  I am currently (December - January) reading 33~34 mpg in car, expecting actual mpg to be 2 mpg lower.",3

The 34 mpg and the fact that it runs on ""regular"" gas is great, however, Lexus made some lower quality moves inside the car that I find quite annoying:  They put composition felt (many pieces of different colored felt pressed together)  on the sides of each front seat, facing to the console.  TACKY!!  There is no longer a light in the coin compartment which is located on the far left under the dash, causing one to have to remove change to hold it up to look at it under the light at night: CHEAP!  Lastly, I absolutely hate the Lexus GPS system!  It was outdated when I bought the car and a year later,  when I asked the Lexus dealer to update it, the Lexus service man blew up my whole sound system including the radio (which they replaced free of charge, but I was without my car over a week!).   When I received my car back, the GPS was still the same outdated one!  As my work involves traveling to new clients daily, I also pay $300 annually for live Lexus Navigation Assistance and they are wrong half the time! and the other half, their system hasn't added new addresses! I finally asked who they use to find addresses and they said BING!  I found that I can Google it on my phone and receive more accurate directions, much quicker!

I simply have to assume this is the case. I had two major issues never resolved which forced me to break the lease and sell the car. #1 - after 6 months of owning the car, when the car reaches about 30 miles an hour, a large rattle would occur lasting a few seconds. I took it to the Santa Monica Lexus repair shop. I was able to demonstrate the issue during a test drive with the head shop foreman. After 1 week in the shop they identified the issue as being the heat shield. The heat shield was ""repaired"", I picked up the car, the problem returned. This went on for 2 more visit before I gave up and took it to another Lexus repair shop. Long story short, that repair shop stated the sound is ""normal"" and therefore didn't want to repair it. The sound was very loud. Not possible to have a sound like that on any new car. The second problem had to do with the A/C. Each time I started my car with the A/C already in the 'ON' position, a mildew smell would come out the vents. I was told this is caused by a buildup of water in the engine area, also considered ""Normal"". The advice was to turn the AC off before starting the car which is ridiculous for a brand new car. Between these two issues and the terrible service, I decided to bite the bullet by getting out of the lease (at a significant cost). I am happy to be rid of the car and will never by a Lexus again.",3

429, on 12/08/16 15:17 PM (PST),bobblock1 ,2013 Lexus ES 300h Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),An Almost Great Car," This is the best car I have owned; it is a delight to drive. I also tried the ES350, and although faster, the shifting annoyed me; I prefer the ES300h CVT transmission. The ES300h has 3 driving modes: Eco, Normal, and Sport, easily selected with a rotating dial on the center console. I usually drive in Normal mode. Eco mode has a bit less acceleration, but is fine to drive in. It supposedly gets better mileage, but I haven’t done a reasonable test to verify this. In Normal mode, my mileage varies with driving. Around town I’m getting about 34 mpg. On the freeway, I get 38. Sport mode makes a significant difference in handling. The car takes corners with much more confidence, and can be pushed into tight turns. It is not a sports car, but for a big sedan it corners very well. In Sport mode, the accelerator is much more responsive, quicker to react, with higher gearing. Still, maximum acceleration is limited to what the power plant can provide – 0-60 in under 8 seconds. The interior is luxurious, with all kinds of goodies to pamper you and keep you safe (I like the Blind Spot Monitor and Cross Traffic warning while backing up). Very satisfying to sit in. Now to my complaint, and it is a big one. A few years back, Lexus decided to go to a mouse-based interface to the Navigation screen instead of a touch screen. The interface is used for navigation, the radio and other media players, and the phone. I also own a 2008 RX400h, with the touch-screen interface. It works fine, and is easy to use. The mouse-based interface makes use of navigation, the radio, and the phone significantly more difficult. It requires you to look at the screen longer, and takes more concentration to position the mouse. During my first month or two driving this car, I found it very distracting to use, resulting in less attention paid to driving the car – dangerous. I’ve now figured out a safer way to use it, but the interface still takes more effort and clicks. Someone in Lexus user interface design is brain-dead. Phone Use:To make a call on my RX, I push a button on the steering wheel, speed dials appear on the screen, I touch the one I want, and the call goes through. On this car, it takes the steering wheel button, and then 2 carefully placed mouse clicks to place the call. Too risky while driving, so I use the voice recognition system. Voice recognition will dial anyone in my contacts list, but needs to understand me. It puts the entry on the screen and says the name. Then I say: “dial” to place the call. Workable if I know the correct names in my contact list. Radio:There are no longer physical push button presets – just the on/off-volume knob and the tuner knob. All presets are electronic on a Radio screen. The easiest way to reach the Radio screens is by pushing a physical Radio button on the dashboard just above the gear shift lever. Then you get 6 screens, 6 presets per screen, with a physical scroll button behind the shift lever or mouse clicked arrows on the screen to move between preset screens. You can scroll through the presets with a lever on the steering wheel or mouse-click them . Again, using the mouse while driving is tricky, but the scroll button works reasonably well, except that you must replace the Nav map with the Radio screen while doing this. If you want the map to stay on the screen, you need to stay with the Map screen and remember the order of your presets while using the lever. Navigation:You can set a destination while driving using voice recognition. The only one I’ve tried is Go Home. This works. You can also speak an address into the system with voice commands – not while driving: City, Street, then Number (speaking single digits). This is easier than mouse-clicking the address into the keyboard. My RX has 6 preset destinations I can get to with 2 touches while driving, and allows me to touch type an address onto the keyboard. The ES system is not as easy. Oddly, and annoyingly, there are no “Pause Guidance” and “Resume Guidance” voice commands. I use these or the touch equivalent on my other cars to get my Nav system to shut up when I don’t want to hear it during the journey (like when stopping for gas or lunch). I’m still learning, so there may be shortcuts I can use to simplify this interface, but it is inferior to what Lexus used to use and what Toyota still uses. I can’t explain why they have done this.",4

It is a great highway cruiser, has averaged 37 plus mpg over the 25000 miles we have driven it and does everything you could ask of a great family sedan!  Service and maintenance  have been very low, virtually nothing. Knowing both what I have learned about Lexus and Toyota, I would have bought the Toyota Avalon hybrid, as the 300h and the Avalon were jointly developed and the drive trains are identical!  The Avalon is slightly less expensive and more importantly, the service on the Avalon is free, whereas ou pay for the Lexus service after the first free service!!!Our 300h now has 33,600 miles and is still averaging 37 mpg! We cannot find anything wrong with the car other than the fact that the rear seat back doesn’t fold down so that more luggage or longer items might be carried in the trunk! We do take the vehicle to the local Toyota dealer for oil changes only because the same service at the Lexus dealership costs more and the dealership is 50 miles away. Other than the aforementioned oil changes and checks,we haven’t spent a penny on the vehicle! Will put a new set of “low rolling resistance” tires in roughly another 5000 miles.

I expect the same reliability from the Lexus.The difference is in the luxury ride and feel of the Lexus, as well as the outstanding build quality.I get 37 to 40 mpg in mixed driving.Now have 63K miles onthe Lexus and it has been reliable.The hybrid technology is not ""state of the art"" but I like that. It's proven.The Nickel Hydride batteries are ""bulletproof.""  The PCS (Pre-collision system was recalled several months ago.  They finally fixed it. The car is reliable and comfortable.

My wife and I drive them to work every day. I keep meticulous records and since the first day I bought the cars I get an actual 40.1 mpg and my wife gets 36 mpg. I get better gas mileage in the city than on the highway. The last two months I have been getting about 45.5 mpg and my has been getting 38.5. We love this car. We traded in 2011 ES350 and 2011 RX450's. We went from 25 mpg in the ES and 17 mpg with premium gas in the RX. I read a review for the ES300h 2014 where the person said they were getting 25 mpg. They must drive poorly as I drive 5 miles over the speed limit everywhere I go and I get the mpg on the sticker.,5

The auto lights-on takes too long to be used safely - I am told that is the way it is with Toyota - Baaad - not safe IMHO.  Why does cruise cut out at 40 K?  Would be nice if it went down to zero?  Find the radio a challenge and the CD player (still have them) not great.Winter brings on occasional bad smells which I control by putting air flow to maximum for five minutes.

Being only $2,500.00 more than it's gas only brother, the ES350, Lexus did us a great favor. The extra dollars spent up front really gets made up in the great fuel economy in just a few years, versus 10-12 years with a lot of hybrids.As of today, 1/10/17, I have to say my ratings all hold true. Still a very reliable, enjoyable car to have. No issues whatsoever.As of today, 7/11/17, we still own the Lexus 300h and it has been trouble free and we have put very little into the car except to keep up with the maintenance schedule. If I were looking for a used car in the luxury category, I would really consider this car.1/9/18:  Still very satisfied with this car. No issues at all.

This is the third Lexus I have owned in the last 20 years. The car has attributes that aren't discussed in reviews. Example it emits an purposeful sound when driving slowly in EV mode to alert pedestrians to your presence. The stereo without the Mark Levinson upgrade is impressive especially with a whisper quiet interior. As to noise levels, Lexus has not insulated us from outside sounds but dialed them down somehow. I like the ratcheted head rests but the front drivers seat is the worst on trips I have ever had. I see no need for a gear shift yet one is there. Interior lighting is dynamic in that evidently it changes depending on what you are doing. I traded the car in early, the only time in my life I have done so because the front seats were miserable for my average build. I have never gotten such a terrible back ache from a drivers seat like this before. I do not know if it is because it is a hybrid that they reduced support in seats to save weight or not. Good news is when I traded it in it got top dollar.",3

First, this car has some of the finest fit and finish materials and unique designs throughout. It is extremely comfortable to drive and more than enough power to enjoy flashing through the 10 speed and let me tell you the sound you can generate with 10 gears paddling up and down is superb! You could NOT find a more reliable or fun coupe for this money with any other manufacturer! If you've owned Porsche, BMW, Ferrari, Maserati etc... like me you know how much they cost to maintain!

I could just imagine myself sitting in the driveway and just listening to the rumble of the engine. Just knowing that it was going to be a fun ride to work that day would put a big smile on my face. Lexus has done a great job with this car!When it comes to sports cars, there is commonly an area where you have to compromise in while enjoying the dominant features of the car, but not this time. Just sitting inside the car, you feel like it was made just for you. Very comfortable with all controls easy to access. You don’t feel scrunched it at all. It’s a very welcoming, personal feeling while you hear the rumble of the engine. While the engine is very easily heard from outside the car, you don’t feel overpowered by it from the inside. And when you give this thing gas, it’s like a comforting, yet powerful push forward. It’s like the car just screams dominance while just waiting for you to unleash the 471 hp under the hood. Although others have posted complaints with the brakes, I only heard one squeak noise as I entered the street from the parking lot, and then nothing else over the hour and 15 min test drive. In fact, I was very impressed by the braking system. Very responsive and did an excellent job slowing the car down at high speeds. As soon as I’m able to, I’ll be purchasing one for myself. ",5

A$100k car with this issue known but not solved is unacceptable. Also was informed a recall on fuel injection system is coming but no replacements parts at dealers yet.

457, on 06/29/17 13:30 PM (PDT),W.B. ,2018 Lexus LC 500 Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 8cyl 10A),Bought it for the looks," Update for July 2018:Having now had the car for a year, I can say it gets better over time. I absolutely adore this car as a daily driver and road-tripper.The highway mileage is so good it seems fake. When cruising in Eco mode I'm easily getting 30 mpg. This doesn't even make sense until you realize the car can switch between Atkinson and Otto cycles.The engine scream never gets old in Sport+ mode. I just can't get enough. Sometimes I switch to Sport+ just to pass people with that crazy loud noise.After a year I expected to have buyer's remorse, or a wandering eye for the Mercedes AMG GT. Or the Porche 911 Carerra. But no. The LC 500 is a car that just grows on you and still turns heads. It's the supermodel you can actually live with everyday.***Outstanding visual appeal inside and out, with disappointing acceleration.Go for the bespoke option, even though it's a 3-month wait. Neither the touring nor sport packages gives you the correct combination of options. Here's the combination you want, starting from bone-stock, in order of importance: 1. Limited Slip Differential (LSD), 2. Convenience Package, 3. Heads Up Display (HUD). Done. All other packages and options actually worsen the car's performance. Or they package excellent options (like the retractable spoiler) with unnecessary ones (like Variable Gear-Ratio steering).Basically you want the LSD to correct the flaws in the drivetrain. The stock, active, rear open-differential loses too much horsepower at the wheels. The LSD is mechanical: more horsepower, more traction. With the stock differential, you have to pay attention when you're kicking the tail loose. It's still fun, but the LSD gives you +HP +control. No-brainer option there.The Convenience Package gives you parking assist. You must have this. The dimensions of the car make it difficult to park. Parking assist will save you, again and again. Get it, save your body work, make parking garages your best friend.Option 3, the HUD, is just plain cool. It's actually an unintentional safety feature, keeping your eyes focused at near-driving distance. It even shows the song you've cued up from your phone via Bluetooth.After engine break-in, get the dealer to fix the rev limiter to 7,300rpm. It's limited to 7,000rpm off the lot. Peak horsepower is at 7,100rpm so the rev limiter is ruining the fun. Oh, and don't get the hybrid, seriously. You'll regret it. The 33% savings in mileage is not worth it. Just get a Tesla or a BMW i8.Pros: The looks, the sounds, the textures, a fantasy for the senses. True opulence. The car looks twice as expensive as it costs. Ride quality is Lexus smooth. Excellent steering feedback, in bone stock configuration. A masterpiece of emotional driving, makes you want to drive forever.Cons: Slower than a Roush Mustang 427 because the LC 500 drivetrain is not designed for performance. Handles like a Challenger SRT8 (it's that heavy). Costs more than a BMW M4. Out-of-touch infotainment controls.Why you should buy it: Honestly? Because it gives you the emotional response you would expect from a dream car. If you do not feel this way after seeing it then don't buy it. Simple. I personally would have gotten just as much raw driving pleasure from a Mustang GT. However, I have a transcendental experience every time I drive the LC 500. It just takes my breath away.Configuration reviewed: Black on black V8, Convenience Package, All-Weather Package, Touring Package, Heads Up Display.",5

The paddle shifters are a constant temptation, the keyless feature is outstanding and the auxiliary input for the iPod makes the ride a whole more fun.",4.875

It is such a pure joy to drive, aggressively or leisurely. It accelerates mightily and brakes commandingly. It's head-turning gorgeous lines and stylish plush cabin make me feel like king of the road day in, day out.",5

However, after 4 months of ownership and first scheduled maintenance this car is definitely worth the wait. So far everything is good, no complains, build quality is superb. 306 HP, that's enough said. I wish I had got the navigation but oh well, that'll give me something to look forward to for my next car (hopefully another IS in 5 years).",4.875

Automatic transmission upshifts and downshifts almost perfectly.  Luxury feel, very comfortable.  The Bad: No manual option, premium gas required, numb steering.  Not much really ;)  The Ugly: Sportshifter and paddles are next to useless since you can't lock down the autoshifting to particular gear range, only lock out a range until you upshift into it.  Trac off only stays off until you exceed 30 mph, then it's back on again.",4.5

To me that was a big plus for the Lexus. Acceleration, handling and braking was very impressive. And for the interior, there is no comparison the Lexus wins. Plus the features and oh that Mark Levinson, need I say more. People complain about VDIM but how many people drive to its limit? and how often? BMW has more to lose and Lexus more to gain. For an awesome daily fun to drive performance vehicle it was a no brainer. Now add better reliability and good looks and ah yes price need I say more.",4.875

Love the interior & feel of materials. This is the definition of a luxury sports car. The exterior design is nice but would like to see a little more sport & a little less sedan. The ride quality is great, except my car has an apparently unfixable small pull to the right. Nav system is great but almost has too many features. I don't need the rear camera, but it sure is nice. Performance is great, extremely quick w/out knowing it. But the traction control & stability control jump in a little too quick with no way to turn them off. Paddle shifter is fun, but not quite as responsive as I was hoping for. Overall an awesome car.",4.375

It's just plain fun to drive. The 306 hp makes it feel like the meanest ride on the road, but the supple interior and quality finishes give it a luxurious touch that remind you this car is worth every penny.  And it has so many nice little touches, like how the gauges rev when you start the car, or how lights illuminate the door when you walk up as if the car is greeting you.  Lexus thought of everything.  Lexus delivers a car that is both fun but also just makes sense.",4.875

By the way, my last car was a Porsche Boxster. The IS 350 is deceptively fast, silky smooth, powerful when needed, handles like my previous Boxster and gets better gas mileage to boot! The Formula 1 paddle shifters on the steering wheel are fantastic, the interior design and comfort second to none.  Did I mention the looks!?  So far, everyone that's driven it has said they are moving it to the top of their desired car list. The best I can describe it is, if Porsche made a Boxster sedan, this would be it.

Hands down, for the money there is no better deal. Nothing comes even close. The balance of sportiness, agility, luxury and comfort is ideal for the 30-something guy that I am. I am for one in favor of the much criticized electronic traction and stability features. It suits my driving style and adds a significant amount of safety. I had to put it to the test on the highway when an 18-wheeler blew a tire. I was going at about 85 mph. I managed to avoid multiple collisions and all of the tire fragments without loosing control.

Put simply, the combination of build quality, appearance and fun factor can only be found in this vehicle.  This car has PLENTY of get up and go to satisfy 99.9% of the kid in all of us yet exudes a sense of refinement and luxury that, as a 30-something, I thoroughly enjoy.

The controls and gauges are all extremely user-friendly and very attractive.   I've driven BMW and Audi, and this car handles as well if not better.   I've cornered at the cars limits and you never get a slide that encourages the car going out of control.  The back never flies out, the car just stays perfectly balanced.  One major complaint I do have is that I get into my car, and i find a new rattle every time.  For the price of this car, I think that's a little unacceptable.",4.75

It got annoying after 2 weeks. The shifting feels sluggish due to that the underlying tranny is still an automatic. It may look fast, but underneath the body-kits is only a 105 hp engine. The crappy tranny ruins the 306 ponies. In the luxury dept it also lacks. The ride is sacrificed for the handling. So if you are looking for a plush ride, look elsewhere. The plastic on the instrument panel feels like hand-me-down Toyota parts. ",2.875

I t just amazes me how you can really feel the power in this car when I first testdrove it plus the interior is topnotch and noise level very much subdued in my opinion.

The Lexus doesn't handle quite as good as BMW, nothing does, but it's awfully close. And while  the IS 350 6 cylinder is as powerful as the MB 5 liter, it's not quite as smooth, but the Lexus is more fuel efficient. As to luxury, the Lexus IS 350  at the very least equals the others.

I bought one last weekend with the sport package and the Mark Levinson/navigation package and I feel like I'm 16 again and just got my driver's license.  Not only is it a FAR superior car to the boring BMW 3- series, it's quite a drastic change from the old IS series.  Handling and acceleration are superb and driving enjoyment could not be greater.

And i like the acceleration, and handling (this is no frs but handles quite nice ) its a lexus so its going to last forever. Ride doesnt beat u up bla bla bla. Now for the cons. Im not going to start on infotainment system cuz i knew how it was and didnt take the car because of the system. Car has lots of road and wind noise. (My ford fusion was much more of a quiet ride for that matter) i thought lexus shud be quiet only some fake induction noise but driving long trips is annoying. Secondly there are no remote starter on a 50k car yes theres yhe lexus enform app which takes forever to start and always crashes my friends grand Cherokee app does commands in 3 seconds while this takes 2 mins atleast. No leg room in back. And no memory seats. Y ur asking most probably they just forgot to ad it to the car. Im very dissapointed! ! Looks like lexus said oh we need to compete with yhe germans so we have a good engine (they also thaught that by the is250...)  lets make a weord design and they tested it and it worked now they went to the handling and it was great. Now they went yo their old files and took out some proto type infotainment system and older toyota hvac/radio buttons threw a blind spot moniter package in from the sienna and hew-yaa we got a car!

Pros:   Though it lacks the horsepower at the line of the Q50- it Brakes and handles like a dream at high speed - put it in sport ++ mode and the suspension brakign and handline tighten and you actually feel really safe takign the turns at high speed!   The Rioja red F-sport interior includes the race stitching, metallic side panel, F-sport badging, and maybe one the coolest LED instrument gauges out there.  At first I hated the front grill, but seriosuly go see one of these in person -  it looks mean - the side profile and sightlines in the fsport version are some of the prettiest on the road imho.  Have only owned this for 2 weeks - so havent test it for winter conditions but the all seasons shoudl be fine with awd.  I have it in sport & ++ mode a lot so my mpg prolly not the best.  Cons:   The backseat is pretty small unless you have little kids like me, legroom could be cramped with an older family.  Make sure and get the protection package put on it, as you will get rock chips on lower sitting front end.",5

It easily accelerates to speed (and for passing on the highway) and it handles like a dream when the roads get twisty.- You're going to play with the guage cluster a lot.  It's cool and fun.- The seats are probably the most comfortable I've ever had in a luxury sports sedan (owned or ridden in is300, bmw 328xi, audi s4).  This vehicle is comfy.- It's a Lexus.   It just works.  And when I'm done driving it, the resale value of this car will be fantastic.  (I sold my old is300 after 10 years for $10k.)- It's got all the luxury I need (heated seats/steering wheel, ventilated seats, nav system, blindspot detection with crosstraffic (saved me twice already), bluetooth, USB port, etc.)   - It's really roomy compared to the old IS300 (and they finally made the seats split folding!)Cons:- It does sit low.  I'm also a cyclist, so I've added a hitch to the rear which makes it worse!   It will get rock chips in the hood.  And it will rub on steep driveways.- It's not great on fuel economy.  I generally don't ""play"" with it a lot and I'm getting around 22mpg.  - The brakes do produce a lot of dust, so expect to give it a cleaning regularlyGo see it in person.  Some people hate the styling, but I think it's less gaudy in person.  (The photos of the front make it look awful.)   I haven't had it in the snow yet, but I expect that the AWD and all season tires will do just fine.Update 4/17/2016.... I've now been through some winter driving in DC with the car.  I have the AWD and it felt as solid as my 2005 Infiniti FX35 in the snow.   I was able to drive it up to Pennsylvania to go snowboarding 4 or 5 times without issue.

After discussing the issue with Lexus, they stated this is standard on many Lexus models. The car draws so much electricity when not in use, if the car sits for ""8"" days will not start. If the car is left at the airport locked, you can not get in the car to even jump it.Lexus's answer: They will provide a plug in solar panel to mount to the car, or a battery plug in!!!!!!Yes, honestly that was the answer.",1

Don't spill anything on the vented seats. It may be absorbed into the seat.  The stock stereo has a very good midrange, but the base can be boomy and distorted.  The ride is kind of odd.  I feel the road and the bumps, yet I feel uninvolved.  There is significant understeer at decent speed. The VDIM is intrusive, kicking in well before there is any real danger of anything.  The VDIM can only be turned off by holding the off button for 7 seconds when the car is not moving. Very annoying. If you have any back pain, even rarely, driving this car can be hellish.

Lexus not remembering the seat settings when you open the car is lame. Not being able to use the nav while driving is lame (my passenger wants to use it, Lexus!). The clearance in the driver's seat is too small. For some reason, the passenger's seat has more headroom. Not providing a full sized spare is a cop out.

I have had the car for a month and here are my first impressions.: 1. Slow starter. My IS300 had a manual transmission that I miss dearly. The IS 350 automatic even in sport mode has significant delay to move. There is also the delay when punching it to exit a corner. The IS 350 has more torque but at higher RPM and weighs more than 300 lbs more.  Acceleration on the highway with the IS350 is significantly better.   2. Handling nimbleness. I definitely feel the weight difference and the IS350 has more understeer so I find myself correcting more in the turns. The IS350 is a cruiser car and not an enthusiasts car. The IS350 with the 225/45 and 245/45 tires sticks to the road on corners. Haven't broken it free except when starting from a stop on wet pavement. (I think this was because of the lack of a limited slip differential which my old IS had.)  3. Modern comforts. The IS350 is so nice to have bluetooth, a great stereo that is tuned to the cabin and it is much quieter inside. The keyless entry is great too.  4. Reliability. My IS300 was extremely reliable for the 14 years I owned it. I expect the IS350 to be the same.  In summary, the IS350 is more of a comfort car than a drivers car. I will drive it for a year until I can find the drivers car with reliability that I have been searching for.",4

Styling is polarizing, but I love the way the IS 350 F Sport looks. Unfortunately, all that just makes the IS 350 that much more disappointing. Somehow, Lexus has managed to make this car incredibly boring to drive. Acceleration is fine, but not great. Not a huge deal except gas mileage is no better than much more fun to drive cars by BMW or Audi. The 6 speed automatic that comes with the AWD version is sluggish and seems continuously confused as to what you want it to do. The mouse controller on the infotainment system is quirky, but not a deal breaker. It seems to have all the expected capabilities even if user friendliness isn't optimal. The Levinson sound system makes a huge difference, it's really outstanding. Unfortunately, the basic audio system is really hollow and it seems like 90% of the cars out there don't have the Levinson option installed. It was hot out when I drove this car and the ventilated seats were a nice touch. Overall the seats were comfortable and the cabin had a polished clean look to it but in terms of materials the IS 350 really needs to up its game compared to competitors. The exception is the gauge cluster which is really advanced compared to everything but the 2017 Audi all digital gauges. No car is perfect and I think I could forgive all the shortcomings of the IS 350 except for one. They put a huge hump that sticks out on the driver's side right where you put your feet when you are driving. Apparently it's part of the AWD system but it's seriously intrusive. Your leg rests and rubs against it while you're driving and it is really annoying. In such a competitive segment, I'm really surprised such an annoying design flaw hasn't been corrected after all these years. I wanted to love the IS 350, I was really excited to potentially drive away in one, but there are just too many problems for me to buy a car at this price point with so many things I find annoying.",2

Coming from a 2012 MB C250 it’s definitely an upgrade. With 306hp you don’t really feel it since the car is somewhat heavy but you do feel the torque of 277 at a dead stop and you floor it. But once it’s up there it speed it tends to fell sluggish compared to other cars. The ride is smooth and quiet. Too quiet for me to be honest but hey your buying a Japanese luxury car. My only complaint is the voice command is extremely trash. It either won’t understand what your saying or do something completely opposite. Entering an address is a pain because 7 out of 10 times it’ll be wrong so I just use my phone. Haven’t had any major issues on this car since it is a daily driver miles will go up fast,4

I turn mine in this May so I figured I have enough experience with it to write an honest review.  First of all, I'm not a race car driver, so I don't much to compare against.  But this car feels very sporty to me, has plenty of pickup, good handling, and a snappy suspension.  The infotainment system is fantastic.  I especially love the 2nd display sitting behind the steering wheel.  It's top-notch; plenty of bling and wow factor when you show a friend how the main dial moves over to reveal a 2nd screen.  And it's functional, allowing you to do 2 things at once (music + navigation for example).  The voice activation is decent enough.  I really grew to like the center console ""mouse"" so if you test drive this car, don't be too put off by it.  It grows on you.  There is one big negative though, and you should know this before purchasing or leasing.  The road noise is excessive.  I realize this is a sporty car that sits low to the ground, but that shouldn't be an excuse for having to jack up the volume on your music at 55 MPH on a road that isn't all that old.  And yes, this is with the standard tires AND with new replacements.  The bottom carriage of the car simply does not have enough insulation to block out what is happening underneath.  It wasn't a deal-breaker for me, but I can imagine some people would hate it.  If you test drive, make sure to insist driving the car on a highway, preferrably one that hasn't been re-surfaced in the past couple years.",4

I have had no less than 8 cars since 2000 and have either driven BMWs or Volvos.      I see a lot of posts about Lexus vs. the BMW.        I would ask the BMW owner to specify when they are reviewing their car-is it before or after 50,000 miles.   I have had a 3 series, 5 series, 2008 X-5 4.8 L and a 2014 X-3.    In 50% of my BMWs, I had major mechanical issues in or around 50,000 miles.     Without hestitation, my favorite car was my 2008 X-5.  It was fast and luxurious, but after spending 3 days at the dealer for a high pitched transmission whine, I decided not to wait for the full repair bill.      I recently picked up a 2014 Lexus IS 350 F sport with 19"" wheels.     The car is an absolute blast to drive and the interior is amazing.     I find the sport+ mode super responsive with an engine that has no lag and keeps giving.    What makes me love this car is the reliability.  With the BMWs, I was constantly worried about a major repair bill-with the Lexus, which I bought with 39,xxx miles, I feel like the car is just getting warmed up.    It's a car that is both reliable and fast and one I can see myself driving for a long time.   It clearly is not as fast or tight as a 335, but it's way more reliable.",5

Overall, I am very happy with my current addition of a 2014 IS 350 F Sport, definitely an upgrade from the 2006 IS 350 Sport I previously owned. Here are some observations: I'd give the current '14 IS 350 F Sport car a 9.0, vs. a 7.0, not surprising it has been 8 years in evolution. Plusses for the '14 IS include: very cool LFA-inspired instrumentation (although wish mph could be toggled to ""analogue""), heavier, but substantial steering, sport modes incl S+, being able to change vehicle settings (incl door locks), LED lights, super comfortable front seats, more rear seat room, folding rear seats, plus I got F-Sport breaks and the air in-take.  I do feel it is much faster (w/8spd transmission), although per rated HP it is not (prob get +5-10HP with the F-Sport air intake). Mark Levinson sound system is better by a small margin; like the USB connectivity, EnTune and Bluetooth radioDrawbacks vs. the '06 IS 350 incl: lack of ventilated seats - ERROR, no memory seats - ERROR (should be at least 2 sets, at least on driver's side): no sunglass compartment (ok since in did not work properly); console opens only upward and thus awkward vs. sliding backward and opening upward; moonroof operation was much better in '06 IS 350;",4

My first impressions were nothing but positive, so I thought I would drive it for a bit before advising others. Here are the categories that are important to me:Looks: Exterior: I love the way my IS350 F Sport looks.  I've read that it's polarizing, and I think that's pretty accurate.  For me, it's  perfect.Looks:  Interior:  I love the interior.  This was the main reason I chose Lexus over Audi, BMW, or Mercedes.  Since I'm on the inside, I care about that more than the exterior.  The mouse takes some time to get used to, but now it's like 2nd nature.  I love the way it clicks into position depending on which screen I'm in.  It doesn't just free float like a traditional mouse.  It knows where each button is on each screen, and gives physical feedback as you toggle.  The guages are one of the best features. It's extremely easy to have the info you want clearly visible. Performance:  I almost always drive in Sport+ mode.  The only time I drive in Normal mode is on the interstate (for the extra gas mileage).  In town, it's just too much fun to drive in Sport+ mode to worry about the gas savings.  The F Sport in the RWD is the way to go due to the 8 speed transmission.  Every gear is so smooth and acceleration is adequate for normal driving.  One of my favorite parts of driving in Sport+ mode is the throaty engine sound when the RPM go above 3k.  It gives the extra feel to the experience of driving a sports car without having it become obnoxious.",5

Bmw has always ruled the market, but after driving the Lexus i have to ask why? The Lexus is EVERYTHING and more than the Bmw 335i and almost 12k less-loaded out. Performance is excellent, it's quiet, all the controls are where they should be - it's perfect. I would totally recommend this car if you are looking at a performance-luxury small sedan. ",5

The car drives like a dream and handles well.  The negatives for this car are the seats are uncomfortable for me, but okay for my husband.

I'm a former RX owner and the NX will appeal to those who liked the size and style of the previous RX models. The NX is roomy enough to be useful while still offering a good garage fit.  At approximately 2,000 miles on the odo, I'm averaging about 30 mpg in mixed daily driving. RIDE: The NX is sure-footed with a comfortable ride. The rear wheels are electrically powered and only engage when needed. CABIN/COMFORT: The cabin is fairly quiet although the CVT is surprisingly loud... something that might be improved with better sound baffling in future model years, if Lexus is listening to owners. Seats are firm; back seat headroom is terrific for adult passengers. OPTIONS: My NX is pretty well-equipped (luxury package with triple-beam LED headlights). However, my last vehicle, a terrific Toyota Avalon Limited Hybrid, had a few nice features (such as automatic collision avoidance and a few other niceties) not yet offered by the NX. But I traded up for the cargo capacity and AWD. In summary, the NX 300h is not just a head-turner; it's a solid performer that delivers nearly everything you expect from a Lexus. I do suggest test-driving the new RX before testing the NX, just to understand the difference in the price points and driving experience. I also suggest testing different NX models, including the turbo and F-Sport. I felt the NX hybrid was the right fit for my needs and I can highly recommend it.",5
640, on 04/29/16 21:37 PM (PDT),David ,2015 Lexus NX 300h SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),SUV that gets 30mpg and can handle like a car!," Ok, was looking for a hybrid SUV. Green was the emphasis for the purchase. Sedans can be green without the hybrid (the CO2 emitted per mile in a Camry is less than some souped up hyrbids). Also, when your car is stopped, it's just nice no to emit CO2. Toyota makes real hybrids (ones where the battery can boost up city driving mpg) and pioneered much of the technology. Our only real choices were the Nx300h, the Rx450h, or the RAV4 Hybrid. BMW makes a X5 plug in hybrid and Ford used to make an escape hybrid, but the X5 was too expensive acutely and the Escape Hybrid is no more. That being said, I would have gone for the RAV4 but the interior is nowhere near that for it's cousing NX300h Lexus (although it has more camera angles).  Ok, back to the car, it performs as advertized -- we are getting between 29-33 MPG in 80% city driving. It handles great and the safety stuff like blind spot monitoring, pre-collision assist, and radar guided cruise control are pretty great. The car is really whisper quiet. (*Acceleration however has a drone, but it's not that bad but sort of unexpected in a Lexus). Handling is actually a bit more sedan like than the RX we gave up. Seats are bit tighter too than the RX -- but it's a smaller car.Suspension and road feel are classic Lexus. My big qualm is the cost -- which it was not $5000 more versus a comprable nx200 to save gas and hurt the environment less. This car gets an easy 5-stars if they charged less for it. But, the ride is really quite good, the handling excellent, and luxury is strong. The new RX is bigger than the previous or we might have bought that with all the new safety and technology features, but they no longer make that 2012-2015 style. To complain of some almost unnoticeable acceleration compromises in an SUV that emits 276 grams of CO2 per mile (less than a Toyota Corrolla at 287 grams of CO2 per mile) seems besides the point. It's hard to ease your carbon footprint and be an SUV this luxurious other than for the nx300h. For comparison, note the nx200 emits 368 grams of CO2 per mile. Sad this technology is not incentivized more. Perhaps the government will at some point though.",4

I had been driving a 2001 Lexus RX300 and really loved that car and did not want the larger footprint of the newer RX models.  My ideal car would be the layout of the old RX300 with updated electronics and slightly sportier handling, with the comfort typical of lexus and toyota seating.  The new NX was the closest I could find to my ideal car.  It has a footprint closer to the old RX than to the new RX and has sportier handling than the new RX.

I'm glad I did.  I drove all 3 configurations of this car and like the handling and ride of the hybrid the best.  I did and do NOT find it sluggish.  It has much better accelleration than the Kia Sorento we traded in.  Breaking is excellent also.  Handling, comfort are all as you would expect from Lexus. This is our first Lexus and first hybrid.  We get 35 mpg city and hwy.  We have had it for 2 months.  I really just wanted to comment on the accelleration and breaking as that comes up as a negative on some reviews.

The GX was simply too big and the gas mileage too low to justify keeping this car (especially as I have a 2016 RC350 sports car that I use as my fun car). I bought the NX as my daily driver, and decided to get the hybrid so as to have an SUV that gets at least 30mpg overall. The car is excellent in every respect except for two areas. Acceleration is poor, especially when getting onto the highway. But once the NX gets up to speed it maintains it's speed well. Gas mileage was good the first few months, getting at 30 mpg on each tank of gas (my best was 35.3 mpg). But in the last month the mileage has dropped to between 27 to 28 mpg. I'm still happy with the vehicle, but in hindsight would probably have gotten the gas only version instead of paying the premium for the hybrid. Regardless, the NX is an overall great SUV and do not regret buying one.",5

After several test drives, it came down to BMW and Lexus. I liked the looks and performance of the BMW, but the comfort of the Lexus outperformed the BMW. I want and need comfort. A recent road rage experience tested the NX 300h’s automatic braking ability. The driver in front of me abruptly stopped his vehicle illegally on a highway. The LEXUS stopped on a dime, keeping me and the jerk who had stopped safe. While it would have been nice to have 2-driver seat memory like our LEXUS ES350, I’m the primary driver who drives the NX 300h 99% of the time, so it wasn’t an important feature to me. Also, I disliked the automatic wipers on our ES350. We live along the coast where the air is often moist. No amount of fine tuning would keep the automatic wipers turning on in thin fog. We shut off that function. Glad it wasn’t to pester me on the NX 300h. I like the driving assist feature that automatically slows down my car when approaching slower vehicles. I also like that I can easily bypass that function by accelerating and pass them. Everything functional in the LEXUS works great. I love my NX 300h. My only two beefs have to do with looks: in an effort to appear luxurious, LEXUS copied BMW to an extent for the interior. The little bit of “luxury”on the dash looks small and silly, compared to the entire sweep of luxury on the BMW X1 & X3’s dashboard. Also, instead of smooth lines, the NX300h has odd rear lights that stick out from the car, reminiscent of the 1950’s fins. I wonder how long it will take for falling rocks to break one of my rear lights.",4

When purchasing the NX I assumed certain features, which I considered to be basic for a Lexus car, would be included.  THAT IS NOT THE CASE!!  For instance, I was considering an NX 300, but it did not have driver's seat memory.  I had to buy an NX 300 H, which the salesman said was top-of-the-line, for over $45,000 MSRP, to get driver's seat memory and the parking sensors.  However, after I got it, I realized this car does not turn on the wipers automatically when it rains (a feature I already had in a 2005 RX 330).  The car also does not have the heads-up display (a feature I already had in a 2010 RX 450H).

This is my 4th Lexus. I had an RX300, an RX350. The last one was an RX 450h.  I continue to be more than just little disappointed with the lack of amenities that come at this price tag - - even embarrassed at times!!!  I still wanted a Lexus, but wanted to go a little smaller...no kids to haul around anymore.  So I thought this would be perfect.  It handles like a sports car. Love that!  It maneuvers well on the highway in heavy traffic. But it is a noticeably rougher ride than the last three cars and even those who ride with me comment about it.  And for the price, I was startled that lane drift alert of any kind was not standard.  In fact I was told it doesn't come with that at all.  Seriously?  My son's Hyundai has that!! So does my husbands Tundra. It is a pretty standard feature. The tundra also has a touch screen (nope, not in this Lexus) and bluetoothing the phone does not operate as I'm accustomed (it won't let me dictate a text response).  It is a bit smaller inside, so the seats are a bit tighter fit and at first I experienced hip pain until I got used to the narrowness of these seats. The back seats, though, are roomier than you would imagine. In my 450h, I enjoyed the hand held mouse control.  This vehicle has the flat surface you drag your finger across.  Couple that with the rougher ride and needless to say I've dialed a few wrong folks when trying to select from recent calls on the screen.  The radio station selection system is not intuitive.  It was between this Lexus and a couple of others and I chose the NX300h because of the good experience I've had with Lexus in the past.  I would not purchase this car again at this price point.  Entry level vehicle or not, a Lexus should uphold a certain level of perks that this car does not have.  I'm not so hung up on the little ""L"" on the grill that I wouldn't select a higher package version of a Sonata in the future. As far as gas mileage, it has been a disappointment.  I got better mileage from my 450h and it was larger and heavier.  The tank is VERY SMALL so I am still stopping pretty frequently to fill up.  Just driving a ""Lexus"" doesn't increase the value enough for me to have given up the other amenities I liked.   I should have read closer when the information said this was an ""entry level"" model.  That's a bummer.  A Lexus should be a Lexus.  And by the way, all the free maintenance stuff is not honored if you take it to another Lexus dealership.  This was pitched to me as a Lexus benefit, but evidently it is a DEALERSHIP benefit!  Imagine my surprise when the next dealership charged me $80 for an oil change.  No thanks.  My car is going to the Toyota dealership for service where, even though it is not free, it counts toward warranty compliance.  Note to Toyota:  Spiff up that RAV4 with better seating and you'll be my next car.  I'd rather save the $25K!!!!!!!!!!!",4

The side curtain airbags deployed as expected and created a safety blanket that shielded me from glass and road debris. the EMT's arrived and found me with not a single scratch. They were absolutely shocked that I walked away unharmed. Of course the car was a total loss and my insurance company called me the next day and offered me just south of 7,000 towards another vehicle.

The engine has plenty of power and gets very, very good gas mileage. The ride is super smooth and quiet, even on the freeway. I do all the maintenance and I haven't had a single problem with it. I leased a 2002 ES 300 for 2 years and loved it so much that I traded it in and bought this new one.

I'm in my 30s and this serves as a professional yet chilled statement car for comfort and safety freaks. Young smart professionals can still flex with the Joneses without “doing too much” like the sporty pretentiousness of a BMW or Mercedes-Benz. The Lexus attitude prides itself on giving you loyalty and luxury in an affordably smart way. V6 is better on gas: Premo octane isn’t required on this model—Mid-grade will help you save on that shmoney! It's a commuter’s bestie and comfortable for long rides. I had to level-up and get the voice navigation with Mark Levinson sound. NO--I can't stand that it didn't come with Bluetooth interface--but no biggie (went to Walmart and bought an FM Transmitter for like 40 bucks--#HOWBOUTDAT). Whisper quiet: can barely hear the engine running and the cabin acoustics is great for when I have to clear my head from a trying day’s work at the office. Be disloyal and hit up another brand outside Lexus? I have SERIOUS doubts about that.,5

769, on 09/09/15 22:46 PM (PDT),Roberto Fabricio ,2005 Lexus ES 330 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.3L 6cyl 5A),Can't get rid of it," Like many I got the new car urge a couple of weeks ago. Wanted a new Lexus, the ES350. I went out to a couple of the dealerships nearby and nearly got one. But the fact is that my ten year old ES330 has me hooked. I like the traditional layout of the dash and the console, the abundant use of genuine leather and wood and the classic and classy style of the car in and out. As fantastic as the new ES350 is, there is no leather in the base car and no wood, just plastic appliqués. So I stayed with the ES330. Let's say that I looked, drove and nearly signed the papers, but when it came down to it I could not justify spending nearly $40,000 (finance included) for a new car when my 10 year old has 53,000 miles and looks and drives like a new car. I bought the car three years ago when it was 8 years old and had 33,000 miles. It had been used so sparingly that the gas door needed oil so it could open smoothly. I felt that I actually broke the car in. Since then I have put 20,000 on the car and for all practical purposes it has been like buying a new car off the showroom. There hasn't been a single problem with this ten year old car. It rides smoothly, handles nimbly and accelerates very well when I need to ease into traffic atthe turnpike. The only problem I have with the car is that the headlights have dulled and clouded and I need to replace them. The factory light assembly runs $305 each. Aftermarket quality light assemblies run about $220 each. You can find them in Ebay for as little as $160 a pair. But the quality is uncertain and I am told by my body shop guy that the cheap Chinese lights leak. I plan to drive the car to the 100,000 mark - another 5 years. I believe that at that point I should still be able to get around $4,000 for car that cost me $15,000 eight years earlier. Anticipating about $2,500 in maintenance, tires and repairs in the next five years that would be $1,680 a year to operate this car - not counting insurance and gasoline. And all that comfort, luxury and style. Best car ever, as far as I'm concerned.",5

They are all nice cars but the ES330 drives more smoothly, is more luxurious, does not require premium unleaded, and is more roomy inside. The transmission isn't as bad as some of the other reviewers have stated. Once in awhile it will have problems finding the right gear but 99% of the time it's fine. Other problem areas are the steering knuckle joint makes noise during the winter (there is a TSB for this). The headlights were aimed way too low but are easily adjusted with a screwdriver.

I however, never cared for this Lexus nor the ES300 because I just thought it was a hopped up and pretty version of a Toyota Camry. Boy was I ever more wrong. My story with this car started when I had too many problems trying to share a car with my dad because my sister took my 1999 Toyota Camry. I have a busy schedule - multiple jobs and school, so I am rarely home and constantly on the road. Finding a time slot available for me to take the Honda Passport we were sharing, to go out and do my business, was becoming increasingly difficult. Not to mention, my dad had a knack for being late on returning the car. So, I was on Cragislist 24/7 looking for a reliable and smart choice as my first car. I had searched and researched the reviews on all potential candidates (this website is great for reviews by the way). The Lexus ES300 of this generation was my first choice, the problem was finding a good example that was good according to my standards. Roughly 4 months later, I found one that was acceptable. Owners had supposedly maintained the car, its been garaged, and it had lower mileage than the Camry I was about to buy.Long story short, with one text, led to me seeing and handing over $5,000 in cash. So, how is the car? It rides great! I mean, it's supple, it's buttery smooth, and yet, it still corners well. This car surprised me with how fast I can take it around a bend. Oh, and it's quiet too, of course. As a matter of fact, I'd have to say, this is the best riding car in terms of comfort and performance (for what it is) I've ridden in. The acceleration is plenty (has more torque than top speed). The previous owner loved bragging to me how she could take it to 100mph and still have room for more. It's no drag racer, but for daily driving around town, its got enough to dodge traffic with ease. The transmission, is so smooth. Well, I take that back. It was smooth, but after I did a transmission flush, it is butter smooth. Brakes are well, good. Not much I can say since I'm not taking this car to the track to test its limits. Steering is direct, but smooth and light. Not too light though, not like newer Toyota's where it feels like there's no resistance, the ES300 has the perfect feel for daily driving around town (or freeway too) all while giving great feel. Interior wise, for its time, just oozes quality. I mean, the wood trim is beautiful, the controls are solid, and nothing feels cheap. Except for the cup holders. Coming from a previous Toyota Camry of same generation, this is worlds apart in terms of handling and quality. I've spent time in a 2008 BMW 3-Series, and truthfully, my 2001 Lexus ES300 feels higher quality (everything is solid, not loose), looks higher quality (materials), and will last longer. Almost forgot, gas mileage. Now from my calculations, I'm getting a combined figure around 18.5mpg, not exactly great by today's standards. Although, I live in a city where things are closer, so the last time I filled up, was a month ago! Under smooth driving of course. What started off as just a smart choice for a A-to-B car, turned out to be a car I love so much and grew a new found love for Lexus and their engineering excellence. Awesome side note: my first 2 weeks of ownership, I kept getting compliments from friends, family, even strangers on how nice my car is! Just last week of the time of this writing, a person walking downtown told me I had a nice car. Not bad for a Lexus from 2001, huh?8/31/2016 UPDATE:I've now had some good time with this car under my belt. I've pushed it to its limits now. A few quick points:1. I've discovered the braking limits of the car (70 to 0 in rush hour). The car brakes well from about 45mph, but at 70, the car struggles to shed off speed for an emergency stop. That's not to say it failed me, as the braking capabilities did stop me from an accident, but it could be better.2. Fuel economy is still okay at best. With me driving it 5 days a week at 70mph, I fill up every 3 weeks if I don't go out on the weekends. 3. Ride quality has dramatically changed ever since I installed new shocks. It feels like a sports car now, really. It's much stiffer and can handle corners even better! I notice the small bumps and cracks in the road now and steering feel has gotten sharper. 4. Although I can seat people in the back, the car's performance suffers greatly. I can definitely feel the difference with the extra weight. The last time I had 3 people in the rear (plus luggage) and going up my slightly inclined driveway, the rear dragged down enough to scrape the exhaust or something. Ouch.5. Snow performance is great. I was driving in a snow storm that stopped even trucks and buses, but this little Lexus just kept putting along (with careful driving).",5

It's as if the transmission can not decide on what gear to go into. When it finally does there's a slight lurch forward. One other thing is a rattle that happened in the right rear.

933, on 07/07/18 12:44 PM (PDT),Roy ,2000 Lexus ES 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan,Straying from European Imports," I am 26 years old and have already owned 15 cars and 9 motorcycles. About half the cars I've owned were domestics, but bought my first & only toyota, or japanese car for that matter, about 5 years ago (like 2013?). It was a 1996 Toyota Celica and was a great car that I bought in a pinch because I wrapped my Mercury Grand Marquis around a telephone pole during a bad ice storm, had barely any money to my name, and needed something that was cheap to purchase, maintain, insure, and operate. It was a phenomenal car for the measly $1000 I paid for it, really fun to drive with the 5MT (had no power but was great in the corners. Kinda like a FWD Miata), and that was it. I bought a 2005 BMW 330XI and sold it. I did look back however and really missed the driving experience that the Toyota gave me, and yes, even over the bimmer. I actually had someone make me an offer on the BMW of about twice what I paid for it one day while pumping gas, and given the fact that I was managing a car dealership at the time, I was under that mentality of ""everything is for sale"" and of course, sold it that same day. After selling the BMW, I got into volvos and have been in a Volvo for most of the last 4 years. This last october of 2017, I sold my prized possession and to this date, my favorite car I've owned - My ULTRA rare 1998 Volvo S70 T5M (only 363 manual T5 S70's were brought into the states in 1998) in order to buy a truck as I took a job working construction. I've never liked trucks and a couple months ago, received a service truck through my current job and was informed I no longer needed a truck for work. I couldn't wait to get out of the truck and traded it almost immediately for my current car, a 2000 Lexus ES300. I drove many Lexus cars while working the dealership and the one thing that always blew my mind was how it simply didnt matter how many miles these cars had on them, they always look, felt, drove, and even smelled new. 100, 200, 300, even 400k miles couldnt bring these things down. You take what are arguably the most reliable cars on earth (Toyota) and then put EXTRA attention to detail, sparing no expense to build quality. My ES300 has quickly become my 2nd favorite car I've owned (behind the Volvo S70) and I just cannot believe at almost 150k miles, how pristine and perfect the car still is inside and out. Again, EVEN THE SMELL is still there. Sure, it wont win any races and in fact, it's actually rather sluggish, handles alright, stops decent, but boy is it quiet and holy crap does it ride well. The stock stereo sounds great with all sorts of music, everything is easy to figure out and control, I guess the punchline of the car to me is that everything just makes sense. I changed out every single light on the outside of the car, high beams, fogs, HID's and all the rear lights, in about 45min combined with no tutorial or anything. Its a solid, great, reliable daily driver that has aged extremely well. Still looks modern and sleek and sexy even at 18 years old.",5
934, on 04/24/18 16:20 PM (PDT),Denise ,2000 Lexus ES 300 Sedan 4dr Sedan,An older Lexus but it's been a good one!," Can't complain about my 2000 Lexus.  It's been a great investment.  It has been in the shop 3 times in it's life. Twice to different dealers to figure out why the check engine light stays on (neither dealership could pick up a reason for this and I still check it to make sure it's not on for some real reason - always no concern). And once for meeting with a deer on a country road.  It has had ZERO mechanical issues.  All I do is maintenance and even then I let that slide a little longer than it deserves.  It has 180k miles and still going strong.  The paint is perfect, all the mechanisms work perfect (window motors, sunroof, etc.) the seats are cream colored and shockingly even they are in great shape and don't look abused or dirty.  No rips, no tears.  That car drives on dirt ranch roads, lots of highway miles too.  In it's old age I hear more wind noise than I used to but the road noise is still dampened unless I'm on some really poorly surfaced road.  Great value for your money.",5

As I mentioned, this car has been through three family members, and we bought it used! I STILL get compliments on how stylish, luxurious, and comfortable my car is. As I write we have NEVER had a major issue. The only time I have had it in the shop (besides regular maintenance and replacement of time belt, 200,000 strong!) was when my ignition locked up, because I over-parked and turned the wheel too far.. it was no big deal, but the AAA person in my area wasn't skilled in unlocking, so they just had to take off dash and reset, it's apparently a common problem, but it only happened once and I'm confident that it was my over-park that caused it. I'm keeping my car and won't let go until the wheels fall off! If you're shopping for a comfortable, reliable, yet stylish/flashy car, this is the one. I will always praise my lexus experience! If it weren't for these crazy new body styles I would 100% be upgrading to a newer lexus.

Transmission shifting issues, which started after a transmission oil change. Put in a bottle of Lucas and continued to use the car with problems. Though the transmission will die eventually, however it recovered in about a month's time, and has been running smooth ever since. This issue happened at about 230K odometer reading.10. some sound starting to come from the rear wheels at about 340K occasionally. On my own inspection, I found that dust cover plates behind the rear disc brakes were completely rusted, rotten and hanging loose. My car mechanic removed them completely and I have no intention to put new ones back on. That sound is gone now.All the issues above were so minor, and mostly I was able to find a solution and fix it on my own. Besides above, the only other issue was that at about 280K the rear valve cover started a minor leak. I do not intend to fix it as I know mechanics will open the engine and create more issues (I will run this car as long as the engine and transmission work).The car has developed rust on both sides of the rear wheels, as well as the clear top is peeling on the front driver's side too. The paint all over the rest of the car's body still is shiny new. I had it fixed for $900 (kind of new metal on the rusted area and nearly the whole car painted except the rooftop). After few days of painting, did apply ""NuFinish"" coat and it is mirror shining the black paint.Great car to own, drive and maintain.",5

I use synthetic oil (previous owners used synthetic also) every 10k miles and the oil is still golden brown after one years worth of driving.

A snap to wash because it's low and doesn't have the slab sides the newer models do.  I only have 75,000 miles on it now, but I'll trade it in for a new 350 -- as soon as Lexus makes one I like better than this one.

The ""new"" 99 tranny is twice as expensive to fix as a 99 Camry due computer chips in the transmission. All 4 struts needed replacing at 150k mi as well.  The ""check engine"" light has proven quite annoying as it appears a few times/yr due to a fuel system anomaly.

This car still drives like a dream, a smooth quiet ride with wonderful visibility and fantastic acceleration.  Lexus keeps on making changes to the ES350 and I prefer the one I own.  In California, I have to do a STAR smog check every two years.  Sometimes it is border line on the Hydro Carbons at idle speed.  This is not a problem if I do a Decarb and Throttle Body Service within a year before the SMOG test, $200 at Lexus.   I have had to replace the transmission pan gasket twice in the last five years, due to leaking, $400 to do that at Lexus.  A check engine light was from a solenoid which I choose to replace given it was 14 years old.  Over the last 8 years, I have driven 32,000 miles and have spent an average of $1100 a year having Lexus service it excluding battery and tires.

It has 313,000 miles on it, I service it at the local Toyota dealership and get the oil changed there every 3,000 miles even though they say you can go 5,000 miles. I love this car...I can't believe it's been over 3 years already. I might have to gift this car to someone, because it's that good of a car. I am looking forward to purchasing a Toyota Highlander Hybrid in the next year or so.I bought this car used about 2 1/2 yrs ago with 210,000 miles on it. I was not deterred with the mileage at that point, because I knew it would last about 3 yrs and I was completely fine with that and the price point at $1500 asking $2,300 (but it needed a few minor repairs, so price was lowered). I've been driving this car about 20k miles a year and I have had no problems with the car itself. It has been the best car I've ever owned and with significantly less miles. The car is so quite and runs like a champ. I could drive it another 2 yrs. at least before setting aside for a newer car and I will still keep it as a back-up car, it's too good of a car to sell.If people are having mechanical issues with the car, it's probably a lack of maintenance on the car. I was guilty of that on my old car (Altima). I drove this car on long trips several times, which I was a little worried that something might happen but nothing at least 300 miles + road trips one way. I replace the oil every 3000k miles, burns zero oil and if the oil was low it was 1/4 of a quart low, but I found that to be the quality of oil not the car. I used to use Valvoline oil but recently started going the Toyota dealership and using Mobil 1 5000 (5000 mileage) and I had clean oil and it was full.I would highly recommend this car to anyone looking for a $2000 car and even it you put $500 in the car for minor repairs it will pay for itself over and over. My repair shop said they would buy the car if I did not want it when I had it inspected to purchase :)Update: Still driving the car,  I just hit a new milestone 300k miles on the car! Just had the car serviced at Toyota and zero problems!! Love the car...I will keep it another year and upgrade to a Toyota Highlander hybrid 😀",5

Had to replace front struts and control arms, that's about it. Went through over 3 dozen new and used cars (BMW, Acura, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mitsubishi, GM, Dodge, Mazda, VW, Saab), but none, NONE like the ES300. This is car is ultra reliable and it can probably go for another 100K. This is really why many are loyal to the Toyota/Lexus brand. It's hard to beat it's quality and reliability combination. The engine will most often outlast the body and suspension. If there is a need for used car, this is the best one to get.         ",5

The radio LED didn't work nor did the lighter/chargers-annoying. The mpg however is 24 consistently and I've gotten up to 28 after servicing across the state.  When you have to step on it it REALLY kicks into high gear with a pleasant rush for this resistant to aging gal. I'd buy this car again and will probably keep it a long time.

Yea, I have the CD display problems that everyone else has, but other than that, the car is great!  I get a realistic 25 mpg, and can hardly hear the car purring, even when completely stopped.

As far as performance is concerned this car handles like a champ and practically drives itself, it's impressive 200 hp is more than complemented by its smooth beyond reason shifting.

I silently uttered ""the car is in drive."" He looked but still didn't believe it until I pushed the gas pedal. Also, the car has great power and good gas mileage, exceeding my expectations.

Great car till it comes to front suspension issue, its a money pit. I have had my fair share of BMW ownership as well; however, my Lexus tops BMW in repair bills. I have put over $5K just in suspension work and no this car has never been in any accident. What happened to the legendary reliability? I guess it is only legend with this car, even dealership acknowledges the inherent issue. Shame on you Lexus for charging the premium price for this junk as well as the premium price for parts.Update: Dealer recommended to replace brake activator assembly for $3,706.91 for making noise,, they always refused to fix it when the car was under warranty because it was the character of LS460 and didn't cause any danger to its occupants. Interior of the car has started to melt in Houston TX heat. Just Google yourself ""Melting Toyotas"". Lexus has refused to fix 2008 and onward,,, they are only doing the recall on 2007 LS460. The most disappointing car I have ever purchased. Lexus LS460 sales have dropped 2007 - 35,226 to 2015 - 7,165 (US sales).... Keep making cheap cars Lexus.....Update: Steering went out (153K), had to spend $3,152 for a new rack and pinion. Also, dealer notified me that I need additional suspension repair for $2,168 to replace driver and passenger knuckle because due to worn out lower ball joint. My wife calls it ""Bottomless pit"".Update: finally sold it at 158K, it did bring more in trade then I was expecting.

We also have an 02 LS430 with 112 on it and the only thing that broke was the driver window regulator.  Way way more reliable than the 7 BMW and one MB S class we have previously owned.     The car is super quiet and gets great mileage on the highway.   The Mark Levinson in my 08 is much better than the ML sound in the 02.  The stereo is absolutely fantastic!  The other thing I like is it has a chain driven timing belt so no more expense of replacing the timing belt in the previous generation.  I highly recommend this car.    UPDATE FEB 2018: Still totally reliable at 82000 miles. The only complaint is the vinyl used on dash and doors. The driver door armrest has cracks in it. All the vinyl gets super sticky when in the sun. The 2007 models had a recall for it but not the 08 models for some unknown reason.

This is our 4th Lexus and I am disappointed in the overall quality of the car.  Aside from the recall, I have had a number of mostly minor quality- related issues since my last review, including an issue with paint chips on the front of the car and a blown out speaker in my expensive Levinson stereo.  If I had to do it over again knowing what I know now, I would not purchase this car.  I expected uncompromising quality in a car I could drive for 10 years like my last 2 (less expense) Lexus vehicles.  Now I worry about expensive repairs down the road.

This car is very much the same, just much more advanced, smooth and powerful.  Lexus is getting pricey is the only bad thing, but once you're used to this car no other even comes close. I tried to find a more economical replacement but there are none on the market.  The German cars that are in the same league are unreliable and even more overpriced than this one, and because I keep my cars forever they're not an option for me.

While we were waiting for him to return with the keys my wife saw the LS460 and said she loved how that one looked.  I of course responded that it was also the most expensive!  When our salesman returned we said we would also like to drive the LS.  Of course there was no comparison and we bought the LS.  It is just the perfect car.  So fast and incredibly comfortable.

I understand the safety ramifications, but when you have a passenger in the front seat this should be disarmed.   I was pleasantly surprised with the gas mileage...I've actually hit 33 miles per gallon with this car, which to me is unheard of with this large of an engine (and considering how fast I drive).

The performance is very good for a large sedan, not as good as the 750, but pretty close.

I shopped the 7, S550, A8 and all of them are very fine cars but none of them though outdo the LS is the aforementioned categories. AND - the LS is 20k less than all three of those models.

It is a solidly well built and quiet vehicle with absolute comfort and interior design, especially in the rear compartment which almost resembles the cabin of a private jet. Despite its 4300 lb weight, I get about 20 mpg around town and 30 mpg highway, depending upon traffic conditions. Its power is impressive as well as its 8 speed transmission which is seamlessly smooth. One minor drawback is the roughness of downshifting at 30 mph.

Even driving at 50 MPH with the sun roof open is quieter than most vehicle with a closed sunroof. The interior is impeccable and is likely nicer than many living rooms you will encounter.

I recently turned 40, and wasn't sure if I was ""old enough"" yet for the LS based on the styling of older models.

It's all more marketing than actual truth & fact!!! I over-paided, foolishly trading-in a fabulous BMW in excellent condition with ALL OF THE FEATURES which this LS (top of the line model with rear luxury package) fell short of; what a HUGE REGRET!!! -- I'm sure one of the sales person's children is currently the fabulous BMW!!! Oh my, what a difference!! If you want wofty, not even anywhere near linear GM-Cadillac styled quality (or ANY SIMPLE LINEAR steering behavior -- constantly adjusting the steering wheel like a '75 Plymouth)!! on simple streets & highways, go for it as it got 29mpg on hwys, all the time, attracting every chip in the road. Mine had been refinished by the dealership with hidden fillers, which, upon 3-4 car washes, showed all of the true imperfections, which, of course, when it came time to trade it, had strikes against it. Had it been honestly represented, I NEVER would have offered such a price!!! Further, a MAJOR COSMETIC issue occurred, after a light rain the following 2nd day following taking delivery....., and the dealership attempted to, ""share the burden of said repair"", though, obviously, it was tacked-down with whatever glue they use when refurbishing. Moreover -- they're dealership extended warranty doesn't cover hidden, engineering defects; or anything of actual use, and even then, you have to pay a percentage -- expensive & simply useless!! And!! Go in for a simple oil change...you are required to pay for a full review of your vehicle (approx. $125.00), whereas, Mercedes & BMW provide such a complimentary inspection at no cost at their dealerships. ""PURSUIT OF YOUR WALLET AND NOT PERFECTION"" is more like it!!! Perhaps because individuals are willing to put up with such, along with the ""Marketing"", individuals think they're purchasing reliability -- you're still PAYING FOR IT. I never thought I would touch a Toyota product after my mother's endless issues with her Camry (LEXUS has same parts inside), though, here I was, and, guess what, it was worse than the expense of owning the most expensive Mercedes!! My recommendation: RUN!!!!!! FAST!!!!!  BTW -- LEXUS is tacky now, and always ugly! Go purchase a REAL AUTOMOBILE, not a plastic one!!",2

The LS Ultra Luxury L is my first non American luxury car. Many advanced features in this car that don't exist in American vehicles. Some you'll never use of course, you just pay extra for them. One good thing with non American cars is that there's a lesser waste of energy in the drive system & more power go to the wheels. Japanese cars have reliable engines & transmissions. The LS has had several issues & problems. As others have mentioned, it has a major wind noise issue that can't be fixed. I've done the upgrades by the dealer & it's still there! There's a problem with the design of this car. This car also has other noise issues from all over after it passes 50k miles. Lexus told me all the earlier LS models have this issue! An $80-90K car has such a fundamental issue?! The air shocks after a few years go bad & it costs $4k to replace them. The trunk in the L model is extremely small & isn't practical. The front seats aren't that comfortable. The driver legroom is really bad & your knees either hit the steering wheel or the front buttons. Other issues when the car gets a little older: speakers vibrate, cooling system problems, touch screen problems, wheels coating chips. Not acceptable for a car with that price range.",3

The fix did not change the noise problem.  Lexus is saying nothing else can be done.  Issue #2:  The truck lid leaks water into the truck on both sides near the tail light assemblies when raised after a heavy rain or after going through a car wash.

I also purchased the 19"" factory Lexus wheels which really made the LS look much better than it did with the 18"" wheels.  It was my dream car that I really wanted after owning a 2002 LX470 for 10 years that I purchased in 2005.  The LS460L is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned.  My favorite features was the Mark Levinson sound system and the extended wheelbase.  We drove to Louisiana in the LS and it felt like I was sitting on a nice leather couch with a steering wheel in front of me.  I drove to Louisiana in my LX470 a few years ago and it was not as comfortable as the LS.  I am tall and the LS460L is incredibly spacious for tall folks and a family of (5).  I wish the LS had a panoramic sunroof option and I am surprised it was never offered.  The acceleration was smooth and felt like a plane taking off on the tarmac.  It felt like the car was floating the faster I drove.  Most reputable car reviewers always speak negatively about the lack of sport feel and power compared to it's German competitors, but I'm not looking for a sport feel in a huge luxury sedan.  I would buy something much smaller if I want a sporty driving experience.  They also mention how the styling is bland compared to it's competitors, which I agree.  Lexus finally stepped it up with the new generation LS500!  The Lexus brand really needs to offer better wheel selections like Audi, BMW and Mercedes Benz.  The Germans seem to have the best optional wheel selections that look better than most aftermarket wheels.  I sold my LS in 2016 and purchased a certified pre-owned GX460.  Long story concerning my reasoning for selling it, but I plan to either buy the new generation LS500 or the LX570 in a few years when I can pick one up as a certified pre-owned.  The LS460 is an excellent vehicle with solid engineering.  You can't go wrong with this vehicle if you were thinking about purchasing it.",5

Pros: Very quiet, comfortable, quick acceleration, great handling for car this size, reliable. Cons: Brakes warp easily, navigation system is horrible, $130 oil changes at quick change places, navigation update was about $300.   I owned 2001 LS430 before this that was more comfortable, quieter, smoother ride and more solid feeling. The 460 is faster and has 2 engine air filters and thick robust brake pads that last a long time.  This is a great car but the LS430 was a bit better in my opinion.

1327, on 01/04/16 18:21 PM (PST),Alvin ,2010 Lexus LS 460 Sedan 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 8A),BUY IT...BUY IT!!!," Easily the best car I've purchased.  Easily.As other reviews have stated, this is reliable luxury for less!  Keep in mind this is the Lexus flagship sedan, with MSRP's close to $80k when new.  Because of that, Lexus has invested/added a LOT of features as ""standard in this vehicle"".  I test drove a 7-series before this which had more features and a much livelier V8, however a horrendous ownership experience that would likely have come with it (high maintenance, high repair, horrific resale value) would have followed.The LS460 is by far the quietest, most comfortable vehicle I've ever owned.  Whether it is cruising on the interstate or navigating through downtown traffic, this vehicle isolates you from the world, it actually makes commuting a pleasure!  The terrific Mark Levinson surround sound system is worth the upgrade and tuned precisely for audiophile pleasure!  The quality of the leather, the interior and the trims are all well thought out.  It is a spectacular ride; test drive one and you'll see what I'm talking about!What to look out for?  Control arms are an issue for 07-10 LS460's with repairs costing over $5k.  This is a well documented issue, and was resolved in 2011.  Also note with this vehicle, maintenance costs more (it takes 9 quarts of oil for an oil change).  Other than that, there is a great network of supporting Lexus dealers to service this, though you can have it serviced at your Toyota garage for cheaper (same stuff, really).Again I can't say enough, best car I've ever owned.  Sporty when you want it to be, serene and dreamy when you need it.  Driving should be an experience, not a function, and this car fulfills that so well.",5

Honestly, the two earlier cars were much quieter, as if powered by a huge electric motor. The driver's seat was more comfortable and its cushion extended farther forward to support under my legs. (I am 6'3"" tall.) Other than that, the 2010 is a much-improved car. The motor has direct injection at very high pressure and it idles like a diesel - very noisy, especially compared to the earlier two cars - but the horsepower and torque are much greater.

I love the heated seats, love the fake leather used, very luxurious feeling and easy to clean.

It is stiff and not luxurious feeling in the suspension. you do get somewhat road noise unless you have the wonderful sound system on. the headlights are sort of odd, in that you don't get a FULL shine, it's sort of cut off, unless you have the bright lights on then it's great.

Had two services performed by dealer. Oil change at 6 months they came to my home. At 12 months they came by to pick up car and provided a loaner anf work done in 24 hours. Really enjoying the comfortable ride, great mileage per gallon, and not having to go for gas fillup every week. Sad to hear Lexus will not continue with this model in 2018.  Reliability, durability, fit & finish, technology and 40+ mpg sold us on this over the Prius Hatchback and V models we test drove. With a 5' tall driver they couldn't reach the hatchback on the Toyotas to close them. We thought with the Lexus brand the buying and post purchase customer experience would be as positive. Rather it has been inconsistent and requires me to have follow up individually with each department. Having the Lexus Certified Pre Owned 161 point inspection, 6 complimentary services over 30 months, and the extended 78 month warranty gives us confidence to many trouble free miles and a reduced Total Cost of Ownership.Update 9/08/17. Have had the car for over six months now and it still drives and feels like a new vehicle. Had the first of six complimentary maintenance services performed at my home. Based on the dealership's VIP program they send a Tech out to do minor service and will also provide a loaner care when major service is performed at the next 30K interval. Based on the Tech's recommendation the tires will have to be replaced in the next 6-12 months. They came with Michelin's and I'm researching whether or not to get Pirelli's or another brand.

It had 30,000 miles on it and was in excellent condition. I have the 2012 f sport. I chose it because I did my research. A large portion of taxi cab drivers in New York City drive the Toyota Prius. They can take a beating and are very reliable. They also get incredible gas mileage.  But in my own opinion the prius is very ugly. Then steps in the Lexus ct200h; the prius's cousin that won prom king and took home the best looking girl on the cheer leading team. Don't get me wrong, there are some definite trade offs between the two. You have the same power train and reliability. You don't get the same gas mileage but it is still darn good. The acceleration isn't that good. But I can drive out windy country roads going 70mph driving with my pinky finger. It stays flat in turns with no body roll. The suspension is very stiff and sporty but comes with a draw back NEVER HIT POT HOLES. It will literally rattle your fillings out. You can feel every single nick, crack, chip, whatever i the road. It is the equivalent of wearing those silly shoes with the individual toes. My wife hates this and I love it. Oh I bought this car when I was single and didn't have any kids. I wouldn't recommend this for people who are planning on having kids. It is possible but car seats are very difficult to fit. I mean you cannot be a tall person and fit a childs car seat in the rear facing position. I like it because of the handling, the economy, the comfort, the reliability, the looks, and the ease of driving. It is stupid easy to operate, just don't curb those f sport rims. Oh and change your fluids like you care about you car. I changed the transmission fluid the instant I got the car. There is this misconception that people don't need to change their transmission fluid EVER. That advice is only for KIA drivers. Everybody acts like this car can't drive on the interstate. Don't listen to them. I've gone across the country with the car full of adults. Just take it out of ECO mode so the car can breath a little. As far as space goes, my wife does caterings and uses my car, she lays the seats down and can do caterings for a 100 people or so. If acceleration is a big deal breaker go buy a Tesla. If you can't afford it do what I did.",5

The front seats are comfortable. Negatives: It's slightly underpowered, especially on hills, and not as luxurious as you'd expect a Lexus to be.

We now put 76k on the clock and we are beating EPA rated numbers. We do more highway driving than city, which according to official numbers should be the lower number. Our lifetime average up to 58k was 43.7mpg. Then I reset it because I finally bought a winter tire set and new oem set, we are at 76k now (18k since reset) and the average is 44mpg and rising. As I mentioned in previous reviews, warmer season mpg will be in 45+ range, it will drop to 40+ during cold months. If you aren't a spirited driver, you will most likely beat epa estimates. I doubt racers will be buying this car anyway. With that said the car handles really really well. I always try to steal it from my wife on weekends to drive around as enjoy well handling cars (i am left with a minivan for my 2 mile commute to train station and that's not fun to drive). I would say that about every big vehicle on the road btw. CT just feels like a road hugger, only lacks acceleration and a stick shift. Second big thing, (technically third since i mentioned handling), the car has been as reliable as it can get. No issues whatsoever. We will be driving this thing until it goes because that's where owning Toyota/Lexus product is the greatest advantage. Their cars are rock solid in reliability and can go long miles. One more thing, we are still on original brake set @76k...wow! I may need to get Focus ST as a third car as I am dying to have a stick shifter and the car that speeds up a bit faster but that's more of weekend car wish than an everyday driver. Back to hybrids, there has been a wave of improved hybrids that hit the market since we bought CT, so choices are better today than in 2012/2013. And despite popular hate on diesels, i love them. Check out BMW 535d (started in 2014) if you can  afford it.",5

To all hybrid newbies: fuel consumption falls down more significantly in hybrids in winter season compared to standard cars. So I am expecting better mpg as we head into warmer season.

Certainly not like a supercharged JAG,   but well within sporty car realms, for a lot less money.  The build quality is superb, as it should be for a Lexus. The cockpit feels, for my 150 lb. frame, just right, is very luxurious , (almost like my wife's ES 350 ) and it fits! Plenty of room in the back for cargo, too.  The ride quality could be improved, though.  Those low profile tires are terrible, they don't add much  to cornering prowess, at reasonable speeds, and  just give you lousy ride quality.

This happened about 3 times so we stopped having them wash the car. In one of these visits, someone left a dirty rag on the dashboard and it took months for them to get the stain out.  We've also had difficulty finding out about a new car release for the UX. I asked several times in sales about a rumoured replacement for the CT to no avail, then I found it on the internet and told them about it. These trivial things have made me wonder what they would do if something big happened.The car is excellent, still drives like new and gets 40 in town, 50 on hwy. Hard to beat those statistics.

Had an RX and didn't need that much space.  Family grown, mostly drive alone.  It's a wonderful alternative.  Love that you can shift it to Sport mode, but you have to watch your speed.  It does have cruise control.  Next, thinking about NX, a new one right inbetween RX and CT.  They just put on options so you have to take what is there.  Also no tan upholstry at all, you have to take black.  Or in the Sport model red and black.Bottom line, didn't have to put anything down, however I put $1k down to reduce payments and left owing $411/mo.  However the sales person said he would pay my first payment.  Sales Associate: AmirHave had Lexus since they first came out.  We had a 1990 LS 400.  You can pass them down or bring it back.

Having said that, if you're looking forthe traditional ""Plush"" Lexus ride this isn't the car for you. This is a Prius wrapped up in a really nice and sporty car like Lexus package. This combo gives you a good mix of fuel economy, sporty design and great build quality. I'm really searching to find negatives about this car and the only one I can come up with is the lack of HomeLink, which is tied to the navigation package. For a Lexus this should be a standard feature, regardless of package. Other than that, I absolutely love this car.Review update on 12/6/16:I've owned this car for almost three years now. My understanding is that Lexus in the newer model years of this CT has addressed some of the complaints such as making the cabin quieter, I can attest that on the highway this is kinda loud for a Lexus. As I mentioned in my original review, the ride is not plush but almost harsh and I think the low profile tires that Lexus went with have a lot to do with this. I was always opposed to having leather seats but now I really love them! Plus, they're heated and work really well! One thing that is hard getting used to is the CVT transmission, by this I mean is kinda weird not feeling any shift points at all. As far as reliability and quality especially in the interior is hard to top Lexus! Incredibly solid vehicle! Oh yes, the gas mileage IS amazing!",4

Did a lot of research on-line and thought this was the car for me.  Although I was looking for a sporty, economical commuter car, the Lexus CPO warranty sold me.  Decent car but with extremely small back seat and leg room.  Except for an infant in a car seat or a small child, I don't think may larger kids or adults would be comfortable.  I liked that hatchback feature although the storage area is small.  Nice features and really like the estimated mpg.  Decent interior features and accessories that you would expect with a Lexus.

This car is and F Sport Premium trim level but now, 6.5 months into 2016 Private party resale is a measly $24,000.00.  That is almost $23,000 off our purchase price.  NOT HAPPY!!    Aside from that, this car is a great city car and very good road trip car.  Turning radius is so good that I can almost turn around on a two lane road.  Lots of room in the garage too.   Acceleration is poor but adequate and we have averaged almost 43 mpg over our 27,000 miles.  Not bad.  Cargo space even with the back seats folded flat is not adequate for road trips but we managed two trips to Florida jammed tightly with two Shi Tzus and luggage in spite of that.  Difficult.    Car gets lots of compliments, most often from some kid on a skate board but just the same.  I can almost wash the entire roof from one side because the car is so low but it gets lost easily in the parking lot because it can hide behind something as small as a Volkswagen Rabbit.  We have learned to make sure to remember what row it is parked in.  Except for anticipating taking a beating when selling or trading, we give the car a ""B"" mostly for good looks and economy.",4
1464, on 04/06/16 16:17 PM (PDT),Anthony M. ,2014 Lexus CT 200h Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (1.8L 4cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),All a Matter of Perspective," When car shopping there are 2 cars in a persons mind: The ideal car that appeals to their emotion while tugging heart strings, and the car that's the logical, practical choice. This car falls into the latter category, which is no bad thing. Compared to the MB CLA, BMW 320i, and Audi A3, the CT is hardly a standout. But rest assured it'll far outlast any of those 3 in reliability and with lower maintenance costs to boot. Its interior is well laid out, and it possesses the greatest front seats in the business. The media system is simple to use (an easy thing to mess up in a car these days) and the premium audio system is pretty good for a non-branded setup. The Bluetooth streaming is very high quality too, while the interior materials are good for the category, with soft touch stuff where it counts. Its ride (I have the F-Sport with the firmer suspension) is a little harsh but never brittle. It's a controlled tightness that allows bumps into the cabin but takes the edge off each time. As an added plus, the CT can be had for thousands below sticker due to its lower demand, a benefit often overlooked in car reviews.If there's one big drawback to the car, it's the speed, or lack there-of. This is a slow car, no two ways about it, and it doesn't want to be rushed. Thankfully, the engine is well isolated so you won't feel like you're in an economy car when entering the freeway. Luckily speed is the CT's only dynamic downfall. In the hills this little hatch can hold its own when the going gets twisty. Steering is numb but razor sharp and laser precise. The suspension has hardly any role either.  The Sport Mode doesn't make the car any faster, but rather sharpens throttle response and weights up the steering for a sporty feel, useful for freeway or canyon use. Power issues aside, the CT never feels like a detached, isolation-pod hybrid whose only purpose is to suck the joy out of its owners in exchange for better savings at the pump.The CT200h is a solid car for anyone looking for solid entry-lux transport in the city. It lacks the pizzazz of its German brethren but is more practical and logical for long term ownership. As an added plus MPG does actually hover around its EPA ratings, and ginger driving will yield near a consistent 48 MPG (I've never gone below 44 MPG myself).",4

I've had my ’13 CT for four problem-free years. Lexus was smart to tweak the Prius powertrain and drop it into a sexy, fun-to-drive package -- the perfect combination for those of us who want to minimize our carbon footprint but still have a little fun behind the wheel! It's true the CT's 0-60 time is less than impressive, but it's a compromise I'm willing to make to get 45+MPG in city driving. Even so, it never feels underpowered around town. It has no problem taking on mountain passes or zooming around traffic on the highway (the CVT will rev like crazy under these circumstances but I don't find it overly intrusive). The steering and throttle response are noticeably more athletic in Sport Mode -- the CT really comes to life! The suspension is firm but not uncomfortably so. The 10-speaker premium sound system is a dream. Interior ergonomics are near-perfect. I'm 6-feet tall and for such a small car I have no problem finding a comfortable driving position. The only complaint I have about the interior is the fact that the tiny sun visors don't extend -- so annoying! I'm actually a fan of the mouse-like remote touch system for the nav unit. I find it intuitive. I’ve taken it on several long road trips. The front seats never grew uncomfortable and it's very easy to cruise along an empty interstate at speed -- very stable. The CT is a fantastic car in its own right -- that I have averaged 43+ MPG is icing on the cake! Americans have gone gaga over SUVs, though, which has affected resale value for the CT. Not many people want small, fuel efficient cars anymore, which has pulled the resale value down much more quickly than I anticipated. Even so, I look forward to driving my CT for many years to come!",5

It handles very nicely but there is a little more road noise than I liked to compared to our infinity G35.

We got our 2015 NX, fully loaded, when it hit the market.  While it seems to be a well built vehicle, it dramatically lacks the plush ride of my RX.  Lexus changes to Yokohama tires and while I can't say the issue is the tires, the ride of the NX is horrible.  I have played with the air pressure, but nothing helps.  Also, if you want any zoom in your driving, you have to put the NX is Sport mode, our you will be seem to be beating a dead horse to get this little SUV to move.  We also have an very inoying rattle coming from the rear view mirror, which can not be adjusted for anyone 6 ft or taller, plus we had to remove the head rests from the back seats in order to see out the back window.  This is a luxury grocery getter, but if you plan to make any long trips, spend a little more money and buy the RX.Update as of Aug 2018 - Lexus fixed the rattle, but can’t say the ride has improved.  The NX is now AWD, which would make it attractive to anyone living in snow country.  I am waiting on the Yokohama tires to wear out so I can replace them with Michelin tires.  Lexus loaned me an NX with Michelin’s when my NX was in the shop and what a difference it made in the ride of the NX - so if you purchase one, ensure you get one with Michelin tires, or you will be disappointed.",4
1487, on 01/15/17 12:51 PM (PST),Mike From Greenwich ,2015 Lexus NX 200t SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Wouldn't buy it again...," So here is the crux of this review. The entertainment system/GPS is the worse system I have every used. Before I explain let me tell you about myself. I have been in the computer industry for about 30 years now. I’m no longer a young man,  but I understand and have many years of experience with all types of electronic interfaces. I tell you this about myself so you will see this isn’t a case of user error, or inability of the operator to figure out the nuisances of this high tech new world. Here are just a few of the reasons this system is the worse. The first is that damn track pad. The TP is so finicky that when doing simple things like putting a new address into the GPS system it makes it extremely time consuming. The pad has multiple touch options (none of which be selected over another), so when you start to scroll to a letter on the screen keyboard just lightly touching the pad (to start moving the cursor) registers as a click. OK, so now you just touch the pad for the first time and already you have an error that you have to delete. Keep in mind that the entire pad can be pushed down to get a click as well, so you back that error out and start over. But again the system senses and responds in erratic ways, it would be so easy if you just had one way to input a click (i.e. push the whole pad down) to click. This problem surfaces again and again. Now you have pain snakingly inputted the address now the screen shows you a visual representation of the place you asking to navigate to. However, you have top move the cursor to the Red Dot Highlight and then click to select it. Well, you guessed it… as soon as you touch the pad it registers that as a click and now the address you asked for is altered. It may be off by feet or by miles depending on the screen zoom factor. These issues abound with just about every aspect of this system. Try searching for a playlist on your attached iPhone, good luck doing it while driving. For safety sake you HAVE to pull over. But hey maybe that is the point, Lexus decided that they would make such a bad system that people will stop interfacing with it when they drive. The problem with that of course is that it is just as difficult to operate when you’re by the side of the road. The POI section of the map is another terrible setup. On the BMW system the fist POI’s that are listed are Automotive (after all we are in a car when we use these) so finding a gas station or parking is so much easier than the Lexus system. Even when you do get the POI you want, again navigating to it entails highlighting the POI and clicking on it, and guess what… same issue, over sensitive track pad leads to wrong POI. Ridiculous. How about when you get back in your car and the music you were playing always defaults to the first song on your attached device rather then picking up from where you last left it. The iPod/iPhone interface on this vehicle is terrible. I travel for business a lot, so I’m in rental cars all the time. T I see the interfaces of all these economy cars and they are light years better than this higher end luxury SUV.  On a cheap Ford economy rental car I get easier access to my stored music and a better way to change what I’m listening to then on the Lexus. How about changing the zoom factor on the GPS display, simple right? No, you change it, but it reverts back to the same size unless you are in the proper view.The interface is terrible, it ruins the whole driving experience not to mention that you have to stare at the screen to do anything, nothing is intuitive. This would be just a minor annoyance if it weren’t so dangerous. Some of the issues I have had can be so distracting while driving that it is a wonder I haven’t gone flying off the highway while being distracted by this system. I write this to help inform people shopping for this car. If I had it to do over again I would not buy this vehicle. This car delivers on what any good car should do,  ride well, be comfortable, but that describes almost any well built car on the market today. The driving experience is more about how you interface with the various systems in the car. This car doesn’t just fall down on that issue it is without a doubt the worse system in any car, luxury or otherwise. I have experience with a multitude of cars and this system is by far the most difficult to operate, and the least intuitive, because of that it is the most dangerous interface on the market. I do not recommend this car to anyone.",2

First thing I noticed that the Lexus did not have was the digital speed limit. That may sound trivial, but even a 10 year old Civic has digital speed.  Also of note was the way Lexus packaged their options; the F Sport does not come with ventilated seats. Considering the price I paid I would expect to have additional features like lane departure warning, and brake assist, however I do have blind spot indicators. My 2008 IS 350 had memory seats for the passenger, however my NX 200t does not. The sound is great, however due to the rear ""trunk"" cover, there is significant vibration altering the sound. I simply removed my cover. The seats are very comfortable and provide ample space, however I am a small person and I thought they were a bit snug around my arms, and made it difficult to lean on the arm rest (maybe because I sit close!).  There are a few basic features that I would like to have seen in this vehicle, that were in my older 2008 IS 350, but maybe I'm just reminiscing and not giving the NX a fair shot! Its a beautiful car, despite not having real leather. The feeling of the NuLuxe is wonderful, and will last a long time.  The ride is smooth, but stiffer in sport mode.

Bought a 2016 and keep finding myself saying, ""This car is perfect."" It's not for those wanting V6 power, but NX is always ready to run. Very agile, superb electronics, flawless interior, great ride over heavy frost heaves, quiet, and will in a few years will be outselling its big brother RX. Not because RX is lacking, but because NX offers so much while also handling far better than RX and costing about $8,000 less at base MSRP.",5

Quick, silky smooth, and quiet best describe the performance. Feels and accelerates like a V6. Nicely appointed interior put together with quality materials. You either like the edgy styling... or you hate it! I like the look. Decent fuel economy for a turbo (I average 21 mpg around town, 28 on the road, with a best tank of 32 mpg. Wish the fuel tank held 18 - 20 gallons, instead of 15.9. The fuel warning light comes on with more than 3 gallons still in the tank... that's a bit too early for my liking!  No repair or maintenance costs yet... first two services are included.  Can put my road bicycle in the back without removing the front wheel! Two things cause my rating to be less than five stars. First, the ""charging pad""! Kind of useless with the charging ports and takes up too much of the limited  storage space. Get rid of it! My biggest complaint is reserved for the interface with the GPS system! It's terrible! I would rather use my smart phone than try and put an address in the vehicle's GPS. Trying to put the cursor on the proper number or letter... and have it stay there long enough to input takes a steady hand... and some luck!  After owning the vehicle for a year, I absolutely hate the GPS interface! Trying to input information with a knob... and having the computer anticipating what you are inputting... takes me multiple tries before I can input an address... is frustrating in the extreme!  This reminds me of all the problems BMW had with their I-drive system, a number of years ago!  I became so frustrated with the system, I traded the otherwise excellent  vehicle for a different marque. One with a touch screen system!",4

I'm a small person and the seats are highly adjustable so as to maintain good high visibility.  This is a fun, well-designed and comfortable car.

While that may be an ""entry-level"" system, it was constantly displaying harmonic distortion, and clearly was not up the level of quality I would have expected of such a prestigious brand as Lexus.  The interior is well done however, and rivals the larger RX models for ergonomics.  Would still consider the NX, but would recommend the NX300h Hybrid version for the better fuel economy as well as the additional instant power available.  Perhaps something larger than the 2.0, say a small V-6 in the NX200T would rectify the power shortage for those of us not wanting to always have to get into the Turbo for passing, accelerating onto on-ramps, etc.",3

We drove it around to see if everything is great. After a long day and looking at all this beautiful luxury cars and it was all set for me to go home with the RX 350. For some reason my brother saw that car (NX) and he said that he would buy that car instead of the RX 350 because it's nice, sassy, and has an aggressive looks to it. It is not common as the RX. So, guys trust me----- I finally made my mind and choose the NX200t car fully load it. And, since I never seen that model before it is so BEAUTIFUL BOTH INSIDE AND OUT. All I can say is wow, wow, wow, and WOWWWWWWWWWW.  I finally applaud my brother in helping me choose that car it's a new model and it's great. I only have a family of four (my hubby, and my two little girl (3 months and 3 years old) so, it is perfect size for us. LOVVEEEEE IT  :-) I am sorry guys I just can't help it.

I live in Atlanta, GA so there is quite a bit of traffic and mostly city driving yet I'm still averaging almost 24 mpg combined! I've had zero reason to visit the dealer other than regular maintenance. Great buy! I was hesitant before buying the NX. I came from a rear wheel drive, 300 horsepower, 15 year old Lexus SC. I wanted something sporty but with more room than the SC sports car I was coming from. I was initially afraid of understeer from a front wheel drive NX and lack of power from a 4-cylinder. All I had to do was drive the NX and I was 100% sold. It handles beautifully and surprisingly has way more than enough power. The gas mileage is fantastic and I could not be happier. I drove the equivalent BMW, Acura, Mercedes, and Audi. Nothing compared to the Lexus. Save yourself the weeks of legwork and research I did, buy the NX200t.",5

I am not a fast driver and basically drive in eco mode all the time to see if I can get the gas mileage up, Thus missing out on the added turbo from the other choices.  Very small in back, did not realize how little can be put in the back of the vehicle, barely room to put a car seat in the back seats without moving the passenger seats forward quite a bit.Did not know the interior was not leather; it does not clean the same as leather.   Very disappointed in the mileage and wrote Lexus about it.  they sent a standard response back that it mostly likely is my driving habit.

Extremely bright and the automatic feature works great.

I took my time doing research as there were so many from which to choose.  Boy am I glad I settled on the Lexus NX200t!!  This is the best car/suv I've owned.  And to think I was going to settle for the Honda Pilot after they made it look like a Mommy Van (not that its anything wrong with moms driving vans, I just don't have little ones anymore).  I've owned the CRV before and it just doesn't measure up.   This SUV is just the right size, right speed, right package, right EVERYTHING!!  Every time I get out of the car I look at it for at least 5 minutes.  The design is sooooo futuristic and sleek!!  The sound (audio) SUPERB!!  I've owned luxury cars (Acura) and mid-luxury (Honda).....but Lexus has completely exceeded my expectations.  I thought I would be completely down feeling that I've abandoned the HONDA family which has never let me down....but can I just say I'm doing cartwheels in my mind!!  The safety features and feel of the drive is impeccable.  I did test drive the RX and although it was a nice drive, it was a little bigger that I wanted and a little bit out of my price range too!!  The NX200T loaded was the best option for me!  This SUV will definitely compliment my active lifestyle since I'm always on the go, riding my bike, attending races and so forth!!  Perfect Choice and thank you Lexus for such superb customer service.   FYI - you cant be tall and purchase this truck also its taking me a little getting used to getting in and out....the windows are a little lower than my previously owned cars so i need to make sure I'm not getting out in a rush otherwise you may run the rusk of hitting your head!  Trust me in this SUV there's no rush to get out anyway!!!",5

I purchased the 4x2 ""non-sport"" version with every conceivable option, and save for the touchpad, it's an absolutely superb vehicle.  I traded in an RX (enjoyed owning it, but always felt it was a bit too much car for my lifestyle), and it's proven to be the right decision.  Performance is excellent, but in a different manner than the RX ... I actually look forward to driving it.  Overall, it has a much ""younger"" vibe, especially for a septuagenarian such as myself, while still maintaining the luxury and dependability standards that make it a Lexus.  This SUV fills that gap in the product line beautifully.  No longer need I consider purchasing one of those high-maintenance German counterparts ... this vehicle has it all!  UPDATE: after a year, my opinion remains the same.  This is a remarkable vehicle ... even Consumer Reports now thinks so, having rated it tops among luxury compact SUV's.  The one wart remains the touchpad ... I thought that the ""mouse"" that controls the RX's functions was awkward; now I wish it were on the NX.  Thankfully, I don't use it all that often, and have adjusted to its quirks; but still ....  Despite this, I don't regret my decision for a moment.  It's a great car, fun to drive, full of creature comforts ... can't ask for more. UPDATE, PART II:  18 months and 10,000 miles into ownership, all remains just fine ... no issues (not so much as a squeak or rattle), everything performing as designed.  That silly touchpad is apparently out on future models, given that Lexus keeps sending me surveys about it.  I've yet to hear anything positive from other owners.  All that notwithstanding, what attracted me to the NX in the first place remains ... a quality, fun-to-drive yet practical SUV. UPDATE , PART III (the final chapter): Well, that quirky touchpad finally got the best of me.  After two years of fiddling with it, I traded in the vehicle.  My new ride has a touchscreen as well as a more sophisticated navigation system.  Had the Lexus been so equipped, I'd likely still be driving it.  Lesson learned.",4

This review reflects one month of ownership, so I can't speak to reliability just yet. The seating is comfortable, cargo space is adequate for my needs (holds about 7 grocery bags comfortably), and this car does MOVE. The vehicle has Eco, Normal and Sport modes. When I will be accelerating onto the highway, I switch to Sport to give the car an added boost. In stop and go traffic, I am in Normal or Eco mode. Changing modes is quick and easy using a dial on the console. Most operations for the radio or navigation can be done via the steering wheel or voice command. Unlike my previous car by another manufacturer, the car synched with my iPhone 6S quickly and easily and remains connected. Audio quality is good. There is ample leg room in the front and back. The back seat has its own air vents. There are some large blind spots and that does take getting used to, but the blind spot detection system is very helpful in that regard. Remote start is available, but only through the Lexus Enform Remote app. This is free for a year and then the price shoots up. Basically, you end up paying for a remote start over and over again, which I think is ridiculous. Overall, I continue to be impressed with the comfort and performance of this car and am so happy I traded up to a Lexus!UPDATE: I have now had this car seven months and have updated the reliability score. I'm still very much annoying this car. It is performing well and, thus far, I've only needed an oil change.",4

I wanted the same in a smaller package and almost pulled the trigger on a Mazda3. I did want to check out the premium brands to see what the extra $$ offered. Nothing caught my attention until I test drove the NX 200t F-Sport.While not neck-snapping, the acceleration is decent for most any driving situation. It is also very smooth with minimal turbo lag. It tracks well with firm handling (the summer rubber certainly helps), minimal lean in the turns while the steering wheel provides good road feedback although the effort was a little light for my taste. The suspension was surprisingly smooth and comfortable, even with the F-Sport package. The vehicle is also extremely quiet. So quiet that I often find myself far exceeding the freeway speed limit due to the lack of engine drone at higher speeds.The interior is laid out very well. The seats are extremely comfortable with excellent lateral support. All of the controls on the dash and center console are easy to reach. I appreciate the standard button controls for the climate control system and not having to access it through the infotainment center. The infotainment center itself is fairly straight forward and intuitive. However it is accessed through a laptop-like trackpad which takes some getting used to and is overly sensitive to the touch. The NAV system is just OK. Entering a destination is kind of clunky and I find using Google maps on my phone much easier.I'm very pleased with my purchase of the NX and look forward to enjoying it for many, many miles.",5

I came from my 2013 is250 and I'm glad I made the switch. This suv has every you could need. Perfect size, perfect handling and performance, great technology, overall the perfect combination of luxury and performance. I'm 25 and this suv is youthful/sporty enough for someone my age to drive yet classy enough for me to grow into as the years go on. The drive handling is amazing, I feel like I have full control of what I do on the road, and MAN can this thing GET UP AND GO! I forget it is a 4cylinder! it revs up but quiets down quickly. The seats hug your body when you drive so you feel safely placed. the in-dash controls are perfect for controlling the many options of the infotainment center without the need to taking eyes off the road, and the car feels light but feels very planted to the ground. I am 5'9, and my brother is 6ft and we both sit comfortably in the front and back seats which also recline! The touch pad is a little difficult to use at first but it quickly picks up on your finger controls and becomes easier control with time. The rear cargo has plenty of space the under storage is a big plus. The front and rear parking/cross traffic sensors are awesome aids when needed. I've driven Mercedes, BMW, and Audis and nothing compares to the smooth ride of a lexus. Also Majority of the features are STANDARD! where as with other brands the nickel and dime you for every penny. I love my eminent white pearl and my black mesh that pops with the glowing headlamps, running lamps and tail lamps.  Overall especially for a young professional looking for a luxury cross over, this car is amazing and should be a true contender.",5

I also looked at 4 Runner, Ford SUV's, Acura (too expensive with transmission problems) and Mazda (just sold one).  I did not even know that Lexus has a new NX200t (Turbo) model.

I had grown accustomed to the small things in the ES, like the steering wheel getting out of the way and the seat moving back when I shut the car off. I liked the consistency of the instrument panel on each of the ES sedans. I am not concerned about going 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds. I want a vehicle that can get me into traffic and pass with some authority when needed. The 2015 NX 200t AWD is the vehicle that gives me the familiar comfort of the old, with the excitement of the new. It is refreshing to hit the gas in the NX and have the turbo kick in and put you back in the seat. The instrument panel has the same tachometer, speedometer, and info center as the ES. I like that familiarity. Some may expect something completely new. The Infotainment center is very intuitive. In a three hour highway drive, I was able to maneuver through the options without becoming distracted. I especially like the Enform auto start feature. I have read in past reviews that the auto start technology was ""old"" for a Lexus vehicle. I have used the I-phone App a number of times already and it worked flawlessly each time.If this is old technology and it works, I'm OK with that. Also, it was easy to download and sign up.The ride is smooth and quiet just as you might expect from Lexus. You can hear the turbo fire up for short time when you start up. It quiets down after a few seconds. One new thing I Like is the slightly stiffer ride in the NX compared to ES. It feels more like a sports car ride. finally for me, going to the CUV versus having a car has gone surprisingly well. I appreciate the access to the trunk area, my golf clubs do not have to be placed at an angle, and the jumper cables fit in with the spare tire. I have no regrets with my decision to go with the NX 200t. This vehicle is not just for Moms, Dads will like it too!",5

Everything fit - luggage, golf clubs, cooler and food for a family of 8 for the week.  We put the backseat down and had plenty of room and did not block  vision from the back window.  The car handled beautifully even with all of the weight.  We traveled on highways, mountain roads and congested cities.  The car had great acceleration and was easy to maneuver around both the city streets and busy highways.  Since this was purchased as my car, my husband at 6'5""  was not sure if he was going to be as comfortable in the NX. He is in love.  He was comfortable when he drove  and even as the passenger.

However it does not compare to the NX Sport. The fit, finish, comfort, ride all exceeded my expectations. I knew the NX sport would be on the top of my list after viewing one at this year's Detroit Auto show. I love everything about the car and i keep finding new features every day. The blind spit sensor is helpful and not distracting. The power is excellent and the ride is smooth and quiet. I tend to keep in in ECO mode, which still offers plenty of power. If I need additional power or handling I can throw it in sport mode on the fly. This returns about 25 MPG with city and highway mix. Overall this is an all around excellent choice. Not to mention it had head turning looks and styling.Update 8/7/16:I've had the car for a year now and still love everything. Only issues I've had are with the touchy track pad and the inconsistent voice command.  Also the USB ports could use an upgrade to allow for faster phone charging. Despite these very minor querks I would still rate the car excellent.The cargo space is excellent with the seats down. The opening to the truck could be larger, however that would sacrifice the stlying a bit.I also wish I had insisted on a tow package as there is no way to fit a bike rack without it. I still love getting in this SUV as my daily driver and I plan to keep it for 7-8 years.Update 8/9/17Car is still great, no issues. Navigation and voice command are below par with other vehicles.

Especially the drivers cockpit (because that is what it is). The drive and handling are superb but more sporty than your typically lexus, this is no rolling couch.

Purchased with all options. I can already see the learning curve may take some time with so many electronic features. However using the voice commands certainly softened the blow. From the showroom we took the car on a 250 mile trip. Even with the AC on the car ran right at 28.5 MPG.. It took about 100 miles to really get the feel. I was amazed that I enjoyed driving in ECO mode and very pleased there were no more blind spots as we had with the ZDX. The steering may feel a bit loose until you get used to it. Hate hate hate the GPS in fact the entire key pad thing STINKS!  Gas mileage still decent.,5

Interior fit and finish is great and the design is very upscale.  BMW's so called ""business luxury"" is getting old after seven years.  Seats are more comfortable than X1 or X3, and lateral support on NX (regular seat) is much better than X3 or X1.  NX is not as agile or fast as X1 or X3, but to me, it has the right combination of luxurious drive, good speed and handling capabilities.  And my deciding factor was NX looks less feminine than X3, in my opinion.

White seems cute while black appears cool. Interior design is simple yet elegant (a minimalist approach). Averaging 24-25 mpg mix, driver can change the vehicle dynamic to fit his/her mood.

The chief complaint keeping me from buying another Lexus of any type is the voice recognition software and navigation system; both of these are so sub Lexus they cannot be rated. The cost of repair is the only thing that keeps the system inside the car instead of bouncing down the highway. I have retrained my voice for the third time but I think its regressing if that was possible.

My NX is approximately 2 1/2 years old with 18,000 miles. The vehicle has been flawless, as far as dependability. However there are major flaws. The AWD system is worthless, it drives one front wheel and one rear wheel. It fails a diagonal test(see u tube).I should have suspected that in the beginning since Lexus does not label the vehicle AWD. So you really cannot differentiate between FWD and AWD unless you look under the vehicle. The fuel tank is too small, you visit the gas station often, if you do a lot of driving, a little over 300 miles to a full tank at 23mpg combined. When the low fuel light comes on, there is may be 3 gallons or more reserve. Too much reserve. The mouse pad is flaky. The tailgate is also temperamental, of which I Have complained with no solution. (problem cannot be duplicated at dealership).A little noisy for a Lexus. A little more power would be a great enhancement. 275+, an enjoyment! I did notice that Lexus has finally packaged all safety equipment in one package. 2016 NX was lacking in that department. Going back to AWD of which is important to me. I can walk into most competitors showrooms an drive out an AWD SUV. I have to special order a Lexus NX with AWD. Why? I really and truly hope that something is done about that, the RDX looks mighty competitive for 2019. My feelings are simple, Lexus Is a top of the line vehicle, it should play that part, otherwise one could settle for a RAV4 at many thousands less.

There’s no comparison between the two. Too much cabin noise, the engine has way too much low end lag, and tge transmission seems confused half the time. Performance is non-existent.

I looked at this size SUV across the different brands and since my other leased car was about up, I took the NX200T.  I have a love/hate relationship with this car since, for everything that bothers me, there is something else that I like.  First and foremost the car is noisy.  Not sure what car the reviewers are driving but this car is loud on the road...get on the highway and it's turn up the volume to cover road and wind noise.  I came from a Genesis and that is a quiet car.  Second, is the amazing amount of hard plastic in this car.  Everything from the elbow down is hard plastic - there is even areas on the dash that surround the speedometer.  Unacceptable in a car with this price point.  How about some rubber paint at least?  The switches for the windows are cheap, the carpet is the same as in my mother's 2017 RAV4 and that is not carpet!  The seats are great.  Heating and cooling on the seats work great.

So I don't know about the cost. I reviewed many crossovers: Kias, Honda, Acura, Toyota, BMW, Audi, Cherokee. Based on comparison and just the car itself, the NX was just what I was looking for. I delayed purchasing a car for many years because nothing had appealed to me. At the time of purchase, I had my Camry just shy of 13 years. Only one non routine repair. But it was time for an upgrade. I have to admit all the technology in this car is a bit overwhelming. My last car's best feature was the 6 CD changer. I opted out on the AWD because the reality is I will never take this car out to the snow. It is a not that type of car...it's a luxury after all. But a couple weeks after buying the car we drove it up to Muir Woods. What a smooth drive.  I can't believe how I whipped up that mountain. The price was a bit of a sticker shock for me...considering what I paid for my Camry but I have no regrets about this car. I love it. My sister has a sporty Mercedes - not too old. And she doesn't have even half the features the NX has. I spoke to a Tesla owner recently who paid over 100K for his car. Aside from the energy efficiency, he can only brag about his large screen. He was bit envious of the features the NX offered. I get compliments on this car all the time.  For a little engine, it sure is a great car.

Fell in love with the look of it.  Coming from BMW my expectations were high.  They did a great job on lying when they sold the vehicle, because I fell for it.  ""Has a full warranty"" they said. ""Has great blue tooth and voice text reading"" they said. ""Has a great turbo drive"" they said. Unfortunately, the only way to get any power out of this vehicle is to drive in ""Turbo"" all the time.  That's okay if you don't want to be fuel efficient.  The navigation system, ability to read a text message when it comes in, had never worked from day 1.  In 2016 I was told it wasn't reading the text messages because my phone was ""older"" (Samsung Note 4). On their web site it says it is compatible.  After several months of going back and forth they said it would work when I upgraded my phone.  Last year, got the Samsung Note 8, again on the web site says it is compatible.  For the last 3 months I have been battling them about it.  Now they say my phone is too new, still a compatibility issue.

Every time I walk up to it I enjoy the gleaming silver lining paint and alloy wheels and the contrast with the red trimmed seats.  As cars continue to get larger, it is the perfect size for me a lot like the original RX 300s I had.  Today the RX is gigantic and there is a new even longer one coming out.  I enjoy just about all aspects of the NX but there are some things that should be mentioned:  1. The safety technology is just now being included in the 2018 F Sport model such as lane departure and active cruise and braking. To put it in perspective, there are Toyota models including the Corolla that had this before the NX F Sport. 2. Until the 2018 model you couldn't get ventilated seats on the F Sport--only heated seats.  3. It seems Lexus is committed to the touch pad idea. They made it larger on the 2018 and I believe they are even incorporating it on their new flagship LS model that's coming out.  Who decided this is the best tool for safe driving and use selection in the car? That should be interesting for the older LS' demographic to try and learn. 4. I am not a big fan of the 4 cylinder engine or its drone. It doesn't get good mileage and requires premium fuel.  It seems to me there are a number of 4 cylinder turbos like from Korea that don't require premium fuel.  I am a reasonable driver and rarely get above 24 miles per gallon.  Even on the highway.  5. Regarding the heated steering wheel, it should be the whole wheel not just the 9 & 3 positions. The switch for the wheel is not logically located way down low to the left. It should be on the steering wheel. And you have to reactivate it every time you start the car. 6. No one uses the SOS button up above. Lexus just wants you to subscribe.  Put the sunglass holder back up there. All that said I love the car and would get another one--maybe the hybrid next time.  It's something different, fun, unique and cool.",5

After driving the car for a day we quickly realized that  this SUV was far was luxurious!  The front bucket seats curved in at the shoulders and the headrest was designed in such a way that it pushes the driver's head forward causing constant neck discomfort.  There were a couple of other factors that caused us concern regarding this SUV (e.g. the touch pad for the multimedia screen and the limited side rear view when you are attempting to change lanes), but with time we could have probably learned to overcome these novelties.  Thankfully the dealership took back the Lexus NX and we ended up with a 2017 BMW X3...which has given us the luxury, comfort, and size that we were looking for all along.  I would like to say that I will one day go back to a Lexus since I was a happy driver of a Lexus RX for the past 8 years, but right now my heart is with BMW.",2

It's sporty look and luxury upgrades are icing on the cake.  I've read many reviews that say they don't like that the seats because they aren't real leather.  Prior to this I owned a Lexus ES 350 with leather seats and I don't even notice that the leather seats were any better than the NX's.  In addition the light gray leather seats on the ES350 started to look worn and cracked over time.  I've only had this vehicle for about five days so I'm still getting use to it but so far I love everything about it.  I like setting up higher than a sedan but not so high like a Land Cruiser.  I'm very happy with my choice.  I knew I was going to buy another Lexus and thought I wanted the RX350 but compared to the NX it seemed too big and less agile.

I thought the time had come to switch to a sedan and traded a Cadillac SRX (too big) for a Buick Regal.  Missed having an SUV and I wanted all the bells and whistles I had.  I have owned many vehicles and have only loved one, until now.  Test drove BMW, Volvo, Mercedes, GMC, and Chevrolet.  Looked at Audi.  DId lots of research.  I thought I wanted an RX350 however the new model was too large for my needs.  Purchased this fully loaded NXT.  It is the perfect size for commute, grocery shopping and errands.  Purchased two large air conditioners and they fit perfectly by lowering the seats which go down without difficulty.  The cabin space is generous.  Perfect height for entering and exiting the vehicle.  Placing and removing the occasional car seat for Grandchild is easy.  No problem viewing my surroundings.  Spent an hour personalizing and learning the information system, can now operate with ease while drinving.

The handling of the car is sweet. I like the extra boost of the sport mode if needed, and the economy option as well. Was disappointed to hear they don't use real leather anymore, but the new car smell is there and hopefully the interior will last me over 10 years. There is, however, sometimes a glare from the sun on the silver part of the dash area and the steering wheel can get quite hot if car is in the sun. The AC not as cool as our Toyotas, but it gets the job done, love the fan in the seats, that is wonderful. I think the touch pad is just fine, kind of fun to feel the little pop as it moves to a designated area on screen. I like the navigation views of the current street driving on and the compass is awesome. The visibility is a bit less, but the backup camera with grid lines is very helpful. The size of cargo spaces are perfect for us now in this time of life. The seats are better than other cars, but sometimes I still add a lumbar pillow, cars aren't designed for women with their hair in pony tails or buns, that's a shame. The push start took some getting used to, but nice to not deal with keys except to unlock my house, wish it was a push button.

Driving impressions are still fresh from the Acura before starting driving the Lexus last Sunday, so the sensations are very noticeable: softer suspension in the Lexus, which is not necessarily better, too much body roll. Also, the steering in the Acura is sharper and more direct.  We did not want to get another RDX, even though the experience has been outstanding. No high tech was needed, so we chose the base model. Kudos to the Acura, the basic equipment is superior: I lost 1. the memory seat, 2. the heated seats, 3. the moon roof, 4. several cubic feet of cargo storage, 5. a smoother engine, 6. silky smooth acceleration, 7. simplicity in the instrumentation (Lexus' is distracting, Acura's are practical and to the point). What did I gain? Nothing really, besides the fact that I am not parking 2 identical cars in our driveway. The payments were better though on the Lexus. One thing to consider: My right knee leans against the center console. Even though there is some padding, after a while it hurts from constant pressure. I love cars, never had driven a Lexus, I was curious to experience the good word about the service at the dealers, big mistake: Worst experience ever in 20 years buying, trading, selling cars. Choose your dealer well, avoid Pembroke Pines if you live in South Florida.In summary, overrated brand, well built, high quality materials, beautiful center console & display. Lexus is aware that it must differentiate well its cars from the parent company Toyota, and this NX is nothing more than a nicely equipped RAV4, nothing wrong with that, but the competition wins.Get the RDX.",4
1571, on 06/09/16 22:02 PM (PDT),Eric M ,2016 Lexus NX 200t SUV 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),So nice we bought it twice," I am already the owner of a 2015 NX F-sport which I gave a 5 star review back in November 2015. We recently became empty nesters so my wife decided it was time to downsize from her 2009 Mazda CX-9 GT and move into a 5-seater CUV. She test drove the Mazda CX-5 GT (loved it but needs more power), the Nissan Murano (very nice and would have bought it except it rolled too much in the turns - she had gotten used to the CX-9's excellent steering/handling which feels like driving a much smaller sedan) and the Acura RDX (very well designed, but she found the exterior styling bland and boring).  She had already driven my car before and decided other than a slightly smaller cargo space, it was better than any of the vehicles she test drove.We found exactly what she wanted - a base unit with the premium package and no NAV. She absolutely loves the vehicle from the unique exterior styling to the smooth acceleration, ride and handling and its very comfortable, luxurious interior.  The main differences between her base model and my F-sport are the paddle shifters and the additional turbo boost and accelerometer gauges.  The handling advantage in the F-sport is only really noticeably in very hard and fast turns and I think a lot of that has to do with the better grip of the summer tires. Also, since she doesn't have the NAV system, the infotainment controller is a dial with a push-button selector. I find this much easier to use than the track-pad system on my car because it is overly sensitive and requires too much concentration if you're trying to use it while driving. Sometimes simpler is better.We only have a few minor issues with the car. We wish the BSM had an audible tone when you signal and a car is in your path in addition to the orange light in the side view mirror. Her former CX-9 and all the vehicles she test drove had this feature so I'm surprised it's missing. Also, the low fuel warning comes on at a way too early 12.5 gallons. You still have over 3 gallons remaining so I find the warning a little too aggressive as I often haven't reached 300 miles yet when the light comes on. But these are minor quibbles.  All in all, the NX200t is an excellent choice if your looking for a compact CUV.",5
1572, on 05/30/16 07:53 AM (PDT),Happy with NX ,2016 Lexus NX 200t SUV 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great tweener SUV," Was looking for an SUV bigger than an Audi Q3 or Mercedes GLA but not too big.  Was looking at an Audi Q5, but since a new model is coming out soon, wanted to find a more current model.  Happened to look at this Lexus.  I'm a boomer and haven't been too keen on the nose of the most current Lexus models, but on the NX, it's not too big and in black or grey it's not so in your face.  We decided to take it for a test drive and we were so impressed by the comfort and ride.Acceleration is good.  Not the best in the segment, but good enough for getting on and off of highways and passing.  Unless you have a need to race, this turbo 4 is more than adequate.  The car ride is solid, like a bigger SUV but handling is good like a smaller SUV.  I like that the steering is not overpowered and there is some road feel to it.The front seat is amazing.  It's like getting a hug every time you get inside.  Lexus makes getting in and out easy by automatically moving the seat back and steering wheel up when you exit the car and returning them to position when you buckle your belt or start the car.  Rear seat legroom is excellent.Some complain about the AC controls being up high, but I find this position makes it easy to locate the buttons by not having to look down on the console.  The touch pad gets a lot of complaints, but really, once you get things set up, you don't need it a whole lot.  I use voice commands for navigation and phone calls.  Radio presets make it easy to use the up and down buttons on the steering wheel to change channels.Storage is a bit on the smaller side with the rear seats up due to the angle of the rear hatch door.  I actually like this because it makes it easier to open the rear hatch in a smaller garage space.  I bought my high school daughter an old ML320 which has an upright hatch.  Her SUV is 10 inches shorter, but she cannot open her hatch with the garage door shut because it swings out so far.  In fact, I traded spaces with her so that we can both open out hatches with the garage door shut.All said, I'm really happy the the NX.  It's exactly what I wanted - an SUV that rides more like a car than a truck, has decent acceleration, fits in my garage.",5

I came from a V-6 powered car and this is my first turbo anything.  My initial thoughts are it's really cool and extremely personal.  The seats grip you securely and the controls are all very easy to access.  I don't quite understand the logic of some of the design which is not as direct or simple to use as some other brands.  But I knew this full well going in and have pretty much gotten used to it.  The technology guy at the dealer didn't help much, and there are some things you learn by chance, or even by hitting a button accidentally.  The turbo is subtle--the car is by no means a rocket.  It is quiet and surefooted.  I don't know if I would ever own it, but do enjoy how special it looks even compared to a non-F Sport NX.  Please note you cannot get ventilated seats on the F-Sport if this is a big deal for you.  In addition you can't get some of the latest technology on this version vs the standard one --items such as overhead camera,  emergency braking, rain sensing wipers and radar cruise.  Handling is nimble and the car is a great size and easy to park.  There is very little wind noise.  Mileage has been in the lower 20's and I have been experimenting with regular gas but it states very emphatically on the gas cap that you need to use premium. So far I don't notice too much difference, but plan to try premium for awhile to see if I get a mileage boost. BTW the hybrid version is very slow and much more expensive.  Also they need to go back to an overhead sunglass compartment which i have noticed they did on the new RX. Places to put ""stuff"" is not very well thought out at all. But in summary, so far so good.  I think we will enjoy this and the all wheel drive should be a great benefit and comfort when the weather turns again.",5

I was fine test driving it around the corner, but not loving after the first full day driving and owning it. It needs to be taller and a little bigger!  The analog clock is fine. Then I thought there was a digital clock at least on the navigation, but No!!! Also there was less safety options on the NX than the RX has to offer.

Especially those who had an RX300 in the past, as i did, and found that their RX450 (or 350) is larger than they'd like. (and heavier too).    I've been a little frustrated with the way that Lexus has evolved.  The front grill is apparently designed with a younger generation in mind.  And car chassis keeps getting longer and wider, and less fun to drive.  So, i anticipated the NX eagerly, as the ""fix"".  Don't get me wrong.  The NX is fun to drive.  Smooth.  Handles well.  Accelerates nicely. And has the smaller footprint for parking and driving around town.2 problems are deal killers for me:  1) the cabin cargo area is too small for my large dog.  And specifically, not tall enough.  The RX300, while much smaller than my RX450, had a much taller cargo area than the 450.  The cargo height problem is much worse on the NX, making it a show stopper.   2) The other concern is that the front seats on the NX curve forward at the top, in a way i'm not fond of.  I could have gotten used to the seats, but the cargo area was a killer.Ironically, much smaller SUVs, like the  BMW X1, are better in cabin height - which is surprising.  And certainly the Audi Q5 and Mercedes GLC....   let alone the Subaru Forester offer far more viable choices for me and my dog.Frustrating as i'm a big Lexus fan of many years.

Even after weeks of diligent searching by my local dealer, and by me on the internet from Seattle to Chicago to Palm Springs, such a car could not be located. Some dealers even had as many as thirty NX200t's on their lots, but... Almost ALL RX350's come with the safety equipment, but for some reason, in a car, one notch down, that costs $40,000 to almost $50,000, this is not available.

1579, on 04/12/16 08:46 AM (PDT),Fyrcat ,2016 Lexus NX 200t SUV 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Love it so far," I traded my 1999 RX 300 towards the purchase of the 2016 NX f-sport. I got the ultra-white with black interior. So, I was disappointed in the materials used for the interior. I came from wood and leather in the RX. I though Lexus was strictly top shelf, and was disappointed in their using nuluxe, aka, pleather, aka vinyl. And NO wood, and NO options for an upgrade. I am hearing that the non f-sports may offer a leather option. Also, only two color options..one all black, one mostly all black with red accents. I would have liked a lighter interior...black shows EVERYTHING!  So, in addition, not thrilled about Lexus Enform. Perhaps I am in the minority...I only drive less than 5,000 miles a year. My trips tend to be the same, grocery shopping and errands. We don't tend to go on long road trips. In addition, we live in the trees, and our roads are covered in trees and satellite goes in and out..so I will not subscribe to Lexus Enform...which after the first free year runs some $300.00 a year. There was a bit of hard sell on this at the time of purchase, seperate from our actual car salesman. I spent 1-2 hours with a technical advisor..just wanting to get out of there. I am one who reads manuals, and learn what I need to. The vehicle itself is super fun to drive..is super comfy, and drives a bit like a sports car. I love it so far, and am hoping it is as reliable as my old friend the 17 yr. old RX300.

The performance is fine, I guess if I were in a huge hurry to get tickets and stuff I would love to have 400 HP under the hood but the little 4 does just fine.  Put it into Sport and it dose react to the gas pedal a bit faster but then I like the good gas mileage it gets in ECO.  The BMW we sold was getting around 12 mpg, or less in town, this car has been up around 20 mpg in town whats not to like about that.  It rides much better than the BMW did but then they are 2 very different types of cars.  This is one very nice car to go for a drive in even if it is just to go to Walmart for orange juice.  Even on the lousy roads here in San Diego the car rides very nice, in my wives old car it was like being in a fight getting bounced around on the rough roads now it is more like a spirited argument.  Wish they would get  the roads fixed but that is a whole different subject. The car is actually my wife's car, as was the BMW, and she uses it mostly to go to church and pick up the grandkids, 7, 6 and 13 from school everyday and she loves it.  One thing she really likes is the powered lift back now she doesn't have to try and reach the gate to close it, push a button and down it goes.  She is quite small, 4'11"", and everything is still easy for her to use, I am 6'1"" and it is very comfortable for me to drive also.  All of the technology stuff is great I guess, all I do is put on the Jazz station and enjoy the sound system Lexus has put together in the car.  I haven't even hooked my phone to the Bluetooth only because I really don't want to be bothered if I am not at work.  The attachment points for car seats for the kids could be a little easier to get to , but still not a big ordeal as with some other cars.It has been just a little over a year now and the car is doing just great.  Have run it up to Los Angles a couple of times and it ran great.  Put on the cruse control, turn on the breeze and turn up the radio and  27 MPG shows up on the dash read out, not to bad for 75 to 80 MPH average, coming back this last weekend we hit traffic, actually we drove thru a parking lot that stretched from Long Beach to San Diego, and it still got 30 MPG.  Nice car, lousy traffic.There is one thing that I don't like and it is the piece of trim on the on the console.  It looks like a nice padded piece that runs the length of the console, it is not padded very much and it hits the side of my knee and it is real uncomfortable.  If it was wider it wouldn't be a problem, a small thing but it still drives me nuts.",5
1581, on 04/03/16 15:38 PM (PDT),Diana ,2016 Lexus NX 200t SUV 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Meets expectations, We recently purchased an NX200T relatively base model ( couple small options but nothing major ). Overall it is a good car and no complaints other than it would have been nice if a couple items standard on non luxury vehicles were included or offered without having to take a pricey package but for a low to mid 30's Lexus you can't expect too much and you can't get too hurt when trading it in. This vehicle was essentially a hold over vehicle for us while we await some new offerings in the small 7 seat cross over segment ( Toyota Highlander refresh and new Mazda CX9 to name two ).If there was one thing that would have given us some buyers remorse it would have been that this is not a good family hauler. The back doors are kind of tight for getting car seats in and out and our 2 years old's feet easily hit the back of the front seats but based on our currently family size it is acceptable.  On the positive side of the NX we did test drive Rav4's and CX5's as other options but the they just seemed a little too slow as they are both 1 to 2 seconds behind when accelerating to 60 but the equipment and options standard or offered in vehicles thousands of dollars less was significant. A Rav4 with decent options and the Lexus engine in the low 30's would be the best of all worlds.,4
1582, on 03/26/16 19:36 PM (PDT),Barry ,2016 Lexus NX 200t SUV 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Pleased with my Lexus NXt," I recently retired and needed to replace my 2011 BMW X3.  I loved my X3 but the new one was just too expensive.   I test drove the  BMW X1 and wanted to like it but the ride was too firm to suit me.  I liked the Acura RDX but their option pricing required the loaded but most expensive Advance package just to get parking sensors.   Plus, I did not feel the Acura style, interior or exterior, was up to the 2016 Lexus NXt.   I requested quotes through the Edmunds link and was pleasantly surprised that an out of town dealer had by far the best deal.   I got pretty much every option except the lane departure warning, dynamic cruise control and leather seats (you will be impressed with the comfort and looks of the Lexus synthetic leather seats!).  I only have about 500 miles on it but so far I am very happy with my purchase.  It is extremely comfortable,  very quiet and has a high tech look.  Yes, the touchpad controller is a bit fussy but you do get better with use (and many controls can be done from the steering wheel or verbally).  As another reviewer commented, the cruising range is only a little over 300 miles but that is a minor complaint compared to the many positives with this vehicle.",5

1585, on 01/21/16 18:52 PM (PST),P Karam ,2016 Lexus NX 200t SUV 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Getting there in style," There is no dispute on luxury and reliability. It's a Lexus. I have had mine just over a week, and so far it's a fun vehicle, handles well, comfortable, agile and luxurious. However, in as much as it is a Lexus it does fall short in a couple areas. 1/The fuel tank is too small and that is a complain on both of my previously owned Lexus both the GS350 and the RC350 and now the NX. 300 miles is just plain inadequate. And don't expect 30 MPG, if you have a heavy foot. My other grief is safety related. Lexus boasts safety so why can't I get 1 safety package with everything, Pre collision with pedestrian detection, dynamic radar cruise, Blind spot, Lane departure alert with steering assist, Backup and overview camera in one package, not spread all over different packages. If safety is #1, let's put it all together. Lastly the cargo compartment is short by just a few inches. I literally had to wait over one month for mine. They could not find a white AWD F model fully loaded with pre collision which was a must have for me(Even though no one has proven that it stops itself). I had to settle for AWD with luxury package and no lane departure alert, no power rear seats. Otherwise it would have to be special order without December to remember deal.  I will review further in the next month or so.After 3 months, 3000 miles,  I am still very happy with my NX, zero problems. I still have the same complaints, Gas tank too small, although when the light comes on it takes just under 13 gallons out of the 15.9 gallon advertised capacity, meaning that you have to watch the LOW Fuel warning for at least 40 more miles, needs a little  more power (275hp) and lastly, the pre-collision is worthless, it's just an alarm nothing else, it DOES NOT stop itself. I came very close in testing the integrity of the front bumpers. 2016, that is not acceptable Lexus. $5.00  more software.Now my NX is 17 months old, no problems what so ever. Runs great, however I have a new complaint. The AWD system is not as robust as I think it should be. It fails diagonal and roller test. It should probably be called Assisted front wheel drive. Subaru, Audi, and Mitsubishi have true AWD, with Subaru being exceptional. Many other AWD in that class also fail Roller and diagonal test, including Rogue, and RAV4. Lexus a couple dollars more of ABS software could get the job done. COME ON Lexus!24 Months, still trouble free. Tailgate occasionally does not respond. The 2018 is out now and still Lexus has not improved the AWD system. Shameful. My 2004 XC70 passes. At least for 2018 there is a good safety package.",5

Picked it up new a week ago and have had the pleasure of driving around town and a snow trip up to Flagstaff for a ski trip. It handles great around town and performed just as well on the 400 mile round trip to break in the AWD on snow. The car handles like a dream and very similar to the older 2008 328i I previously owned. I was pleasantly surprised how well the SUV handled the elevation change from 1000 feet up to 9500 feet. The turbo is flawless and at all times felt adequately powered. Several times I was surprised I was traveling too fast and had to use the cruise control to not break the law. The AWD performed well on the nasty road up to the ski slopes. I was deciding between this SUV and Subaru offerings. I feel I made the right decision and could not tolerate a 10 week wait for a 3.6 liter alternative. This SUV is extremely comfortable and a joy to drive. All riders tell me how sweet this Lexus drives. This is my 4th Lexus and the best so far.7/11/2016 Update - Still love the car after 6k miles. I've dropped the visibility to poor. It is hard to see the blind spot.7/11/2017 Update - Car is great. The visibility is still bad. BSM needs to be standard equipment.7/11/2018 update - car is still very nice. BSM NEEDS TO BE STANDARD.

I opted for this car, after researching some BMW, and Mercedes offerings, all in all this lexus fits a good balance of what's most important in the long run, comfort and reliability. Sure the German cars offer up more powerful engines, but at what cost? Theirs also the factor of the RC bold styling,  no one will mistake you for the everyday beamer you see going down the road.                                                                                                        The only cons I can nit pick at are the less then stellar MPG, the dated infotament system, and perhaps the engines modest 306hp. By all means the power is plenty for everyday driving, passing power, and adequate enough for some fun in the streets. I think any lexus owner can agree the infotainment system needs a overhaul ASAP, it's not horrible, but it's just so bland in appearance and function. Gas mileage can be decent if you baby it, however you can quickly find yourself in the 17-19mpg in the city trying to escape traffic.

The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it is not as fast as it looks! It is much slower than I expected but the ride and handling are superb.Update:Still a great car and still turning heads as it rolls by. Gas mileage is not great about 16 in town and 23-25 on the highway. The only negative thing is that the paint is very, very thin and seems to scratch and stain very easily.

The vehicle alignment throws you to the curb, especially on wet surfaces. According to two different dealerships, the car is within spec. This is a car that is all for show, definitely not performance (and I opted for the F Sport). If you are an enthusiast, stick with the Germans or Brits. The pursuit of perfection? Far from it.Update: Since the above mentioned issue, Lexus of Tampa Bay went above and beyond to handle correcting the issue. ALL 8 South Florida locations I visited either inspected the car and retutned it with condescending and/or bogus explanations or outright refused to look at the car. The worst offender being JM Lexus. Lexus of Tampa were the only one interested in pleasing a customer. In summation, once corrected, the car has indeed been pleasing to drive but, it is more or less just for turning heads and getting attention. If you are a Toyota brand enthusiast, get a V6 Camary or a Lexus IS and save 10's of thousands. The early experience, poor customer service from Corporate and time that I had to invest in order to correct a factory issue they tried to ignore has made me a one time only Toyota/Lexus brand buyer.",3

Many people have commented that they want more power, it would be nice, but then they would definitely cry about the fuel economy.  If you want more power, spend another $20k and get the RCF.

It really is the best of both worlds, although it can be a challenge to get in an out for some. The front seats are very comfortable, rear seats are pretty much reserved for kids or small packages. Like others have said, the navigation controls are a bit confusing and I still can't figure out how to change the XM radio stations from the steering wheel mounted controls. The climate controls themselves are a bit hard to reach - especially the dashboard mounted radio tuning knob if you like to sit farther back from the steering wheel. The car is pretty quiet and is a great cruiser - acceleration is adequate under normal conditions but the car does get up and go when you step on it- and it sounds great. I chose the Lexus RC 350 AWD over the BMW 428XI because there are too many BMW's on the road  - not that they will be there for long considering their reliability issues.

The car is the ultimate mix of luxury and sport.  The ability to change the driving dynamics from Eco, Normal, Sport to Sport+ make it feel like you own two cars at once.  If cruising in quite and luxury is your thing Eco or Normal and if you want aggressive shift points and tighter suspension then Sport+ makes the car rock!  The interior is such a contemporary mix of materials and touches that it's a treat every time I get into the car.  The Lexus Touchpad interface for Navigation system does take some getting used to.  It's jumpy at first, but after a few days you will have it mastered.  Steering wheel and dash controls make most systems in the car redundant so there are many ways to do things.1yr later-Still enjoying driving the RC each and everyday. Had a few unexpected squeaks/rattles that needed to be addressed with the dealer. All were fixed but a. It disappointed they happened at all coming from Lexus. Also a bit disappointed in the quality of the paint on the hood. I drive less then 1,000 per month, yet have more hood paint sings then you would expect. Still the sporty and luxury coup I expected. The only thing I don't love is that when you enter and exit the car you have to climb in and climb out.  I had a mustang prior and it was easier to enter/exit then the Lexus.

Weve had the car for about three months at this point and there are some pluses and minuses to highlight. First off to the ""so called experts"" who knock the looks of this car, this car is visually stunning. I've had at least 100 people stop me to ask what kind of Lexus is it, and they comment on how gorgeous it is. I have the Ultrasonic Blue with playa interior. The interior fit and finish are exceptional. The F Sport seats have the right amount of side bolstering for fast cornering. Here are my gripes with this car. The engine is underwhelming. This is the same engine from the GS but it seems to be tuned much less sporty.Update***  It's been 2+ years since I purchased the RC350. I  have found lots to like about the vehicle (e.g. styling, reliability, functionality)  while the same issues that plagued the car after a few months still exist ( bad fuel economy, glitch CPU  for navigation). Lexus somewhat addressed the fuel economy by introducing the 4 cylinder turbo RC. I would purchase this vehicle over again knowing what I do now about it. For my needs it checks off many of the boxes and their aren't droves of them on the streets (ala BMW 4 series).Update*** It has been almost three years since I leased the RC350. Styling wise it has aged well, but technology wise three years is a lifetime. The interior has held up well and the overall mechanics of the car work fine. Lexus has seemingly abandoned this car from an advertising standpoint as everything is now compact SUV biased. If you are in the market for an RC search around because great deals are out there.",3

The infotainment screen could be larger, but I believe they took care of that in the 2018 model. The handling on it is amazing, you get good control of the car even at high speeds. The grip of the steering wheel feels great and the seats are sporty and comfortable at the same time. The gauge cluster is heavenly too! (On the Fsport model only).Not to mention all the options and safety features that are available on the car.I don’t mean to put anybody down with this but comparing it to it’s main competitor the Infinity Q60 (in my opinion) I would take the RC any day! The Q60 is cheaply built compared to the RC. Just look at the blind spot monitors that come with the Q60! They look like cheap aftermarket products! And they are located at the cars pillars not in the mirrors! But again, that’s just my opinion.I would definitely recommend the Lexus RC 350 (Fsport if possible) to anybody in the market for a car in it’s class. At the end of the day, it’s a Lexus.

In the middle I owned a G37 Convertible which was very noisy and harsh compared to the lovely SC430. Don't think of this car as a sports car, this car is a luxury touring car.

The automatic aspects of putting the top down are outstanding; in 20 seconds you are ready to go. The comfort and details are what you would expect from Lexus. A definite buy.

The design and comfort are very nice while the performance and drive are lackluster. The car seemed to have been designed for an older driving population who want the look of a convertible in a Lincoln Town Car frame.  The technology and nav system is very counter intuitive with the entire system disabled while driving, so you'd have to park the car before using your nav system or Bluetooth phone.  Be careful of Lexus dealers lying to you about this feature.

Watching the top go down is almost as good as sex (almost)!!Even with it being an 11 year old car - the interior is luxurious - black leather with the burled dark walnut is elegant.  The exterior is beautiful (not as striking as my 1999 SC400 - but excellent).  Everything work like it did the day it rolled off the showroom floor.The only downside is that it isn't exactly top down weather - so I'm impatiently waiting for the weather to turn.Of course - the only drawback is the lack of up-to-date electronics.  Can't download my contacts from my phone.  It handles ""1-touch"" dialing - but you have to manually enter your top 10 phone numbers, but the Bluetooth still works well with the phone.  The navigation system is okay, but needs updating (need to go on-line and find an upgrade DVD.  I updated it with a wireless back-up camera - tough to see behind you without it.  I get about 22 mpg and it only had 83000 miles on it when I bought it!UPDATE - July 2018I now have 119,000 miles on the car and it is still as good as the day I bought it.  One small item...I developed a small drain on the  battery that I can't trace down.  I installed a device that disconnects the battery when the voltage falls below 12V.  When you step on the brakes, it reconnects that battery and starts the car.  The alternator then recharges the battery.  If I drive it every day, it is fine, but I only drive it about once a week and that's when the battery saver device kicks in and starts the car - a real life saver.  I was also able to find an up-to-date Navigation DVD to update the onboard  navigation system.  This car is best when you're able to drop the top and take if for a run on a windy country road.  The car still turns heads when you are in a parking lot and drop the top - I still find myself asking my wife to sit in the driver's seat so I can watch the top go up and down.  I installed a Sirius-XM radio and can now cruise with my favorite tunes.  Still love this 14 year old car!!!!",5

Maybe that is the problem but we as consumers should not suffer from that!   When one buys a $65,000 car, he or she should expect quality including the quality of the tires.",4.25

I have the rare pebble beach edition too. The first problem was that my left headlamp fell off while I was driving on the highway. Lexus said that it was due to driver neglegance. Then my power top got stuck halfway closed they did replace it. Then my alternator went bad I've been through six already. Then three days ago my brakes let go coming up my driveway. The car is nice looking yes but its very unrealiable. Then my whole instrument panel stopped working. That cost me $1,100 dollars because it wasn't covered. I also have a Cadillac STS-V and that gets better mpg than the Lexus. Im trading this in for a most likely a Cadillac.",2.625

Have also driven Camry, Highlander, Prius and ES330 models. Very happy with all. Purchased this 1-owner clean carfax SC430 model with 109k in October 2014 for not a lot of money. Now at 140k in August 2018 and not a peep out of it from a mechanical standpoint. Got rid of the run flat tires quickly, as the ride with them is much too firm. Happy with all season radials although no spare on board. The styling is timeless. The wife loves it.  Ride is and remains smooth, quiet and polished. And with the top down we tend to smile more. Many still mistake the car as new --- at 15-years-old now --- and consequently me as a rich man. Neither is the case. Only drawback is it's a little hard for me to get into and out of with its low stance, but that's likely due to my increasingly creaky bones and not an inherent isssue with the car itself. Would not hesitate to purchase one if the law of attraction happens to bring a nice one to your attention! 🚗",5

Not even once inch it will crash.My friend who had one told me this.It drives smooth and refined and its reliable. If you buya German used convertible you'll spend a lot in repairs.

The sound system sounds amazing although it is very expensive to replace just 1 speaker at $320. The rear seats (golf bag holder) are useless for people to sit in.

It is beautiful, great acceleration, but the tires and wheel covers will be replaced numerous times.  The tires which never go flat get lousy overall mileage.  It costs over $400 just to put snow tires on in the winter.  That is without buying them at $400 a pop.

The car has been a complete nightmare and I don't recommend it to anyone unless you don't mind constant loud squeaks and other unwelcome noises.  The car had more minor problems than most I've owned.

Fit, finish and flawless performance surpass the most demanding of expectations... crucial flaw: low profile tires that are unsuited for the rigors (pot holes, steel plates) of New York city streets. In the last year, 6 tires have been replaced, 4 at the dealers considerable expense as well as sensors and suspension parts. I am not an isolated case. The same frustrating experience has been shared by other owners. Larger tires are not an option as there is no room for a spare without sacrificing the trunk.

Seriously if you are considering an SC430, it's a great 2 seater with a lot of package room. (Don't think of the rear seats as seats, they are simply insurance lowering devices).  The Mark Levinson sound system is the best I've heard in a car. Get rid of the run-flats and put Michelin performance tires on for less road noise.

This is my first hybrid so in the beginning it was hard to know if the engine was on since there is no noise initially, but after about 5 seconds or so the noise will tell you it's on. It's roomy and the second row fits two booster seats with enough room for an adult in the middle. One issue that I have is that the MPG only averages about 25 combined city/hwy rather than 30/28.

Effortless steering and acceleration, great visibility thanks to the A pillar and side mirror design. Whisper quiet at any speed and the hybrid powertrain works seamlessly. Definitely go with the upgraded 12.3 inch infotainment system as it has better input method with the joystick (as oppose to the wheel controller on the base system) and the definition of the screen is very high. Averaging 32 MPG on our first tank so far with the AC on all the time. Speaking of which it is the best AC system I have experienced in any car.

1953, on 01/13/18 13:54 PM (PST),TW ,2017 Lexus RX 450h SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Lexus RX 450 > 350," I spent a lot of time shopping for my new car and ended up buying the Lexus RX 450h.  Before settling on the RX 450h I drove many of the competing vehicles including Audi SQ5, Q7, Mercedes GLC AMG, GLE, Volvo XC60 and XC90.  I also drove the Lexus RX 350 as well.  Initially I wasn't looking for a hybrid but I am glad I drove the 450h and ended up buying it.  I've driven other hybrids as rental cars over the years (Prius and Ford Fusion) and in most cases the switch between electric and gas isn't particularly smooth, not so in the RX.  Other than hearing the gas engine, it's just continuous power and smoothly switches over.  The CVT makes the vehicle incredibly smooth as well with no gear changes.  For the 2017s, the hybrid carries a pretty big premium for the base vehicle but upon closer inspection, it comes with a lot of standard features and in the end it really only adds about $1800 to the price of the vehicle.  For 2018, the hybrid packaging is different and now has the same features as the base 350.  The premium is now only about $1000.  For that you get, in my opinion a much smoother vehicle and much better gas mileage.  Bottom line, even if you aren't interested in the hybrid for environmental reasons, I still think it is a better vehicle and worth the upgrade costs.  To address one common complaint, the weakest part of the RX vehicles is the user interface for the entertainment/navigation system.  The remote touch control isn't as convenient as some other systems but it is more than adequate.  Some times the user interface is a bit more complex than needed.  That said, you will get used to it and don't let that turn you off from a great vehicle.  Bottom line, if you are going to test drive RXs, take an RX 450h for a spin.  I think you will like it.",5

But, the style grew on me and now I think that it's actually a better look.  The redesigned interior dash design is definitely much better than before.  There is quite a bit of learning curve to get familiar with the technology.  The manuals are poorly designed and printed and online information is far from helpful.  The navigation system is quite limited and the voice command system is unpredictable.  I do enjoy driving this car very much because of the nice and quite ride.  I bought the hybrid which gets around 28 mpg which is very nice even though premium gasoline is required.  Couple of annoying things while driving are the fairly loud hum when braking (due to regenerative brake system) and the slight hesitation when starting from a traffic stop (due to switching from hybrid to gas).",5

At 1438 miles, had to replace the fuel tank, fuel pump, fuel gauge and brake pump booster; in shop 21 days.  At 10,019 miles, scheduled lift gate recall repair and oil change; took 45 days to get part and second trip to dealer for installation of part.  At 12067 miles, replaced leaking transaxle oil seal.  At 20,140 miles, replaced same leaking transaxle oil seal for second time and replaced transaxle itself.  According to my service adviser, the transaxle was scored and was a factory defect; took 6 days to receive part.  At 20,153 miles, the air conditioner on the driver's side quit (I live in Texas and the temp was still near 100); took 16 days to get damper servo so it could be repaired.  On one occasion, the radio was on, but no sound would emit regardless of what I tried; restarting the engine caused it to work again.  On one occasion, several warning lights flashed, but I couldn't tell which ones they were since I was driving.  I've been driving a Lexus hybrid for almost 4 years, and know how to start it.  About 20% of the time, I have to try a second time to start the car.  None of the electrical problems created an error code and the service department can't replicate them.  Fortunately, I leased the car, and it will be returned at the end of the lease.

I'm over 60 and wanted the biggest Japanese hybrid money can buy.  But after I bought it I heard that Acura will have a hybrid MDX in mid year 2017.

Hate the front seats. The bolster on either side is rigid and relatively high (pointed) compared to other bolsters so a big person sits ""ON"" the bolster instead of between the bolster.

1974, on 04/25/16 17:32 PM (PDT),David K. ,2016 Lexus RX 450h SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),One Sweet Ride," I really like the design of this car, contrary to what others have posted.  To me it is modern and very distinct.  The only negatives on the design are that the rear cargo area and visibility out the back window is somewhat limited.  However, as soon as I got used to using the camera, mirror, and warning systems, visibility was  not an issue.   Also I am glad to give up a little cargo room to avoid the boxy rear on you see on most SUVs.The backup warning system lets you know if a car is coming when you are backing up.  I don't know how it sees around corners, but it seems to.The design of the interior is amazing.  I got the parchment and bamboo interior, and it feels and smells very luxurious.  The seats are leather trimmed, but most surfaces are what Lexus calls NuLuxe, a  synthetic leather.  The material is not cheap feeling at all and is supposed to be a lot more durable and less prone to wear than real leather.  It feels very substantial and leather-like.  The bamboo is beautiful, especially on the steering wheel.  The only vehicle I would compare to this Lexus is a classic Rolls Royce, circa 1960 ( I rode in one once).The car accelerates OK, it is no Tesla, but has plenty of torque on the low end when you press the pedal to the metal, thanks to the 3 electric engines.  Braking has a different feel because of the hybrid system, but stops quickly for a 2 1/2 ton vehicle.  Cornering is just OK.  it is a tall, heavy car; not a sport car feel but what I would expect in a big luxury car.  The vehicle has a tendency to over steer when you accelerate into a turn, which does not inspire confidence in handling.The ride is silky smooth and quiet.  Passengers are well insulated from road noise and imperfections in the pavement.The remote opening 5th door is a convenience.The vehicle side doors seem heavy for such a luxurious vehicle.  Everything else is so refined it seems like they would have some kind of power assist or counter balance.  The rear door is always operated electronically.The Infotainment system is the only real negative I have for an otherwise superb vehicle.  I have been working with the voice commands with varying degrees of success.  The voice command options seem too limited.  Lexus apparently went with its own navigation system rather than partner with somebody that knows what they are doing like Google or Garmin.  Note to Toyota: you are a CAR company - why would you think you can make a competitive navigation system?  You can't.   And they want $240/year after the first year, much more than buying a better Garmin.The manual states you can integrate the voice command system with an iphone - and a small and otherwise worthless compartment in the middle console seems designed to hold a small iphone.  The on-board bluetooth integrated my Samsung cellphone seamlessly into the car's voice and sound system.Mileage has been less than claimed, but has improved since the battery has become conditioned and I learned to drive the vehicle.  I got 29 MPG (vs. claimed 28) on a recent highway trip, averaging 70 MPH.  Around town I've averaged 26 MPG (vs. claimed 30), but that seems fine for such a heavy vehicle.  Most of my trips are short, and the air conditioning is usually working at warp speed in our Las Vegas heat.  The Lexus RX450h  requires premium gas.I have driven a lot of nice cars, and this is the nicest.  I love it.",5

I drove it till November 2015 when I traded it in on a 2016 gray Lexus RX 350 which was a great vehicle. But it was gray and driving a gray vehicle in gray Indiana was too much. So I traded it in on a red 2016 Lexus RX 450h in early January 2016. The h is definitely more refined and, although I am not an expert, I feel that the CVT transmission is much superior to the 8 speed in the 350. I really do not have any complaints about the 2016 Rx 450h. It is extremely quiet, responsive and safe. The driver's assist technology is superb. And the color is uplifting.Now that I have driven more than 10000 combined highway and city miles the vehicle has delivered on all off its promise. No complains. I am now used to the mouse and can navigate easily. The voice recognition needs a little help, however.The odometer hit 22500 miles and I am still thrilled with my purchase. No problems what so ever.

I recently traded in my 2011 450h for the 2016 revised model and am just smiling ear to ear.  Everyone I show it to is in awe.  I was lucky enough to get in early on this vehicle and can tell you first hand that it is worth every penny.  From the new and extended high tech navigation system to all the upgraded safety features, Lexus has hit the bullseye.  Ergonomically, it is the most comfortable ride ever and at my age (59) this is critical to driver comfort and safety.

I am on my second hybrid SUV from Lexus and also owned an LS.The first thing lots of people do not seem to realize is that in order to extend your gas mileage in any car, including hybrids, YOU HAVE TO KEEP THAT HEAVY FOOT OFF THE ACELERATOR! Driving faster than a maximum of 65 will diminish your mileage, also driving in hilly terrain, fast take-offs, your AC usage, incorrect tire pressure, and otherwise rough handling. In addition, you have to go into the RXs' information setting and reset the gas mileage indicator to see the true mileage. Hope this helps.",5

It is not a car for the performance oriented driver. It is a room, comfortable cruiser that gets impressive gasoline mileage in town. On the highway it is smooth and quiet. The hybrid drive has worked great, and we've had no problems with the system. After 70K miles, I can report only one significant mechanical problem, which could very well have been catastrophic. An oil hose burst and the car leaked oil all over our garage a driveway. Fortunately, I discovered it in time before the car was driven a significant distance. The local Lexus dealer replaced it for free. This was not an isolated incident with the model... there are quite a few similar cases posted on internet forums. Why the Lexus dealer didn't recall and replace it earlier is a mystery. If you own this car or buy one used, make sure your mechanic checks all of the oil hoses! Otherwise, it's a great (if boring) car. We will pass it down to our teenage daughter soon.",4

Unfortunately, this is the only great thing about it. Very poor performance even after shifting into S-Sport. Car feels very heavy (like most luxury cars, right?) and lacking power. After taking it for a day drive around the town, I've got 22.5 mpg this is what you get for $19,000 used car (I was looking at regular RX for $9,000 and thinking: how much time/years will take to get the 5 mpg difference back?). Radio and controls are weird: like you are holding Japanese cassette player from the 80's. There is no way to find the button you need while you are driving... forget about using the joystick (awkward-est part #1 in this car ). So, bad gas mileage, mediocre performance... Probably good for people who cannot handle a V-6 engine (great for retirement?).  I also tested LS 430 and I appreciated the ride (didn't buy it because we couldn't open a trunk. Later I found out that the car was overpriced).",1

We've taken it on several 4-hour trips and I've driven it every day on suburban roads with some freeway.  Overall about 26mpg regular or premium, so we'll stick to regular gas in the future.  I've noticed that I can nurse the mpg up to perhaps 28mpg by babying my acceleration and braking, but I prefer to drive in my normal fashion; anyway, gas is cheap and saving gas money wasn't the motivator.  Pros: beautiful and luxurious.  Surprisingly economical.  Like a gorgeous woman who still loves tacos and beer.  Minuses:  Has middle-grade stereo, boomy bass at about 100Hz, (I'm an audio engineer, this really bugs me but what the heck), unknown future battery replacement cost (but other Prius hybrids have lasted for 200k+ miles, plus it's a Toyota/Lexus).UPDATE December 2016:Now that it's cold outside, it takes ~10 minutes before the engine's toasty warm, and meanwhile the fuel economy is lousy.  So if my trips are just 10 minutes every time, I get more like 22mpg.  I would assume the EPA tests are done with a fully-warmed-up engine, which is why there is such a large discrepancy.",5
1991, on 11/01/16 20:58 PM (PDT),LuckyMe ,2010 Lexus RX 450h SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Love it.," The great thing about this SUV is that the body changes so little each year that the car seems like new, at about a third of the price of a new one.  I don't like the big new grilles Lexus has been making anyway, I think they cheapen the look.  I prefer the more refined grille of the 2010.  Despite that mine had somewhat high mileage, it was extremely well maintained by the previous owner and seems like new.  I have had no problems with it thus far except I occasionally get a little carriage squeaking on overpasses for some reason, but not on regular paved road.  However, otherwise, the ride is as smooth and quiet as silk.  My favorite things about this car are the cushy interior and the high ride so that you can practically walk in and out of the car.  No having to bend way down to get into the car.  The quality of the interior is great, soft leather, nice wood on steering wheel and other locations.  The only things that are cons for me are that the charger outlet and usbs are not in a good place.  You have to remove a storage bucket in the front center console to get to them.  It would be more convenient to have them in the dashboard area.  However I guess it allows you to store things that are being charged or played out of sight.  Heated seats are very nice.  I like the auto lights and being able to talk on the phone handsfree via bluetooth connected phone.  Mine is silver (tungsten pearl, to be precise; it is a little different than silver, I've noticed) with black interior and some light gray around the window area.  I love it.  Sometimes after I get out of it and walk away, I look back at it just to admire it.  I am getting good mileage, averaging about 29 mpg thus far, and that's on 87 or 89.

We purchased the extra maintenance plan and at 125,000 miles, so far I've done nothing but the scheduled oil/maintenance, covered under my plan.  More importantly, I love driving it. I concur that milage is contingent upon driving style.  I average 28 mpg even hitting 80mph with highway driving, by avoiding quick acceleration and taking my foot off the accelerator when I know I'm braking soon.   My only frustration is the USB port location is inconvenient which they've changed in newer models. I leave the connector plugged in so rarely have to access it the port. My Lexus dealership couldn't be more accommodating  during maintenance, with a loaner if reserved beforehand, shuttles to the mall across the street if desired, and a nice set up at the dealership where I can work or watch TV in designated lounges.

I love the ride; quiet, smooth like glass, cushy seats. Mileage so far is a disappointment. I am averaging just under 25 mpg. The interior of the car, other than the fine leather seats, is also a disappointment.  Too much plastic. Even the wood appears cheap. The gadget technology (phone, nav, audio, etc) is unsophisticated and lacks elegance.  Placement of the dashboard and other interior gauges can be in hard to find places making it necessary to take your eyes off the road. The glove box is a joke.

Journeys averaged 25 mpg, commute in traffic usually get 29 or 30 mpg which is sensational for a vehicle this size. It's only let down by the plastic finish on some of the interior fittings. It's very strange as some features are wonderful like the soft leather seats and the soft interior roof lining. Contrast this with the plastic finish of the grab handles that rattle annoyingly.

I have found that, if I deliberately drive to maximize mileage (no jackrabbit starts, stay at 70 on the interstate, take it easy in general, but nothing extreme) I can consistently average 29 or 30 MPG.  I would stress that these are AVERAGE mileage.  Often people (and car ads) talk about the highway mileage as though that is the mileage.

There is plenty of power for normal city and highway driving. However, don't expect to floor it at a light and whip ahead of the car on your left.  It's not built for this but it can do it if you want to shoot the MPG to hell. On the highway, throw the trans left into manual and downshift to 4th gear for extra passing power.

The car is pleasingly quick and reasonably quiet; and, at least within the RX line, the best safety features are reserved for the Hybrid.

A lot of value for the money even as a base with 18 liquid graphite staggered wheels and radar cruise control with lane departure warning. Feels very sporty ...not fast but nether slow. I wish for driver memory seat settings and a power telescoping steering wheel which I think should be standard for a Lexus but oh well, you can’t have it all for under $40k. Just three of us so we have enough space but don’t be tall or have tall friends without cars...storage inside lacks too and the trunk isn’t for the pack rat travelor",4

The V-6 engines had a little less power, but got much better gas mileage on regular gas.  The interiors from 2006 to 2016 are much cheaper with very little storage on the inside.  Drink holders are almost at your elbows, making it unhandy to use.  The voice recognition system is terrible; 50% of the time, you have to give up on completing a voice command.  I carried to dealership, and they couldn't figure it out nor offer to do anything about it.  When you finally successfully make a phone call command, you will get a list of everyone with the same last name to choose from, even when you give the phone number to be called.  My understanding is that having bigger back tires on a car is a performance enhancement; this car does not have the power to rate a bigger rear tire than the front.  If you think you need the 18"" rims, they should carry the same size tires.  The car is a very stylish looking car and the ride is ok, but I've had one with the 17"" rims, and it had a far superior ride than the ones with the 18"" rims.  The trunk space is adequate for a car this size, but the opening is fairly small, making it hard to get a large suitcase or a large cooler in the trunk.  The ""computer mouse"" that controls almost everything is very difficult to use, especially if you are driving, but your are almost forced to use it because voice commands are difficult to complete.",4

Called Dunlop and they send me to another tire shop, they checked the tires and they agree with the dealer, tires need to be replaced. They quoted me over $ 900. I went to Sams club and I've got new tires for $ 626 (no dunlop). Disappointed with Lexus, Lexus needs to make sure to deliver new is200t cars with good tires.

So pulling out into traffic isn't as confidence inspiring, as one may expect. Also, the car I test had the plastic mesh material from C pillar hanging there, and a rubber seal on the door loose. I was extremely disappointed, as I've heard mainly great things about Lexus quality. The paint on the exterior of my friends 2016 (flat black) is really scratched, I asked him why? He stated he takes it to the car wash, so again not impressed with the overall quality. I've since driven the 2017 330i and the 2017 Audi A4, they seem much more surefooted, as well as the cabin materials are constructed as you'd expect.

It has less torque, and less horse power, slower acceleration, and (if it matters to you) doesn't sound nearly as nice as the V6 does. Don't kid yourself, the only reason you would buy this car is if you can't afford the 350 series. I'm not saying its a bad car, I'm just saying you should test drive both. I'm not sure why someone else said it handles better, thats complete BS as curb weight is almost identical, 3,583 lb vs 3,593 lb.",4

I decided on the 200t because of the turbo 4 and the 8 speed trans.  The 350 does have torque on demand but if one understands how a turbo works and can manipulate the lag the 200t is an awesome machine.  You can't expect performance out of the 200t when its stuck in Eco mode.  Put the car in Sport mode and it will awaken the beast within. The 200t is lighter and feels more nimble and balanced than the 350.  I saved $6000 over the 350 and with that savings I can tune this car to out perform the 350 and still have thousands left.  In my opinion, the 200t is the best-bang-for-your-buck!!  The interior is beautiful and the seats very comfortable.  The exterior styling is a work of art.  I love this car.",5

But the IS overall feels like an upgrade. 1. the exterior design is  quite something, it is fresh, no other car from same category in my opinion beats lexus - audi a4, bmw 3 series, infinity q502. quality of interior is high. the seats for example  are higher quality than that of audi a4, now you could get higher quality seats in a4 as a package but they come standard with lexus IS. Overall interior quality will feel better than in audi a4 or bmw 3 series, but prob not better than quality of q503. this model makes some features standard where other makes (audi, bmw) would make them optional. keyless ignition, rear view camera, and my favorite free feature - the interior lights up as you approach the car door with keys in your pocket - these little features give a feel of owning luxury",5

I was so excited to try the IS, it's ideal for San Diego.  The IS200T is beautiful, but the seats are very uncomfortable.  When I first got the car, I didn't notice it; as I understood, it was different than the ES I was used to and the IS would require adjustment.  After the first month, I knew the front seats were uncomfortable, I voiced my complaint to a friend, whom tested the seats and said it felt okay - that's what I thought at first too.  I started getting back pain through the holidays of 2015.  I was sure it was the seats, but determined I was just not adjusted to the seats yet. Today in January 2016, I cannot take it anymore. I have backpain and I feel like I'm getting a hunchback from it. I have excellent posture: one, I'm a ballroom dancer; two, I've never had back or neck issues. I've decided to return to the Lexus dealership where I purchased my car, bring this to their attention and see if there's a fix: swap the seats or swap the car.  Stay tuned. DRJan 2018, Update: No change. Eats are still awful. I purchased a back cushipn for support. Lexus of San Diego was not able to assist by offering a fix or a good deal on trading in the car.  However, in addition to the seats, the breaks began sqeeking at 6 months. I've had the breaks checked, they are fine. Two years now, they squeal and squeak still. Ugh, one more year. >:/",3

The car  has enough power to give you the feeling that it's in between a luxury and sports sedan. The exterior, or appearance, of the car is very refined looking and in my opinion, the newer IS line of cars are the best looking entry level luxury vehicle in its class. The interior is astounding and very comfortable. The controls are very easy and manageable. My wife and I had no learning curves from driving our other vehicles, so the transition is fairly smooth.

I had to replace an air conditioner fan, but everything else has been flawless mechanically.    Compared to Lexus LS series cars it is not as smooth riding nor as quiet--even after adding $900 of soundproofing. (That was a waste. I don't recommend it.). This is a mild disappointment.   Acceleration is quite good. I did not give it higher marks due to a one to two second hesitation when accelerating to pass. I love the continuously variable transmission.    I can play MP3's using a memory stick. This is good, but one cannot reliably or easily navigate to to the song desired due to the balky interface. The rest of the radio/CD interface is fine.

I live  the Chicago area and with the winter cold, it has dropped to less then 30. I took it to the dealer who said it was normal due to the engine running more for the emissions. Seems like too big of a drop to me. the car itself is fun to drive, handles well, although the grunt of the engine turning on does seem to be a little underpowered. Trunk space is diminished due to the batteries and the stereo is not what I consider top of the line for a Lexus, particulalry in the back seat.

Acceleration and power are good but more pedal push is needed at times compared to gas cars.  Steering is very responsive with good road feedback.

The new hybrid drives very smooth, quiet and I love the interior design.  I have much more room, storage space than the BMW 325i. The gas mileage has been great so far.

I drove both Toyota hybrids and the Ford Fusion and they simply are not in the same league in terms of either performance or comfort. It is obviously more expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for; you don't even have to drive them, you can just sit in them--though driving will further substantiate the differences. If you want a diesel, get a diesel; the A3 and 335d are different cars that meet different needs and expectations; I live in an area where many of their advantages are mitigated by traffic. This is the paradigm of the car of the next 5 years.  ",4.875

Right after, various TSB's were performed for interior noises & passenger side front A-Pillar head air bag cover was replaced.

All I can say is that with the 6 speed manual transmission, the car is actually a well balanced fun car to drive.  I drove a few automatics and didn't get the same feeling in the car.  Also, I have upgraded lowering springs, cold air intake, catback exhaust, short throw shifter, 19 inch IS-F rims, and added a spoiler.

This latter problem is rather annoying: every time I came to a stop and then release the brake pedal to move again the front brakes make a noise.

The BMW has better engine sound but you can add F-accessories to the IS if you really need the sound.  Handling is better on the IS.

A passenger cannot program the system while the car is in motion, does not announce street names, is very complicated to program.  Do not waste your money on this inferior system.

It has so many things i like for example the speed odometer with the LED lighting is great.. I love the way you can set the color change when you going too fast, those of you who have it know what i'm talking about and i have the sport package with the sifter makes it so much fun to take on an open road.  I do have to add the dislikes i came across but its not family friendly when it comes to leg room and trunk space.. it is best to only have 4 people in the car including the driver because i find that it does not have a lot of leg room in the back if you are planning on buying one and you have a family you may want to try it out and make sure... another thing is if you are tall take a second to look how close your head is to the roof lowing the sits may help but not everyone finds that comfortable.. The car does handle very well on the road but i do thing it need a bit more hose power for it to be a sport car and i don't like how much work you have to do to replace the headlight bulbs. if you have to replace it don't buy the cheap one because you want to save a dollar or two just get the best replace it once and don't worry about it for awhile. check online to see what i'm talking about.. I hope this help but since i just got this car i cant give you all the information but i do hope it help's those looking to buy an IS250. I did how ever pay a bit more on the car over the trade in valve because i forgot to check due to the over all test ride i just wanted the car and i has so many good reviews i assume the best and took it. so don't make that mistake you maybe able to get a better deal",4

I put over 100,000 miles on the ES after I bought it and thoroughly enjoyed that car.  But, I have been telling him since he bought the IS that i wanted it when he was ready for his next new Lexus.  This past Saturday he bought a new RX 350 and I bought the IS with 95000 miles on it for a little less than the trade-in value.  It is comfortable to drive, has enough pep for this old fart, looks amazing (the previous owner took meticulous care of it), and is everything I wanted8/1/17 - we are now a year later, and I still love this car.   Because I live so close to work, I have only put 6200 miles on it. It has been everything I hoped for2/1/18 - Another 6 months, and I still love it. No problems. No issues. Routine maintenance.

It remains bullet proof and a great and reliable ride for all seasons.  Bullet proof is the term Carl at my local auto body shop said about his experience with this Lexus model.  I had to take mine in when I was rear ended a few years ago and the plastic cowling had to be replaced.   Carl said the original 2006 IS 250 has quality materials far superior to what he has seen on recent Lexus vehicles brought in for repair, especially the cabin interior.  I Just finished polishing and detailing my Lexus and it looks damn good after 11 years of Colorado weather exposure.  The AWD feature has been an excellent and reliable feature when it snows and icy road conditions have to be navigated.   I only have 86k miles on the vehicle and when our first grandkid gets a license I will feel very comfortable transferring this vehicle to another family member because of its safety and reliability features.   Another thing I like about the Lexus is the outstanding customer support the local Denver Kuni Lexus dealer provides.   They don't care if you own an IS250 or the highest priced Lexus flagship car......the responsive customer and technical service is always top notch.  They stand by their product.",5

I've been a long time BMW fan and enjoyed driving the crap out of them. I've owned at least ten of them in my lifetime.  But one too many expensive repair trips left me wanting something sporty yet reliable.  My first experience was with the Lexus GS300, loaded to the gills with Navigation, Mark Levinson sound, DVD, park distance control, etc.  I recently sold my daughter's Honda Accord with 192,000 miles.  A great car for the money and reliable as well but with none of the Lexus care.  I told my daughter not to worry that her mode of transportation would not be gone for too long.Enter the Lexus IS250.  Taught lines and and a sporty appearance with 18"" sport rims are a winner! Included are navigation and back up camera, heated and cooled seats, etc.  I bought it for my daughter, used and slightly abused because the previous owner had a dog and lived in San Francisco.  Yet all of the Lexus dealer service records indicated that at least the drive train was in perfect running order.  Basically, purchased it for the KBB dealer trade-in price which was about $3000 more than I sold the Honda Accord for and daughter definitely approved of the appearance overall and tremendously discounted price due to scratched bumper.Lexus has always had a reputation for reliability and they have really taken care of this car.  Lexus has made several recalls on this car and a major engine recall where the piston rings were faulty.  So, 127,000 miles on the odometer, I basically have a just like new Lexus certified rebuilt engine!  BOO-YAH!  WINNER, WINNER, CHICKEN DINNER! My wife drives it and loves it so much, she has to battle my daughter for the use of the car.  They're both petite, so, it fits them both perfectly and I don't worry because of the safety features and good gas mileage.  My only gripe is that it is tight in the back seat and owning a GS300 for myself leaves me to believe that in comparison of quality the GS300 is much higher.  Get what you pay for.Edit 3/23/2018:  Driver's seat is now ripped due to the fact that it is vinyl. Sad.",5

I did have it sputter on idle twice, but just gave it a little gas and it was fine. Car feels like it is glued to the road and in snow and ice/blizzard conditions- the AWD didnt even slip.

People say BMWs cost more than Lexus to maintain NOT true. Lexus will drain your pockets.  Pros: Performance for small V6 2.5L is impressive, excellent handling, interior quality is much better than BMW, looks better than a BMW and most cars in its class.  Overall I would stick to a BMW 3 series, for some reason the Lexus rust very easy causing expensive exhaust leaks that occur frequently.

It has excellent exterior design and looks sporty yet refined. The interior is fairly comfortable for a small to average sized person. It's a very smooth and quiet ride and is very fun to drive. The 250 model lacks in power, but is surprisingly fuel efficient getting 24MPG in town and 31MPG on the highway. Mine has the navigation unit and I'm not crazy about it since the stereo and climate control are all part of it meaning you can't see your radio settings, navigation screen and climate settings all at the same time.

For no reason, at 36K up until 75K (I got rid of it), the car would idle at a stop and almost stall. I knew something was wrong. The dealership could never identify the problem. Aside from the many recalls, there was another incident when the engine light appeared. I read that others had the same problem, so I assume that it is just super senstive if you ""top"" off gas.

At 70K miles I took it to the dealer who told me it was a faulty battery. 2 months later did the same thing, towed it to the dealer they told me, it was a fluke they couldn't repeat it and to bring it back in when it repeats it.

In the morning when the car is cold they seem to grab too quickly and cause jerky stopping. The quality of this car is not what I expected.

This is because the first 1.5 seconds the car barely rolls before the computer engages and you actually get moving. The other acceleration problem is on highways when passing. I can't just punch the accelerator and go. I have to time it in order to pass other cars because of the delay similar to the one while standing still. Terrible in winter conditions.

The IS 350 is nice but the additional 102 hp not necessary to enjoy the features of this sports sedan.1/13/17 Update - my IS is still rock solid.  I now have 26k miles and is a joy to drive everyday. I replaced the tires at 19k miles with Michelin Pilot Super Sports and it handles much better than when I 1st purchased it. ",5

While the cars may share an engine and drivetrain, the 2015 model is a significant improvement over the previous model. Lexus has really changed the dynamics of the car with the chassis and steering; the car feels incredbily sharp, if not overwhelmingly powerful. 204 HP may not be tops in this class, but it has always felt sufficient to me for what I require. Forget the AWD and save weight and mpg, you aren't going to drive this car in the snow anyways (the ground clearance alone won't allow it). In RWD the IS250 has enough power to satisfy, and you will always look better next to a C class or 3 series!",4.625

Don't let the 206 hp rating discourage you, the car is quite quick and responsive. Power is very linear with strong pull all the way through the rev range. It feels much faster than it actually is, which is a huge plus in the fun factor. Steering is very precise, and the car stays flat through the corners at high speeds. Ride is firm, yet forgiving over small bumps. You quickly see where your dollar went when you drive it, Lexus has this suspension dialed in. Road noise is minimal. Great visibility. Base level stereo is great. Would recommend this car to anyone who can see the value in a performance oriented car. **Update** Have had the car for 2 years now. Mileage is not good. Averaging around 21 mpg with an even mix of city/highway driving, with ""ECO"" mode selected. Have really focussed on driving it extremely conservatively to try get the best possible mileage and it just doesn't seem to ever get any better. I chose the smaller V6 rather than the IS350 for better mileage and am very disappointed. Our old Accord V6 which had much more power, averaged around 5 mpg better, I don't get it. Otherwise, car has had no issues.",5

After driving it for about a year the door panels and the dashboard began to melt. Literally like goo up and melt! We received a letter from the dealership that this issue was under a warranty enhancement program and we would be able to receive replacements from Lexus at no cost to us. Thrilled about this we put our name on the list and began to wait for our car to be fixed. ONE YEAR LATER only 5 cars have been fixed. Upon calling Lexus to complain they said ""they are on back-order."" However, they can continue to make new cars and sell those. What I hear is they are not standing behind their product and do not care about the customers who already have given them money... Just new customers. The car is so bad that we virtually can not drive it. The goop from the doors has melted on to the seats and it ruins your clothing. The goop from the dashboard has begun to melt onto the steering wheel and the dashboard has also ruined the shift pannel as the goop has melted onto it. Their warrenty program is a SCAM! They are fixing 3-5 cars every 6 months to say they are doing something. They offered me a dashboard cover which will clip on, but that would forfit my place on this non-existant list. I have never been so angry. I spent 20k on this vehicle and it is a piece of ***!Upon calling the Lexus corporate line I was told that a manager would call me back on Monday. It is now Thursday and she is just now getting around to it. When asking her why she informed me ""I SIMPLY FORGOT"" Lisa from customer care who claims to be a manager actually laughed at me when I asked her to esclate my claim to the next level. She said ""HAHA MAM WE ARE ALL AWARE"" I have never been spoken to in such a rude and disrespectful manner. I am appaled by their lack of care for their customers and I can not beleive they have people who have so little respect for their clients calling pretending to be managers.BOTTOM LINE: I DID NOT GET WHAT I PAID FOR. BE CAREFUL WHEN PURCHASING AN IS AND DO NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE.There is a class action law suit against Lexus for the IS models. We will be persuing this. When told we could trade in the vehicle and not have any reprocutions on the value based on this defect my dealership said ""Well going rate on the auction is 8k, and I would have to auction it off because I can't put a car with doors like that on my lot."" So BS for not being penalized for the condition of the doors and dash!",1

I am disappointed with the way the car drives. Mine has sport susp. and tires. Handling is great but the ride is too harsh. Sport tires VERY road-noisy. The steering is the major flaw. Very fast and tight, but no road feel or feedback. It feels ""sticky"" and ""dead."" Very strange. Brakes grabby.",3.875

The dealer ended up replacing my whole top dash and now it's much quieter, but I'm also getting those loud pops that others are getting. I find the ride very bumpy on bad LA freeways. The suspension seems way too tight. Had a BMW 328i before, and while this doesn't handle as well of course, it has more interior comforts. I still love the styling and get lots of great comments.

I bought this used for a price I just couldn't pass up as mine is has the F-Sport package and that alone makes it well worth it.  Since it is an F-Sport, it handles superbly well on sharp turns and even some slopes.  This allows for a healthy blend of city and highway driving, both of which I do daily.  At a combined 25 MPG that I get, the mileage isn't terrible but not anything to write home about either.  The exterior looks are my favorite part of the car.  Every angle looks sharp, sleek, and stands out even among other top-end luxury sedans.  Only cons I can speak of are the slowish acceleration and some slight deterioration of some interior plastics.

My first impression was great! I love the style of both the exterior and interior.  I'm content with the performance (love the sport mode) and braking is phenomenal.  My issue has been a  rattling sound on the driver side that comes from somewhere within the dashboard.  The dealership has attempted to find the source of the rattle 4 times to no avail. It sounds as if I have plastic CD cases in the door pocket that rattle constantly. Not even turning up the radio can mask the sound. And to make matters worse, its starting to happen on the passenger side as well.  I thought Lexus was known for its smooth, quiet ride.  I guess I was wrong.  This is my first Lexus and it will also be my last.",3

As a former BMW driver, I loved my beemer....but this car is eye-catching, sporty looking  and I know it will be far more reliable.  With the  repairs made on the BMW, I could have bought another car. After 100K miles, for starters, I had suspension parts and engine coils fail to the tune of $4K.   I traded it in with $7K in repairs looming (steering fluid and oil leaK).    The Lexus is sporty, elegant, well appointed.  I bought it with only 7K miles....drives like  a dream and even has an optional sport mode.  Only concern is that the paint will not hold up like the beemer.  Chips easily (not me, previous owner).  In contrast, the  BMW  looked mint when I traded it in for $3K with 180K miles.  The car should have been worth more but was on it's last legs.  BMW needs its owners to be mechanics to afford repairs after 100K miles.November 2016 update:  I continue to love my 2014 Lexus IS250.  Still a great car, no issues. I have somehow put 20K miles on it this year.  As for maintenance, because this was a certified Lexus, all the maintenance has been at no charge.  The only quirky thing I will mention is that you need to change your oil every 10K miles, which is fine.  However, the maintenance light comes on every 5K miles to trigger wheel rotation and fluid check.  Because my car's front tires are a different size from my back tires, this particular maintenance does not make sense and it is annoying to have that maintenance warning come on.  Anyway, still a great car.  Also, I recently checked how much this car would cost today, and I seem to have gotten a really good deal since they are still asking around the same price that I paid for my year and model last year.  Maybe this is because the AWD is now only available in the IS350 which is a more expensive car.",5

BMW has great styling and is a fun car to drive. The issue is more the nickel and dime attitude from BMW. Why are car alarms extra? Plastic seats? Come on BMW. So I am going Japanese and in the end got on a great deal that included all the luxuries.  Love the interior (except the old school clock) and comfort. While this is no BMW 328, it does have decent power. I am speeder by nature, so less power when the light turns green is best for me. If I want to floor it, it will move.

But I got a screamer of a deal (less than this website shows for invoice) at 2.9%.  With only ~220 miles I'm already averaging 26 mpg in the city - pretty good for car not broken in yet.

The C200 was rough and hard on the fuel pedal with engine and road noise not on par with the brand name.  The IS250 choice was a balance between my want to have an exciting car and luxury and comfort.  In the end the choices were Audi A4, Volvo S80 and Volkswagen GTI.  A4 was expensive not worth the money, the Volvo was too big for my wife to handle and the GTI was boyish.  The choice fell on IS250 Deluxe.  I do not have a regret.

It is a sporty looking pre-luxury all wheel drive vehicle, top notch reliability and a spectacular dealership experience.  Beyond that it's an expensive AWD Corolla with added bells/whistles. It does do a great job in the harsh Midwest winters, but is not nearly as fun to drive as the Audi/VW cars I have owned in past.  Its handling is okay but not sporty; the ride is generally compliant but at times punishing.  It never ""goes"" when you need it to and then whines like a four cylinder.

Lexus interior finish is by far higher end than BMW finish at a more affordable price point.  Obviously the 250 could use some more power, but you can get that in 350 and the 250 gets great mpg.  Combined hwy and cty mileage averages about 26mpg. I get 31mpg on hwy.  The audio and nav system is superb. One drawback is not being able to program the nav system while the vehicle is moving.

I can understand why other reviewers focus on the power, but I consider this car a luxury car that is sporty, rather than a pure sports car. We test drove the A4 2.0T Quattro (used to own an Audi allroad) and really liked it also, but the interior seemed outdated and the engine, although better kick, did not seem as refined as the IS250.

I probably won't but could keep car for another 15 years and it would still be an enjoyable ride. A bit jumpy off the mark. Even if you try to moderate throttle it tends to leap off line.

Well, the traction control and VSC complemented the near new tires so well that I never had a problem on the highway and the LS drove like a tank in the city.

I love it. it rides like a cloud and it will out run any Camaro or mustang on the road. I would recommend this car to anyone . repairs are a bit pricey but it is a luxery car. this car has probably the best sound system I have ever heard. 16 years later it now has 170,000 miles on it and it run and drives like brand new.",5

I am amazed by the performance and reliability of a 15 year old car by the way it puts many of the new cars on the road to shame, particularly luxury sedans of the same age. The best compliment for this car happened when my 15 years said she wants one too because the ride is so smooth, quiet and fast (when needed)!!",5

After extensive research the 1998-2000 LS400 models fit the bill-40 more hp(290), 5 speed transmission, VSC and V8vvti engine. I bought online a one-owner, dealer-serviced, full records 1998 in mint condition that sold new for $59k. My test drive was the 1400 mile effortless drive back to Denver. Got 30mpg hwy doing 80mph with A/C on. The car absolutely looks and performs as new. The service history consists only of factory-recommended maintenance; nothing ever broke. A full dealer inspection after my trip revealed no issues. Spectacular vehicle for one-tenth cost new.",4.875

Absolutely no problems whatsoever. I did the 90k maintenance which was about $1000, but was very extensive. The car is comfortable, quick, and surprisingly economical. Every once in a while I get the itch to buy a new car, but think what could I replace this with that would come close. The answer is nothing. I have two other Lexus's that I bought used, a '92 SC300, and a '95 ES 300 and have been just as fortunate with those.My daughter now has the ES at college with 260k, and my SC is my weekend car with 180k.

I did sell it, and to my dismay, few cars could come close to the refinement, ride quality and overall durability of this fine automobile.I bought it used with 32,000 miles on the clock, it was a one owner car. I kept it for 4 years as a second car ( I also have a company car), and traded it when I thought I needed a larger (silly me). It would avage 29 mpg, in mixed drive from a 290hp 4 litre V8, simply amazing!

With ""Pulse and Glide"" technique, I get 37 MPG on freeway. Using cruise control, I get 30 MPG;  Top performance yet quiet and smooth as silk. Acceleration start at 30+ is breath taking. I challenge any sports car on the road. Feel like ""Speak softly and carry a big stick""  I call it the world class economical luxury sports cruiser.",5

The paint is peeling at two places on top of the rear bumper.  I have to check if these items are covered by warranty but I doubt it. I never expected these items to happen to a Lexus. I live in California.  The air conditioner is also weak even though it has been recharged and checked.  I had to cut the factory floor mat as it was too close to the accelerator even with the tabs. The floor mat would depress the accelerator. The engine gunned once and I saw the floor mat against the accelerator. I sent in a complaint but got nowhere. Check your mat.  Bad gas pedal design as the mat cannot slide under the pedal. ,3.625

Have driven the car from NC to Key West Florida twice with no problems. Recently had to have the drivers side door lock actuator replaced, but that is minor for an 11 year old car and the warranty that I purchased for the car covered that. My Saab spent more time in the shop than in my garage. I have spent a lot more time with Lexie. You will never regret owning this car even though it is 11 years old. Lexus Rocks! ",4.875

I purchased it used in 2003, and this was an excellent decision on my part.  I will be purchasing a CLK 500 Mercedes next month (June 2008), I wanted something a little smaller.  However, I refuse to get rid of this car, they could never give me enough to trade in my vehicle.  The car still looks good inside and out (10 years old).  I get so many stares.  I guess I will need a bigger garage.  This car rides smooth, and is extremely reliable.  Since it is 10 years old, of course it requires routine maintenance,not too expensive. This is a fine machine, exceeds expectations!",5
2506, on 12/14/07 22:47 PM (PST),greg hadden ,1998 Lexus LS 400 Sedan 4dr Sedan,Best of the Best," Lexus makes the BEST cars period.  The LS shows it all off and gets you there in style, comfort, with a bit of performance.  You'll not have to worry about these cars as they are virtually indestructable with bulletproof engines and transmissions.  This is the fourth LS I've owned, moving from a '92 to '94 to '96 and now the '98 which is far superior to the others in the options and styling that it offers.  The Xenon HIDs and Nakamichi sound really make a difference.  Buy this car, you won't be sorry.",5

Tried many cars including MB and other Lexus. I would say this is a car beyond belief, 10 fold better I mean. Even compare to brand new RX, it still is on different level. I plan to buy another soon. No matter how you compare, comfort, quality and reliability, it all scores top of all cars. This car's body integrity is so good, you simply feel solid and can drive confidently.",5
2508, on 08/23/07 13:07 PM (PDT),Ben Logan ,1998 Lexus LS 400 Sedan 4dr Sedan,From a Mustang GT to a Family Car," The car is solid as a rock.  It has never once coughed or buzzed or knocked.  I feel very safe driving my family around in it.  Switching from a Mustang GT stick, it took a while to get used to the delay in jumping off the line.  If you want power immediately, or are doing an instant merge to freeway speeds, you better be power breaking it from the get go.  It has plenty of power, even more than the GT, but that half second delay can get you if you aren't used to it.  I am still finding cool features.  It is luxury at its finest.",4.625

I sold it to my brother in law after we were married and got my wife a Mercedes and almost a divorce. Needless to say I bought her a 1998 LS 400 from original owner that was impeccable and I found my true love. This is the best motor car for price, comfort, reliability in its class.

The comfort and quality is unmatched. I also enjoy the power of 290 HP which will sprint from a traffic light as fast as a sports car. All this and it is 8 years old!! I get so many stares and compliments that it makes me want to blush!This is definitely a car that I will keep for years to come. Oh yeah I was a little disappointed that I did not get the Nakamichi Stereo. No need to be the Lexus Premier system is also incredible. I compared the MB E430 and the GS 400 which I almost bought. But after driving the LS 400 it was the best of both worlds. Speed. Power. Luxury. Can you tell how much I like this car!!!!,5

It handles well for a luxury sedan and gets surprisingly good gas mileage for a V8. As others have said, the workmanship is unparalleled. This is far and away the finest automobile I have owned. My wife has an Infiniti that I thought was top shelf until I bought the Lexus LS 400 - there is no comparison.",5

I purchased mine certified for $25K two years ago and I simply love this car.  I actually get about 30 MPG highway cruising about 5MPH over the limit.  No mechanical problems...none.  Took a hit in the rear on a snowy day on I-95 causing $8k of damage, but protected me and my family as advertised and the ABS and vehicle anti-skid worked as promised.  Also, Lexus service has been excellent and not too overly expensive like my last Mercedes 560 SEL.  My family and friends are surprised to learn that I paid less with a better warranty than they did for their new SUVs, and I get much better mileage to boot. Winner!",4.875

The engine and transmission are incredible. The brakes are breathtaking. The comfort and quietness are sublime. The audio system is magnificent. The quality is unparalleled. It would take several pages or a whole book to accurately describe the superiority of this work of art, but reading all the reviews here is a good start. My favorite story about this car is that just after I bought it, I AVERAGED 33 mpg over a 253 mile stretch of Interstate. This is simply unbelievable for a car with a 290hp V8 engine.

We test drove the four above mentioned flagship models when they were three years old, and bought the Lexus.  It's not very quick off the line, but when it gets rolling, it flies.

I knew this car needed some work based on it's low price and I was correct.  For example even though the previous owner had done much of the recommended services, he did them at an independent garage which never changed his cabin air filter or his engine air filter.  Remarkable how much better the car ran and the blower got air into the cabin after those repairs were made and this was after the blower motor had been replace in late December for about $380;  Lexus feels it was over working trying to get air into the cabin to warm and cool the car.

Due to a congenital defect in my C-spine, I need a smooth-riding car to avoid agitating my neck. I shopped around and decided on either this vehicle or a 2010 Lincoln MKZ. The interior on this vehicle is MUCH more spacious, and the car itself feels of a higher quality. The interior quality is absolutely flawless—every material is high-quality. The wood and leather feel great, and the details are taken care of, too; the grab handles are wrapped in leather. I came from driving a Mustang, and even in comparison to that car, this vehicle is fast. Transmission shifts are very smooth, and the car simply whisks you up to speed with no drama. Handling is better than I expected, but it’s not a sports car. Ride quality is absolutely key, and the car mostly delivers here. It does a fantastic job of insulating the passengers from harsh road imperfections, but the bumps are still felt. It’s not a “floaty” feel where you can’t even tell you’re on the road—if you want that, get an LS. All in all, the car is a beautiful vehicle.

If you are broad in the beam get a different car.  When I drove the car I had to shift my position numerous times to feel comfortable - the seat is not wide enough for a larger than average person.  There is a wind noise on both sides of the windshield that should never be heard from a car in this price range - and owners of the same style Camry have reported the same noise as well but Toyota/Lexus report that this is normal.

It drives smooth and gets good gas mileage. The center console is an engineer's joke. It always opens (what where they thinking with that button). Hopefully not the same guy that developed the engine with the Diesel noise. I can't say I will buy another one. This was my first Lexus. Oh, and the paint scratches with just a wash.

The gas mileage is better than expected.  I average around 24 mpg (mostly city driving).  On the highway, I get 30 - 35 mpg.

Transmission control is poorly designed, hurts economy and has safety issues as it coasts. Too quick to downshift on slight inclines. Driver has no control! Handling feel is not too bad. Pushed hard, exhibits roll. Front drive in any car has handling problems. This car is powerful and has torque steer that can take the car in dangerous directions if pushed hard from a dead stop. Be prepared if hard acceleration is planned or required.  Inside lighting is extremely poor. Design goof again. Paint may be thin and prone to scratches. Do not have the dealer service.

2611, on 07/19/15 05:16 AM (PDT),DrV1968 ,2015 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Not Your Child's Car," First of all, I didn't even consider Lexus when my husband and I test drove cars recently. In fact, I wasn't going to purchase ANY car because I was perfectly happy with the one I had, but my husband wanted to look, so well, let's be honest, much easier to give them what they want! We drove several luxury sedans that day, and my husband wanted to look specifically at Acura to replace my loaded Honda Accord, which was a car that I loved.  We visited dealerships up and down ""motormile"" including Audi, Acura, BMW, Honda, and so on. At the end of the day, I was happy to have proven to my husband that my Honda was, even after a few years, unbeatable. THEN, at the end of the day, he asked me would I like to visit Lexus, which I really didn't, but like any good wife, my response was Why not? Oh. My. Goodness. I've friends who own Lexus, BMWs, Mercedes, etc. but I'm not one to be persuaded to buy for the ""label"" unless it's truly a better product and an exceptional value. That said, I should have stopped while I was ahead that day... Because I'm now officially a Lexus addict. There are three things that I demand of any vehicle I own: comfort, reliability, and power! When I press the accelerator, I want that car to move; however, I'm not a twenty-something looking for a sports car, (or a mid-life crisis hot rod) and if that's what you want, look elsewhere. Try their slightly more affordable IS version for a stiff sports ride if you need that speedster experience. There is no go-kart, stiff, bumpy, hardcore ride to the ES 350 at all --- it is pure comfort and smooth luxury. After test driving cars all day, including a few for $60K and 80K, this one actually made me realize that I did in fact want a new car- THIS car!! Let me be blunt, if I shell out over $40K from my pocket - not the bank's money, but cold hard cash - it must be an amazing bang-for-the-buck because, personally, it hurts to turn loose of that much hard-earned money in one fell swoop (Note to cash buyers: If you pay the dealership $9900 in cash and write a check for the balance, they are still required to report that to the IRS. Checks count as cash, go figure.)All this to say, I'm not a Lexus fan, or a gadget junkie, or a new car aficionado, but that ES 350 literally sold itself. Period. If you haven't driven it, what are you waiting for? No review is going to convince you like the car itself! There is a reason that the ES 350 is Lexus' best selling model - it's just that good! Yes, even if it means I have to admit my husband was right!  Three things you should know: Most surprisingly, Lexus of Knoxville mailed us a refund check for $100 because we overpaid (after we had dickered over price for an hour) which tells me the associates working for that dealership have integrity! It would have been extremely easy for someone to stick that cash in his or her pocket. They were honest during the entire process, even when it came to telling me what they were going to do with the Accord I traded in. (I loved that car! And FYI they auctioned it. For less than they gave us in trade in value.) If you have the ability to deal in Knoxville, definitely buy from them! Next, the accessories and safety features definitely stand head-and-shoulders above the rest. A back-up cam is nice, sure, but features like the park assist and blind spot monitoring are fab-u-lous.  The dealership tech expert sat in the car with me and taught me all the nifty tricks and short-cuts. For example, If you activate the voice command system and say, ""I'm cold,"" the car increases the temp by four degrees, without ever taking your eyes off the road. Same with ""I'm hot"" and ""I'm hungry"" is a simple way to get nav to display local dining options. Take advantage of your tech expert because he or she knows how to make it easy and fun to drive this car and will answer all your questions no matter how long it takes --- then gives you his number in case you have questions after delivery. Lastly, when you do purchase the ES 350, and if you drive it, you will buy one, make sure you get all the accessories you think you might want; having them added at a later date (like a spoiler or body-side molding) is actually more expensive than the price on Lexus' website ""due to the added labor costs.""  Unfortunately, we bought ours on a Sunday night and I regret not getting those items added in at a set price, thinking when I drove back to Knoxville to have the car officially delivered, I could add accessories at their stated price. Luckily, I found a spoiler and body-side molding online for less than $100 each (original equipment branded In a Toyota box when delivered) and our local body shop installed both in under an hour... So, we spent $200 on options that would have been a grand had we had them done in Lexus' service dept; however, these parts aren't covered under warrantee. If the car is already equipped from the factory, according to the dealership, you don't pay labor.",5

We couldn't be more happy with all the changes/ upgrades that this new model brings to the table.   I rent cars several times a month and have always told my wife that our 2003 Lexus drove better, interior quieter and functionality of gauges better suited than any rental car foreign or domestic that I have ever had.

I have a BMW 5-series, so I understand I am not in the ES's target demographic. But seriously, when I drive the ES, I am reminded just how poorly front-drive platforms perform. They push, yank, and protest. They are positively poor driving cars, but probably not unlike most FWDs.Luxury-wise, the interiors are ok; ok materials, fair design, not a fan of ANY touchscreen, but definitively targeted at old people.

Why did I wait so long?," It might be a little early to make a report on this car, but when I picked it up, I was impressed....  Now I'm even more impressed.  My wife & I had been looking for a few weeks for an upgrade to our existing mini-van with 200K plus on it.   I kept telling my wife that I wanted a luxury car (with minimum road noise), something like an older Lincoln Town car!  She kept saying that the Lincoln was an ""old man's car"", to which I replied ""well I'm an old man""!   We test drove a couple cars like a Subaru, Cadillac and a GMC Cross-over!        Got tired of looking rather quickly, as they all look and feel the same after a while.  Last week, we stopped at a used lot only a few blocks from our house to look at a couple of vehicles out close to the road that caught my wife's attention.  I did not like either one and express to the salesman that they were all alike and that I wanted something to get excited about ~ like a 6 to 10 year old luxury car with low mileage.....   He said he had one ""right over here"" that was a one-owner 10yr old with everything on it!   He said they were asking more than I indicated I wanted to spend, but I should look anyway.   I indicated that my checkbook was variable, in that it varied depending upon the degree of excitement!!!   Anyway I drove it, got excited, went to the bank for a cashiers check and purchased a lovely 2007 Lexus ES with many add-ons/upgrades within the hour....  Only had it a week, but find something new I love about it every day.  Took a trip Christmas to Portland, OR (usually 3 1/2 hrs) at Christmas on terrible ice-covered roads to see the kids.  It took 7 hrs!  I was so glad to have this car with all the traction control and safety features....   We got to know the advanced navigation system and a few more goodies during the trip.  Continue to enjoy all this car has to offer and we got what we wanted - - - a luxury car with much of the depreciation on someone else!!! Everything works and we are still getting to know it.",5

Still bump my head occasionally on door opening, when exiting or entering drivers seat. I don't care for fake leather. Looks cheap in the cabin. However, it fulfills its entry level luxury car descriptions. I bought a Ultra Luxury package with panoramic roof, with all options offered, which overcame many of its shortcomings. I would not be happy with the ES350 equipped with a base or near base option package. My wife who is the main driver, shares my feelings on the technology, and is getting the hang of it.

My current car has the 17"" grand touring tires and the extra rubber makes this quiet and really comfortable.  I have the Luxury package and Navigation which adds some nice features.  If you can find nice colors get the Ultra Luxury with the Mark Levinson Stereo, Panaoramic sunroof, and upgraded leather with power extender on the drivers seat.

The next 6 years should lose about $6000. Also I would recommend getting a 2011 or 2012 since these cars accept regular gas instead of premium like the 2007-2010.

Buick no longer makes the Park Avenue and I have not been thrilled with their latest offerings. Reliability and longevity were my criteria in selecting my new car. So many people that have owned a Lexus product swear by the reliability of the cars. One owner I talked to was on their third Lexus having got 430,000 miles on the first one, and 375,000 miles on the second with no transmission problems. Consumer reports also rates the Lexus brand as having a good track record for reliability.I chose to go with a pre-owned Lexus ES 350 with 44,000 miles. Having the warranty from the Lexus dealer was added peace of mind. The ride comfort, low cabin noise level, and acceleration made missing the Park Avenue for just those reasons relieve me from my angst. Driving is part of my job as a manager and all-around comfort and performance are of major importance.The other aspect of owning a Lexus has been the experience of how I have been treated by everyone at the dealership, especially Rob, the general manager. I had reservations about not driving an American made car, but the way the dealership has gone out of their way to make sure I was happy has been absolutely exceptional and without peer in my all my years. This is the way we used to do business in this country by taking care of the customer, and in my mind, this removed any anxieties I had of not buying an American car.My fiancee having been witness to my experience, decided to get a new Lexus from Rob and his team. In doing so, she gave up the albatross of high cost of ownership that comes with every BMW, where the cost of service borders upon being absurd. I am so totally sold. The dedication and service that Lexus of Omaha has shown to me by exceeding my expectations makes the dedication to the Lexus product and people all that easier and gratifying.",5

Until this model, we liked the car, the value, and the features, even though the latter are pricey.We bought a 2012 ES-350 brand new. The navigation system in it is simply dreadful. Worse, there have been no major improvements in that system in the ensuing five years (including the 2016 model). The Obamacare people could do better. A $270 voice-activated off-the-shelf Garmin 2797LMT runs circles around this $2,600 rip-off. It's awful.The fact that the navigation system has not been either improved or junked completely since December 2011 affirms the arrogance of Lexus USA executives. Another tell-tale sign: If one calls the 800 Lexus number, one learns that Lexus management refuses to give the phone reps the tools to do their jobs: they can't see my instrument panel on their monitors. Therefore, they can't see what I'm having trouble with, so they cannot help. First, Lexus management hoses customers. Then it hoses its own employees. That is shameful, esp. the latter.",4

2732, on 08/19/16 11:43 AM (PDT),Disappointed ,2016 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),What's missing?," This is a Luxury automobile and as such should have luxury features. It has quite a few but here is what it does not have. I think I am bothered as much as to why these features are missing as I am that they are missing.First, there is no digital speedometer. Today’s analog speedometers are hard to see and under certain conditions very hard to see. With police having zero tolerance for speeds over the limit in some places the 20mph increments on the analog speedometer won’t cut it. My 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee has not one but 2 digital speedometers plus the analog. One is on the dash and one is on the navigation system and turns red if you exceed the limit. The Lexus has the hardware and processors to provide the digital speedometer but Lexus chose not to for on ES350. The dealer told me if I bought a more expensive model I could have it. I have 2 digital speedometers on my smart phone that are free.Second, there are no warning sensors to protect against high curbs. The low slung front end looks great but if you get too close to a curb you are in for a horrendous repair bill.  The parking assist front sensors won’t help on high curbs. Add 2 more properly angled sensors and problem solved. I think this problem is well understood by Lexus and was left uncovered on purpose. My friends F150 Ford truck has 360 degree cameras that also do the trick. Hardly a luxury vehicle. Lexus wants to fix your front end damage$$$.Third, there is no “remote start” on the FOB. Most other cars have this. Lexus wants you to buy the Enform app that does this. The app costs a lot of money after the first year and there is such a delay to the actual remote start it is unusable in many situations. Once again my 4 year old  Jeep has instant remote start on the FOB as do just about all other vehicles. Lexus says the app has other stuff like a vehicle locator. A vehicle locator can be had as a free app on any smart phone. After the first year, if you don’t pony up for the Enform Remote , Lexus says they will not help you find your stolen car. Isn’t that sweet.Fourth, there is no map button. You cannot touch one button in a hurry to get to the Navi map to see what the next street name is. You can if that’s you only home screen but that silly when the home screen has split screen capability. The Lexus used to have a map button but took it away in this generation. Yes the Jeep has one.  Once again, this is an obvious omission….but why?  There is a button to get to radio and media. How about a voice command you say. That takes you to the Navi but starts asking questions. They could have a “go to map” voice command but don’t. How about just hold the home button down to get there or any of 10 other ways.It's been a year now and what's missing is more bothersome than ever. Too bad, because other than being overpriced the ES 350 is a nice car. Lexus just sent me a notice that if I want to keep the Enform app it will cost $1200+ for 4 years.  UPDATE: Now that it's 95 degrees outside and I see other car owners remote starting their cars with 2 clicks on their FOB to get the AC going I realize even more how duplicitous the Enform App really is.",3

2734, on 08/09/16 15:31 PM (PDT),Amy ,2016 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Transmission issue, I've only had my 2016 ES 350 since December of 2015. It only have 5000 miles.Love my car until this past July my car starting doing some weird sound after taking off from a traffic stop light. Once I accelerated the car it made like loud thump and the speed diminished. I couldn't make the car go over 20 miles per hr because it started to make the thump sound again. Also the traction control came on when it made the sound. Long story short I got a tow truck to take my car to the dealership and they made the analysis and it turns out to be the transmission. But according to Lexus consumer hot line and the dealership they only cover a refurbished transmission not a new one. So for right know I am paying for a vehicle that is not drivable and going back and forth with Lexus to get a new transmission. This has been a big headache we just going to have to see what the outcome will be for my car.,2

I like the front-rear-and side warning beepers  and blue tooth android connection for Pandora. There is a very slight degrade in handling stability compared to the rear wheel drive and suspension of the GS but more than made up by the quietness and comfort of  the new ES. I got what I thought was a a good deal on the 2016 model - $7500 off MSRP and the $11.5k for the trade in of the '07 GS with 54k miles.  The car has 400+ miles and so far no problems except for the Pandora dropping out occasionally.  Car is as pleasure to drive. My only suggestions  would be for an 8 speed transmission and a little tighter suspension for less roll on turns.UPDATE 1-25-17:Affirm the above but have  some very minor complaints. The eform is awkward - poorly designed. It gets  confused and loses Pandora  connection and seeks another application I don't have installed. FM radio switches stations on its own. I don't listen to FM often. Lots of inefficient,distracting movements it operating the eform. I'm told the 2017 model has addressed some of this. Only 3500 mi on  ODO.1 Year Update July 2017Still high marks for the car but the enform software still defective POS even after a so-called upgrade or update. Pandora works through the enform about 25% of the time. Has a hard time connecting and gets confused trying to connect with Slacker, which I don't use.  It works 100% if I by-pass the enform and play it directly from the phone to the speakers via blue tooth..I miss the smoothness and efficiency of an 8 speed transmission like my wife's RX -same model year and same 3.5 ltr. engine. She has the same issues with enform which fails trying to connect to Pandora.  My guess is that next year's ES will have it.Update 01/20/2018Np change - still a very reliable and comfortable ride. Technology now not cutting edge- state of the art - 6 speed auto trans lacks efficiency compared to wife's  8 speed in her RX.

I currently have a 2015 GS 350. My 2014 ES 350 was coming off lease and was traded for a 2016 ES 350 Luxury with 18 wheels. I looked at several other brands this time, but kept coming back to Lexus as the lease deals are hard to beat in this segment. I was very surprised how much better the '16 is verses the '14. The 2014 ES 350 was ok, but had several downfalls. The ride was just ok, bumps got through. I hated the wood steering wheel, among a few other things. That car was sort of a marsh mellow. Mushy steering, handling, seating etc.  The 2016 has greatly improved these things. The seats are better, being slightly firmer with good support for long drives. The steering is more direct. There is definitely more sound deadening in this new one. The ride is much better, with much improved absorption of bumps. I'm not going to debate the spindle grill, thats personal taste. It does blend in well on this design, unlike some other Lexus vehicles where the spindle protrudes. I recently completed a 7 hour drive, and my hands didn't hurt with the new steering wheel design. It is much more padded than the old one. I thought I would never used radar cruise, but it worked flawlessly on a long trip. This is primarily my wife's car, and she really likes it. I feel its a big improvement over the previous ES. The dealership experience was great as well. Is it perfect? No, but neither is any car out there. What could be better? Start with Lexus Enform. Ridiculous amount of steps to remote start the car. Apps are useless, better just to have the passenger use their smart phone. There are still some hard plastics in the interior, such as on the door panels, and where the driver's right leg hit the center console. Is it a GS 350? No way, but that car is more expensive. The ES has a very large rear seat, uses regular fuel, and is priced very well in this segment. Overall, I am very satisfied with this car. I am very happy that there has been refinements over the previous one.",5

Now, after several years, I am finally prepared to purchase a car that will last me for the next 10-12 years. Overall, I was very pleased with the 2016 es350 Ultra Luxury Sedan, and would have ""plugged the trigger"" and made the purchase. However, due to the terribly designed headrest in this car, I will sadly have to pass. What a shame! The car is everything I need and want. Unfortunately, there really is no way for me to be comfortable while driving. I tend to sit fairly erect when I drive, and the headrest makes me very uncomfortable. I am 6'0. Now, I am considering my other choice, 2016 Toyota Avalon Limited. Of course, it will lack several ""luxury touches"", but the headrest is not as intrusive as the es350. I wish Lexus would make an adjustable headrest that you could adjust an inch or two backwards. I know this is for safety, but I feel certain that I am not the only person that feels this way.",4

The white color (eminent pearl white) I chose does bring some challenge in the days after a snow. The fact that this is a nice and new car make the dirty mud on the car less bearable.,4
2754, on 01/26/16 17:51 PM (PST),Jin ,2016 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Good But not the best," Been driving about a month now. Changing from Audi A6 07 model, ES gives me more comfort and convenience yet I can't give it five stars since it has a bit unsturdy lower body in the highway driving. Also it has lot of IT stuffs, mobile connections etc. However the User interface is not really user friendly. For instance, it's hard to control the navigation. There's no Navi button anywhere in the panel. In order to go to Nav, at lease two or three steps you need to use fake mouse that ES provides. And its map is really crappy. Voice recognition needs a lot of improvement compared to other German cars.  The default speakers are acceptable, but some AM radio stations (although it has HD radio option) sound almost inaudible.  The manually folding side mirrors are design fault in the big sized car like ES.Its gas tank is such small that allows to go upto 350 miles with full tank. I know I sound a bit harsh but these are my impression of 2016 ES350.",4

The seats are hard, road noise inside is bad and I am very dissatisfied with its over all ride and comfort, and road noise. Mine rides just a tad above my husbands 2015 Dodge truck. I don't know what happened to the quality but I am very unhappy with my new 2016 Lexus es350. I did not test drive it and that was a big mistake. However, I did not test drive my 2011 or 2005 and I am m not sure a simple test drive would  have been enough to tell me how uncomfortable this 2016 was going to be. I trusted since I was buying a high end car like the lexus it would be of a quality I had known before. I am looking for a 2012 or earlier used lexus and will sell this one. I just hate that Lexus has fallen into the cheap car routine. Why not have leather seats?? I don't want a sports car I want a car that is comfortable. Very displeased with this new car would not recommend unless a person wants an sports rcar.",3
2756, on 01/04/16 21:41 PM (PST),Lee ,2016 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Redesigned 2016 Lexus ES 350 Luxury Package," This is my 6th Lexus. Previously owned GS, 3 Rx models over the years and currently have an IS 250 that my wife drives. I was in the market for a new car and seriously considered other luxury models including the new C300 Mercedes, BMW 5 series, Cadillac CTS even toyed with the idea of the Porche Macan. I thought after many years of Lexus maybe I wanted a fresh change. After viewing, researching, and pricing the different models with options and overall editor and customer reviews Lexus was still #1 in reliability and value. I had driven the 2015 ES 350 when my RX was in for service and was impressed with the comfort and handling. When the 2016 came out I truly loved the redesign with the new front end and rear end. I test drove it with the 18"" wheels and was very impressed. Quick, smooth, quiet, comfortable,  and a truly upscale luxury interior. Before I made my decision I decided to wait and test drive the new 2016 RX when it hit the market. For me the 2016 ES 350 just handled beautifully and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I have the luxury package which includes the new leather seat design with double stitching, 18"" wheels, and the one touch power trunk. This is a wonderful luxury car and a great value.",5
2757, on 01/04/16 16:32 PM (PST),Brandon ,2016 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Important read if shopping or analyzing reviews...," I have a 2016 ES ultra luxury, and have had a 2008 in the past.  The ES is a terrific car for real world use, it will out-handle what most will ever throw at it.  It's not a car for a track..but neither really is a C class or 3 or 5 series BMW that I've owned, and they were in no way as serene nor exciting (except when the warranty runs out, or you deal with condescending service departments).  The Lexus ES is as luxurious and reliable as you can find anywhere close to it's price range, has a unique 'feel' of quality and thoughtfulness that can't be checked off on a checklist when shopping, you have to own it to notice it.  Is it sporty?  No.  There's not much luxurious about 'feeling the road' unless you're on a track or rare weekend journey, and for that, you can get a real sports car.  If you want a sportier 'edge' in a sedan, the GS is very nice and still solid.   When shopping for the ES, know that with it being quiet, it's very noticeable which wheels and tires you get.  They come with either Michelin or Bridgestone from factory, the particular Michelin they use is rated as top 3 by tirerack.com, the Bridgstone dead last.  You can tell when you drive it, and from some reviews who say it's not the car they expected, they always photo Bridgestones on larger rims...which you also may want to avoid.  The 17"" wheels for 2016 look great, but if you get ultra luxury, you have to swap out the 18"".  I know..an inch less, but test drive for yourself, the 17"", and on a Michelin (Not Bridgestone) tire is what you'd like.  in 2016 they also updated suspension and added more sound deadening.  It's noticeable if you drive it back to back with a prior year.  It's 80% of the top of the line Lexus LS, for almost half the price.    It's a hard model to ignore, unless you're trying to impress people who insist that luxury must be sporty and rough edged.",5

That car was great too but it was a little small for a family. Plus the reliability scared me every time I got in it. Not this Lexus though. This is a family car! I never worry about if something expensive is going to break or going into limp mode ""bmw"". I am 35 years old and I always thought I will look like an old man in this car. You know what this car makes you mature and look established. The led headlights are bright and show the road well. The navigation still looks like my 2008 Toyota Camry navigation though. I really wish Toyota would update their nav systems. The seats are la z boy comfortable. I am ready for a road trip. Standard stereo is more than enough. More than enough acceleration and very serine interior. I definitely would buy this over any other brand. Bmw drives nice but costs way too much. Acura is boring, Mercedes is over rated and Audi is in trouble. Buy a Lexus!Update: After owning the car for about 6 months. I decided to go back to my bmw 328i 2016. I miss the road handling characteristics of the car. The lexus was nice don't get me wrong. Two weeks after buying the lexus the presidential collision system went out on the vehicle. They kept it for a few days because they couldn't figure out what was wrong. So they finally fixed it and wanted to keep the car longer and do research on it! Um thats ok give me my car please. Got a crack in the windshield that was a nightmare because lexus needed to recalibrate the lane departure warning also. And then after five months of ownership lexus recalled the brakes saying the vehicle can become uncontrollable. OK I was done then. My first bmw I owned for a year never had a recall or any problems. But lexus is supposed to be the most reliable. So I'm back with bmw. I just couldn't get past the problems and the lack of technology of the lexus. I do miss the size and the price of filling the tank though. The paint is better quality on the Lexus also. Everyone says if you want a good ES then get a 2010-2012 model. 2013 and up is when they started to cut costs.",5

The leather on the seats start to break down very quickly, I tried to get Lexus to do something about it but they said it was it not worn enough to warrant being replaced.  The cheap plastic they used on the doors around window controls started to peel and looked really cheesy but Lexus did replace those with some nice chrome plated inserts, good for them.

In fact, I have been buying and driving Lexus for more then 20 years and I have bought each one from the same dealership and salesperson! This 2014 ES has tons more features than my first one in 1994, yet really has not increased that much in price, compared to other inflated items. You get a lot more car for a little more money.You just cannot beat Lexus when it comes to quality of workmanship and support. Japanese reliability is second-to-none. The dealer network is unbeatable. I only have a couple of ""complaints"", the seats are just not comfortable for extended periods. Also, bring back radio buttons! The menu system may be ""cool"" but is clumsy and unnecessary.Now that we have owned and driven the 2014 for 18 months, my opinion of the ES has not changed too much. We did suffer a rear-end collision and I have learned that the Starfire Pearl (077) white paint is nearly impossible to match. Our rear bumper had to be replaced and we had to have it re-painted three times to get close to the factory paint. My only complaint with the car continues to be the frustration with the radio control. It is way too complicated. But, the car has an incredible ride and is buttery smooth and quiet. My best friend has a 2016 Camry and the difference between the two cars is substantial. The Lexus is a MUCH more refined vehicle.",5

I liked the '07' version better but this one does have many things I like.  This one is pretty much loaded. The blind spot / cross traffic alert is great but a lot of vehicles have that now.  I like streaming the music from my smartphone.  Acceleration is very good but sometimes sluggish from the start.    The window design is ridiculous.  They slope into the car a fair amount so when it rains, water will drip on your arm, leg and seat when you open the door. There is no 'wow' factor in this car.There is just way to much wind and road noise.

Six months ago we leased a 2014 Lexus ES 350 and find it every bit as luxurious as the Cadillac and exceedingly superior in other areas such as fuel economy, useable trunk space, interior legroom in back seat, and overall value. The dealer, Lexus of the Palm Beaches , added to the enjoyment by not wasting my time and offering a fair deal in the first place with no hidden costs. This continued when I purchased an extended warrantee for a different make of car from the finance dept. of Lexus and once again received a great value with no wasted time.  I traded that Lexus in on a 2017 and Lexus of the Palm Beaches went out of their way to treat me right. We are equally happy with our new car!!!",5

I negotiated a great deal on a close out, brand new 2014. I quickly became very disappointed with the comfort and ride of this car. You would think a Lexus would be the pinnacle of comfort but not this car. They did a model change in 2013 and made the car ""sporty"". Now you feel every bump & crack and hear a lot of tire noise on the highway. I feel fatigued after driving it.

2799, on 11/08/14 13:38 PM (PST),mentin ,2014 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),"Not a car, badly integrated collection of features"," My wife moved from Infiniti G20 to Lexus ES 350. The new car is definitely an upgrade in most dimensions, and adds a lot of features. But G20 felt like a well designed car that does everything exactly as you want it to do, the ES 350 feels like a poorly integrated list of features - kind of the way (bad) software was done and advertised in nineties. We have feature A and checkbox B and support C - except trying to use A, B or C drives you mad.* E.g.: when the rest of the car moved from daylight saving time, the navigation is still on summer time. So it would show correct current time, but the estimated time of arrival is 1 hour off.* The navigation is horrible and voice command is exercise of despair. It is not even able to find its own nearest dealership.* The radio has satellite and everything, but feels intentionally designed to make listening to plain old FM stations as inconvenient as possible, forcing you to buy sattelite subscription.* The driver seat has memory, but if I get into car when the seat is still in my wife's settings and start car, ES 350 does the following: moves seat forward and makes the back more vertical, simultaneously trying to hit my head to the roof and press my chest against steering wheel. Only after doing this, it moves back-and-down simultaneously - away from the roof and steering wheel. But why did it have to almost kill me first?* The car constantly beeps whenever it finds something it does not like. Like leaving sunroof slightly raised (not open) on a sunny day. Or opening doors in wrong order. Or anything. If you have a sleeping baby in the car - it is impossible to leave the car without waking up the baby.* There is radar cruise control that keeps the distance to the car in front. Works perfect on the long stretch of straight highway. But when you are in the mountains and the road turns - (1) everybody slows down, (2) the radar loses the car in front due to road curve, and thinks it has clear road ahead, (3) car starts accelerating! Right when you are doing the sharp turn! Could they use the signal from the steering wheel to understand it is not a great time to accelerate? They could, but they probably just slapped a feature (radar) designed by third party, and did not integrate it with the other stuff.* This radar is also supposed to stop the car in case of potential frontal collision, but the government data shows it is not efficient at all there. Seems like a problem with many cars, but some (e.g. Honda) do much better. There is also active recall for radar causing breaking in some very rare scenario.There are tons of features in this car, but when you actually start using them, you find out they are garbage, done without real thought about the usability and comfort.On the other hand, the car drives OK. It is a reasonable compromise between comfort and drivability, great traction control. I think if they spent just a bit money on usability engineering and making sure their features actually work well, rather than spend all the money on stuffing as many features as possible - it could be a great car.",3

I have owed five of these cars and this one does not meet previous expectations. It drives like an Rav4. The road performance could be better. The ride is not as soft and cushiony as previous cars. You will feel every bump on back roads and roads that are not perfectly paved. For that reason, I am disappointed. Overall it is quiet and has plenty of power, although there is a slight delay. Remember this is not the inline six as before. My guess is, the IS engineers got ahold of this car instead of the LS engineers and did it their way.Finally gave up on the cars ride. I tried the 2017 but it drove the same. I then drove a Buick lacrosse. The Buick drives just like the old ES350 did. I bought it and don't think I will go back to Lexus.",4

I mean hard and narrow and I 'm not that big. The ride was ok but not that firm quality experience one would expect from this car. My neighbors new IMPALA was fantastic in comparison.

The second try they had the Lexus rep/engineer from Atlanta look and he replaced one of the engine mounts. It was improved but still not right. Now at 4k miles the vibration and sound is getting worse. The service Mgr rode with me and called The Lexus rep in Atl who said it was normal. BEWARE test drive any ES and watch for the shake and noise. Do not buy the Lexus. I hate my Lexus and will be out of it as soon as I'm not upside down.

For the price, the degree of luxury and smooth, quiet ride really makes road trips a pleasure, and there's lots and lots of space for passengers and cargo.  The big positive surprise is the gas mileage!  We are now averaging 31 MPG on the highway, and about 23 mpg overall. No doubt this is improved by 1 or 2 mpg simply because of the excellent variety of displays, which make you aware of the mpg you are getting.  The trade-off is disappointing handling.  There is plenty of pickup and stopping power for us, but the steering and lateral feel are average at best, and visibility is average minus.",4.375

First being the destination cannot be changed while driving unless you pull over or call the enform service that will COST you $250 bucks after the first year. Second is the audio. Lexus says for safety reasons you are blocked out of scrolling for artist on the IPOD, USB and CDs. However can you can scroll tracks, select from over 200 satellite channels and have full use of a Blue tooth capable portable player. What's that all about? It should be all or nothing.

My first two Lexus' each got 200K+ miles neither one of which EVER needed repair other than maintenance.  HOWEVER, my latest, 2013, ES350, has been a major disappointment for me.  The ride is so noisy, a normal conversation is difficult.  This is due to the 18"" low profile tires.  And, I understand that I cannot, without replacing the rims, change tire size for a higher profile tire.  I may as well purchase a new car, if I was inclined to buy another Lexus, if I choose to buy 17"" rims.  One cannot control the climate without concentrating totally on the screen (accident waiting to happen); blind spots are huge.  The 45 degree outlook on the driver's side is nearly useless (unless one want to totally rely on the BSM (blind spot monitor which helps NOTHING, if one is trying to enter traffic at one's 45o angle); another accident waiting to happen.  There is no monitoring of traffic over the driver's left shoulder due to blind spot.  Opening and closing the trunk is a real pain when one's hands are full.

2861, on 12/07/16 14:14 PM (PST),Steve ,2013 Lexus ES 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 6A),My Lexus Experience," In March 2013, I purchased a new ES350 from Sewell Lexus.  My reason for choosing this car is that I typically drive my cars for 8-10 years, and the utmost priority for me is reliability.  I was assured by Sewell’s salesman, Maury Erbay, that I was buying the most reliable car on the road.  He told me about a rare circumstance with another buyer who was unsatisfied with the maintenance history of his/her Lexus and how Sewell made it right.6,569 miles, August 2013Upon leaving the car at the airport for 4 days, the car was dead.  Roadside assistance came to jump the car, and I drove the car to Sewell.  It was Sewell’s opinion that nothing was wrong with the car.15,442 miles, March 2014 Upon leaving the car at the airport for 5 days, the car was dead.  A co-worker who had been traveling with me jumped my car.22,101 miles, September 2014Upon leaving the car at the airport for 4 days, the car was dead.  A co-worker who had been traveling with me jumped my car.27,452 miles, December 2014Upon leaving the car at the airport for 5 days, the car was dead.  A co-worker who had been traveling with me jumped my car.31,000 miles, March 2015I am a conservative driver and not a “hot rodder”.  After 31,000, my tires needed replacing.  Based on the price of the car, it was rather shocking to learn that it was sold with tires that would be shot at 31,000 miles.33,808 miles, June 2015Upon leaving the car at the airport for 4 days, the car was dead.  Roadside assistance came to jump the car, and I drove the car to Sewell (exasperated by the complete unreliability of this car).  I was told that Lexus has “just learned” of a problem with the Gateway ECU, and mine was replaced.  The service representative told me that I had not been notified of the fix because it had “just been discovered, in fact subsequent to my last oil change at 30,000 miles”.  I did some research on the internet and found that Lexus had identified the problem for other owners in 2014.  I asked myself many times why there wasn’t a recall for this issue, but it appears that fixing an issue that causes its customers to be stranded isn’t a priority for Lexus.  It is inconceivable to me that Sewell prides itself on service, yet they were aware of this problem and did nothing to fix it until I had been stranded again and brought the car to Sewell.  Because of the multiple unnecessary drains on my battery, I insisted that the battery be replaced.  Sewell resisted and finally agreed to the replacement only after a lengthy argument.45,828 miles, April 2016The car’s locking system failed, and the driver’s door actuator was replaced under warranty.50,000 miles, July 2016Warranty expires 50,200 miles, July 2016Back seat begins to squeak loudly when no passengers are riding in the seat.50,756 miles, August 2016Air conditioning fails.  Lights illuminate, but no sound from air conditioner is present, and no air came from the vents.  As a courtesy, Sewell picked up the car but found nothing wrong with the air conditioner as it started for them.  However, the fan was noisy and needed a new bearing which was replaced at no charge.52,900 miles, November 2016The car’s locking system fails again, and the passenger’s door actuator was replaced at my cost ($500 parts and labor).  By now, it appears that the other two doors are likely to fail soon as the quality of the actuators in the Lexus ES 350 is poor.53,400 miles, December 2016A dull thumping noise quickly progresses from infrequent to extreme.  While it sounds as if it is a suspension issue, the real issue is the sunroof rattling.  This repair is projected to be a 3-4 hour repair job and is not covered under warranty.As is clear from the above, the car has been a maintenance nightmare.  The reliability factor that was conveyed to me at the time of purchase has been completely non-existent.  Never in my years of car ownership have I been stranded (and stranded multiple times) by any vehicle other than a Lexus.  It appears that the maintenance issues are becoming more frequent.  (One has to wonder when the last two door actuators will fail when two already have.)Upon discovery of the 52,900 mile problem, an email was sent to Sewell’s business manager (Cecily McClarin), Sewell’s service manager (Mason Kessner), and Sewell’s general manager (Dudley Haralson) expressing my level of unhappiness with the car and its track record of poor reliability.  Based on the Sewell promise Maury made at the time of purchase of the car, I expected to hear from upper-level management at Sewell.  Instead, I heard nothing from anyone.I am prematurely near the end of my Lexus journey (due to poor service and poor reliability) and am close to making a decision about which car I plan to buy next (clearly, not a Lexus).  No one from Lexus demonstrated any effort to retain me as a customer by offering a trade on another Lexus at a discount in an effort to win me back. I leave as an unhappy customer determined to share my Lex",1

What a mistake.  This is the most cramped (you don’t feel it on a test drive), poorly laid out, underengineered and underwhelming piece of overpriced crap I’ve ever been in.  It is longer than the GS and has way less interior room and visability is hysterical.  Steering feels like docking a boat.  The transmission is a joke and spends much of the day seeing how many gear changes it can make per mile.  how they get so little torque and horsepower out if a V6 had to take some effort to accomplish.

This car is roomy in the front and back.  I test drove the Acrua TL and the Volvo S60, but neither was as exciting as my ES350.  The fall back is that some of the amenities look and feel cheap especially the trunk handles.  You only get two keys.

We had a horrendous winter and I drove with hardly a worry once I saw how this magificent vehicle handled in the snow and ice.  Traction and stability are exceptional.  My only complaint is the heater didn't keep my feet warm on my hour drive to work - but, to be fair, it was in the below zero range.  A very luxurious car!  Gas mileage is very consistent at 20.5 mpg for both highway and city.  I just wish I could get it up to 23mpg.

So I asked about a similarly priced used SUV.  That's how I got the Lexus RX300 and it has a better warranty than the new RAV4  would.  I do miss the sporty ride of the RAV4 5 speed, and center console of the RX300 is unduly complicated.  My coffee mug and water bottle tend to tip in the cupholders.

My RX is based on the Toyota Highlander and drives like one.  The ride is smooth but a bit ""trucky"" on back roads with bumps.  The turning radius is wide compared to most cars.  The transmission is a 4 speed which is outdated by today's standards.  At 6'2"" I could use a little more front leg room - wish the seat had more travel (a body shop could fix this for a few hundred dollars).  This is a very good car with a lot of features and I would buy it again.  Compared to our 6 year newer Rogue, the RX is not competitive as far as handling, gas mileage, and suspension refinement.  The car does exude quality though and even the under carriage is really clean for a 13 year old car.  No evidence of body rust or rusted out brake lines like a friend's Chevy truck.    Toyota/Honda/Nissan must use more alloys as none of my cars have issues with under body rust.  October 2016 and the Lexus is still bullet proof and all is well.  Just routine maintenance.  Traded the car as of April 2017.  Wanted something more nimble with better gas mileage.

The previous youthful driver had disrespected the car and it had many cosmetic and minor functional interior damages. I feel I was lucky to find such a reliable beautiful car way below market. The only draw back has been the cost of parts is higher than most cars but as a DYI person I was able to fix many of the problems at minimal cost. I have been very happy with this car as it has NOT required ANY other service except routine  maintenance in the 8 years I have owned it, saving me lots of heart ache and money.  After 19 years of use it runs smooth, quiet with no signs of age except the hood paint has failed and the leather on drivers seat has normal wear. Amazing quality. I will be purchasing a newer car soon and passing this beauty on to a another driver to appreciate quality at a low cost I expect they will get may more years of low cost enjoyment.  The only design flaws I do not like is that it has a poor turning radius, can not make tight turns, need to swing out for U turns and it has a rear blind spot.",5

The major problems I have experienced is replacing the knock sensors, and the check engine light will not go out. There are to many sensors on this vehicle so your check engine light will come back on once you have fixed the problem. other then that it is a nice vehicle to own.

3061, on 08/23/15 21:05 PM (PDT),Stan ,2000 Lexus RX 300 SUV 4dr SUV,Have driven it like a sports car for 17 years!," Bought it new in May '99. Since then have put 213,000 miles on it.  Have had a few repairs along the way. At 66K miles, I replaced the battery, otherwise the first major service (besides routine) was at 72K miles; a check engine light required  a $170 meter.  Had all the struts replaced at 96K miles. I switched to synthetic oil at 97K miles. At 100K, the engine dying while trying to start required a $270 IAC valve and a $265 something called ""Assy, Idle Spe.""  At 123K, needed new rear brakes. At 135K miles, spent $900, because it needed a new timing belt, all (3) engine drive belts, water pump and 3 light bulb (some of the bulbs can be replaced by anyone and a few are hard to access).  At 141K, had to replace the air fuel sensor replace battery at that time also). At 147K, a passenger side CV joint was noted to be damaged. At 166K, the right front door lock actuator was replaced. At 180K, another 90K service was done and  in addition an exhaust system gasket leak was repaired, a transmission pan gasket was leaking and replaced, and the power steering rack & pinion unit was leaking and was replaced (I spent over $2,000 dollars that day).  Again at 200K, a front right inner CV boot and the transmission pan gasket were leaking (these were fixed, both front CV boots were replaced). Replaced the air-fuel sensor again at 201K miles.  The high beams became inoperative requiring a surprising amount of diagnostic work-up; in the end it was just a bulb that was out. At some point, the radio antenna gear strip broke (antenna would not lower), but I found out how to repair that myself from the internet and it only cost about $25. Finally, about a week ago I ended up paying for a $1400 repair because the ignition switch locked up (requiring a ride back to civilization aboard a flat-bed wrecker). I would say the majority of my service is just tire rotations and oil changes. Every once and a while a sensor goes out (especially the air-fuel sensor),  A few gasket and CV leaks (but despite ruptured CV covers, the CV joints were fine).   If you were to see the vehicle, it appears new inside and out.I still like it.  For a sports utility vehicle, it is very quiet, smooth, handles well, has lots of storage and more than enough power.",5

The other vehicles around me were totaled per the state police. The vehicle is easy to drive and predictable to keep you out of   trouble.

Mine just went into limp mode due to bad knock sensors, and I just spent $685 for that. Parts were only $185, but it took ten hours of labor to change them. Drove it home, and when I parked it, it started idling at 2k rpm. Back to the shop it went! I've now been without my Lexus for two weeks. Fuel economy on my AWD model is terrible and it has very little power. It's comfortable and safe, but expect to spend ALOT on repairs.",2

Don't be fooled, the RX is a good 4 X 4. Held up through the tough winters in NC! Comfortable and will continue to buy Lexus/Toyota. Wouldn't be surprised if this car made it to 400,000 miles.

Unforunately at 100K miles the car had a steering column failure, the worst the dealer had ever seen. Car was unsafe to drive. Cost of repairs $1,700. Less than 12 months later at 112K miles the engine went.

However, the RX has been very unreliable and left us stranded on vacation two summers in a row. I purchased the vehicle with 48K miles and didn't expect any problems; however, that was short lived. Everything from electrical issues to fuel system issues has plagued the vehicle. In the last two years alone, the maintenance costs have exceeded $6K. I know, I must be an idiot for keeping it this long. The longer I try to keep the vehicle to receive a return for the maintenance costs, the more it burns my wallet.

RX3s can have some small known issues that can be fixed by a competent DIYer. Exhaust leak (have a friend with a welder?), O2 sensors (buy a $5 socket), clean the MAF (simple), spark plugs (a chore but not impossible), suspension noise (disassembling a strut is more than most ppl want to do on their own). Suggest changing the driveline fluids for insurance against trans issues. Consistent 19mpg which I think is fair- if you get less, have it checked out, or turn off 'power' mode! All in all, I think its a vehicle you can become familiar with & keep around for a long time. It's versatile, but not too big or obnoxious. My trusty daily driver.",4.625

It now has 150k miles and still runs like a champ.  Keeping the regular maintenance, I expect another 150k miles. Hope to give the car to my one year old daughter when she's of age.   It's extremely reliable in going up and down Stevens and Snoqualmie Passes in Washington. The AWD allows for great traction even in the most extreme cases, superb handling in inclement weather.    The car has needed a new starter, battery, and minor. Belts and plugs were changed at suggested intervals. No major repairs or maintenance.

Seat is worn from last owner pretty bad, drives great. Turning radius is fine. Gas could be better but oh well my last car was a Saturn. I had to tint the front windows to match the rest of the car and I dropped a couple of subwoofers in to juice up the radio. The deck was unchangable which kinda stinks.

It is the size of a sedan, just higher off the ground. One major design flaw which I understand has been fixed, if the rear windows are down but the front aren't, there is a horrible wind-suction noise. Other than that, it is a smooth, luxury ride. Very nice interior leather, comfortable seats and a nice car to drive around town and short distances. Wouldn't recommend for a long drive, particularly if you're stuck in the back seats.

Seats just as comfortable with just the right height and strong seat heaters. Good stereo/CD. Mileage ranges from 17-18 running errands to 23-24 on the flat highway. Great car for realtor/inspector and practical for bad weather, bad roads. Keep oil/trans fluids changed though. I switched to K&N filter and 0/30 Mobil-One oil and get 1-3 better MPG.

First - O2 sensors (TWO) at once, then electrical, which NO one but Lexus will touch and will probably run me thousands at 90 an hour. I suddenly had no control over heat, radio,  - anything on the console.  Now, as of today it is parked because of yet another problem.  Seems like horrible mix of gas - O2 sensors again???

After much debate about what kind of SUV to buy I can now say I made a great choice!  I was comparing it to the 4Runner and other comparable SUVs.  I was a litte hesitant about buying a Lexus because of the cost factor and I thought that it may be too much to maintain.  Since I bought it all I have done is a front brake job which I knew it needed when I bought it.  Of course at first I brought it to a Lexus dealer but after seeing their review and estimates I brought it to my local shop and they did the same work for a lot less.  I saved about $150 on the brake job with them.  I have been extremely satisfied with it so far!,4.75

Here is my view......POSITIVES......-  Looks nice, F-Sport adds to the sporty look,  quiet on highways and for sure will be extremely reliable having owned toyotas .   NEGATIVES -  Acceleration is bad, unless driven in Sports/Sports plus mode which kills the gas mileage.....no torque at low speeds and the transmission seems to get stuck in higher gears too long (kinda defeats the purpose of an 8-speed Tranny).  Seats are rock solid leather...no comfort at all.....Metallic Gas paddle/Brake look nice but very hard on feet ......handling is so-so, and harsh with the 19 inch wheels......No holder for sun-glasses (really ?  my toyota has it) ;  no visor extender to block sun (again, my toyota has it).....Complicated electronics....too many menus to go thru for simple tasks.....and the mouse like controller is a PAIN......bottom line - overpriced for what you get.....4-cyl acceleration with 6-cyl gas mileage.

I was somewhat dissatisfied with the first one because of the lack of sporty handling.  I had previously had an Infiniti M35, 2008 model with 20 inch wheels which handled magnificently.  The larger wheels and larger tires on the F sport and the sportier steering and suspension made huge difference for me.  I test drove a 2015 Audi A6 with 20 inch wheels and although acceleration was better, I found ride, even in comfort mode somewhat punishing.  And the Audi system was truly frightening and non intuitive.  To put on a radio station There were menus within menus within menu.   The motorized screen seemed hokey and trouble prone.   The GS motorized rear sunshade makes huge difference in heat of summer, much more than I expected.   The regular GS radio is great except for bass, I had to add a subwoofer to listen, the Mark Levinson system superb, significantly better than the ML system on the IS, which I also drove.  In sport plus mode very similar to IS, however in Normal mode the comfort of the GS is far superior.  I plan on keeping this car for a long time.  Could be better on gas mileage, but used turbo F sports were not available.   I have heard so many complaints about BMW reliability did not want to test drive one.  Next car will be electric.  Fine way to say goodbye to gasoline engine!!!  If you are thinking of a GS F sport I don’t think you will be sorry.",5

The car we chose had only 2000 miles and we paid $16,000 less than a 2016 comparably equipped,  just because our vehicle was red. Apparently, people still believe the urban myth that red cars get more tickets, so Park Place was making a deal to move it. This GS is smoother, faster, quieter, and more comfortable than my BMW 330i was. The 6 year unlimited miles warranty on certified Lexus is unbeatable.

With the F-sport package's 18-way seats to hold you in place, accompanied with bigger brakes, adjustable dampers, and aggressive throttle mapping, ""sport +"" makes this car feel smaller than it is when you're hustling along.  Basically what BMW used to be in its hey-day, Lexus has targeted with this car.It's back seat is a good size, though not as large as say, the current E-class Benz.  The mouse based entertainment system takes some getting used to, but works fine otherwise, and voice-command is vastly improved from earlier iterations.

As you know, Lexus only makes luxury vehicles so if you think a loaded Camry is the equivalent of, say, a Lexus EX 350, it’s not. I’ve driven them both. You can load a car up but it’s still essentially the same car with leather and some tech features. Lexus (Infinity, etc) are born and bred luxury cars. The GS 350 F Sport has the advantage of being both sporty and luxurious. I can't really speak to the mileage yet because it's so new. I'm getting about 17 mpg city.For those of us who’ve had sports cars, the GS 350 F Sport is a natural evolution. Additionally, the Lexus buying or leasing experience is superior. They are very fair and easy to work with. You don’t leave thinking you could have done better.These numerous benefits aside, I’m surprised at some of the features the car DOESN’T have. I traded in my 2013 Ford Fusion SE Hybrid because although it looked sporty and had luxury pretentions, such as leather seats, it was neither sporty (as in fast with good handling), or luxurious. What it did have that I will miss are:•	Blind spot warning in both side mirrors•	Rear parking sensors that beep as you get closer•	Touch screen radio with channel identifierThis last point may seem small but in real life it’s very nice. The Ford was a very uncomplicated system that would let you touch the station you want instead of scrolling through the channels. In addition, it would label each Serius station (Howard Stern, Highway, Lithium, Classic Vinyl, etc) instead of just giving the preset number, which requires you to memorize what station they represent. The sticker on the Lexus is $25,000 more than the Fusion. Lexus ought to rethink these things and give the driver everything a $57,000 car can offer. I suppose if you've never has these features you won't miss them, but they should be standard. **Update. Now that I've had the car a year and half, I still think it's a very nice car but, to be honest, if the Lexus (or any premium) name doesn't mean that much to you, you can get a very nice sedan with similar features for $20,000 less. I don't mean to be dismissive of this fine car, it's just a personal opinion. My next vehicle will likely be a Jeep.",4

The engine/transmission combo are perfectly suited for many styles of driving. The car is perfect at interstate speeds when traffic is moving quickly and lane changes come frequently. There is no turbo lag or ridiculous gear count to get in the way of the task at hand. The Fsport is sporty, the ride is a bit stiff on certain roads but what remedied this to nearly perfect was a tire change to Pirelli Cinturato P7 all season plus (factory Bridgestone Turanza EL400s were extremely stiff). The Mark Levinson sound system was a must for me and has sweetened and matured to one of my favorite car stereos (including several aftermarket). The seats are dreamy, the cabin is quiet but not has hush as an LS. This is my first time with the brand and having sampled mostly German cars and one other Japanese, I feel the initial build quality is up there with the best.",5

I was very satisfied with the two Cadillac STSs I drove, but after the STS was discontinued that model and I found the CTS small in comparison, I opted for the Lexus.  Another advantage is the Lexus dealer, compared to the nearby Cadillac dealer.  A more accurate depiction of the Cadillac dealer is a mid-service level Chevrolet dealer who also happens to sell Cadillacs.  The Chevy dealer team has a difficult time delivering a service experience consistent with a luxury vehicle purchase.1/6/'18 update - I've now driven the car 31 of the 36 months of the lease.  It may be the most trouble-free car I've had.  The quality, fit and finish and reliability have been excellent.  There are three minor points about the car I don't like, and their minor nature points to the quality of the car:  1) the three ""stops"" on the door hinges are at distances that often make it difficult to exit the car or easily reach the door to close it when seated in the car, 2) the turn signal lock does not operate conveniently and efficiently, and 3) the heights on the door armrest and the center console arm rest are not at the same height (the door armrest is too low) so on long trips the places where my elbows rest can be uncomfortable . . . clearly a first-world person's problem.I would characterize the dealer experience as an 85 on a 100 scale.  One of the service writers would get an A, two of the others would get a B.  Otherwise the dealer experience has been excellent - but to be fair remember I am comparing to a Chevrolet dealer who sells Cadillacs.Two sources tell me these cars may be discontinued, which would be a shame.  I will likely buy it out of the lease because of that, and because I like the styling better than the car they are selling now after the 2016 update.",5

Some issues: I have had to repair the exhaust system for pinhole leaks three times. The car is very hard on tires being AWD and a set of good tires only last about 20-30K miles until they have so much edge wear. They car does consume oil, I have to top it off every 1000 miles. It is also hard to get our toddler in and out of her child seat with a low roofline and the result is that the headliner has worn. Overall though I have been very pleased with the car.

The other surprise was when I bought the car I discovered soon that it would not sync with my treo 650.  Now had to trade my phone for a Motorola Q which works but is a poor substitute as a phone.

Not only are the electronics non-intuitive (example, Nav functions are under 3 different top level buttons) but some bureacrat or lawyer in Lexus decided to eliminate most of the functions while the car is moving.

Lexus audio is awesome (Mark Levinson would be nice to show off!). The middle seat in the rear is a little high and uncomfortable.

It may lack a few seconds on the 0-60 time at 5.7 seconds compared to some of its German competitors, but makes up for that with the luxury features and overall quality expected from a Lexus. The F-Sport package gives the vehicle a unique styling and sportier appearance compared to the regular trim level on the GS. Lexus is a brand well known for its reliability, comfort, and quietness and of course all factors are taken into account with the GS350, but the performance singles this vehicle out from the rest of the Lexus lineup. The GS350 is made for those who do not necessarily need to feel the road while driving but still would like great acceleration and handling. Lexus is stereotyped to older clientele, but as a 21 year old the F-sport styling swept me off my feet, but the ride is what sold me on the vehicle. The Triple-beam LED headlights are a must have feature when buying this vehicle and not only look high-end from a mile down the road, but give you unbelievable visibility.

I just bought the car and it is pretty noisy. The tires Dunlop Sport max 050 are very noisy tires. You can feel every bit of the road. It averages over 70 decibels and I get 73-75 decibels of road noise. That was a disappointing. Other than that it is great in all respects leave aside the navigation. Oh and no storage for bottles on the side or a compartment for your glasses. I like the car but not the road noise. Seems each Lexus comes with different tires. So check those tires and make sure you have Michelins if you want a quiet ride.After 7 months I feel the car is a bit underpowered on normal drive mode. Only on Sports mode does it feel sporty and powerful enough. My 10 year old Acura MDX feels more powerful and responsive.

Then, any notion of modesty slips off, the sports-mode turns up the heat in red, and you leave the ordinary playlist of luxury sports cars behind.  It eats Jaguars and Maseratis like so much breakfast cereals. It impales BMWs and Mercedes Benz of similar class like Count Vlad of of Transylvania. And it does so with minimalist effort, as though dropping off the kids uniforms at the cleaners.Nothing about this car speaks of its great style and handling better than owning one and driving and driving and driving.  The only drawback is that it is a beast in sheep's clothing. Never knew that gas could be consumed so quickly, by such a fuel efficient engine. But, test drive it. You'll see what I mean.",5

I have owned 5 Lexus but will never buy another one.  The Nav system is still defective and Lexus/Toyota has had 3 updates and still doesn't work correctly.  My main issue is the management (or lack of) in Torrance and Irvine,CA.  They don't respond to certified letters or calls to their 800#.  I should have sued them.  My 2 portable Garmin gps units work perfectly but Lexus/Toyota doesn't.  I even used my Garmin in the dealers car and his didn't work but my Garmin worked perfectly.  I also note that Lexus/Toyota is finally starting to recall cars with defective air bags - can't wait to see when this car is recalled.My last years review still stands: January 2017   I have written certified letters to the US Torrance HQ (VP Bracken) as well as their Western Region office (Irvine) and have never received a response. they just ignore me and the issue. Both the Riverside Dealership and the Newport dealership cannot fix the nav system.  Lexus 800 # useless. Lexus  won't even consider refunding the extra monies I paid for the nav system.I this is my 5th and very last Lexus/Toyota - car is OK but the US management is not honest and non-responsive. I plan to contact Akio Toyoda in Japan just to let him know about his US management.  The car most likely has a Takeda airbag, but Lexus won't admit or disclose.Navigation system goes to dead end road and says home is 0.2miles away. Car has latest micro SD card but both my car and dealership car with latest chip go to dead end road.  It took 6 weeks for dealer action after many multiple emails and phone calls. Lexus 800# is useless.  They just refer you back to dealership. Lexus suggests waiting till next card update, maybe Oct 2016 (I don't believe it will work) so they want me to live with this defective system for 6 months before a ""maybe fix"". While in the dealership car, I used my Garmin GPS simultaneously and it worked perfectly while the dealership car failed every time. Found out Lexus uses Denso electronics and Tom Tom for Navigation data. Tom Tom is Netherlands company and reports show lots of USA mapping issues. According to JD Powers  their system accounts for 20% of customer complaints.As of 7/18/2016 Lexus has not responded. I also noted that the nav micro SD card is date 8/1/2015 which will be 1 year old  in 2 weeks. So either Lexus sold me a 2015 car based on their own published literature at lexusnavigation.com (note GEN 8) for 2015 cars GS350 dated 8/1/2015 or they are using old parts. Service Mgr. told me next Gen will probably come out Oct 2016.  I have waited almost 2 1/2 months for Lexus to do something; but now in a 4 week ""queue"" at their headquarters waiting for a response.  800# is useless and there is no customer service.  They just delay and hope you go away.",2

3424, on 02/16/16 21:50 PM (PST),Dan ,2014 Lexus GS 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),F Sport Love," I recently purchased a 2014 CPO Lexus GS350 F Sport AWD. I wanted an AWD car that was supremely comfortable, reasonably quick, fair on gas, fun to drive and unique. The GS is all that and more. Having owned previous luxury marques such as Acura, Infiniti and a Lexus ES I didn't even bother cross shopping the Cadillac CTS, BMW 5 series, the Audi A6 or the Mercedes E350. Although fine automobiles in their own right my #1 criteria when shopping for any vehicle is reliability and low cost of ownership....and they fall short in that category. That is why I own a Toyota Tundra and not a Ford F150 or a Chevy Silverado, and also a Honda Civic and not a Ford Focus or Dodge Dart.The GS is undoubtedly the nicest vehicle I have ever owned. The 2014 has the toned down spindle grill (compared to the 2016 and other new Lexus'), a high quality interior, great handling and the most comfortable seats I have ever had in a car. The engine is quick to respond, the shifts are crisp without being jarring and the suspension offers great handling while providing a comfortable ride. The steering is fairly precise but a little on the heavy side. There is a sound enhancer under the hood that sends a sweet melody into the cabin when you nail the accelerator. Reminds me of a V8. The Lexus premium audio system is superb. It sounds as good or better than the Mark Levinson system that was in our ES and much better than Acura's ELS or Infiniti's Bose. The huge infotainment screen is top notch as are the gauge readouts. Some have complained about the mouse-like controller for all the functions  but after a few minutes of getting familiar I find it quite intuitive. Gas mileage is decent at around 27 hwy / 21 city. Our previous car was a 2014 Accord Touring Hybrid. Loved the 45mpg when gas was $4 a gallon but at today's prices 27mpg is not an issue.I do have a couple complaints with the car, although minor. The first is the road noise from the tires. I can't for the life of me figure out why Lexus builds such an outstanding car and then put on those sorry Bridgestone Turanza EL400s. The entire Potenza/Turanza line of tires are horrible. Doing a little research I have found that the cure for these noisy, hard riding tires are the PIRELLI CINTURATO P7 ALL SEASON PLUS tires. The reviews for these tires are off the charts for any sports sedan. Even better than the much lauded Michelins. I can't wait for these tires to wear out so I can order a set of the Pirellis. The other complaint I have is with the apparent thin paint. My car is Obsidian black and being a CPO Lexus they repaired all the stone chips before selling the car. At only 19,000 miles when I purchased it there are at least 8-10 small repairs on the hood. My Tundra is a silver 2010 with 70k miles and has maybe 3 chips. My '05 Civic has 4 or 5. I owned an Obsidian black Infiniti for 50k miles and it had maybe 3 or 4. I test drove and bought the Lexus on a rainy day so I didn't actually notice the chip repairs until it's first hand washing. Being somewhat OCD about my cars I was a little upset. I hope the repairs were the result of an over zealous paint technician trying to cover up every slight imperfection and not an indication that there is an ongoing problem with the paint. Only time will tell.Besides those 2 complaints I love this car. We are planning a 3 week tour of the western states and can't imagine a better vehicle to take on vacation and enjoy the driving experience at the same time.Other than those 2 minor complaints I am certain this car will provide years of satisfied driving.Update 8/16/2016Although I have only driven the car about 3,000 miles in the last 8 months we are leaving for Florida soon and will quickly add 2,500 miles. So far the car has been great. I have found that the comfortable 16 way driver's seat becomes a little uncomfortable after a couple hours of seat time. There are no lateral springs on the bottom cushion, just a layer of foam in a steel pan. I purchased a thin memory foam pad that I use on long trips. I was able to repair all stone chips with a razor blade to shave off all the high points. I then used a Porter Cable DA polisher to remove all the car wash scratches that came with the car. It is standing tall and I love driving it. I can't imagine a better road car than the Lexus GS 350. It's the perfect blend of luxury, comfort and performance. My one suggestion is not to buy new. Even though it's a Lexus the depreciation is pretty bad the first 2 years. Either buy a Certified pre owned or if you have to have new, lease.Update 2/17/17Still an awesome car with tremendous depreciation. MSRP in Aug. 2014: $59,850, CPO price when I bought in Dec. 2015, 19k miles: $39,900 +tax., today's trade value with 26,000 miles: $26-$29k. Daggone! I guess I should have waited and bought it @ 3 years old ...lol! Research by me has revealed that the GS depreciates more rapidly than all other Lexus models.Update 2/21/18 - Sold the car.",5
3425, on 04/20/15 20:00 PM (PDT),renaissance1 ,2014 Lexus GS 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Excellent ride!," This car is amazing. I test drove BMW, Mercedes, and Cadillac. My second favorite was the Cadillac CTS. However, while those cars had great strengths, they were also burdened by heavy weaknesses. The Lexus GS 350, on the other hand, is the total package. The infotainment system takes some getting used to, but that's about the only weakness. The car handles great, has a smooth, powerful engine, and is quiet at speed. I like the styling, but of course, that's highly subjective. It has a wonderful interior with all of the features one could desire. If you're shopping in this category, the GS deserves a strong look. Update: I've had the car for two years.  I'm still loving it.  I have no complaints and have had no problems with it.",5

This car runs smooth, it feels like luxury when you drive it.  The exterior looks sporty, it accelerates quickly, the brakes work perfect especially the way I brake I am a woman driver. LOL The only thing i would improve upon is the electronics.  The sound quality for the stereo is lame and the radio looks cheap.  I love the larger navigation screen but it takes a few times to get used to the mouse. Enform is great",3.875
3427, on 12/18/13 21:37 PM (PST),techtroop ,2014 Lexus GS 350 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Great Chassis Terrible electronics," Leased this car after Hyundai Genesis as I wanted a more engaging chassis & I certainly got strong capable handling.  Ride, handling power mostly very satisfactory.  On the drive-line I would caution that the engine drives like a 4 cylinder in many ways. Acceleration is a function of waiting for 1-2 downshifts all the time as the torgue is limited. Standing start acceleration is impressive but is not that easily accessible while driving without 2 downshift and the transmission is sluggish on downloads leading to some frustration and then over-reaction by the car.I HATE the terrible 1990 technology in the dash and much worse than the Hyundai. iPod integration, NAV performance and route management, radio presets are so poorly done on the Lexus that it limits their value. Most everything is many extra clicks to do anything and then still works badly. Steering wheel controls poor. Phone integration is very poor with address book sync meaning phone numbers only so business contact list with addresses do not show up in the NAV.  (Address book entries must be done manually) Voice recognition is no better than cars from 2000. Nav system reports no such address on a number of occasions and then my Android phone takes me right there.  I then click with the Lexus NAV at the address I've now arrived at and it reports the correct address it just won't navigate to it!There are many odd design choices like the car beeps when you get out if the headlights are on and set to auto or the sun-roof is in vent position. Older iPod shows up as USB & then says no songs so I had to buy a new iPod.  Front seat drink holder block controls, or silly joystick takes up much of center console, or small hard to use glove box that can break items as you close the door.  Sun roof is noisy and has no smart controls like Genesis did, so in vent position to open you must close vent with one control and the switch to 2nd sun roof control to open but no click detents so you have to hold the control for 3-4 seconds vs a click like the door windows have for auto-open etc.  Nothing horrible, just older kludgy designs in many places compared to other car companies.Great driving car, but you won't get much value out of the technology. Look carefully at drive line behavior, partial throttle downshifts etc, and NAV system / how the radio works.After 39k Pure city mileage is about 17, mixed about 19, pure freeway 25-30, does not seem to matter how I drive super gentle or brisk...Update at 44k, about the same. Summer tires lasted an amazing 45k so alignment is easy on tire wear.  Still biggest day to day issue is drive line works too much like a 4 cylinder engine and since the transmission does not like down-shifting moving through traffic requires planning much like an old turbo design, no power for a while. Car really doesn't need eight gears and this motor. Since car is not agile or happy on a really tight mountain road and is more of a GT type sports car, thus better to have a motor with good torque and six gears especially since gas mileage is on the low end.  Sun roof has developed a rattle in turbulence and front end a squeaks like an old Chevy needing a chassis lube but likely the dealer will fix these issues.",3

But I needed something bigger and with more features and this car is still awesome after two years. It's not as fun to drive as the IS but it's more of a laid back ride that has more features and makes you feel more important when driving it, ha ha. But the only things I would improve is the trunk space, speaker sound, and the passenger side wiper blade. Also I'd add the sunglass stowage back to this car. Why did they remove it? All in all I still love this car as I am just a big Lexus fan and I after two years of driving this car, I'm pretty happy with the choice I made to trade my IS in for the GS ",4.75

I came from a 2004 BMW 330xi that was a complete nightmare from beginning to end, so I was looking for a car that was not made in Europe. The GS is rocket fast, quiet, extremely luxurious, and has impeccable build quality. The only option I wish I had was the Levinson sound, but I must say, the 10-speaker factory audio is not too shabby at all. I am hoping this beautiful beast will be far more reliable than the joke/gouge-fest that is BMW.***UPDATE***I've put about 40,000 miles on this car, and I still love it.

Though it doesn't have the tight road feel of the German cars, it blows them away with the technology, rear camera, parktronic and nav. But, having said that the audio sound system is disappointing, We don't have the Mark Levenson system. Our sound system doesn't have the fullness or the sharpness of even the basic systems in the German cars I have had.

I was told they are in Summer Mode which is 1"" from the tip of the wiper to the bottom of the windshield glass on driver's side and 2"" etc. on the passenger side. Winter Mode keeps they UP EVEN HIGHER! Yet, in all photos of GS350 MODEL they either show it at angles that don't reveal this DESIGN FLAW or when you do see a photo clearly  displaying the hood and the entire front windshield you do NOT SEE THE WIPERS!

In fact, having previously owned two Audi’s, I thought my mind was made up.  After too much research, I was still intent on the A6 even though the GS 350 had risen on my radar. I recalled seeing the new 2013 GS at a car show and being blown away by the cockpit and that cool display, but that was about it.  I still wanted the German feel  and Audi engineering/design.   When I finally drove a loaded A6 30T Prestige I was a bit underwhelmed. I can’t explain why – it was beautiful and had lots of grunt off the line. Maybe my expectations were too high. My mind verified all the good things that I had read in reviews. But I was left feeling empty – and at that price point, I wanted to feel more - in my heart.  Then I test drove the GS. It immediately wowed me in comparison. Again, I could not explain why, but it felt better… it spoke to my mind and heart.  And oh, how that engine growl sang to me as the RPMs shot past 4,500 on the tach compared to the silence of the A6. So this sent me back to my research – exhaustive research – trying to quantify the differences so I could make my purchase with confidence. It was tough since I had such brand loyalty to Audi... and had been looking forward to getting back into one now that my kids were old enough not to trash it with spilled milk and gummy bears.  But I kept hesitating.  In the end, and after test driving another A6 I went with the GS 350. The deciding factors were clear… it was fun to drive, had impeccable build quality, was luxurious and sporty (lux package, thank you) and had a reputation for industry-leading reliability.  It was a few pennys cheaper too (in purchase price and cost of ownership)… And I figured that it would be a rather high mileage car when the time came to sell it, and would clearly be worth more than a high mileage German car thanks to that Lexus reliability.  Now that I have been driving it more, I can better quantify the differences over the A6 and why I love it so much.  It feels better as a driver’s car, tight and hunkered down…  it drives small... and being able to choose Sport + mode turns it into more of a speed-racer than this dad with a past could become bored of…  stomp on the gas and the sound is visceral. I’m a driver’s driver, but I also live in the real world spending most of my time commuting.  And I look forward to commuting with this car.  The GS is my sanctuary and elicits passion, not just in the way it drives, but in the way it surrounds you in sport AND luxury. The seats are the best I’ve ever experienced and this is one reason the A6 left me feeling unloved.  The A6 seats are flat and uninspired. The GS seats w/ the lux package hug me… literally.  The leather and slightly retro/slightly futuristic cockpit in black with linear espresso wood makes me feel ensconced. And the big display is just wow… The A6 felt a bit sterile compared to this car.  It lacked passion for me.  So in the end, I am reluctant, surprised and totally satisfied GS 350 owner.",5

I promise you that this car can handle everything and anything that you're going to want to do in the real world. Your bravery will run out and your consideration for not crossing from spirited to reckless driving will kick in well below the limits of the F-Sport. Great track day car? No. But I'm going to work a lot more often then going to the track. I just want to enjoy the hell out of the daily commute and dude, it just doesn't get any better in this price range.

Having said that, I have no reason whatsoever to want to drive any other type of car but a Lexus. I am a full time nursing student and commute at least 2 hours a day depending on clinical location, so comfort and fuel economy is at the top of my ""car"" priority list. This car meets all of my standards and then some. It is so smooth and comfortable, it almost drives itself. I also have a Challenger R/T so if I have a need to ""feel the road"" I drive it, but I choose to drive this car 95% of the time due to its comfort, excellent gas mileage (I consistently get 30 mpg highway or more, long trips I get around 33.9 avg) ease in driving, acceleration, and classy looks. I will try to break down some pro's and con's for those of you who are considering one.Pro's: Beautiful looks, plenty of leg room (my husband is 6'3"" and fits comfortably) well crafted interior, VERY comfortable ride, great acceleration, excellent gas mileage, decent technology (car is 9 years old!), CASSETTE player for those of us who grew up in the '80's and still have a few tapes, great exterior lighting for entry/exit of vehicle, high safety rating, sport mode, and many more pro's that I am probably forgetting. My favorite car before this one was a Nissan Maxima, and it does not hold a candle to this Lexus. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CAR to anyone who likes a soft, powerful ride and great gas mileage combined with good looks. Last but certainly not least, Lexus customer service is second to none. There was a recall on this model earlier this year. I went online to Lexus.com and scheduled the maintenance, easy - peasey. I took the car (that I did not buy from them) to Butler Lexus in Macon, GA for the servicing. Not only did they give me a brand new Lexus RX350 SUV to drive for two days, when I went to pick up my car, it was clean and full of premium gas- for FREE. I didn't pay a dime for the recall, the carwash/ vacuum, or the gas. Each time I have taken it in for servicing they always wash it and vacuum it, so yeah, I will be buying another Lexus.Con's: Not very many, but here are a few: Lacklustre sound system - however, I love rock and roll and like to crank it up, so this may not be an issue for you (Mine does not have the Mark Levinson), unreliable bluetooth (but at least it HAS bluetooth- it is almost 10 years old!) an annoying thing where the rear view mirrors tilt down in reverse and then won't go back to the preset position- you can turn this feature off but it is easily reactivated, so it gets annoying sometimes, NO TRUNK OR HOOD LIGHT!!!- why????, and a very common issue with these cars is a cold start rattling sound. I have heard this is a crank shaft pulley or something of the sort that costs around $1,600, so I will live with the noise for awhile. The lowbeam lights are ridiculously dim and you can barely see the road at night if it does not have prominent yellow markings. That great gas mileage I referred to comes at a ""premium""- the car requires premium fuel. This was not an issue for me; I always use premium, but for those of you who like to use 87 Octane, this might be an issue.That's about it. My car is an '06, Crystal White with tan interior, with 159,000 miles on it. I get MANY compliments on this car and people think it is much newer than it is. I love it and will almost certainly buy a newer version of it when I am finished with nursing school.I hope this helps!",5

Put in ~1000 miles driving around North Texas and a round trip from Fort Worth to Houston. For a 9 year old car, it's a beauty in and out. For 1K driving impressions, it's a great car! I will come back to update this review when the car passes the 100K mark. Had great luck with a 1999 GS300, still driving great at 260K without any issues. Normal maintenance [oil changes, tires, brakes] were all that are needed so I looked at the next generation and if it is as reliable like its older brother has been, the 06 GS300 would be a great value. It is better looking, drives better with more technology, hope it will last as long w/out issues",4.875

High performance tires wear out under 25k miles and will be pricey to replace. At 6 feet tall, it fits just right, but any taller and I'd be against the roof.  Trunk is spacious, but opening is small and trunk springs make it a struggle to close. Need a real trunk closer/opener. ",4.625

However, when we are going somewhere together I generally drive.  At 6'3"", I find the leg room in the driver's cabin to be sorely lacking.  Within a week of ownership it developed a rattle inside the dash that required disassembly, including removing the windshield.  Now, at 14000 miles the OEM Yokahamas are so noisy I will not drive/ride in the car until we replace the tires.  Lexus claims some tires become ""defective"" at low mileage; however, the tires are not warranted for noise.  ",3.875

I have one of the less common models that features a GPS system, which was rare in 2001. STILL WORKS, although getting an update can be tricky for such an old system. Performance is not super fast, but this car hugs the road. Body roll is nonexistent in this thing. Exterior appearance still turns heads. This body still is 20 years old, but its still striking.

Had to change starter twice, and it's hard to DIY as it's it a tight spot;2. Radio LCD went out around 200,000 miles;3. Engine valve gaskets leaked around 180,000 miles but not a bad DIY;4. Master gasket (between engine block and transmission) leaking, one bottle of Lucas Stop Leak will work;5. Exhaust shield start rattling, but not affecting anything.All in all it's a great luxury car with good MPG (23ish).",5

Its got great style, not too bold, but not too understated either. The engine is a work of art; only making 225 hp, and yet it feels like so much more. The transmission shifts perfectly and is barely noticable. The handling is not the best I've driven, but is still great. The steering is amazing in both feel and weight. However, none of this compares to the interior. It is simple yet very functional, and everything is in great reach from the drivers seat. The seats are a little firm, but offer great lateral support. Finally, this being a Lexus, it will last a long time.",4.125

The feature that hooked me and I still use to this day is the button to roll down all the windows and open the sun roof from outside the car (comes in handy on those very HOT days).  The car now has over 120K miles and all I have had to replace was a timing belt (100K) and a starter.  A few years back I started looking for a replacement but could not find anything I liked so my wife let me ""PIMP"" the ride.  I added a really cool kit to it and had the outside repainted the same Zinnabar Pearl.  Added Halo headlights and a chrome grill.  No one can believe it is a 99'.

It's NEVER has a mechanical problem and it's driven every day.  It's comfortable, fun to drive, and extremely reliable.  The quality of the fit and finish is hard to beat and I can't think of any car on the road today that can beat it for the price.

Overall quality is very good, but performance stinks.  Sporadic shifting pattern, especially after slowing and making 90 degree turn, then accelerating again will drive you nuts.  Also, shifting pattern in stop and go urban traffic will drive you even nuttier.  computer and ESC don't have a clue how to respond.

Another thing, one sunny afternoon, I couldn't get the car to start, and I had to try three times to get it started. I say sunny because most of the time, the car won't start when it is cold or wintery weather, but this weather was fine! I have no idea why.

Had noticed this line from Lexus when they came out in 2004 and thought they would make a good used vehicle at some point in the future. This one had been well maintained by the dealer and was a 1 owner vehicle. Noticed when purchased that the radiator had been recently replaced and that steering seemed a tad loosey-goosey but still safe. Everything worked and the drivetrain was strong with the brakes recently serviced. Month later noticed fluid on the garage floor that was coming from the steering rack. Bought a reman rack on line for $190 and had my trusty Toyota tech install for $275. Had the tie-rod ends, plugs, pump and timing belt all replaced after that..(had orig. plugs). New set of Cooper CS5 70K tires and alignment and she runs like new ! Numerous hot weather trips and mileage seems to be averaging about 21.9 but at 75-80mph with the A/C on.

It has only been in the shop for oil changes and scheduled inspections, plus 2 minor bumper/fender repairs [repaired perfectly].As an update, I've put another 13000 miles on the RX330 and the Lexus dealer did the extensive 120,000 mile scheduled maintenance inspection.  I also bought some new tires.  The SUV continues to drive like it did in 2010 when we bought it.  I do more in town driving, so a hybrid 400h or 450h would be a nice upgrade, especially with newer safety items.  Unfortunately, the trade-in value of a 130K vehicle isn't very high.

Smooth on the road.  Little road noise.  Nice top end speed.  Great cargo room.  Carries my family of five quite comfortably.  Great sight lines.  The only problem I've had is the dash cracking due to the heat and the cold.  Didn't expect this from a Lexus; however, Lexus replaced the dash for free ($2,600 normal cost).  They gave me a brand new RX350 as a loaner while mine was being serviced.  That was a nice perk.   I purchased mine used with 116,000 miles on it.  (Got it $3,000 below NADA.)  It now has 154,000 miles on it.  No problems mechanically.  I've read about the cost of maintenance.  I never use the dealer (except for the dash), so my cost has be a fraction of normal maintenance.  I have an amazing mechanic.  He's a genius and very fair in pricing.UPDATE:  My 330 now has 186,000 miles on it.  I'm still mostly repair free with the vehicle.  The car is starting to burn some oil - not much - but some.  I also have a leak somewhere and anti-freeze is leaking out.  This is not a problem so far as it is a very slow leak and I just top it off every 3,000 miles or so.  Still a great purchase!",5

If you're also looking at the Acura MDX, let me tell you what the differences are: MDX has more power, more towing capacity and more storage space. It isn't as luxurious, refined or reliable as the RX 330. So it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for a hot SUV, take the RX 330.

Aside from the smooth ride, great handling and spectacular amenities, there is a certain confidence and attitude that come with owning a Lexus. It is wonderful, yet hard to describe. I have received so many compliments. I have only owned it for a week, but, so far it has been excellent. I keep finding new features that blow my mind, seeing as it was so affordable.",4.75

You sit up high and get the SUV feel, but still get pretty much the 18/24 mpg advertised.  It may be slightly under- powered for some, but that's the price of decent mileage.   It has been completely reliable.  The controls are ergonomic - placed logically just where they ought to be.  One exception:  the GPS navigation system is complex and somewhat counter-intuitive.  Expect a learning curve of some weeks.   The low-profile tires are more expensive than the regular kind, but they look great.  I replaced them at Walmart in 2009 with top-quality for about $1,000.

The seats are long haul comfortable. The power tilt steering wheel is a nice touch.  The power rear door has also come in very handy. I get a respectable 23 mpg city/28 mpg highway. The transmission is very smooth, but I feel the engine is a little underpowered. Mine has the 18"" chrome wheel pkg, which seems to ride well. The dual DVD's are nice, but not something I needed.

Driving the RX 330 for approximately two weeks I am so very frustrated. It is so uncomfortable for anyone over 5'5 to drive. I am 5'7, the seat cushions are too short - gives no support under my knees. I have to move my seat back to stretch my legs out to be comfortable and not be on top of the gas pedal the whole time, restraining my foot from laying too heavily on the gas doing so. Then I have to drive with my arms outstretched in an awkward uncomfortable manner because the steering wheel does not telescope out far enough. Told my hubby to hurry and get rid of it.

The ride and comfort and quality are outstanding.  We drove the Audi, Infinity, Accura and BMW over the past week and this was easily our favorite of the group and it came in lower than most when comparing similar packages.  I also like the look a bit more than the RX 350 with the less slope backend.  The base sound system also was a real pleasant surprise ... with some slight adjustments to the balance and bass it was really surprisingly great and I love good sound.  The ride is very smooth and quiet with very comfortable seats and easy to use controls including the great safety technology package.  To be fair, as another reviewer wrote, the 3rd row is tight, but we did not feel anywhere near as bad as the reviewer described.  My wife 5'4"" tried it out on our ride and said it was comfortable with the mid row seats still in a reasonable position.  This would work for our needs of 2 hour or less drives with an extra ability to fit 1 or 2 more kids or shorter adults avoiding the need for a second vehicle on the trips.  There is still nice storage behind the 3rd row too.  For us, this was a great choice and we're really happy with nearly every aspect of the car and would recommend it to friends or family.",5

I was so excited when the RXL came out and I went to the dealership with checkbook in hand, ready to buy.  I literally cannot understand what Lexus was thinking with the 3rd row design.  I expect midsize SUV 3rd rows to be child-sized, but this was completely non-functional and worse than any I've ever seen.  With the 2nd row seats in the back position, the back of the 2nd row seat touches the bench of the 3rd row with precisely zero leg space.  It touches!  With the second row seats in the farthest forward position, I (or my teenage kids) STILL could not lock the second row seat in place (in it's farthest forward position) because the knees of the 3rd row passenger were in the way.  It was physically impossible.  The fact that the car is only 4 inches longer than the 2 row version should have been my first clue.  If you need to get any child older than about 5 or a dog (which is exactly what they show in the new RXL commercial), the 3rd row is physically impossible to use.  Not just cramped, not just tight, both of which I expected.  Literally physically impossible to use and completely worthless.  It was such a disappointment.  We ended up buying the highest optioned Toyota Highlander (AWD hybrid limited platinum) instead.  Not quite a Lexus, but darn, darn close and a bit cheaper too.  I was so excited waiting for the RXL, but it's a complete whiff with regard to the 3rd row, which is what we were holding out for.  I still love the two row version, the RX is still a great vehicle, but the RXL turned out to be completely pointless.",3

The seats are comfortable and everything is logically laid out (except for the controls next to the steering wheel which you cannot see). The navigation system is intuitive and easy to understand and input. I had XM satellite radio installed and have the Mark Levinson option, which makes it hard to leave the car sometimes. I paid sticker price and after owning it a few weeks think it is worth more. A much better car than the BMW.",4.875

The GS 430 has an engine that rocks, an interior that had to be fitted by the people at the Four Seasons, the best stereo system in the Mark Levinson bar none, and a design that makes your mouth water.

I have these run flat tires.  Shame on me, that I did not know they only last for a bout 15,000 miles and the cost 389 each to replace. But I am FRUSTRATED and would have them take the car back if I could.  The tires go bump bump due to a flat spot they say is from being on the boat and will take 1,000 miles to smooth out.  Why shoul I have to wait a 1,000 miles, after paying 58,000.  I only want round tires.  They tell me they will try to figure out what to do, but to me just give me a new set.  Pretty simple.

Bridgestone 17"" tires are the noisiest I ever heard. Missing a number of features like, rain sensing wipers, a passenger side mirror that drops in reverse and the heated seats have but one level. My wife's 2000 ES has 2 levels. Has perpetual rattles in dash that dealer can't cure and a permanent stain on the rear seat from a tire being placed there, Lexus central was no help with either issue. It gets you back and forth smoothly and reliably, but at $50K plus there should be more from the car and Lexus service. Cars costing 30/40% less are more exciting and just as reliable. ",3.375

The quality and workmanship is superior to everything else available.   I completely disagree with every complaint in the category - I don't think they understand the market.  The one drawback is size.   If you are looking for a larger SUV (Tahoe, Sub, etc.) the LX 470 will be too small for you.  Also, for towing, I just purchased an 07 Escalade ESV.

Lexus has seen fit to ""refine"" the ride of the vehicle by using Dunlop tires instead of the Michelins we all loved.  This has created more body roll in turns than I find acceptable. Stiffer sidewalls were better. In an effort to keep us safe, Many functions are disabled while the car is in motion, such as Navigation System input.  Also, when locking or unlocking you are subjected to that insidious ""beep"" that not even the dealer can eliminate. I think that Lexus has forgotten it's off-road roots and has created a not so special vehicle-for-the-money. I'd rather have an older model.",3

The problem was after test driving other SUV model cars there was no comparison.  The pick up was the biggest difference.  There is not another SUV of this size with the pick up and reliablity of pick up as the LX470.  There is not a smoother SUV on the road.  I bought the identical car and I would do it again.  The only complaints are the same as they were in 2001.  The third row seats are too difficult to operate and move in and out.  The tail gate should also swivel out as in the smaller 470 model.

It has been the best car I have ever owned by a long shot. The ride and handling are top notch. Not quite as fast as my Denali, but very smooth. It will climb over just about anything too, but you hate to take it off road because it's too good looking to take a chance on scratching it. My only complaints so far is the tiny plastic cover that covers the little window that displays the time and temperature is coming off. Also my moon roof may have a short in it as it takes several tries to get it closed. It also has more buttons in it than any other vehicle I have ever owned.

It has more buttons than a NASA spacecraft, but I think I finally have most of them figured out. It is not as quick as my Denali was, but as far as build quality, ride, comfort, and looks, it's hard to beat. I'm hoping that it can go another 90,000 if I take care of it.",4.75

Its my favorite vehicle I have ever owned out nine.  I feel safe, secluded, pampered, yet enjoy the capability in the snow and off road of the NW.  I put 295/75/16 BFG All Terrains on it, and it looks sweet.  I will probably never sell it, as it has everything I need and like.  A heated seats, a center locking diff, suspension adjustment, sunroof, killer stereo, etc.  The size is perfect too, such that you can park it with ease unlike a Suburban, Escalade, or Sequoia.  And it fits in the garage with room to walk around it. The new one looks great, but until they make it with 25 -30 mpg there is no reason to upgrade. Buy a 99-02 model and you'll be happy. ",4.875

And even though a bit sluggish from a stop, it has lots of pulling power (80% of which is available at just 1100 rpm!), the sign of a ""true"" SUV with an engine designed for it, not just out of a truck. You will get use to the gas mileage.",4.875

Driving up Hwy 1 in CA was a blast, and I never have a problem getting around in some of the incredible snows we have here in Colorado - I've pulled out numerous vehicles out of being stuck in ditches, etc., and even pulled an Nissan Xterra up a hill by my house from a standstill 1/3rd of the way up where a lot of people just park their cars at the bottom and hike their way up - ALL included in this display were VERY impressed - I've even noticed a few of my neighbors (3 now) have gotten one since!",5

The car has held up quite well and all I have had to replace is the front brake rotors.  If you are looking for comfort in a big SUV, this is the one to buy!  You can get them for good prices used and since they hold up so well, don't be afraid of buying them used with maybe 50+k miles.  Also, the thing is an absolute TANK when it comes to snow.

We have driven it in the Rocky Mountains and Northern Michigan in various extreme weather and road conditions and it hardly skipped a heartbeat. Then the problems. Front wheel portion of AWD failed completely without warning and complete and thorough maintenance & records upkeep. No reason, just failed with less than 120K miles on vehicle. Lexus Company left me dry and lacking enthusiasm for its continued reliability stating I should have bought extended warranty. Chagrined that a seemingly top notch vehicle of this caliber has such a major problem with so few miles, but goes to show failure happens",4.25
4328, on 01/07/07 05:46 AM (PST),Steve ,1999 Lexus LX 470 SUV 4dr SUV AWD,Almost Flawless," We've owned it since new. On long trips, it feels like you're sitting in a comfy chair in your living room. On the negative side, too many unnecessary options for headlights, give us ""on"" or ""off"". The height adjustment was also a useless addition, we never used it. Also, the button to engage the 4-wheel drive was placed where it could be inadvertently hit which happened several times for us and caused problems. Would like to see Lexus add some practical options, like an automatic step that would engage and allow older or physically challenged passengers easier access. Overall, though, it's been a delightful vehicle.",4.625

I wanted an SUV with a look, performance, comfort, realibility and I found the LX. I just make sure I change the oil every 3 months, and do the maintenance at recommended mileage. I wish Lexus offered 22 inch rims for the car; it is very hard to find a rim that will fit the car. It has an unusual ball pattern. Great car, what else can anyone ask for? ",4.625

The quality build by Toyota/Lexus is simply amazing.  I have had many cars but this one is superior in so many categories most specifically in the quality product.  Everyone loves this vehicle when they get in it and no one can believe it has 132K miles for the way it looks or feels.  The leather doesn't show any cracks and there are no annoying rattles.

To this day though it is a 98 model, I have kept it looking new and I cannot convince people the truck is 12 years old. Most people tend to think it is a 2005-06 year model. Lexus did a good job with a look that has stood the test of time. Has never left me stranded and the only time it has been to the dealership has been for routine maintenancealbeit very expensive maintenance. The 90k mile service was the most expensive. I had all major service done at that time and the price was 3k. So if you are buying used with close to the 90k miles or above, make sure it has been done.",4.75

Had diagnostics by Lexus dealer. Per VIN number could see all previous service work. First trip to Lexus dealer - clean, first class hotel lobby-like (what a change from typical dealers). Service advisor very straight shooter, listed all (minor) service requires. Cost to get it ""as good as new"" $2000 -- none of it vital or urgent. Happy, although it fills the entire footprint in the garage compared to my former Toyota Sienna. Past owner of many TLCs, expecting this will be a long term daily driver.",4.375

We have had only one problem with it.  The dealer said that there was a problem with the 4 wheel drive fluid in the transmission so the fluid was replaced.  The vehicle would shake and shimmer when making sharp turns.  This was fixed for free by the dealer.  Besides this, we have no complaints.  Perfect vehicle for family of 6. ",5

Exterior = 9,  Interior = 9.5,  Mechanically = 9  But unfortunately my son didn't want something that old... annoyed I said ""Okay then I'll take it"" and I'm glad I did!  The SC400 is a great, fun, reliable, quality, luxurious 2+2 GT.    Although it's 17 years old it truly drives like a new car, everything is tight, quite, and fast!

It may not have 21st century electronics, but it doesn't need them; I looked at everything from Bentleys to Aston Martins to newer installments in the Lexus line, and no other car came close to the now bargain-priced SC 400.Other cars may be faster or more efficient or more comfortable, but the SC 400 truly is the complete package.If there's anything that enthusiasts and consumers alike both hate, it's compromises, and this car makes none.",5

It also has surprisingly good headroom for rear passengers, though legroom is a bit lacking for them. Its certainly not a car built for practicality, given it lacks fold-down seats, but it makes up for looks. It can also return surprisingly impressive fuel efficiency on the highways, even for an 11 year old V8. I've averaged 26-29 MPG depending on speed, no lie.",4.75

I didn't consider a Lexus SC, because these are so rare in Iowa. But when I saw this at the dealership, it was too good to be true. Thanks to Kelly blue book and the previous owner being a millionaire who took care of his toys, I was able to get a steal. Mint condition, dressed to the nines with all the options except GPS and hands free phone, and with less than 28k miles. I practically got a new $65k car for $20.

Four cylinder turbo is just fine for acceleration and cruising. The interior systems are controlled with a joystick-like device which is a little touchy. Voice activated navigation is nice. While there is a backup camera there is no radar which was disappointing. Haven't tried the cruise control yet. Sound system is better than anything I've had before.  Car is only 5 weeks old with just local driving so don't have good line on MPG. The Edmunds review caused me to look at this car specifically when I went to dealer.

However, the 241 horsepower turbocharged motor is more than adequate. There is a slight delay when you initially press the pedal (turbo lag), but it gets going once the turbo kicks in! Even with the upgraded premium Lexus wheels, the car delivers a smooth, noise-insulated ride. I purchased this vehicle in Thousand Oaks (398 miles from my home), and drove it back home. With a full tank, on ""ECO"" mode, I arrived in Sacramento with a little less than a half tank left! Talk about fuel efficiency! Definitely night and day from my Maxima that returned 26 MPG highway/19 City (versus 33 Highway/22 City with the GS 200t). I was fortunate to find a model equipped with the Navigation and Premium packages. I absolutely love the huge 12.3 multi-function display (you can view audio information on one half while viewing your GPS), interior lighting (pretty much every button is illuminated), comfortable leather seats, retracting power mirrors (perfect for conveniently parking in tight spaces), power rear sunshade, ventilated driver's and passenger's seats, and the crystal clear audio system (it almost sounds like you're in the studio with the artist). On the outside, I can't get enough of looking at this car! The Nebula Gray Pearl is gorgeous, and looks clean even when dirty (I came from a black car that collected dust within minutes of being washed). The spindle grille (revised for 2016+ models) gives the car an aggressive look. Like most luxury vehicles, the doors close with ease. The LED daytime running lights provide adequate lighting during dusk and dawn. I have only had the vehicle for 4 days, so I am still discovering new features (the rear passengers have their own center console)! This is my first time having a vehicle with all of the bells and whistles! Hopefully I'm not speaking too soon, but I feel like Lexus has hit this one out of the ballpark.",5

The car delivered a respectable 25.6 mpg combined city and highway driving.  I found the NX300 front seats were exceptionally comfortable and the NX delivered an overall tranquil smooth ride; but, the NX interior falls short on being a practical SUV. Four adults going on a long trip are hard pressed due to the hemmed in cabin and cargo space.  Four standard 30” suit cases (the largest case airlines will check), will not fit in the back cargo space,“Upgrading” from a 2014 Toyota RAV4 Limited to a 2018 Lexus NX300 has been a disappointment. Both cars are built off the same platform, but the NX300 has less cabin room and cargo space. The Rear seating is tighter in the NX 300; especially, in the middle seat.  The NX is basically a four-seat car.  The Rear visibility and head room is less in the NX, and driver seat entering and exiting is a head banging experience.  The NX has a power seat easy access system (the driver seat automatically lowers and pulls back on ignition shut off), but it crushes the rear seat occupant.  Also, the center console is overly wide, giving the driver a hemmed in feeling.  This car is not for six-footers. Cabin road noise is about the same in both the RAV4 and NX thought the Lexus does have a slightly smoother ride and beefier engine.  Though the peppier engine comes at a hidden long-term cost: it uses premium gas (91 octane) which isn’t openly presented. Premium gas can cost an extra $.70 to $.90 cents per gallon in most areas.Most of the control buttons on the NX are an ergonomic mess. Some are below the steering wheel level that are hard to see; while others, on the dashboard center cluster sit directly in the sun light. The greenish yellow LED lights on/off positions cannot be differentiated on sunny days. The NX300 touch pad infotainment/ navigation system is a challenge to learn and use.  If you’re cell phone or computer “challenged”, this is not the car for you.   Be prepared to spend hours reading the owner manuals.  It’s interesting Toyota has moved Lexus to extremely computer-type controls that may appeal to the younger driver, who generally cannot afford a luxury car; and, has abandoned simplicity preferred by the older driver who can afford a luxury car.Be prepared to increase your monthly car payments, in the future, if you want to keep your “LEXUS EXPERIENCE”.  Besides the free trial subscription period for satellite radio there are three other free trail subscriptions for 1) remote start, 2) navigation system and 3) Wi-Fi (Verizon only).   The remote start feature works off a downloaded app on your smart cell phone. Each “advanced “ feature will cost $8.00 a month if kept.  This isn’t openly presented either. I feel The NX300 interior kills this car on being considered a luxury car.  The interior falls short on being engaging, innovative, unique, spacious or practical.  Four people cannot take this nice riding vehicle on a long ride trip, or even to the airport, because of the hemmed in cargo space the exterior design creates.SIT IN THE DIFFERENT SEATS FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE YOU PURCHASE THIS VEHICLE!

I drove the 350, but I found the acceleration with the Turbo to be more responsive and nimble.  I don't drive hard and am not going to the track, so this engine gives me more than enough. I don't understand some of the negative reviews.  I'm only two weeks in and don't write many reviews, but I couldn't find a good consumer review on this car, so I figured I would write one.

We already had 3 cars including a 2013 Mustang GT 5.0 but really wanted this car too even though there are only 2 drivers in the household. We rationalized buying this car as a ""loaner"" for our neice if she needed transportation to and from the local JC in a couple of years. Well, guess what? She's never going to drive this car! She can drive our 1990 Toyota Celica GT that I still love too. After a good but expensive detailing this car looks almost new except for the paint chips on the front of the hood that I will be touching up today. The dealer offered my mom only $1000 trade in and Carmax only offered her $3,500 for this car, no brainer on matching the Carmax price. My wife has already claimed this car as hers even though she still loves her 2001 Infiniti QX4. It has become our go-to car for most things we do together. It's so deceptively powerful and smooth for a 16 year old car. I'm in a lot more danger of getting a speeding ticket in this car than I am in the Mustang. The Mustang holds 75 mph on the freeway pretty easily but the Lexus can get up to 90 mph if you're not paying attention. Classy, powerful, refined and reliable describe this car. We have every repair and maintenance record my mom ever did on this car and there hasn't been anything major needed on this car in the 90,000 she put on it since 2003.

Under the hood sleeps a V-8 that will make your head jerk back if your not careful. The transmission is very smooth to compliment the V-8.

It's built for luxury, so it's not real great on the turns, but the powerful V8 really moves on the straight-aways. I've even taken it drag racing. It's pretty heavy, but can still do 0-60 in about 6 seconds with 80,000 miles on the speedo. There are many cars faster than that 0-60, but it's unbeatable for highway driving.

This car does it all.  For daily driving it is smooth, quiet, very comfortable, and it seats four. If you want a more exciting drive; however, stomp on the gas and hold on.  I highly recommend the SRT intake/ecu mod.  Before installing the SRT, the car accelerated with gentle, subdued power.  With the SRT, it lets off a beastly roar and leaps forward, but only when you want it to.   This car is an excellent practical solution for those who need an all-purpose sedan, but want some fun too.  I never get tired of driving my GS400.  ",4.75

Wow...had no idea it would be a needle in a haystack. But...I found it. 63K, 1 owner, had an accident in the past but was Lexus repaired (and had my body shop check it over and they said it was fixed perfectly). I bought it. Since it is 12 years old and the rule when you talk to Lexus is 90K or 108 months.  So I had the timing chain and water pump replaced for good measure and had the 60K done. ",5

Flip to manual shift on the transmission and this car can rock. Probably the best aspect of the GS 400 is how reliable this car has been.  Fuel, oil, drive.

Superior performance, great sound system, quiet ride, and great reliablity and low maintance.  The key to Lexus/Toyota is routine maintenance at 30/60/90k/120k miles.  My current car has 159k and runs just as well as my last one at 69k.  I can't say enough about Lexus quality.  Make sure you acquire maintenance records (if it was dealer maintained, any Lexus dealer w/ have the records).  This IS a high performance machine, so some people ran them hard. If it was maintained, good records will nullify that.  P.S. Get the SRT intake/chip for $300-500 for an added 15-20hp.",4.5

The first time it rained i was laughing all the way home as the sensing system turned the wipers on and off as needed. Seriously? When a dash light came on I though ""uh OH"". the honeymoon is over, now the problems start. Nope, it was telling me my (full size) SPARE tire was low. Everything about this car is delightful. Cargo space is huge, back seats have their own cup holders. The push button tailgate is wonderful. I never imagined a car could do all this. Mostly I feel safe in the car.

It is as solid as a tank but it drives like a sport sedan.

The breaking of the car is excellent. However the alternator was replaced at 75,000 miles and today at just less than 90,000 miles I have had to replace the power steering train which is 2000+ dollars and the back right strut which is another $750.  I don't consider this a good buy when at 90,000  miles a powertrain starts leaking. I've had BMWs before and never had the issues that I have had with this car now.  Today I have a new model SUV that's on loan to me and I was considering a purchase possibly have a newer car since my car is 2008 however after seeing the repairs today I don't trust Lexus to be that good a car. I kept my BMWs 13 and 15 years and never had the major repairs that this car has had. So much for all of the reviews that say this car is so incredibly reliable. It's now another 10,000 miles later and the car is now about 9 1/2 years old.  I've had to replace the front brakes again but that doesn't bother me. The car has actually done fairly well the last 10,000 miles but the lack of technology for safety is making me rethink whether I'm going to keep this car or not. In any case it won't be another Lexus RX 350 because I don't like feeling like I'm squished in a cockpit  or the design of the new car. Safety technology has become my number one issue. This car kept me from a bad car accident two years ago when a car cut out in front of me and I was able to hit the brakes hard and fast. I still really enjoy driving the car so I may keep it another five years unless it falls apart. I have a friend with the exact same car and mileage and hasn't spent a cent on repairs so maybe mine is just a fluke.  Still like the car and will be driving it for a few more years I am sure.",4

Loved a 2000 Rx350, 2005 GX was blah, the 2008 RX350 was the worst of the bunch. Boring driving, not refined at all. Nothing special about it. It had a soft supension and steering that rolled in the corners. The major problem I had was with the shifting, when you would turn to the right from a stop, it would take 2-3 seconds to engage after you turned, besides annoying it was dangerous. When taken to the dealer, they said it was normal. I traded that off for an Escalade the next day. After owning a Cadillac SRX, my wife wants to buy another Lexus, so we have been looking at them again , and it seems there have been a few complaints about tranny issues with the older Lexus.

In that time I've replaced a water pump (~$500) and a rack & pinion (~$1800).  Everything else has been general maintenance (oil/brake/filter changes, etc.)The car handles well on the road, and I love the feel of driving it.  It has enough engine to accelerate well and the suspension is setup to be comfortable, although it will feel a bit like turning a boat around sharp turns.  Unfortunately, the interior of the car has some issues.The GPS is dated and clumsy to use.  The controls for adjusting many common things like fan speed are buried inside a digital menu system that is difficult to use while driving if you want any more control than adjusting a temp and letting it decide whether to blow full speed or low speed fan to achieve that temp.  There is no USB / aux input so you're stuck using a tape deck adapter or replacing the stereo console if you want to connect your phone.My biggest problem, however, has been that my dashboard cracked & melted (pics: http://imgur.com/a/B62He)This is part of known issue (https://www.carbuyingtips.com/articles/blog/lexus-to-pay-for-cracked-dashboard-repairs.htm) and is being replaced as part of a warranty recall.

However the technology, while outstandingly marketed, is absolute crap. Voice recognition is extremely inaccurate, complex and distracting to use. It is so bad I have almost completely abandoned it. My 10 year old Garmin portable GPS has better voice recognition and routing features but their is no safe or interfering place to mount it or I would be using it. Emails and phone calls to Lexus & Toyota have been useless. Poor dealer support for tech issues (multiple dealers). Map upgrades are infrequent, extremely expensive & must be done by dealer. Keeping other technology current is also very expensive. The ability to enter in addresses from a computer was a marketing feature but so complex and buggy that it made it time consuming and frustrating for the user. Subsequently that feature has been removed leaving  address entry options to be a joystick on the screen keyboard or a complex entry procedure transfer procedure from a smartphone.

Live assistance (extra cost) is often problematic. Some controls are difficult to access when driving. Some others are unneeded duplicates that adds confusion. Windshield has some built-in technology and likely very expensive to replace. Options were outrageously overpriced -i.e. Heads-up display from dealer was $1,000 but high quality from 3rd party was $89. Rear camera is affected by rain. Tailgate has enough force to knock you over before stopping if it hits you. Tech that works well includes Park assist (not automatic), blind spot sensing, and adaptive cruise control. Interior lighting is poor. Car is comfortable and runs well and has a lot of unneeded 'frosting' that boosts the pricing. Good cargo space. Gas mileage is poor. In summary I do not recommend this car due to poor technology, low gas mileage and poor customer support. Based on this experience I currently have absolutely no interest in purchasing a Lexus or Toyota product again. Lexus marketed this vehicle as including advanced technology. In reality it is anything but. In my opinion attempting to use many to the technology 'features' while driving, makes this car unsafe to drive. In retrospect I should have invoked the California Lemon Law.Update:Voice Recognition (VR) is so bad and frustrating to use I have completely given up using it. There have been no navigation updates for this vehicle since fall or 2016. Traffic alerts are incorrect at least half the time. In order to relieve myself of this stress, I plan to get rid of this vehicle buy June 30, to avoid double registration fees for 2018. The sad truth of all of this is that in all of the vehicles I have tested so far, none have VR that is as good or better than my 2012 Garmin.  As such I am focused on purchasing my next vehicle without in dash navigation or voice recognition, but to use my Garmin instead. This issue is that all the manufactures I have explored, link safety features to in dash navigation/VR. The only SUV manufacture I have found so far that does not link in dash tech to critical safety features and has a spot for my Garmin is the 2018 Lexus RX350. So ultimately might have to 'bite my tongue' and buy another Lexus. However I am still doing research on this to avoid purchasing another Lexus if that is possible.",2

My teacher colleagues and I noticed later that the rear bumper color is different from the body. It is kind of yellowish. I understand that the bumper is plastic, the color is always a little different from its body. I accepted this little difference.  But my bumper's color, in brief,  is off too much. My relative told me the bumper looked like repainted after the car crash. I have been contacting Lexus Dealer since then. They repainted the bumper but its color is still off too much. They refused to paint it again.  Everybody who sees my car told me the rear bumper color is off too much, which makes people think this car once had a crash, the bumper was repainted. I was told by the Consumer Authority person that I could bring this matter to the small court. I already have a court day. I would like to give my advice to anyone who wants to buy Lexus cars, which is:  look carefully at every parts of your new car before you drive your new car home. In addition, my GPS failed in taking to the restaurant where I was invited to. My tire pressure warning light is on many days of the year even if the tires pressures have no problems at all. I am a good driver for 23 years and have no accident at all.  My experience tells me Lexus is not a good car.",1

Tire pressure monitor only shows that ""a"" tire is low, but no hints as to which! My 2005 Suburban showed me a reading for each tire, Lexus says maybe next model year!  Navigation is quirky, put me out in the middle of nowhere on several occasions while saying ""You have reached your destination, the route guidance is now finished!""  Fortunately I could backtrack.  Overall I like the SUV, but you would think that for over $50,000.00, you would get more refinement than it provides.  Lexus is very proud of their vehicles, $80.00 for a synthetic oil change!",4

Shopping for a mid-sized, crossover for the wife to replace her 15 year old Sequoia.  The kids are grown so it was time to move down on size and up in luxury.  I really thought the RX would be a great fit.  The wife wants a Toyota as we have had great experience with them from a reliability standpoint but she wants something easier to handle in parking lots (which would be damn near anything compared to the Sequoia).  We don't like the wild styling of the new RX so we went to look at CPO 2015s.  As soon as we got in, we were both taken back.  Everything I read talked about the quality of the interior materials.  Huh?  Where are they looking?  I saw a sea of cheap looking, hard plastic.  The door panels were just slabs of plastic as was most of the dash.  The Sequoia has a much nicer interior.  Then we drove it.  I didn't expect a sports sedan, or even an engaging driving experience but this was horrible.  It wallowed around turns and floated over undulations like it was on springs with no damping.  Disappointed, we went down the street to the Toyota dealer to check out the Highlander.  What a difference.  The interior was much nicer, with nice, soft simulated leather covering the dash and soft inserts in the door panels.  And it drove much better, handling seemed secure and bumps smoothed out.  I just amazes me that for these two corporate cousins, the Toyota drives better and has a more luxurious interior for a lot less money than the Lexus.",3

However, if you are looking for a sporty handling SUV, go with the BMW X3.  I know my Lexus will be a reliable car and will last for many years, but I do miss the performance of my BMWX3. Also the Lexus does not require Premium gasoline, so I will save money over the BMW on gas and maintenance costs. Maintenance on the BMW was costly. I don't think this will happen with the Lexus.

Nothing intrudes on my peace of mind while driving my RX350.  I have owned almost a year and driven approximately 4500 miles both small town and interstate.  I traded a 2016 ES350 sedan in for this SUV.  Only had 2000 miles on it but just didn't please me.  My lady friend has hip problems and found the sedan too low to enter and exit without pain.  So, I traded down one year to the RX.  The seat height is just right for the petite little lady.  The RX styling is subdued and classical.  It should stand up well over the years.   The 2016 and 2017 Lexus front grill is outrageous in my opinion.  A couple of years ago the Lexus dealer made fun of my 'buck tooth' Acura but seems to accept the snarling Lexus LOL.  A word of caution:  research not only the year car you want, but also read comments a year or two on either side of the car you are thinking of buying.   I find that some people don't adapt readily to the 'newer' car in performance and appearance.  They  are often very critical of a newer model because they are so accustomed to the old car.  But do pay particular attention to dealer experiences.  Update: The RX350 is high quality in all respects:  I have owned Mercedes, BMW, and Audi and nothing is better than the quality of my 2015 RX350.   If you want a sports car look somewhere else, but if you want a quiet, smooth competent car that will retain resale value, this is it.   I laugh at those that expect both plush, easy ride, AND sports car handling!!  Come on.  I am 74 and love my Lexus!!",5
4562, on 08/10/16 19:59 PM (PDT),Cynthia ,2015 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Luxurious but Dissapointing," I had a RX 300 and then a RX 350, 2009, both of which I loved.  They drove like a car and felt like a car, but had the extra room of an SUV.  A true crossover car.  However, this car is bigger and feels like you're driving a boat.  It drives like a large SUV, which I did not want.  I can't even see over the hood very well and the seats are up as far as they can go, so now, I have an extra seat cushion.  So much for the heated and air conditioned seats.  The 2009 was much more comfortable.  I really miss the arm rest in the 2009.  I make a shake in the morning and now, the cup holders are even smaller!!!  I know this is a little thing, but it only holds a water bottle, not my shaker bottle!  Why?  Why, Lexus, would you make this change?  Very inconvenient.  The navigation is really slow and painful to use, and does not respond well to voice activation.  I also miss the 6 CD changer.  The mouse pad is difficult to use, especially when you are driving.  Also, there are no guide lines with the back up camera.  My husbands new Jeep Cherokee has them, but the Lexus doesn't???  Bottom line, it feels like a full size SUV and the 2016's are even bigger.  I won't buy another one of these.  They had a wonderful car with the RX 300.  I wish I had another one.  Lexus pretty much ruined the RX 350 now. It's a shame.  And the new 2016's are pretty ugly with that front end grill they have.  It doesn't even look safe.  Lexus, what are you thinking????",3

4565, on 07/11/16 11:56 AM (PDT),joe K ,2015 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 6A),"Horrible service, unreliable, bad AC"," I wanted a lexus because my entire family has been driving lexus vehicles for 25+ years. Between myself and my extended family, we've owned around three dozen lexus vehicles over the years. My vehicle is the last Lexus anyone in my family or circle of friends will ever buy again. It's not worth the money or the time. When I first bought it, they promised me it would be ready for pickup the next day. The next day came, followed by three entire weeks of them calling me every other day telling me ""it will be here tomorrow"". I drove around in a rental for three weeks while they figured out where my car, which I already paid for, was located. Finally I get it, with around 10 miles on the odometer. A week later, not 100 miles later, I start getting a moldy stink from the AC. I take it back to the dealer, they claim they can't smell anything (despite it being so pervasive it sticks to my clothes and earns comments from co-workers), but spray the AC system anyway, and it clears up the smell....for about a week. I took it back another couple times to get cleaned out, again same story ""we don't smell anything, but we'll clean it anyway"". It smells bad for the first 15 minutes of driving, and anytime i try to turn down or turn off the AC. As long as it's on blast, the smell seems to be dilute enough to not be noticeable. So fast forward six months, I'm driving across the country on a sunday, in the middle of nowhere in Pennsylvania when I get a flat. I call lexus support/roadside assistance. They said they can't do anything for me. It's a sunday night and it's about to snow, so they can't send anyone over until the next day. The closest lexus dealership is approximately 200 miles away in bad weather. So I put on the spare, and started calling every tire shop within a 20 mile radius. No one has the tire I need. The lexus's standard 19in tires are so specific, only dealers and a handful of places around the country have them. To add insult to injury, there are huge swaths of country where the closest lexus dealer is hundreds of miles away. Anyway, I expand my search radius and find a costco 140 miles away that carries a compatible tire (after sitting in a hotel calling tire shops for two days straight). Except since it's AWD and the tires are not completely identical, it means I had to replace all four tires (about $1,500) because I got ONE flat. A little while later I moved into a new house in a new state, and took it to the dealer again to see what they can do for the AC. They said they use a different, new chemical cleaner (but even though they don't smell it - a bold faced lie) they will still clean it for me. After that treatment, every single day my lexus has smelled like someone poured fresh vinegar into the AC ducts. It's a smell almost identical to sticking your head into a bag of salt&vinegar potato chips. Again, the dealer is refusing to do anymore service. They said to examine what's really going wrong, they need to take the entire dashboard apart. They refuse to do so without payment, refuse to acknowledge any of my warranties or service plans, and refuse to give me a loaner vehicle in the meantime unless I pay for it. My insurance has a $1000 deductible, so I'm not going to pay for that service. I tried complaining to their managers, who refuse to call me back. To make things even worse, any service at any lexus dealer has generally resulted in a 5-6 hour wait. Even oil changes. Meanwhile, when I take it to any other shop, it's a 20 minute wait to get an oil change at a quarter of the price. I complained to lexus corporate about the smell issue, and they are requiring me to jump through a dozen hoops and fill out binders of paperwork to get anything done. The lemon law is complicated too by the fact that I bought the car in CA and moved to NY shortly thereafter, and I'd need to go to california court to get the dealer to buy back the car. You may be wondering, WHY DOES MY CAR SMELL? Well....here is why: Lexus/toyota is currently (since 2009) a defendant in a class action lawsuit regarding this very issue. A certain percentage of their vehicles have defective condenser coils on their AC. They have an anti acid and anti mold coating - Aluminum Hydroxide - which corrodes and flakes off on some vehicles, and gets blown into the passenger compartment as a fine grey dust akin to cigarette ash. This chemical is used in anti-acid pills, so it's not dangerous when swallowed. But it sure is dangerous when inhaled! Once the coating flakes off, the condenser coil becomes a petri dish and starts to smell like mold or mildew first, then like vinegar, depending on what kind of mold/yeast/bacteria has been growing inside. Don't expect any explanations from lexus, they play stupid about it because if they lose this suit, they could loose an incredible amount of money. It's best for them to keep their customers in the dark about it. Anyway, I won't tolerate that anymore, and neither will anyone I know.",2

I have had this 2015 RX for 2 months.   I brought it in to service this week due to the fact that the gridlines disappeared when backing up.   I am being told now that the navigation system in the 2015 and camera system does not come with gridlines.   I feel that these folks are calling me a liar.   Why on earth would I take my car for service and ask them to fix this issue if they were never there to begin with.

I tried talking her out if it but she wouldn't listen.  When it came time to pick one out, I made the mistake of pushing for the F Sport because it was much better looking than the rolled under front bumper standard version.  The big problem with the F Sport is the ride and the transmission.  We live in Wisconsin and test drove the car in the summer on decent roads.  The ride is stiff... really stiff.  I was concerned but the style got in the way of my judgement.  Now that it's winter and the roads are crap (you know what I mean if you live here), I hate the ride. Our subdivision is older and the heaving on the street makes the car feel like you're riding a bucking bronco.  I actually drive on the wrong side of the street in some places to avoid the bumps.  The stiffness has gotten old in a hurry.The other issue is the transmission.  It's a joke.  Why on earth would Lexus put in a eight speed tranny when they've programmed it to get into top gear as soon as possible?  First gear is way too low.  You step on the throttle from a stop and if you don't ease back to almost an idle position, it over-accelerates and makes it feel like you've mashed the pedal to the floor.  There's a very fine line between idling away from a stop and lunging up to second gear.Then it shifts...shifts...shifts... and by the time your going twenty miles an hour... you're in fifth gear.  Hit forty... you're in eighth.  The engineers have programmed the trans to get into top gear as soon as possible to save fuel.Then comes the downshift issue.  You get off the freeway, slow to thirty, as you step on the throttle to accelerate off, it doesn't downshift.  You press harder and it still won't downshift.  Not until you really give it some serious throttle, it will finally decide to downshift.  The other annoying thing is... you're moving along at 70 and you hit a headwind, or the road heads uphill.  It immediately downshifts as soon as you give it the hint of more throttle.Oh... one more transmission programming oversight.  The paddle shifters.  You're driving along at 55, you apply throttle to accelerate, it won't downshift as usual, you pull the left lever to downshift... and it goes from eighth to fifth. What's up with that?  I want seventh, then sixth.  Dumb. (the gear shift lever in manual mode does shift one gear at a time)On the good side... Styling is nice, considering these cars are so cluttered trying to find their identity.  Interior is very nice.  Stereo is good.  Seats have everything including the drivers side moves back when you shut it off. Seat bottoms could be a bit bigger and softer.  Interior noise isn't bad but not as quiet as a MDX or GLE.  Motor goes well (when you really press on the gas)On the not so good side... For a $53,000 car, the steering wheel isn't heated, it's hard and has no grip at all.  The exhaust is annoyingly loud (another brilliant marketing move just for egotists).  The car developed an rattle in the left front fender that took a couple trips to the dealer before the they found the problem.  They thought I was nuts after multiple complaints and in the end my analysis was spot on. The tire pressure monitor had problems after a few thousand miles and we've been back twice to balance and rotate the tires trying to eliminate noise.  Hasn't helped.To me, the car's a loser.  I pushed hard for the Pathfinder but lost out.  My wife keeps a stiff upper lip and says she likes it.  I guess that's what counts in the end.  I bet it's gone at the end of the lease. ...Update Feb 23, 2018... Lease is ending.  I was right.  She's done with it and hates the ride.  We're looking for a new car.  Reliability wise, there has been zero problems in 36k miles.  In the end, other than a couple of minor gripes, the stiff ride and transmission really brought down the enjoyment factor of this car.",2

I knew going in this is not a sports car but it is a great SUV. I had a 2010 RX for 60K miles and did nothing but required maintenance.  The battery died at 55K and Lexus replaced it free of charge.  This 2015 is another fine trouble free SUV.  Just did 15K service, 10K was free, 15K was $100.  That's it so far. And this RX is quieter and more refined than the 2010.  I am 60, owned all kinds of cars and this is by far the best ownership experience I have ever had. I use Lexus of Palm Beach in Florida and they are just great.

I wanted to purchase the Volvo SUV but my husband convinced me to stick with Lexus since we had such a great experience previously.  Unfortunately this 2015 RX350 is no that great.  The navigation is very annoying and takes so long to enter an address, I prefer to use the map app on my iphone so can can just say the address and off I go.  I really miss my armrest... I know its something most people don't care about but I like to have an armrest where it meets my elbow.  My biggest complaint is the gas economy.  It's supposed to range from a minumum of 18 MPG local.  It only gets 14 MPG on average!!! which is worse than the V8 Ford Explorer Limited that I had from the 90's.  This is a huge gas guzzler - thank goodness the gas prices have gone down.  On a positive note, I love the seats, they are very  comfortable with beautiful color option of ""saddle""... or brown.

There is a huge difference in the ride quality. The NX was just too small. Coming from a Highlander, the RX is a much better fit ! Several have commented on the ride of the RX...I find it very smooth and quiet. The seats are very comfortable, and I got a loaded RX. The Heads Up Display is one of my favorite features. Your eyes stay on the road while the speed is flashed in the windshield. The Mark L. sound system is also awesome. Just spend a little time getting the balance and adjustments right on it. As the new 2016 RX350 will soon be out, it was just too big, and the 2015 has the better look IMO. I'm not a fan of the huge front grill on the 2016. Mine has most everything you can get on it, and it's fun on the highway, unlike other reviews that say it's boring. Sure, it's not a sporty ride, but it isn't intended to be one.

The quality of the RX is as good as the Mercedes and the ride is much smoother. The steering feel of the RX is better and the body leans less than the Mercedes. The RX's leather seats are more comfortable and luxurius, very much like an S Class Mercedes. Overall, the RX is quiet, luxurious and easy to handle.After owning the Lexus for a year and a half, I still feel the same way about it except for the poor gas mileage ( 17mpg average) and the driving position.

I can't afford to buy a brand new car so I spent a year searching for a used RX 350 that had fully maintenance history documented and found mine with service done every 5,000 at the same dealership.  I've owned mine now for just under one year and find that it's superb in every aspect; interior is luxurious and features enough electronic gadgetry to satisfy, it's really comfortable to drive, gas mileage is decent and it has plenty of get up and go for a guy of my age who is not interested in trying to set land speed records.  It's attractive styling is what made me fall in love with it and mine came with a brand new set of Michelin tires on it which give it a very smooth, comfortable, quiet ride.  I've heard from many RX owners over the years that I can expect reliability in abundance well into the 200,000+ mile range if it's well taken care of and I do my best to pamper mine.  This is my dream automobile and I am very much pleased with my purchase.Now that I have owned my Lexus for 16 months my review and feelings about it haven't changed at all.  I haven't had a single issue with it.  I realize that the technology is a bit older now than current models and that current models are certainly more refined and luxurious but the newer models cost more than I can afford.  The backup camera in my car is likely a good example.  I'm sure that they have improved.  I find it a bit difficult to see when backing into the sun or when it's raining.  Still, this Lexus features more gadgets, features, technology and other comforts than anything I have ever owned.  I have upgraded my sound system on a modest scale by swapping out all of the factory speakers but left the factory head unit in order to keep it looking stock and it sounds terrific.

It has been reliable with minimal issues that the dealership has taken care of.  Not the most fun to drive as it is very plush and you really can't feel the road.  It is just the right size for us and tows our 3500 lb boat just fine.   Lately, @30k miles now, I've noticed the mileage isn't as good as it used to be.

The Navigational system does not allow the driver or passenger to make adjustments while the vehicle is in motion.  Lexus refuses to acknowledge this design issue and stonewalls its customers...so much so that owners are talking about class action litigation. If you must buy this model year, shop around until you find one without the navi. The engine has high noise...sounds like a 1970's diesel.  Lexus advises that it is due to their decision to go with a mechanical timing chain. I would rather have a quiet vehicle and pay the cost to replace.  High wind noise at highway speeds.  Buy an Acura, you will be much happier.",3

A very pleasing sound and slight feel, soft Roar of the engine as you accelerate, more than makes up for reduced acceleration. Super mileage can’t be beat, I easily get 25-26 mpg city driving on economy + a/c and navigation screen. Love the cockpit, front luxury seats with frills, good looking steering wheel lovely leather wrapped look and nice feel,  even the shift sticks a beauty, with front dash slightly angled towards driver are luxurious for Dads daily commute as also luxurious headroom + legroom at the back compared to other competitors  for the family outing on weekends. Rear screen entertainment is really not needed as everyone inside is relaxing even bask in comfort. The quiet cabin has to be seen to believe, the difference is awesome. A really wide cargo bay makes up for the least space available compared to others, as is easy to simply dump lots of grocery bags for the entire family on the way home on weekends. And the touchless liftgate is highly thoughtful for this reason. Nothing left to chance every feature including design inside and out are well thought out.Love the hands free bluetooth can hear calls so clearly and never take hands off the wheel, also no text messages on the go unless the vehicle is not in motion, must mention that the infotainment system is a big letdown as is slow and cumbersome, but I must add the screen just can't be beat . Music system that comes is another poor feature as sound is lousy. Even for the price am sure they can do a lot better as everyone is an audiophile.BSM, RCTA and Park assist are great utility features in use for daily driving as also the cruise control and brake hold at the lights are perfect for city driving.

4670, on 06/25/18 08:37 AM (PDT),AL ,2018 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),"Nice, comfortable ride with a few minor flaws"," Coming from 2016 Accord V6-EX sedan, which is already a very feature packed vehicle, the first impression on 2018 RX 350 AWD is the much smoother and cushy ride. Accord had a very jerky transmission I had to fight with and an aggressive fuel savings (25-35 MPG on Accord vs 15-20 on RX) from which the gear switching and the ride comfort suffered. RX seems to have a much better sound system - at least it has the mids, comfortable and more adjustable seats - compared to the headrest tilting too much forward, and a large 12 inch entertainment screen (comes with NAV) - though it is not a touch screen and the controls are awkward and sluggish as compared to the touch screen and nearly perfect integration with smartphones as well as fast response time on the Accord. RX has a much larger and versatile storage / hauling capabilities, although the two are not in the same category. Looking further, the RX has a working Sport mode, where on the Accord the sport mode seems to ride two gears down from where it is supposed to be - driving at 4-5k RPM at 40-60mph makes one look like an idiot on the Accord. The Accord seems to have better dash and door materials and they are not as marr prone as on RX where after a week you can definatelly notice dust and smudges in places you touched them with your hands. No wonder my neighbors are washing and cleaning their RX every week. Paint seems much better and thicker on the RX where as on the new Accord models it is skin deep - after two years of driving on the highway, the front is littered with paint deeps and chips from tiny road dirt. One thing however that is not acceptable from Lexus is the requirement to pay to use the remote starter ($80-96/yr, even though it is already installed with push start) and the fact that once the vehicle is remotely started the vehicle shuts off as soon as you enter it - some safety nonsense. Accord also has a remote starter built in and it works at get go from the key fob; you can get into the car and press break+start to continue without the car ever shutting off - again this is the ideal implementation here and shame on Lexus for making us pay for a half baked nickel and dime solution. If you leave the remote inside Accord, the car won't let you lock and will beep at you, while the Lexus does none of that. Another thing to note is how loud the engine is on the RX from outside compared to the other new cars which are barely audible when new. There is also some loud knocking heard from the engine while parked as well as some whining when driving at 70 mph or higher and slightly holding the gas pedal - it generates noise similar to engine being revved up and let go (like it is running out of gas), all the while you are pressing the gas pedal consistently. Read some reviews and some suggested to wait a few thousand miles at which point the noises should disappear. Until then, these are my observations. To be continued.",4

Lexus was offering to pay for last 3 months and disposition fee if I stayed loyal to the brand. Normally I would've just leased another Lexus but the spindle grill had me on the fence. I looked at 2018 Range Rover Velar and 2018 Audi Q7. The Velar was a stunner but questionable reliability and first year production scared me. I actually looked at the Audi Q5 first but liked the Q7 better.  It was a toss up between the RX and Q7 but I would've had to buy the 4 cylinder Q7 just to be close to the RX's lease deal and that's not even counting the the 3 payments plus disposition fee Lexus was giving.  In the end I couldn't pass up the Lexus.  I leased an F-SPORT because I actually liked the aggressive design.  The 2018 RX F-SPORT is better in every way to my previous RX F-SPORT except for seat comfort.  I think the new seats are a tad bit too aggressively bolstered.  I'm getting used to it however. I also highly recommend getting the Levinson stereo . It's simply divine.  I'm happy with my decision.  Lexus service is second to none and they make the best vehicles.,5

When you speak with Lexus customer service, they will tell you this is common complains from owner. Although it is very common, they did nothing to address it. 2) Car doesn't have full integration with iphone and andriod like other luxury cars. You can send receive text and phone calls and it pretty much ends there. Many other cars have better integration like screen mirroring, ability to control addressbook to other things from cell phone or an app. 3) Dealer and manufacturer recommends service every 5k miles costing 350-450 per service. They change oil every 10k and for other service it is just tire rotation and some other inspections. Very costly tire rotation and oil change. When spoke with with dealer, customer service they simply took note of complains and offer no guidance or plan on how they are going to address it with future update.

However, I didn't notice any improvement and can still feel the low vibration at various speeds.

4693, on 01/31/18 13:00 PM (PST),Paul J. ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Luxury Yes - SUV Yes," I’m a Lexus fan and this is my 3rd.  First SUV.  Getting into the SUV market wasn’t easy for me.  I loved my GS 350 and it had low mileage.  The one and only reason to go to a SUV was so I could see around the one in front of me.  Congested freeways in Southern California requires one to see brake lights several cars ahead in traffic.  Ever been in a freeway which turns into a parking lot?  It happens  here.  Anyway the majority of vehicles on the road are SUV’s it seams.  So I got one simply to have a better view of the road ahead.  Here is the review.  1) this is a luxury vehicle with a soft, quiet comfortable ride.  If you live on or frequently windy roads, do you want a soft ride?  For my tast it is too soft.  2) acceleration is OK but nothing like my GS 350.  Since both the GS and RX have 3.5 liter engines I expected similar acceleration.  Disappointing that isn’t the case.  On the other hand driving slower and being more patient isn’t a bad thing but I miss the fun factor.  3) braking?  No problems but I do believe my sedan was more responsive and would stop in a shorter distance.  That is a feeling since no actual comparison was made.  I may have been happier with the Lexus RX 350 Sport model as I was accustomed to a sportier vehicle.",4
4694, on 01/29/18 20:48 PM (PST),Jim B ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Overpriced - Lacks Technology," Excellent ride but technology definitely lags other cars.  HUD is totally USELESS and a joke at best.  Speed limit is displayed randomly with no logic and makes no sense.  It is always on the Navigation display in the center of the dash but only on the HUD less than 5% of the time at best.   Where is the logic in that?   When I took it back to the dealer, they said it was designed that way to reduce the clutter on the HUD and only show up occasionally as a reminder.  Are you serious?  When I look for it, it is because I want or need to know speed limit where I’m driving.  So now I have to look at the navigation screen in the center of the console and take my eyes off the road.  This is a 2018 car and the navigation database was June 2016 almost 2 years old when purchased.  That is hilarious to me. To spend that much money on a navigation system and then turn around and have to go buy an update which is 1 year old is insane.   Save your money, and use your smart phone with Google Maps which is a better mapping system, more accurate, with latest data, and a better display.  The PCS system does not even come remotely close to providing sufficient warning and application of the brakes to keep from hitting someone or something.   There is no way you would want to be in front of a car and test the system.  And in fact Lexus demonstration videos do not show any test of the system with actual people or vehicles in front of the car but a dummy is used instead.  Good thing.  I have ridden in a 2016 Infiniti QX60 that provides excellent warning and application of brakes.  The 2018 Lexus is no comparison and the system will not adequately or safely perform.  The rear hatchback will supposedly open with just a wave of your hand over the Lexus symbol. It didn’t work when they demonstrated car to me, so they had maintenance department disconnect the battery for 30 seconds and reconnected and it worked.   When I went to pick the car up for delivery it did not work again. So they repeated the same battery disconnect. It worked before leaving the dealership but the following day it would not work again.  I called the dealer and he said I had two options, that I could bring the car back into the dealership, or I could disconnect the battery myself and leave it disconnected for 30 seconds and then reconnect and it will start working again. Seriously?  So I just bought a 60+ thousand dollar car and I am going to be disconnecting the battery to reset this system for another 24 hours. The logic for the electronic controls for the navigation system is  not user-friendly at all. When you want to do something very simple you struggle through the menu items to find the screen that holds the selection you need to make and often times have to either pull out the manual or search online and find out how to get to the screen that you want to make the selection you need.  There is absolutely no logic to that system. My daughters 2016 Infiniti QX 60 which is two years older has a much better and more logical menu system.  I just purchased a used 2016 Ford Explorer for another daughter and you can start the car remote with the key FOB.  Not so the Lexus. With the Lexus you have to use an iPhone and open an app, navigate to a page that shows “start” and push the “start” button.  The fastest I have been able to start the car using that technique is 30 seconds as it is totally dependent on getting a connection.  Why not use a key FOB that you could start immediately without even looking at an app on a phone.  My last 2015 Lexus had a feature that would allow you to open all 4 windows and the hatchback to allow the hot air to escape before you got to car by pressing the unlock button on key FOB for longer than 2-3 seconds.  Not the 2018.  Have to take it back to dealer to have it reprogrammed.  When I purchased this Lexus I thought I was buying a better car but I was sadly mistaken. I fully intend to sell this car and replace it with a QX 60 for at least $10,000 - $15,000 less or a new Ford Explorer with better entertainment and navigation systems.  AND, Ford has a training system in their lobby to show you how to work the navigation and entertainment systems in the lobby without sitting in the car with the engine running for an hour while the dealer shows you how to work all the systems.  Lexus has stood still and allowed the competition to blow past them with technology.",3

Of all the SUVs we have owned (5) in total, the 2017 RX 350 is by far the best. We owned a GMC Jimmy that had way too many problems. Then came the Infiniti QX 4 that gave us great service, comfort and enjoyment. Our next SUV was a NISSAN Murano that had problems with the transmission. Our next SUV was a NISSAN Murano that did not give us the problems the previous model gave us. Our first LEXUS RX 350 was a 2015 that was trouble-free. However, with very few miles the dealer offered us a great trade-in on the 2017 RX 350 that we now own. We loved the added features this one had over the 2015. With 18,000 kms now on this SUV we wil probably keep it for another year or two, that is unless the 2019 has enough added features for us to trade up. We are very happy LEXUS owners. We traded up to the all black edition RC350 because of it’s power and styling having sold our 2015 ES 350. It was great, but at the age of 81 I just wanted a fun car. We bought the 2017 RX350 SUV in November of 2016. Great family long distance vehicle. Plan on buying the 2020 RX 350 and get rid of our 2017 RX 350",5

It sounds and feels like a transmission issue but have been told it is an issue with the exhaust system.  They know and have know for A LONG time there is a problem and do not yet have a fix for it.  I have been complaining for a year now.  Initially, was told it was my imagination  but since then was told it is a known issue.   STILL WAITING.   It is loud and sounds and feels like the engine is not wanting to shift to higher gears.  This is my third Lexus as I had found them to be so reliable.  Now not so sure.

4701, on 01/02/18 08:17 AM (PST),Unhappy Lexus Owner ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV F SPORT 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Terrible for a Lexus -- can't wait to sell it.," I was coming out of an Acura MDX into the Lexus RX 350 Fsport.  I am very disappointed in the vehicle and with Lexus.  1.) The cars with headsup display come with a windshield that causes headlights and streetlights to be duplicated (like being cross eyed). After taking pictures and getting a Lexus service tech to ride in the car in darker weather, they agreed there was a problem.  At first Lexus (corporate) said it was defective glass and replaced the windshield. When the problem still existed they found an engineer that knew that there was different glass for cars with HUD. Their solution was to put the glass from non-HUD equipped vehicles into my car. This glass then made the HUD blurry and duplicated and rendered it useless. I eventually got my money back for the HUD since it's now useless.  During this experience, I found that using polarized glasses eliminated the problem. I shared with Lexus dealer and corporate and received the response ""we trust our engineers to solve the problem."" So I found a solution that costs about $100 -- a clear, polarized window film would solve the problem. Instead they want to break the factory seal on the windshield and put in a $1500 windshield rendering the HUD useless.  2.) I have less than 15K miles on the car and have rattles in the drivers door and the roof.  Of course the dealer cannot reproduce the issue.  3.) Rear hatch struts weren't lubricated correctly and squeal loudly. 4.) Entertainment software usability is very poor and not intuitive. It doesn't remember your last media setting and turns off when using bluetooth connections. 5.) Mouse is too sensitive and creates a safety issue to use when driving (even after adjustment). 6.) The overall fit and finish of the car feels cheap. When shutting doors it sounds like hollow metal slamming.  I've had lower end cars that don't sound like that.  7.) No remote start without a paid subscription. For a 2017 luxury car, how can this not be a standard feature?    8.) The Mark Levinson stereo is definitely not worth the money. It is NOT surround sound, not tuned to be balanced for different music types, and sounds like the rear speakers don't work.  The base stereo sounded better.    There are some nice features on this car, but it is significantly lacking overall quality in many areas putting it below low end car makers like Kia and Hyundai.  The biggest issue is how I've been treated by Corporate Lexus when dealing with the HUD windshield issue, but combined with everything else this car is a huge waste of money.",1

Lexus released a fix for the droning and vibration on January 25. I had the fix installed and it works! Amazing stuff. The middle section of the exhaust system gets replaced. Do not buy or lease an RX350 unless you like consistent droning from the drivetrain. Mine was super quite until around 1800 miles and then something changed. There’s a low pitch droning sound with a vibration all the time - especially at about 1400 rpm. The nice ride and comfy cabin does not make up for this serious flaw.

The RX350 seems lighter and more nimble.  I read many review on the RX350 and disagree with the sentiments expressed regarding looks and handling.  The RX350 bold and aggressive look out shines all of the rest of the SUV's.  Its sporting look sends the message that I'm not just another stogy SUV driver.  The handling is light.  The steering is light and easy as opposed to the stiffer Audi steering.  I'm not sure why people think a stiff steering is better, but I have no problems doing twisty roads.  In fact it seems like I can do them quicker in the RX350 without a lot of body roll.  Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the RX350.",5

And now that we've gotten comfortable with the daily use of all the features, I can honestly say this vehicle has exceeded those expectations. Many vehicles have features that appear appealing on paper or when a sales associate describes them but turn out impractical or downright unuseful. I find myself taking advantage of nearly every feature built into this car. The safety and awareness features are perfectly designed to integrate effortlessly with normal driving habits. I've been pleasantly surprised at how simple it's been to take advantage of them. We chose an AWD model with the luxury package and Mark Levinson audio system - a set of options that added considerably to the cost. We vascillated over the decision, but I'm now overjoyed with the additional features and amazing audio. We look forward to many years of reliability, safety, and comfort.",5

Ride is smooth, handling is good, overall a good car, but not great.. The packages are hokey.  The hands free tail gate which is on almost every car has worked once.  Try to use it and I'm out there waving my hand over the sensor, looking like an idiot and then need to open it conventionally.  This wouldn't bother me except they charge $200 for this worthless option and it is packaged in most cars.  Another such option is the heated steering wheel.  Can't even tell it is on.  The Navigation system which ties to your phone (Scout GP) is  worthless.  It can't decipher what you are asking.  Neither my wife or I have had any luck with it trying business names, addresses, anything.  Haven't tried the remote start via phone app yet, but it is disappointing that a car in this price range doesn't have one standard.  If it does end up working, it t is free for one year, then $160 per year afterwards....Too expensive, will ultimately end up putting in an aftermarket starter.  When we picked the car up, they wasted too much time trying to sell add on packages and spent very little time explaining the features. Wasted time rebooting the entire car because the hands free tail gate wouldn't work.  Overall, much less than the stellar buying experience Lexus advertises.  Lexus obviously has a loyal base and as such is stingy with discounting, but I would suggest giving similar cars a better look.  Over priced for what is delivered.",3

I traded it in for this one with over 300K on it.  The reason for the trade, repairs became more expensive and it was just pain time.  I really miss the old RX 330, but I can't complain about this one.  First and foremost, service at Lexus is exceptional.  The service representative make you feel so comfortable, you almost want to hug her.  Second and most of all, The car gains respect when riding down the road.  I got the autumn shimmer, with the sunroof, heated and cooled front seats, and tow enabled package.  Not sure what the package is called, but it was good enough for me.  I tried the Mercedes GLE, Audi Q7, and Jaguar F Pace, but none came close to the price to value point that the RX 350 did.  All I can say about that is go find out for yourself.  The Q7 is a great car, but the price point could put you close to 70K.  The final point I want to make is, my wife took the new RX 350 and I only get to ride it on the weekend.  :)",5

4715, on 09/21/17 22:19 PM (PDT),John I ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),The vehical I have always wanted," I have had the RX 350 AWD for 4 months. I am not experiencing any of the vibration or noise that some reviewers are describing, to the point where I was shock reading those review. PERFORMANCE:  I think this could be the smoothest car I have ever had, if I am being picky might be too bouncy over bumps.  The shifting gears in the transmission is hardly noticeable and I have never found the 3.7 lt V6 is plenty powerful. COMFORT: I have owned Cadillac SRX, BMW X3 and Buick Enclave over the past 10 years. I think the comfort for the Cadillac and Lexus RX350 were the best in different way. The Cadillac has a the softness factor but the Lexus has a firm comfort. I like them both. The BMW X3 could have been the most uncomfortable car I have ever owned. INTERIOR: I love the two tone leather interior with the highlight of the brushed chrome accents.  I seem to have more leg room than in the BMW X3. The backseat leg room is very good. I was actually embarrassed to have someone sit in the back seat of the Cadillac and BMW. I think they took some room from the cargo and gave it to the back seat because the cargo area is smaller than both of the BMW and Cadillac. In the Cadillac I had the panoramic moon roof, which was way cool, but I hardly used it. The standard moon roof is just over the front seat. I think the F sport model has the bigger moon roof. SAFETY: I am not a risk taking driver, so I might not be the best for evaluate this. However, the parking assistance package that I have really gives me confidence. I did test drive the Infinity Q50 and it had the 360 cameras. I thought this was a neat feature that is missing on the Lexus. TECHNOLOGY: I can’t imagine a vehicle having better tech features. The LCD screen is huge! I also have the LEXUS ENFORM and it is terrific. Real Time weather, Real Time Sports and Stocks! Need to know where the closest gas station is? Where the lowest prices? This car lets you do it. REALIBITY: I have had this car for 4 months and it has started every time. VALUE: Pricing is higher than the similar models for Lincoln or Cadillac but more affordable than the Porsche McCann, the Jaguar F-Pace, Land Rover. I think I got a good deal from the dealership that’s all I can ask for.",5

My wife and I just retired and wanted an ""RV"" (Retirement Vehicle) and we planned on a lot of time behind the wheel driving across America to work on checking off items on our bucket list.  We traded in - reluctantly as it had been such a good vehicle - our 2010 RX350 that had just turned over 110K miles.  While the 2010 had all of the bells and whistles of it's day, the technology had become a little dated.  We opted for a 2017 RX350 premium package with the wide screen navigation.  We brought it home and about one month later took off on a 3000 mile road trip up to Pennsylvania and Ohio from our home in San Antonio Texas.  The RX performed beyond our expectations.  The cruise control and radar/safety system worked well, but it takes some getting used to.  (BTY, the safety package is standard on the RX, something BMW, Acura and other make you pay extra)  The assistant was helpful in setting up addresses and voice commands were easy.  I especially like just saying ""I'm Hungry"" and it lists all of the restaurants nearby.  You pick a place to eat and the navigation system lays out the routing.  Overall, I love this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone wanting an upscale SUV that seats 5.  As it is only the wife and I, it fulfills all of our travel needs.UPDATE - March 2018 - We have made several trips to the Northeast and to Mississippi since we purchased this vehicle.  It has performed wonderfully.  We have become more familiar with the technology and it is very useful on the road.  We are planning another trip once spring comes to the northeast.  We want to take a trip out west sometime in the fall.  One note, I was worried about the light color of leather getting dirty quickly or absorbing color from clothes - especially blue jeans.  This has turned out not to be an issue after a little research on You Tube as I purchased a good leather cleaner and conditioner and it cleaned the seats right up..  Absolutely no problems with the RX - it rides smoothly and is very quiet.  Looking forward to many more miles behind the wheel.  I also want to say I receive excellent service and support from my Lexus dealer, North Park Lexus at the Dominion and the free car washes for life are a very nice perk!!",5
4723, on 08/03/17 06:26 AM (PDT),My Mistake ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),My Mistake," This car is a perfect example of a good model gone bad.  The drive train in the 2017 is not smooth or powerful, resulting in a herky jerky performance and uneven power even when the throttle is steady.  It also has a way too soft suspension that results in instability when going over bumps at higher speeds, such as on an interstate.  The drive is comparable to a high mileage vehicle with weak shocks and struts.  In addition, the bluetooth set up is both confusing and difficult to navigate.  So if you want a new model that is both unattractive because of grill styling,  drives like a pig, and is a step down in bluetooth, this is the vehicle for you.

4725, on 07/04/17 22:21 PM (PDT),John Bowling ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),"Very nice car except engine groan, trans hunts"," My wife's car, but I drive when we are together; about 75% of total miles. I am getting used to the engine groaning. The 8-speed transmission regularly upshifts when it can't maintain speed and shifts back down within four seconds, then repeats. It is the constant attempt to keep engine revs under 1,800 rpm for fuel economy that causes the groaning and very slight vibration. The engine is laboring, even under the light throttle of a gentle driver, the revs are so low. Downshifting manually a gear or two completely eliminates it, making the engine very smooth and quiet. The transmission is reluctant to downshift when speed drops on a hill with throttle still applied. When climbing a steep hill into our neighborhood, I must make a sharp turn. I feather the throttle to time my speed reduction to reach 6 or 7 mph as I reach the sharp corner, still climbing steeply. As I turn it gets steeper and I add throttle. The speed drops further because it's still in third gear. The torque converter sounds like it is being abused. The car slows to about two mph, slower than I want to go before dropping to second, but if I add enough throttle to make it downshift when it should it would surge ahead too strongly for the turn. It never selects first, which is what is needed. I now shift manually every time I climb any hill to prevent these problems. When I do, the engine is quiet, smooth, sounds happy at 2,000-2,500 rpm and of course there is no hunting. The transmission programming must have been done on flat land with fuel economy paramount. Positive effects are my gentle driving and their crummy programming have produced 25.5 mpg combined over many tanks of gas, which is well above EPA estimates. Beating EPA estimates by 15% is typical for me, but I can do it without such substandard transmission performance. One last transmission observation; when cruising gently, then deciding to pass, upon adding a lot of throttle suddenly the car does nothing for almost two seconds as it thinks, revs, drops several gears (all at once, to its credit) and finally takes off. Planning is required. Otherwise a great car. Very quiet, smooth riding, nice seat and steering wheel memory setup, 10,000 mi oil changes, very high quality materials with the luxury pkg. Lane Keeping Assist rarely works. Neither headlight system available, standard or optional, turns the headlights with the steering wheel, even though it is badly needed for curvy back road driving. Lexus incorrectly calls both systems ""adaptive,"" which has always meant headlights swivelling with the steering wheel. Cornering lights with the optional LED headlights are very helpful when turning, but their light does not reach the light from the headlights and leaves a big dark area between them. Swiveling headlights would fix that. My BMW's truly adaptive bi-xenons with cornering lights that meet the edges of the high beams are far superior. Adaptive Bi-xenon means both low and high beams swivel. Wonderful for curvy roads, which is all we have around here. My tread depth gauge shows fast tire wear despite 98th percentile on gentleness. Power steering is easy at low speeds, as it should be. Overhead view with backup camera beside it can be selected to display automatically at 6 mph and below. It is terrific for parking. My wife loves this car. I like it a lot despite its flaws.Update Jan. 2018. Now back in Texas, our permanent home, the hills are gone and so are the groans and my dissatisfaction. The car shines in severe weather. The automatic seat heaters work great, the HVAC warms or cools the car quickly with less noise than thought possible and the seats are ultra comfortable (luxury package). The overhead camera system continues to satisfy.  It is wonderful for parking straight in the middle of a parking space. Niggles - the cargo net came with a useless vinyl case that interferes with its function and I had to move it forward to the shopping bag hooks to get it out of the way and leave some room behind it for bigger things. Like every car I have ever seen, the spare is installed with the inflation valve facing down so that a very heavy wheel and tire (20"") has to be lifted to air it up.  It is so heavy I put it back in upside down and even though it cannot be bolted down.We both habitually select SPORT on the rotary transmission selector in front of the armrest, and arm the conventional cruise control which we prefer (hold button on end of stalk in for three seconds) every time we start the car.  The transmission is much more responsive in SPORT and worth any small reduction in gas mileage.  The adaptive cruise control is nice on a long trip, but it slows down so smoothly when coming up behind slower traffic that I don't notice, and interferes with my carefully timed passing plan. We love that the power windows slow down before stopping. There is no perfect car and this is a nice one.",4

We previously leased a 2015 RX; when the dealer provided us with a 2016 loaner for a few days, we used the opportunity for the ultimate test drive.  Our decision was easy - as much as we loved the refinement of the third generation RX, the fourth generation provided a more rugged durability that makes it an ""everyday"" car rather than a ""night on the town"" car.  We have driven our 2017 RX for three months, and have put it through every type of driving condition except snow - in-city, suburban, freeway, winding two-lane highway, rain (lots of that here in the Pacific Northwest).  We have hauled around three adult passengers for extended periods.  Each time, the vehicle has performed well, and everyone has commented on their comfort.  I have carefully listened for engine vibration that so many other owners have mentioned between 1,500 and 2,000 RPM, and I just don't hear it.  The car is certainly ""throatier"" than the previous RX, but I expected that to come with the edgier, sportier handling that was lacking.  At speed, this RX is just as silent but handles better and provides better viewing angles from the driver's seat.  My partner recently said, ""I thought I'd miss our old car, but I don't."" Neither do I. PROS: safety technology, cabin comfort, interior quiet, panoramic moonroof (option), Mark Levinson sound system (option), increased handling, automation (parking brake, seat heat/cool, lights, wipers).  CONS: outdated infotainment operating technology, intermittent buzzing/humming near glovebox that can only be heard near idle and with stereo off/low, wiper blades cannot be accessed, less rear cargo room",5
4727, on 06/16/17 12:38 PM (PDT),Peter Billings ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Unhappy in the ATL," I have owned a 2002 1st generation RX300. Bought it as a CPO and loved it. Smooth, tight, solid in everyway. It had good road feel. This new 2017 4th generation is none of those things. Even though my wife bought this car for the luxury and comfort of Lexus, it only partially delivers on that. The feel of the steering feels so disengaged from the road. My 2011 Genesis had complaints about its electric steering but it is orders of magnitude better. The 12"" Navigation works but it is a mess. Steep learning curve and it is difficult to manage while driving. You really need to pull over or futz with it at stop lights. But the biggest issue is the lousy buzzing feel we get through the pedal and floor board of the driver. Mostly when the engine is under load. Lexus is being very cagy about this. Sometimes there is an admission of the problem, and other times, you get an answer of ""this is normal"". Its' either an exhaust issue, tranny issue, or engine mount issue. This is at least the consensus on clublexus.com (be sure to read the over 60 page thread on this topic before you buy this car.) I wish I had.",2

Sorry!.....I rented the 2017 RX350 for a couple of days while my 2007 RX 350 was in the shop. Ugh, I did try to maintain a positive attitude about this vehicle, but there was very little I liked about it. Yes, the outside styling is ugly, period, (I was embarrassed to be seen in it) but this time I got a good hands-on look at the interior.Where do I start? I totally dislike the huge cumbersome floor console between the front seats. My 2007 has space there. I can reach to the floor of the passenger side if I need to. The analog clock is annoying. Why put a shiny reflective rim around it, light up the hatch marks in the dark, but the hands remain  unlit. You can't see the time during the day if the outside light is wrong for the clock, and at night, the hatch marks, although lit up, ...everyone knows where 1,2,3 is on a clock, but it's the HANDS you need to see for the time and they are not luminescent. They are of shiny plastic.The things I see clearly in my older version are what are important to me - temperature (I am a farmer) and time. In this thing, I cannot read the displays behind the steering wheel unless I put on glasses that I cannot wear while driving!The trims are transformer-like and gaudy. Shiny silver plastic on some, dull grey plastic on others. And it looks like it was a kit assembled. The steering wheel has multiple parts that look cheap and has a dry cheap feel. My older version, aaaahhhh, so comfortable to the touch, clean, elegant yet sporty, rosewood and wonderful stitched leather that you find in a car twice the price. Perfect Japanese efficient elegance. The interior of this new version looks like a cheap Nissan, or an older american car when they used to add this and that, this gaudiness and that gaudiness, thinking it was ""luxury"" when it was only cheap looking gew gaw.This new version is noiser than my 2007. When stopped to make a turn across traffic, I'd keep thinking there was a window cracked open when a car whizzed by. Perhaps it's the added little window sections by the rear view mirrors?Then there is that huge thing sticking up in the center of the dash. Ugly. You can't get rid of it. It makes for a nice map if you need that (but, who doesn't use Google Maps now?) but otherwise, if you use the radio, that pay radio station is there in big text whether you want it or not and you have to take the attention off the road to cycle past it. And again, the metallic trim does not help, only clutters an already cluttered looking interior. Trying to use the mouse to get around that menu is horrible. Skips around and it takes many tries to land on the desired icon.Visibility in my 2007 is not great. Visibility in this 2017 is noticeably worse.Why haven't they put in a double visor? It's been years and years now, and still no double visor? And, my coffee holder, to the left of the steering wheel, is GONE.The radio and air buttons below the dash are tiny and unreadable.  I would have to memorize them in order to utilize them while driving.The style of this console looks like that of an old car of the 70's, cluttered, hard to read. Whether it's old or young eyes looking at the console information, it should be VERY easy to read. For safety sake, for heaven's sake.Shiny plastic, dull plastic, too many parts piled upon one another. Such an added expense IMO yet such a loss of elegance and style.The engine is probably more powerful than mine, yet, it has the exact same choke/dead zones when changing gears. We also have a Toyota Tundra that accelerates beautifully and does not have those annoying swallows when you want to accelerate. And, BTW, the dash is totally readable. I think it's a 2011.I could go on and on but for what? The car I had once wanted to drive for the rest of my life is gone. RIP RX 350. My 2007 is near 250000 miles, costing my plenty of money now for repairs, as I still haven't found a decent replacement. That perfect Japanese efficient elegance, is it gone forever?",2

Soaks up bumps and pot holes like a champ, which is appreciated where the roads aren't so great. It's not a performance car by any means, but it's got plenty of get-up for my tastes. I love all the driver assistant technology (dynamic cruise control, lane keep assist, blind spot monitor, heads up display, etc.) and parking assist functions. I think it looks great inside and out and I get a ton of compliments. I truly believe this is the best interior in it's class, I opted for the bamboo and parchment and it's really slick looking.  My only major gripe is the navigation system which is basically garbage compared to Google maps.

After about 6 weeks, I was told that my claim can’t be honored because I failed to prove that it is a manufacture’s defect.  Thoroughly drive this car to ensure it does not have the same problem. Check recalls.gov for complaints that have been filed with the same problem. 2016 and 2017 models are affected.

4740, on 04/30/17 16:22 PM (PDT),waldograph ,2017 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Expected way MORE from Lexus!," Me and my wife bought this RX350 almost a year ago, and she drives it 75% of the time. We are in our early 40's,our first luxury vehicle, previously owned: Isuzu, 2 Hondas, Toyota, Mazda, and 2 Subarus. Recently we took a road trip from Chicago – Miami ( 3,000 mile R/T). Vehicle currently has 15,000 miles and after I read all the mixed reviews I decided to help the undecided. Except for 2 free scheduled maintenances (5,000 and 10,000) car was never in service for any issues. Exterior design: you will either love it or hate it, no comments here, it is a matter of opinion. The good: 1. Luxury interior design with quality and soft materials. 2. Very roomy and quiet cabin, with absolutely no “plastic” squeaking. 3. Comfortable ride, not too soft, not too firm. 4. Very quiet up/down window operation. 5. Lots of room in the back seat. 6. Adjustable rear seats. 7. Great basic speakers. 8. Very convenient front heating seats. 9. Under the trunk floor actual spare tire, not like European competition just repair kit. The bad: 1. Grinding (drone) noise while slow take off around 1,500-2,000 rpm. Reported to Dealer during scheduled maintenance and the answer was: vehicle is operating normally. 2. Transmission forcing higher gears / lower rpm’s to save gas, this makes Eco and Normal modes annoying, Sport mode okay, keeping higher rpm’s and lower gears makes the drive a pleasure. 3. While idle, lots of vibrations of steering wheel, gear shifter and center console. 4. Throttle response is very, very slow (measured 0.6s). 5. When I start the car during cold months, it makes constant, a loud knocking “diesel like” sound in the engine, disappearing as vehicle warms up. Complained during 10,000 maintenance, and technician takes me to another brand new RX350. We started it and it sound like mine. He explained that high pressure fuel pump in the engine when it’s cold makes this type of sound and this is normal...? 6. Using the infotainment is very difficult, and screen menus are not intuitive at all. 7. Never know if AC is on or off, no indicator light or “old fashion” basic on/off switch. To check if AC is on or off you must  go thru complicated 4 menu screens...unbelievable!  AC compressor defaults to on, even when it's 10F outside.  8. Trip odometers switches are hidden on the left side behind steering wheel. Even when stopped it is hard to locate and re-set trip odometer. 9. The front passenger door needs heavy force to close. I oiled it and closing is a bit smoother. 10. On the passenger side the chrome window trim has about 6 dents which we discovered the next day after we purchased. It looks like someone who installed the trim in the factory did this damage. 11. Transmission  is confusing sometimes and not sure what to do, hesitates when you give gas. When you add gas the throttle slowly responds and you ends up with one of two: rabbit jump, or turtle motion! 12. Automatic rear hatch closing or opening very, very slow.13. No beep signal when vehicle is locked from the key fob, you are never sure from the distance if vehicle is secured. 14. Tiny holes on the seats makes it easy for crumbs to get stuck in  15. Not even an option to order heated rear seats. Think, and make your own decision before heading to store with your 50,000.",2

MDX has good acceleration/passing and excellent cornering.

I took it to a dealer but all they said was there was nothing wrong with the car!!  I got sickened with their response and decided to switch to RX 350 and I think I made a good decision so far.

I have also owned and driven a Lexus LX 470 for 10 years and compared to that monstrous SUV this RX has been such a joy to drive plus the MPG is something that you can't even compare.  Ive been averaging around  22-24 mpg in this car compared to the LX I only got around 12-15 mpg.I got the black AWD 3.5 V6 edition and not the F sport.  The only real differences that I disliked in this model compared to the F sport is the plasticky spindle grill and the size of the tires 18 vs 20. I also have a regular size sunroof vs the panoramicOtherwise my two tone , cream and brown interior is gorgeous, I have the upgrade 13 in screen, heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats, back up cameras, parking assist etc.My model was lacking the wireless phone charger which I'm bummed about and it didn't come with the Lexus self drive system which is a glorified lane assist system.  I managed to test that twice when I had a loaner car and the precision of the car for it to stay in the lane driving at 75mph or faster was quite impressive.  It was almost like I was driving a Tesla.Styling: Rating  9.8  I love the wide spindle grill in the front and the floating roof line.  It's very futuristic and quite a departure from the old school boring  RXs of the past.I was looking into getting the Audi Q5 and when I saw this car I was immediately in love and forgot about the Audi.RideRating 9.7Its buttery smooth and very pleasant.I do put the car in ECO mode 99% of the time so it does drive softer and slightly less under powered than when  I have it on Sport mode.MaterialsRating 9.3Very high quality plastics and leather.Its soft touch plastics everywhere except the corner where the left of the steering wheel is at.

The screen is huge and it splits and its gorgeous.The controls though are clumsy and very tedious to use especially when you’re driving and trying to click on something on the screen using that mouse stick.TERRIBLE.

I have had is a couple of years .  I bought a Lexus because my Camry was virtually  repair free year after year.  I kept that gem for 10 years.  Today , at barely 4 years of age the car has a radiator leak problem.  Apparently the parts are made from plastic and in the heat,,, yes it is hot here, the plastic breaks down and we have a leak.  Apparently to fix this requires that the whole bumper has to come off resulting in at least 5 hours of work and over $500 just for the labor.  I was stunned!  Please do not tell me that every 4 years I am going to have to have the radiator fixed or repaired.  This is for us a major financial issue and one I think people should know about.It is interesting to go back and read this.  The Lexus repair guy lied to me.  Before I had it repaired I took it to another Lexus dealer and we determined that was absolutely NO leaking radiator.  Needless to say we do not take our cars to that dealership anymore. We travelled 11,000 miles in the car this past summer through Canada and the US.

I've owned it just over 2 years. I absolutely LOVE this thing. I don't have the ""drone"". The only thing I dislike about the whole vehicle is the famed  trans shifting  foible. I know why it happens. It's because they map this transmission to get to the top gears ASAP to get the closest to the stated mileage numbers. Under normal acceleration from a stop, my RX350 will be in the 8th gear (top gear) before 30MPH. This ""lugs"" the poor engine as this beast weighs 4222lbs. empty. No wonder many have a ""drone""! That drone is the lugging I just described. The remedies are as follows: around town, use ""sport"" mode in where it'll hold out shifting to a higher RPM. The other tip is, in ""eco"" mode, it actually will shift a bit smoother than ""normal"" range, and it helps to keep a steady accelerator foot so the computer can ""learn"". I do hope Lexus has a transmission re-program one guy in here mentioned-to lift the ""anchor"" of rapid upshifts. I'll jump on that with mine next visit.

My wife thinks the front seats in my F-model are a bit too firm, but she likes a cushy ride. I drive a lot and now don’t have any lower back issues for the first time in my adult life, so it would be hard for me to find fault with the comfort of these seats. The F-model looks super aggressive, which I love.  This car is not as sporty as it looks, but it has plenty of power and performance. It’s not an AMG MB by any stretch, but it also costs half as much. It has adequate trunks/cargo storage, but if you have 5 people and luggage, it can get tight once you load presents and luggage for a family holiday’s-style trip. It’s been flawless with the exception of a lot of wind buffeting on the panoramic roof when open. I finally took it to dealer and they changed the rubber seals, which significantly reduced the noise. I really wish I had thought of that sooner. Just a great car. It gets a lot of compliments in black. The seat coolers are okay - I live in a fairly hot/humid city and once the car’s black interior gets hot in a parking lot, it takes a while to cool down. On all but the warmest days, the autocooled seats, which integrate seamlessly with the auto-climate control do an excellent job. The seat fan is kind of loud when on high, sounds a bit like you are waiting for your jet plane to taxi. Sound system is excellent, which I’m fairly certain is partially responsible for my newer hearing loss (thank you Mark Levinson). The lane keep assist only works on straight-aways with newer painted street lane markers. It will let you coast right out of your lane, so don’t rely on it. Other vehicles have more sophisticated systems that do a much better job. The adaptive cruise is nice, but it is super conservative and shuts down in heavy traffic, so it’s not the perfect stop and go solution. Also, when driving in regular traffic, the adaptive cruise doesn’t accelerate very fast, which causes you to make others slow down if you don’t override the system. For example, you are slowed down automatically because you approach a slower moving vehicle in your lane. So, you switch lanes to pass them. It then increases speed at about one mile per second. Anybody coming up in the passing lane behind you thinks you are a real jerk. Not a huge thing, but it’s just too conservative/slow to resume your previous speed without manually stepping on the gas.I have driven 41k miles in less than 2 years. I enjoy it and would buy this vehicle again.",5

I loved them all for their quiet refinement and great reliability.  I thought I’d try the luxury RX350 and bought a new 2016 version.  What a mistake.  I like the cars style but the driving experience is very unrefined.  The drivetrain is crude sounding and the transmission shifts like a manual transmission with a bad clutch.  A noticeable vibration occurs at about 1500 rpm and makes the engine sound like a cheap 4 cylinder from the 1980’s.  The supposedly cheaper Toyota’s  were much more refined.  Can’t believe they call this a luxury car.  The infotainment system is so poorly designed that it is borderline dangerous to use.  Have driven loaners from the 2017 model year and they are little better.  Very poor value compared to the sister Toyota division. Have complained repeatedly to Lexus and they say the car operates normally.  If you consider an RX I’d recommend a very LONG test drive.  Wish I had done the same but expected at least the same and hopefully a better experience than with Toyota division products.  Be forewarned that Lexus Corporte will not have your back when problems occur.",3

I don't have the panoramic roof, no LED headlight lighting, (that I wish I had, I miss my side turning lights) it didn't come with lighted door sills, (and I kind of liked those on the 2008, so I checked to see if the wiring was there(it was) and I ordered new door sills with LED ""LEXUS"" - these both easily click into the supplied harness and the old ones easily snap  out and the new ones snap in) it didn't have the Levinson audio system, (""THAT,"" simply isn't needed-standard system is amazing sounding, 12 speakers I think, and all the power a reasonable person needs) and there is at least one other feature we could have got that I can't recall.  The ride is good, but I think the 20"" tires ride ""less comfortably"" than the vehicle we drove with the smaller tires, but I'm not sure.   It's definitely a comfortable ride but somewhat firm if that makes any sense.  I like to drive the vehicle in ""SPORT"" mode.  Just seems to have better throttle response and the shift points seem different.  The transmission is smooth for the most part but can, I don't know that this is the right word, but irritate you a bit if you get a little aggressive with the throttle.  Now that might be good, (you definitely want it to solidly lock into gear quickly) but it can ""hard shift"" at times.  I like the 8-speed transmission though.  Most of the time you simply don't notice it.  The steering assist takes some getting used to.  It will stay in its lane if the lane shifts are very gradual, but the car is NOT intended to self-drive.  In fact, it will beep and tell you to put your hands back on the steering wheel in seconds if there is no user input to the steering wheel.  I'm not sure how helpful the ""TAKE A BREAK"" msg is or ever will be.  I was surprised to see that come up.  It doesn't help and doesn't seem to be something helpful the ""way"" and when its implemented.   You know when you are tired and can't safely continue in my opinion.   The 2008 we traded was quiet.  This one seems even quieter.  The trailer hitch package is really nice.  (trailer hitch went on in easily 20 minutes with convenient trailer interface point pre-wired)   Rear seats can be moved forward and back and reclined.  I understand why they (LEXUS designers might have done it, but, I kind of miss the cute pushbuttons that were on the 2008 RX, that were for the various rear compartments near the spare tire.  There is some room, but it doesn't seem as well thought out on the 2016 as it was on the 2008.   I like the hidden rear wiper.  (comes out from under the rear airfoil)  Holding your hand over the rear emblem can be a bit finicky at times.  It ""eventually"" works, but I might as well use the remote or the deck lid switch for a solid reliable quick activation.   My favorite feature is the radar lock on the vehicle ahead, ESPECIALLY in city stop and go traffic.  My only dislike so far in this system is that it doesn't accelerate quickly once the car in front starts up again.   It's so slow it would irritate the drivers behind you if you wait for the car to get up to speed with no driver input.   I still don't know that I like the LKA system.  It does alert you when you depart the lane with no blinker on.  If it actually kept the vehicle reliably in the lane it might be interesting.  It's more....""A suggestion"" or maybe a notification and it gives MANY false alarms.  (esp. going up a little rise in the road- the camera seems to lose site of the lines on the road)  Interior LED lighting is excellent.  Seat heating system doesn't provide enough air for my tastes even at maximum.  I also wish it (seat fan) was quieter and independent of the main fan speed.  I like the joystick, but it takes a great deal of care to get it where you need it to go.  There has to be a better way and still keep the joystick.  I really don't want to look away from the road to finally get the joystick to the right point on one of the screens.  The IPHONE start/stop engine, door locks, etc. are sluggish.  I'll do it but when I feel like getting to it sort of thing.   It does locate the car in a large parking lot pretty quickly though.  (requires subscription based ENFORM app)  I really like being able to use regular grade gas now.  GAS door locks with doors (nice)  Paint is flawless and ours is a beautiful metallic red.  I may have to put my wife in a hospital if something happens to the paint... :)  (like a scratch)  We like the new grill style.  (a lot)  No headlight washers on this car for what that's worth, but the 2008 had them.  Might be an option we don't have like with the LED headlamps.   If I mentioned anything that makes you feel we are not satisfied with the car, we're definitely satisifed.  It's a really nice machine...",5

This June we traded in a 2006 GX 470 for a 1 year old RX 350. While I never thought I would give up my big SUV, the year with the RX convinced me that I had to have one as well. This car is an incredible all around vehicle, and now I can say that it is a joy to own 2 of them! I could go on for a couple of pages on all the aspects of these cars that we love, but to some it up, comfort, handling, gas mileage, looks, and yes, I LOVE the electronics. This is the main reason I wanted to write this review. The entertainment system in this car gets a lot of hate around here.  So bad actually, that I was hesitant to even buy our first RX because of what was said. I will tell you that when you first start using it, the joystick seems out of control, and I can see why people complain. However, after reading up on the system and practicing on it while the vehicle was standing still, it is the coolest control center in an automobile I have ever used. The joystick and the display are so intuitive that I've gotten to the point where I don't even have to look at the screen to get done what I need to get done. Plus, the voice activation system (if you take the time to learn how to use it) is quite amazing. I have learned how perform the bulk of my tasks with my voice. It really doesn't get much better. So, if you go down and drive one of these things and get turned off by the controls on the entertainment system, fear not, soon you will be guiding the joystick like a pro and landing on SAT without even trying.",5

Lexus dealers and service managers are saying the vehicle is operating normally and this is a characteristic of this newly redesigned model.  The transmission which is tuned for gas mileage also does a lot of ""gear hunting"" which it's unsure what gear to be in so the transmission is always up shifting and down shifting constantly.

I previously switched to BMW, and after I was on a first name basis with the service manager at my local BMW dealer, I switched back to Lexus before my BMW warranty ended - the repair bills were terrifying. I generally prefer to buy one year old cars because of the significant depreciation.  However,  in this case, the performance and looks of the newly designed RX F-Sport were dramatically improved, and I couldn't bring myself to go with the old egg shape RX. The F-sport design of the 2016 and newer models is much more aggressive. I get a lot of compliments on it. Honestly, it is not as fast as it looks, but when in the S+ mode, you get enough oomph from a car that carries it's passengers in total luxury, near silence, safety, and reliability. The interior of the F-Sport is extremely attractive, with the hand stitched leather, carbon dash trim, etc.  I bought a black model with black interior and every option available.  I don't have any regrets as I love the safety and technology. The only part that strikes me as goofy is the panoramic sunroof. It looks great and everyone loves it when they ride in my car. Unfortunately, it barely opens up, which is really strange considering the size of the giant panoramic roof. Interestingly, I have ridden in convertibles with less wind buffeting (when the roof is open at around 25 mph). If you decide to go with the panoramic roof, drive around with it open in town a bit, to make sure it doesn't hurt your ears. This design flaw is totally out of place. I have 25,500 miles on my car and bought it one year ago. I would buy this car again and have no regrets.  After having totaled my previous Lexus, I was very concerned with safety. The auto braking system is awesome. I live in Houston and people love to slam on their brakes on the interstate. It works. The lane keep assist isn't really that amazing, but it at least helps keep the car centered in the lane. Some people aren't a fan of the more aggressive and sportier design. While I love the new style, I found the old egg RX shape a bit of a snooze fest. It has acceptable storage, but we quickly learned my wife's GX holds MUCH more in the trunk than my little RX commuter vehicle. This is a great vehicle and 100% worthy of consideration. If you just lease your cars and don't worry about what it's like to own them 3+ years out, I would also check out the Audi's. But if you want a car that will never leave you stranded with tons of technology, check out the 2016 RX F-Sport.  There is a reason Lexus has had the best selling mid-size luxury SUV for years.",5
4791, on 12/17/16 10:24 AM (PST),Philip Lane ,2016 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Buyer's Remorse," Numerous idiotic design ""features"" that give you a pain in the butt. Too many to list, so here are some highlights: Why does it only unlock the driver's door?  Once inside, my friends have to wait while I fumble for the unlock button. The one-touch rear hatch opener almost never works. You can't listen to the radio and have your phone navigate, like you could with a normal car.  AC compressor defaults to on, even when it's freezing outside. Complicated menu sequence required to turn it off - distracted driving at it's finest. Terrible throttle response, you could get killed waiting for it to rev up and downshift through about 6 gears.  You have to accelerate with a lead foot or else it upshifts too far, and then has to downshift again. It buzzes on a rough road - coming from the headliner area, right side. Heater has numerous cold spots, with cold air blowing on my left ear and foot, unless you crank it up to about 80 degrees. Auto-dimming mirror doesn't work.  You can't just flip it up, can't even raise it high enough manually, due to lack of travel. Why does the radio stop just because you start the engine? AM is totally muffled, even with the treble and midrange cranked. Why won't the windows roll down unless the engine is running? A manual crank would work better. WTF is with the door locks? I left the engine idling, went around to the passenger side to get something and it refused to unlock, so had to go back to the driver's side, open the door, and hit the unlock button, and then walk around to the passenger side again. The steering is way too stiff! It's worse on on the freeway than in a parking lot. My old arthritic hands can't handle it. I guess they  think that's ""sporty"". The steering wheel heater is near-useless, since it only heats small leather strips at 9 and 3 o'clock - also it won't turn on automatically, even though the seat heaters do. You can't put your hands on the bottom of the wheel, since there's a giant ""spoke"" blocking it. Do not buy this car, unless you like to be frustrated.Update: Tried to find an SUV I liked better. Volvo had better steering, but was way too small on the interior. At least the Lexus has enough space. Too bad the seat won't go far enough back if it's raised up high. Lowering it moves it back at a 45 degree angle. LAME. I'm thinking about a Buick Lacrosse. Steering was nice and light, not truck-like, and the seat was pretty good. There was enough room, but not much more. The mid-sized Mercedes SUV drove really nicely! Great steering feel and response, and power. Interior is a bit too small though, my right knee bangs on the console.Update: Took it in to get an oil leak fixed. They had to pull the engine just to change a gasket. Then they damaged the oil cooler lines putting it back in. Took over a week. Had to scuttle our planned road trip, which wasn't the worst thing, since anywhere we wanted to go was 99 degrees!To those who ""disliked"" this review: I hope you enjoy your new POS! Don't say I didn't warn you.",2

The 2015 is an awesome ride, my wife's car I drive on weekends and enjoy it. I do not like the Dunlop tires but will soon be replacing. Yesterday we dropped the car off for service and were given a 2016 RX350 as a loaner for the day. We jumped on I95 and headed south from West Palm Beach to Boca Raton and stopped for a while. First impressions, hated the looks from the first time I saw it but figured it would grow on us but it hasn't.  Having said that, my wife who is 5'4 and 130 pounds could not get comfortable at all.  Seats are way too hard and she actually wound up sitting side saddle to make it bearable.  I am 6' 200 pounds and the drivers seat in addition to being way too hard was way too thin and short. I rented a highlander a few months ago and brought it back it was so uncomfortable this was the same. In addition, very cramped driver area compared to the 2015 and the controls are crammed in and in dumb places.  Not intuitive at all, this was a fully loaded premium top of the line model.  We got past the fact that we felt like we were in a tight little car and then started to critique the driving feel and features. It had radar controlled cruise control, what a disaster, way too sensitive, found the car braking for cars in the adjacent lane at times and at one point took me from 80 to 65 in an instant, terrible system had to shut it down.  Every once in a while upon acceleration a groaning noice came from out of nowhere, couldn't stand it. Next and most important, the steering is terrible, don't know how to explain it other than notchy, not smooth at all almost felt like it was sticking at certain points and had to be jerked back and forth on the highway. Then there was an annoying fan running in the rear, loud, didn't take the time to investigate but it was distracting. On the way back from coconut creek to west palm we were back on I95 and again, the steering is twitchy, wandering and pulling and could not use the cruise control, kept slowing me down I thought dangerously trying to take over driving.  Hated it. Look, I am a Lexus guy, loved all my previous RX rides with the 2015 as my favorite. I do not enjoy critizing this car but seriously before you buy this car take it on the highway and give it a run.  I will be looking elsewhere for my new car, sorry Lexus, you blew this redesign big league.",3

I have had it in to the dealer twice. They could see that it doesn't work as advertised and made some adjustment. I just learned to live with (without) it. However, the other day I walked around behind the RX in the garage on my way out and apparently I triggered something that caused the back door to open. I did not realize it and backed out of the garage with the door open, causing a lot of damage.",4

But among all the issues here are some major ones: 1) In quite a few occasions, all windows and moon roof would be found open by themselves while parked in front of the house. The fob's were inside the house on the kitchen counter; Googling ""Lexus all windows and moon roof open by themselves"" finds discussions of some mentioning being a Lexus software feature, while others think it is a software defect, over 8-9 years; 2) Each time the car is started, and you try to back out of a parking spot, if you have a phone programmed to connect via bluetooth,  it generates a connection message on top of the LCD screen, blocking off the top which is the most important part of the rear view camera display. However, turning your head to see the rear would find the view was blocked by the hatch back cover. Guess the designers thought with the rear view camera, you wouldn't need to turn your head to see the rear; 3) The software menu is horrendously organized, and difficult to use; 4) It is not easy to know if the AC is on, and it is not easy to turn it off via the menu on the LCD screen. Go try to turn off AC  next time you sit in a Lexus RX350 -- mind you that the AC could be still on even if the ""Auto"" AC led on the button is off.  And many more smaller nits, such as the steering wheel making scratching sound when turning, etc. The Lexus RX350 quality and design are not what I expected it to be before I purchased it.",2

I have not taken my 2016 RX 350 into service yet, but from other reviewers who have already been in service and got nothing done so I decided not to waste my time and anguish to argue with these repair tech. it is definitely a flaw in this new 2016 design.

It has become an around town car and very disturbing that the Dealer has no idea why it's vibrating after experiencing and agreeing it is not normal. Lexus has also been called and they do have other vehicle with the same problem, but to remedy or how to fix it. Pathetic to say the least as our family has had seven Lexus vehicles and now that we have retired we downsized to one vehicle. The RX350. Not pleased with Lexus or our Dealer with a car just over 5,000. Oh, forgot to make note that the dealer has known about this problem when I brought this to their attention at 994 miles on the Vehicle. Beware RX350 owners as you may not even realize you have a problem. We purchased our RX350 in January 2016 and the vibration has, in my mind, is caused by a faulty engine or transmission.",2
4799, on 10/30/16 17:45 PM (PDT),Neil ,2016 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8A),No longer trust Lexus," I bought RX350 2016 on Nov 2015, which is the first batch of that model onboard the US. I finally give this review because I cannot tolerate the car any longer due to the low quality. I purchased Lexus because I trust the most reliable vehicle brand, but the car I purchased makes me feel disappointed. I cannot imagine such a luxury expensive car has problems that should not deliver to market. Following points are the issues that annoy me a lot.1.	The floor of driver and passenger seats are not flat. The inner side of the floor is higher than the outer side. I never see the similar design on other cars. We feel very uncomfortable every time when I or the passenger put feet on the floor. Imagine you sit in a luxury car but one leg high one leg low.I reported this issue to the dealer. They said this is not a problem. All other RX350 2016 are same. I don’t agree with them. Even all cars of this model are same, it just indicates that the problem happens on all this model. There is no excuse for such bad experience on such level of the car.2.	The air conditioning system is noisy.The air conditioning system has obvious noise when it runs after 5 – 10 minutes. The noise sounds like somewhere of the car is leaking fluid. I reported this issue to the dealer. They acknowledged this problem and tried to fix it. They replaced the refrigerating fluid but the issue is still there. Finally, they said all other same model has this issue. It’s not my car’s problem. It’s the problem of the air conditioner, and the air conditioner is provided by a vendor of Lexus.3.	The MPG never reach the designed value.The car specification says the MPG of this car is “City 19/Hwy 26/Comb 22”. I drive the car 80% on highway. My highest MPG is 19.1. Is this a kind of false propaganda? Give a number that cannot be reached by customers.  I think this is same to the fake emissions incident happened on Volkswagen.4.	The passenger door needs heavier force to close.The passenger has to use heavier force to close the passenger door. The same force can close other doors but cannot close passenger door. I reported this issue to the dealer twice. The first time they acknowledged the issue, but engineer says they cannot fix it. The second time they just said cannot repro this issue. But 80% of the time my wife need to close the door twice, failed one time and use heavier force to close it again.5.	The car does not support Unicode characters.I am not a native English speaker, I often listen to songs with other languages like Chinese, Japanese and Korean. I also have a lot of contacts that stored with Chinese names. The car shows all non-English characters as empty. It’s 2016, and it’s Lexus. I told this to a lot of people, they all cannot believe Lexus does not support a function that most other lower brand cars supported.Above problems annoy me every day every second when I use it. I trust Lexus so I decided to purchase it before I see the real car. Until now I still cannot believe this car is produced by Lexus. I also tried several months after I found these defects, I hope I can tolerate these issues after I used to them. Finally, I failed. I feel very unhappy with this car. It brings me a lot of pressure. Every day when I step on the slanted floor, when I hear the noise, when I ask my wife to close the door heavier, when I listen to songs, when I drive it, I feel frustrated and worriment. I think I cannot keep in this status any longer. It is very dangerous to drive with it. My wife also feel very scared when she hears the leaking voice. She feels the car will explode sooner or later.So, be careful when you are considering this car, even considering Lexus. They are not as reliable as they said.",1

Purchased the gorgeous infared color 2015 RC 350 F Sport that I absolutely love and plan on keeping. I purchased the first RX 300 in 1999, then a 2006 RX 330, a 2015 RX 350, and now the 2017 RX 350.  I have loved them all, though now seeing the older RX models they definitely look outdated.  The 2015 is still a looker but compared to the new RX design, is quickly getting that outdated, old egg shaped look.  I just purchased a Black on Black 2017 RX 350, I love it!.....The exterior gives the magical, mystical, long, shiny, sleek look of a black panther, still keeping that classy look, More modern, and Sets it apart from all the other SUVs on the road, you always know it is Lexus.  This is definitely for the bold, beautiful, and magnificent who dare to be different.......the leaders and not the followers.  I didn't think Lexus could top the 2015 Model but they have done it.  Got the luxury package and all the upgraded packages as well.  The triple beam headlights are a must and light the corners and whole surrounding area when turning remarkably well, like Iv'e never seen before an any car/SUV.  The Mark Levinson Stereo system sounds incredible.  The interior is still as pretty with the luxury package, and a tad bit more room.  Still has the classic smooth ride of luxury.  I believe the other auto makers will soon follow and try to compete.

If Lexus isn’t willing to offer functional floor mats, they just shouldn’t offer any at all.My major complaint is with the over-priced navigation system, which we didn’t want to begin with. It frequently suggests routes that are NOT efficient. When engaged, the map itself is usually accurate, but the verbal and text directions are often 180 degrees wrong. When I brought this to the attention of the dealer’s service department, they suggested I buy an update, with NO guarantee the problem would be resolved. This has spooked my Wife to the point that I bought her a Garmin nuvi 2599, with lifetime updates and traffic and that’s what we use in lieu of the built-in.I’m not sure the frontal Pre-Collision System works.

Cons: nav system so-so; not cheap.   It is funny to read those negative reviews about the Lexus RX. My guess is some of them are written by BMW/MB/Audi dealers. Lexus pioneered the luxury SUV and has been the sales leader in luxury SUVs from the beginning. It is obvious their European competitors are doing everything they can to knock down Lexus. The styling of the new Lexus RX is amazing. If you take the BMW/MB/Audi SUVs, remove their nameplates and their styling for many models are exactly the same. No originality! None! If you live in any metro area, 300HP is ample power. You do not need 500HP to drive around town! Bottom line is that if you want a great SUV that has a smooth ride and is reliable, go with Lexus.

The 2016 RX 350 even without the F sport package has loud noises penetrating the cabin. The shifts between gears in the new 8 speed automatic are not smooth as expected from Lexus. The RX was always a comfortable car. That is what Lexus pioneered. Suddenly they are chasing the Germans with this mid life crisis and  anahialting a big chunk of there customer base. The build quality in certain areas is impeccable - though other manufacturers are catching up. When's the last time you sat in a Lincoln Black Label trim? The Lexus RX should focus on creating two destinct models. The F sport should be sporty while the regular spec 350 should be super luxurious. I have 4 friends who have the new RX and they ALL regret not extending the lease on the 2013/2015 model they had. They feel the older body style was superior on the comfort side.

I bought this car in March of 2016 and the windshield has a problem. there is a double vision where the all the lights (cars, traffic lights, street lights) are doubled. The dealer changed it once and the problem is still there. The deal says this is the was Lexus designed the windshield, which is a lie!! I contacted Lexus customer satisfaction team and they believed the dealer without even inspecting the car. I warn you from buying these cars. It has other minor problems too. Such a waist of money.

Our 2007 RX 350 was and is amazing. 175k miles and still running strong. After only 4 months and approximately 6k miles we want to trade this end for something that works like the Lexus cars we are accostumed to.  Navigation with voice recognition is absolutely a waste of money.  Doesn't recognize common language words and is super frustrating.  Rides like a truck.  One reason we selected RX 350 over the 4Runner was for a car like ride.  Last comment is in regards to Entune.  Toyota needs to let technology companies do what they do better.

4825, on 07/08/16 11:13 AM (PDT),Don K ,2016 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Enjoying new RX!," I'll start out by saying that this is my fourth 350RX and I have now had it for only 3 days.  The first three RX's (2002, 2006 and 2010) were nothing short of fantastic.  Only one repair on any of them that cost more than $1000.  I will also admit I hated the look of the front end of this new RX so I shopped around for 3 months, looking at BMW, Mercedes, Volva and Audi.  As time went on, I did warm up to the front end look.  The sides and rear of the car, along with the interior is second to none.  I find the acceleration more than acceptable - it is an SUV, not a sports car.  It drives considerably smoother and quieter than my previous RX's and it is very agile.  The technology is a bit overwhelming but I'm working through that.  Practically everything can be done via voice - you can tune the radio or change the interior temperature, all by voice.  The GPS is a bit slow, expecially when you deviate from the originally planned route.  The seating exceptionally confortable.  We purchased this from a dealer that is 5 hours away (closest dealer is 3 hours) and driving it home was a pleasure.  The attention to detail is off the hook - the way the leather and other materials come together is awesome.  I have the safety plus sytem, and it is wonderful.  The cruise control is easy to use (same as previous years) and the new safety plus is easy to figure out.  Sometimes I would get behind someone going 65 when I had set it to 72 and the car would start slowing down, matching their speed.  The minute I moved into the left lane, it accelerated by up to my set speed.  Worked the way it was supposed to......I just had to get used to moving over into the passing lane before I got too close to a slower moving vehicle.  The sound system is a wow!  You can really rock out in this thing.  I put the soundtrack from Pirates of the Carribean on from my cell phone via bluetooth and it sounded amazing.  The whole car was vibrating from the bass and it was not turned up very loud.  All in all, I am very impressed with this vehicle.  The improvements over the past 6 years is unbelievable.  I really like the look of the BMW X3 or X5, but in hindsight they are very conservative in design.  Beautiful vehicles, but the changes each year are slight.  With the RX, the look is bold and edgy.  I could not be more happy that I went with the RX and would do it again in a heartbeat.",5

With each generation the navigation and other electronic controls get more complex and harder to use.  For some reason instead of getting faster and more responsive over the years, the computer in this car is slower and less intuitive than the earlier models.  It is on its way to the dealer for the second time because the screen has blacked out and now freezes on occasion.  I pay for the traffic package and it is not unusual to drive 10 miles after starting the car for the traffic info to show on the screen.

I am not happy with the UGLY black plastic around the wheel wells of the 2016 as it looks so cheap for a luxury car. The front seats are so hard that my back and buttocks were hurting even after trying to adjust the seating.  The navigation and entertainment is difficult to operate while driving. I don't have this issue in my 2008 or 2013.  The engine noise while accelerating is horrible; it sounds like 4cyl engine struggling to move the car.  This is not something that I would expect from Lexus.  The inside looks absolutely fantastic; however using the technology is difficult.  The AC sounds as if it's about to blow me away; however, living in Houston, TX I can appreciate that it cools very quickly as our summers can be brutal so I can deal with the noise (i guess).  My 2008 is not as noisy but it does take a minute to cool off in Texas' heat.  I hope Lexus makes some changes to the 2017 RX as I will not purchase this generation RX.",1

I also do not like the loud sound of the air conditioning system. Another issue I have is when I start the car it makes a loud knocking sound in the engine, which I am told is ""normal"" for this model. One very big problem we have is the odor in the car. It does not have that new car smell that we all love but rather a musty mildew smell......the dealership advised us to use Frebreeze!!

4838, on 05/28/16 22:33 PM (PDT),J. Liu ,2016 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 8A),Somewhat disappointed," Like many of the loyal Lexus owners.  This is my 3rd RX 350.   This is the first time I've written any review on the RX 350.   The previous were 2011 and 2015 version.   They both were great.    Although I did read all the negative comments,  but,   I still went for this 3rd RX 350, thinking, it can't be that bad.  Well,  after one week in this vehicle,   I can now see and feel all the complaints in the previous reviews. Pros:   Sportier Look, mean looking Grill,  Excellent Interior Finish,  I just had it one week,  could not comment on the Reliability.   But, the same Lexus quality, is apparent in this vehicle.   Great Warranty and Service of the Lexus dealership. Cons:  1.  Navagation and Audio control function logics  SUCKS !  ITS COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT, and operation very illogical.   Don't even think about making changes,  delete,  during driving.   The difficulty in operating the navigation system, makes it very hazardous during driving.     I'd give this a 1 star .... Very poor.     What happened here ?   Why didn't the Lexus design engineers adopt to the simple, mature, and logical operation commands of the current GPS in the market place ?    This is a major disappointment.     Although I love the 12"" display.  But, the operation and controls simply way too cumbersome and  poorly designed.2. Audio control,  complicated and difficult to set and navigate during driving.   And not responsive at all.   there  seemingly a few seconds delay,   previous Lexus version, the response was swift and quick.   Very poor design.   It makes the operation very frustrating, and takes the enjoyment out of  music. 3. The little mouse pointer.....You have to be EXACTLY AND PRECISELY dead-on, and the pointer is so so so so sensitive,   very difficult to land  exactly on the target.   Very bad design.   Very distracting, especially during driving.     Don't attempt to operate this during driving,  very hazardous.      My other car is a BMW, the  control is so much easier and accurate to operate.    Lexus, Lexus,  what's gotten into you ! ? 4.  The doors are very heavy to open and close, comparing to previous models.    5.   The gear shifting in all my previous RX 350 are smooth as silk.   Although  there were noise,  it was more like the exhaust noise.   But,  in the 2016 RX 350, the  noise.   Especially during  start-up acceleration ,  the humming sound from the engine seems louder,  but, the worst part,  is the gear shift are a bit rough, and no longer smooth.     The 2015 RX350 and my BMW 5 series, the gear shifts very quiet, and so smooth,   its hardly noticeable.   But,  this 2016 RX 350,  it is very noticeable.   Well,  after all this is said,   this is still a good SUV to have.   I'm just a bit disappointed and a bit anxious to finish the current lease of my RX 350, and move on to the next one.  Hopefully a much better car in the future.",3

The technology is so extensive the dealer offers a class to get the most out of it! Everything about this SUV is great but for one draw back. Even with the stronger engine and an 8 speed transmission, we are used to a bit better acceleration from zero. Now note that it isn't terrible but we would have liked a little more in the ""get up and go"" category. After less than 1 month . . . that's about the only drawback we have encountered. And it isn't major nor would it deter us from buying this SUV again.",5

I would have liked different interior choises.  I could not get grey, what I wanted and so I chose Palomino.  This came with brown dash, which I am less than thrilled with.  The car drives and handles superbly and the ride is the best of all of the RX 350s I have owned.  I would have loved to have more technology, but they were cost prohibitive for me.

I've put 26,000 miles on it in that time, bringing the total mileage up to 39,000 +. I've had no reliability issues whatsoever. The free maintenance plan is nice, though so far, through two visits, it's just been one oil change and two tire rotations. The car does use a quart of oil about ever 2500 miles if you're doing highway driving in warm weather. This is probably due to the very light weight (0W-20) oil used. The only thing I would give less than stellar reviews is the navigation system. It's so untrustworthy that I won't even use it to go any distances or to places I've never been before. Other than that, car is perfect. The reason I've been racking up the miles is trips from NY to FL, four roundtrips, and doing a lot of driving in Florida. It's perfect for that kind of travel, 11-12 hour days in the car.

I bought this 2010 loaded model, Certified Pre-Owned in 2012 after the 2013 models came out. 2010 brought the first major overhaul in style and substance since about 2005. Gas mileage would have been better with an 8-speed tranny, which they finally did with the 2016 upgrade, as well as smoother ride and loads of technology and safety features. Acceleration has never been a problem. Being Certified it came with 3 years added to the factory warranty, and we bought another 3 years for a total of 6 years Lexus warranty. It was rarely used due to the dependability of the vehicle. Several have complained about the joystick Navigation control, but I never had a problem with it. In fact, I prefer it over touch screen because the joystick is handy within arms reach, rather than having to reach for a touch screen.My car had the Premium, Luxury and Comfort packages, thus it is LOADED. I am impressed with the technology even in the 2010 model. I like the 2010 RX 350 so much I just bought a new 2017 RX 350--WOW!! Talk about TERRIFIC!!.

Reliability is the big seller to me.  My complaints are about several minor areas, where Lexus has missed the mark completely.  Example: each door in the front has a swing out pocket.  The problem is that when the pocket is swung out, gravity rearranges the contents of the pocket such that it can no longer be closed.  My model has a dash mounted cup holder along the lines of what used to be an ashtray.  The design is such that you cannot put ANYTHING into the compartment and close the door.  Pretty much useless except for cups.  The center console lid doesn't fully swing open, thus making access difficult even when stopped.  My car has utility outlets below the center console liner.  So I use an extender cable to get the outlet where it can be reached.  The overhead switches for interior lights, garage door openers, etc. are flush.  Thus, you cannot easily find the buttons by feel.  I find the voice commands for bluetooth phone, etc. to have much difficulty in understanding a voice.  The climate control system is downright strange.  It requires a lot of fiddling to turn A/C on/off to maintain comfort when setting a fixed temperature is supposed to do the trick.  The driver's floor mat doesn't cover the carpet where your left foot rests, thus causing unnecessary wear.  NOW for the biggie, which will influence my future buy of Lexus cars.  The car comes with a ""funny spare"" (compact spare).  That causes any problem with a tire to go from an annoyance to a trip ruining experience.  The compact spare has a top speed of 55 mph.  That's quite dangerous on western state freeways.  And on drives such as Los Angeles to Las Vegas, there are few places to have the tire repaired.  Now the worst part:  the full sized flat tire will not fit into the space the compact spare occupied in the trunk.  Thus, you will have to move luggage into the back seat or strap it on the roof rack.  I realize that many other cars are using compact spares, but I would expect a luxury vehicle to not cut the corner so carelessly.  Finally, for a premium car, I would expect a better audio system.  If an optional premium audio system is offered, it should be bought.  In test driving newer models of the RX than my own, I find most of the complaints have not been resolved.  The car is comfortable, drives well, and handles very nicely.  It is a bit bouncy going around a corner if there are bumps in the road.Updating 3-19-17I haven't warmed up to the interior at all since the last review.  There are so many little annoyances with the interior that the total gives me dissatisfaction with owning the car.  Just this AM I got out of the car, and the door pocket was slightly open.  It snagged my pants cuff.   I also forgot to mention the seat pockets on the back of the driver and passenger side.  They barely open and have hard covers that are uncomfortable against the knees of back seat passengers.  The rear seat door pockets virtually hold nothing but a small water bottle.My first RX was a 99.  It was the best car I've ever owned, and was far superior to the 2010 RX.  The smooth ride of the 99 RX-300 was a dream.  The A/C system was flawless.  The center console did not extend to the dash, but had two roomy slide out drawers.I'm due to buy another car this year, and the RX is dropping lower on my list as a replacement.  I'll take a look at the GX, and if it doesn't fit the bill, I'm off to another brand of car.  The only selling point for me with another Lexus, is that in 20 years of driving Lexus cars, I've only had one significant mechanical failure.",3

Bottom line, 4 hours later they came to get the car.  At our location, it should have only taken 1 1/2 hours at the most.

I'd recommend the car itself but not the purchase of the navigation system. When the car is in motion the navigation menu options are unavailable except for eDestinations which is a subscription service available for a fee. You can issue voice commands to the GPS while driving however the information returned is extremely limited. A query to the POI for example returns 3 choices. Effectively the navigation system is useless while driving. Technically you probably shouldn't use it while driving but there's no option to allow your passenger to use it either.

Purchased the 2010 FWD RX350 and could not be happier with my first RX 350. At 6'3,I was worried about comfort, especially on long trips but after making two 500 miles trips, no problems. The ride was quite and very comfortable. The RX350 has more back seat room than my 2007 4Runner and everyone loves the reclining rear seats. Have averaged 19 MPG city, 22 MPH Hwy. Only complaints so far are a weak stereo system and the black/gray screen for the nav/comm control panel. Needs to have some color in it. Surprised at all the negative comments about this vehicle. So far I have very pleased at my choice at a entry level SUV.",4

I told them I would just have the Oil filter and oil change (new 10,000 mile synthetic oil). The oil change cost $120.00 . They said they did not and do not check the fluid levels along with the oil change. The 35,000 mile check up (no oil change), just fluid checks inspect, clean battery cover,check air pressure, tighten nuts and bolts: over $400. 00 (because that labor costs $342.00 of the $400).

Like the HP, Nav, and dash design, but I think they've seriously underestimated the Lexus buyer.  Being a repeat buyer, it's quite evident that they've cut cost on the area's that make the Lexus a standout luxury car.  The RX back seats are no were near the quality of previous RX's.  Seats are no longer have that thick forming design.  The side door designs have been stripped bear.  No more leather like stitching and padding on interior doors.  Doors look like what you get in an American made suv.  And quality of carpeting has also been downgraded. And no longer a full spare tire.  The outside does not match inside.",4.25

Layout of controls are good and easy to use for me. Received a UBS and power plug extension from dealer which eliminates problems I read about access. Not as high performance as BMW X5 (X5 handles better) but that is not what I was looking for out this vehicle. RX has plenty of power. RX zero problems and quality seems very good so far.

The gas mileage is down from 27 average to 19.5 but it is a SUV. Very limited wind noise and quietness of vehicle is very much Lexus. I have gotten out of vehicle with it still running but in park several times. Love the storage area with only two rows of sits suit my lifestyle. I didn't get the nav,love the screen display of various settings. I am a 64 yr old and not your typical RX buyer. I personally think it is a great buy with the improved features for 2010.

I had been an Acura driver for 15 years & still love the brand.  However, I craved something different & the RX 350 caught my attention.  I love the cabin space, the power tail gate & the overall feel. Comparing this to my previous Acura RDX, the RX350 doesn't have as much power as I expected.  I don't like the quality of the material on the console & near the radio.  I definitely expected higher quality from Lexus.  The power & usb plugs inside the console are HORRIBLE!

I traded my Honda Ridgeline pickup for a 2010 Lexus RX350 crossover as I was looking for something smaller that had plenty of cargo space plus the AWD capability for Colorado snowstorms.  I must say I am quite impressed.  I was seriously torn between the RX350 and the Volvo XC60, but the Lexus won out when I test drove both (3 times) and found the Lexus had more hip/shoulder room for my 6'2"" frame, yet was very easy to load and enter/exit for my 5'0"" wife.  I believe the RX350 is built on a Toyota Camry frame, which gives it a great smooth ride that doesn't have that stiff ""truck"" ride that some SUV's have.

You will then talk to a Lexus representative that will find you what you are looking for and the send the directions to your nav system, if that's not luxurious and intuitive i don't know what is. The car is pretty quick, quicker that a benz ml350 and rides very soft. The quality of the materials inside is great.

We were flipped over in the middle of the intersection spinning and finally sliding to a grinding halt.  We were upside down and suspended by our seat belts.  I was terrified that the gas tank would explode and when she came to, she was terrified that another car was going to hit us.  Once the police officer and EMT released my seat belt I crawled out of that vehicle with a glass cuts on my knee and elbow.......just wiped off with alcohol very minor.

4954, on 04/29/18 09:23 AM (PDT),WR ,2013 Lexus RX 350 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 6A),Not Like Our First Lexus," Our first Lexus was a 2005 RX330, purchased as a Lexus Certified Used vehicle and was great.  We purchase our 2013 Lexus in November 2012 expecting the same quality of materials and design but were somewhat disappointed and over the years this has not changed.  From the ""carpeting"" that is little more than fuzzy laminated rubber to the leather seats that have turned blue, show way to much wear for a vehicle that has less than 50,000 miles, been garaged and driven by two people who combined weigh less than most individuals do, Lexus really cut back on the material quality on this model when compared to our 2005 RX.  We also learned to late that the rear parking sensors can be intermittent and are not aimed to protect the entire rear of the vehicle.  The sensors do not protect the area you are backing into if you are turning while backing up which we learned the hard way.  Finally, many features that you would consider standard for a luxury vehicle such as rain sensing windshield wipers or quality tires, ours came with Dunlop Tires which the dealer refused to change causing us to almost walk away from the deal, and many little details that were obviously changed or eliminated  to cheapen the vehicle.  We recently considered purchasing another Lexus RX but did not due to costs and the current design, my wife hates the front end.   We were particularly interested in the new RX 350L with third row seating, what an engineering an design disaster.  Of the vehicles with third row seating that we looked at the 350L was the worst in every way. Sorry Lexus, even though we have enjoyed the drive, ride, reliability and the service of our 2013 Lexus, we will wait until you do a complete overhaul of the RX before we purchase another.",4

I have always driven manual shift cars and this car is a nice luxury experience.  I am in my early 70's and plan on this being my last car, which is why I bought a Lexus and not a German car.  As far as the reviews, I don't quite understand.  I have owned an early Porsche 911 for almost 25 years.  This car is certainly not a Porsche, it was never intended to be.  But I can hold my own on an autocross course, and I have driven this car on some curvy, decreasing radii turns requiring heavy braking, power on acceleration out of turns and weight transfer.  I think this is a great car for what it is in the handling dept.

After driving my GS 300 22 years and 191,100 miles I thought I'd like to drive a newer car.  I test drove several Toyotas including the Highlander and was close to being sold until I went across the street to Lexus.  Ah, the comfort of my GS 300, the beauty of the elegant lines, gorgeous starfire pearl exterior and parchment interior and supremely quiet inside.  How could I ever accept any other car?  I can't, never will.  This is a most exceptional car and, after looking and researching this model for 3 years, I finally have my dream car.  It's about as perfect as one will find with a roomy interior and power on the road.  What a beautiful, elegant vehicle.  There is only one little annoyance:  I'm a petite person at 5'2"" and, even when the driver's seat is adjusted as high as possible, I cannot see on the other side of either side mirrors.  The size and placement of the mirrors completely blocks my view of any other car that may be close to me.  I have to jump up and arch around the impediment to see any car I might hit or any curb I approach in a turn.   My GS 300 had the mirrors lower than eye level and I never had a problem seeing any other cars.  For this reason my next car will probably be another Lexus but a more driver-friendly, safer view one.Word to the wise:  Be sure your Lexus RX 350 Is made in Japan not in North America.  Nothing excels Japanese attention to detail, pride in workmanship and acceptance of nothing less than perfection.  Teaching American workers about technical requirements doesn't convey teaching ethics and a sense of self worth that extends to Japanese made products.   Those are the cultural differences.  You'll be able to tell the country of manufacture by the VIN number.  When it begins with a ""J"" it's made in Japan.  Anything else, like a ""2"" and it's made in Canada.  You take your chances if it's not made by the Japanese.",5

This RX has also been my the least reliable one. The car had a chronic  and constant squeak audible at low speeds which after 4 trips to the dealer finally  got diagnosed as a poorly fitted hood (poorly fitted at the factory). It was finally fixed at 20,000 miles. The squeak had gotten so annoying that I actually considered selling the car rather than listen to it.The electric self positioning steering column began to groan  when it moved, starting at about 35,000 miles, and was replaced under warranty.  The dealer had to keep my car for two weeks to make the repair. The service tech  said the steering column would have eventually given out and that it is tied into the car's starter switch so failure would have rendered the car inoperable. It would have cost $2 500 to fix had it been out of warranty. Also the leather on the two front seat cushions wore poorly. Deep creases developed into cracks during two years and 50,000 miles of normal use, despite routine application of leather conditioner. The leather cover on the door armrest also came loose from it's padding. After some discussion between the dealer and the factory rep, all of these upholstery items were replaced even though the car was a few miles beyond it's warranty period.My previous Lexus experiences were trouble free, so I felt I bought good value despite the high purchase price. However, this  car has required a lot of attention. Although this RX is a safe comfortable versatile SUV, it is not a great machine like all my other Lexuses.About service, I have learned that  each Lexus dealer sets the cost it charges for service and these costs do vary greatly,. Desert Lexus in Cathedral City, CA  charges more for service than any other dealer I have found in Southern CA.I will probably not buy an 8th Lexus.",3

This car did not have the Tecata airbag recall (many we shopped for did, but we found one at Sewell in Dallas which was pristine with no open issues, no wrecks, clean car fax and no recalls). Although the backseat is tight, it did fit my 6' tall son and our daughter without issues. Probably not the car for long family road trips, but great for just the 2 of us empty nesters. Love it. Love it. Love it.",5

This is a well designed car and it stands on it's own with no comparisons to fussy Germans.  The 350 has effortless acceleration to the point of excess.  It has plenty of legroom in front.  I'm 6-2 and actually have to move the seat forward.  It's quiet enough to use the speakerphone on the highway with the top down.  Better than some sedans with the windows up.  Dash and nav are simple and intuitive.  Body work is rock solid.  ,4.875

I read the review in Car and Driver and have to disagree with their comments. Traded in a 2003 Audi A 4 Cabrio. This Car smokes that and the Audi 5 Conv. A Four Banger with Rag Top, a little dated. The Infinity G37Conv. Tiny inside, with the top down it shakes like a wet dog. The BMW 335i Conv. Nice Car but load it up like the Lexus and its $10K more with less equipment.

Both my prior cars where V8 roadsters, and the IS 350C still packs a healthy punch for a V6 that still gives you that high-performance feeling (albeit without the engine/muffler growl).  Additionally, for a convertible, the cabin is exceptionally quiet and there are no rattles at all (unlike all my prior convertibles). It is well engineered and has a solid feel.

The performance was great for the MPG I averaged around town (compared to my 03 S500). The trade-off in power didn't disappoint. The cost of maintenance was also dramatically lower than the Benz.

This is a sedan with the highest quality, very good performance and a thoroughbred to boot.  A lot of misguided people say this car is a big Avalon.

It handles nicely and there is plenty of power and it's quiet due to extra insulation and triple door seals. It also moves very fast in a split second to avoid a deer or car on an interstate with the help of my Pirelli tires which are cheaper and better than Dunlops.  It also has a mini sun visor that covers above the rear view mirror-- nice touch. And front seat crumb and coin catchers inside area by floor storage box. My gripe?  Mark Levinson is way overrated and overpriced but coming from (((him))) no surprise. 375 watts only?  Plus my CD player is failing and it's not been used that much. Bose and fords THX and Harmon Karden beat Levinson hands down and with 400 to 700 watts!   It's not junk but really Lexus!  You should dump him.  Lots of head space as I'm 6'. Lots!  And fit and finish very good. Interior appointments nicely done. Power is excellent. Seats are softer than most new cars but not like my 95 Cadillac. I hate hard seats. I have spent only 350 dollars on repairs over the last 7 years.  That's cheap!   I love the quiet ride and the controls are fairly friendly except the navigation which I'm not that fond of.  You can't change it as you drive. Wife could do that you know.  Also maintenance is not that expensive and as long as you do it when recommended you'll be fine.  Last but not least the modern luxury package is worth it.  You cannot beat these LS 430s. I believe they are the best on reliability.  Sadly Lexus has lost some credibility on the newer ones as they are making them cheaper looking and too sporty. Look if I was 30 sure. But I'm in my 50s and I like traditional luxury. And the newer LS's are not as reliable.  Find yourself a 2005-2006 LS with 50,000 or less for about 13 grand and under 50,000 and you'll enjoy it and say ""Mark was right!""   And I know. I've owned MB and BMWs and Jaguar CJs and Cadillacs and Olds and Chevys and Lincolns. None except my old Cadillac and Chevy came close to this car in reliability. I love it.

Getting done next week (Using only OEM materials--Aisin, etc...)..There are no signs of leaking,  its strictly preventative,  and Lets me know I'm good for another 100K or so!!..  I challenge you to find another luxury car that will go 238K on original TB/WP and hasn't needed any repair other than routine maintenance (brakes, fluids, etc) ...   Feels like a plane at takeoff , only there is no noise,  and the trans is still whisper quiet and shifts are undetectable.  Mark Levinson sound system compliments the car perfectly...(Not meant for deep pounding base songs,  but rather excels with classical, smooth jazz, as well as rock and most pop)..I replaced the foam surround on the rear deck subwoofer ,  other than that,  there is really no wear or broken items that would keep you from thinking your not in a much more newer car.  Speaks Volumes for the fit , finish, and quality of the materials used during the build...  Navigation CD was $10 on ebay and was upgraded in a minute... Still havent mastered the voice commands available to me,  but its a learning curve for a middle aged man.

Over last 2 years the car continues to drive like new, and keep in mind this is 2003 (almost 14 years old) Lots of new cars still don't have half of the technology what this car has. If you buy one make sure you see Carfax, so you know how it was maintained otherwise it might cost you a lot to fix stuff like benz or bmw. I will keep on driving till wheels fell off or this car might just out drive me. The engine in this cat is well know to go up to million miles plus if well taken care of. So the tranny and the rest.

The LS430 is truly head and shoulders above the GX (albeit a different category of vehicle altogether). I've owned various lexus models (GX, SC, ES), but this is my favorite yet. The quality and comfort of this vehicle is amazing. I'm disappointed that Lexus has lost a lot of the quality over the past few years. I was considering a new LS, but honestly the quality of the new model isn't the same (even if it has a number of advanced features to offset the difference in quality). I looked for the best condition LS43s0 I could find and ended up finding one that looked brand new inside and out with only 26k miles and one owner. Money wasn't a factor in trading in the GX (I just never could get myself to love it), but walking away with $20k+ as part of the trade in was definitely nice. I'm even considering looking for and buying another equally well kept LS430 to store to replace this one when it's seen more use. However, knowing about the legendary reliability of this car, that may not happen anytime soon. If you are thinking about buying one, don't hesitate. Cars just aren't produced like this anymore.",5

Heated and cooled seats long with plenty of trunk space just to mention a few extras. I don't understand why Lexus would quit making this particular model.

I'm at 117K now with NO issues what so ever!!!!!!  Just oil changes.  For the money, you CANNOT beat the ride, quality of materials, and steering/handling this car offers.  Basically cruising around in a $60-70K car when it was new, for around $12,000.  Toyota reliability on the mechanical size is PERFECTION as well.  Let's face it, it's Toyota engine and parts, just upgraded in quality for Lexus.  YOU CANNOT HEAR THIS CAR accelerate, I can't even tell when it change gears the transition is so smooth, and even at 10 years old you can not show me another car that still rides like it's floating on air (with all original equipment).  Also, the appearance is not affected by time (10 years), it still holds it's own next to any newer model luxury sedans without the maintenance issues of German or British cars.  As for power, 290 horsepower!  That's enough for anyone that doesn't plan on drag racing.  (a 2001 Mustang GT only has around 285 horse).  Do not go for the ""navigation system"", I never do, they age poorly in every vehicle.  Your cell phone can guide you around these days.

Now, not only does this screen control the GPs, but it also controls the climate control/defrost, rear view camera, Stereo including radio/CD changer.

Fuel charges are high for city driving.  Average 11mpg for Los Angeles driving (no freeway driving).  During trips, the Lexus just averaged 23-25. I just had it services and drove it cross country from Tennessee.  Brake job, inspection, detailing and synthetic oil change from THE Lexus dealer in Knoxville, TN.

I've tried to ask them to do more to the vehicle that what was recommended at the time and they actually REFUSED to do the work.

Sound system is good but with very limited adjustment possibilities. Radio often loses station in city driving and this downgrades the overall sound. Change of gears from 2nd to 3rd is late for 1 sec driving normally without kick-down.",4.125

The only item needing warranty replacement were the two gas-filled lifters for the trunk's lid. I bought as ""like new"" with 23K on the clock. The original owner replaced the Yoko 390's with Michelin XSE MXV4's as they wore out too soon. The ride is not super quiet over interstate pavement joints which may be exasperated by these new tires. I don't know. Also, the AC is so powerful that even in a Gulf Coast summer the fan speed on ""Auto"" has to be manually moderated. This involves using the Navigation touch screen.

If you floor the gas while driving at 70 to 80 mph, you WILL get pushed back into your seat and blow by everything else on the road.

Having the minute-to-minute feedback from the gas consumption screen enables you to maximize your mpg, and once you learn the correct way to drive a hybrid, the fuel economy is certainly attainable, if not beatable!

First of all, I LOVE driving a Hybrid and second, I LOVE the performance on this thing. 340HP and I average just a hair shy of 30MPG. I'm going to take it to Thunder Hill Race Way next month to show off to the Miata and Lotus guys... my tires are low so I figure I'd wear it out even further before putting on a new set (LOL). Third LOVE for this car is the equipment... The 18 way adjustable seats are TO DIE FOR. I am 5'6"" and will never buy another car without leg extenders and adjustable side bolsters and butterfly headrest. Triple LED headlamps are also awesome. Originally, they were too low so it took me about 30 minutes to figure out how to slightly adjust the beams higher and now they are perfect. My daughters, 8 and 4, are so spoiled from rear door and windshield sunshades and pleathra of buttons in the center armrest. I put them into my BASE Tacoma truck and she thought it was FANCY and HIGHTECH because of cloth seats and manual windows. Lastly, Dynamic Radar Cruise is another thing I love. If every car on the road had it, we can all set the cruise control at 75 MPH on the freeway and CRUISE on the freeway substantially reducing congestion and save gas at the same time from drafting each other and reduction in speed up/slow down.

The LED lamps that come with the luxury package are impossible to find on any Lexus lot, so a comparison is, well, impossible to date.

A Lotus passed me and I caught him at a stop light and blew him off from a stop. Lexus means quality and this one is awesome. No comparison on the interior of this to a BMW or Mercedes.

Safety features really protect life. The car is fast, safe, luxurious, dependable and fun to drive. The sound of the engine rocks.  I do not like the run flat tires.  They do not hold as well as the high performance ones.  The fact of driving without a spare is worrisome.  I made a trip recently in which the nearest facility that could fix a run flat was greater than the range that you can run flat your tires.  I bought a spare and when the present tires are done, I am getting high performance tires, which is what this vehicle needs. ",5

I particularly like the Mark Levinson system and the navigation system.  I listed interior as ""9"" only because there are certain things you can't input on the nav system while driving.

I've rented the newest 4Runner on a week long trip and this is nothing like that vehicle. I have owned a Nissan Xterra and a Mitsubishi Montero Sport. I've also owned MANY fast sports cars. My family's kiddo count just went from 2 kids to 5...we had TRIPLET boys 7 months ago. While we hardly ever need to haul all children in one vehicle BUT the Sienna I bought my wife got stuck in gear in a parking lot one day because the shifter cable from cabin to transmission broke by way of retainer bushing failure (not the cable itself). My fast car was a BMW M3 at that time. So, I made two trips in that car to take the wife and kids back home while AAA took the sienna back to our house so that I could install a new corrected cable/bushing from Toyota. I work nights and had to work the following night so I put the vehicle work off for 3 days. Wife was not happy that we were down to a single cab pickup (used to haul our dirtbikes to the mottocross track) and my M3. So, here we are...I traded my coveted M3 for this Lexus GX 470. I want to cry, but let me tell you this GX 470 will make those tears a bit smaller and will perhaps even allow them to run dry a bit faster too. See this thing rides like a dream on the highway and I was watching videos of them off-roading before I decided on it vs a ton of othe SUV's I could have bought. I took the GX 470 to the freakin' motocross track and it got around a DIRTBIKE track (at low speeds granted) like nobody's business. My 4runners would have MAYBE made it, the Xterra may have made it, but I honestly kinda doubt they would. What I do know with no doubt at all is that this crazy Lexus SUV made it around that track and some of those jump faces are 15' formidable, steep, inclines. To be honest I kinda wanted this vehicle to pay a price...I had to sell my M3 to get it. I didn't bash it but I was kind of telling it ""you had better be what I expected or else""....it was what I expected and then some. Can't go wrong with this thing. I considered Land Cruisers, Escalade ESV's, LX 470, and GX 460...I know the escalade sounds way off beat but they're kinda cool.",5
5495, on 01/28/17 08:04 AM (PST),Mr. Waffles ,2008 Lexus GX 470 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (4.7L 8cyl 5A),This is the one!," What can I say about this 4runner's brother and FJ cruiser's cousin in a suit and tie. I've owned about 3 cars in the past year hoping to find the one that I'd own for a while after my last car was totaled. I finally came across this one and I think this one is a winner. I like a good highway cruiser and typically only looked for long wheelbase (used) luxury sedans. However, after being bitten by the adventurous offroading bug thanks to my friends, I caved and had to have something with offroading capability. This one popped up at a dealership as I was trading in my M5 and immediately jumped at the opportunity. The water pump was leaking (dealership replaced for me) but considering it still had the original pump and t-belt at 152k I knew this one would warn me well in advance before I need worry about being stranded on the side of the road or giving me unnecessary stress as to whether it would start in the morning.  MPG is... well.... it's a V8 truck. You don't buy these and expect anything better than 16-18 mpg (What I get). Ride is comfortable as can be as expected. Off roading capabilities are extraordinary and can definitely hang with others on the trail. Haven't had a problem yet with the running boards. Might have to push it harder to scratch them. I tend to take the less daring way off road. Have 5 seats more than usually needed, but the cargo space I can't do without. You can feel the beasts weight in the corners but again, it's an truck. Probably should stop driving it like one of my old cars. One thing I do like is the torque from a stop. Again it isn't sports car fast, but oh man does it get up and go. With 152k, I'm waiting for the air suspension to bite the dust, but knowing Lexus/Toyota reliability, that will be a while I hope. Overall, I think I've found the truck I will keep for a while.",5

In short, it's an amazingly comfortable SUV that excels at off road performance. Based on the Land Cruiser Prado sold pretty much everywhere else in the world except the US (think sand dunes and the bush), this truck is NOT a pimped out 4Runner. The full time 4WD, V8, rear air suspension, build quality, comfort and reliability combined make this rig unsurpassed for those who venture beyond the mall. These trucks are often referred to as out of date dinosaurs, and are compared to their unibody competitors who may outperform in terms of drivability and road manners; but this truck is built for towing, adverse driving conditions, and off-road capabilities while maintaining superior daily driver comfort for the whole family. If that’s not what you need, then look elsewhere. If it is, then look no further, spend a little extra up front, and drive it for another 200k miles. The KDSS version will decrease road body roll and improve off-road capabilities, as well, but they are hard to find. Not so great features include: limited 3rd row seating space and comfort, high (but rare) repair costs, fuel efficiency, styling (face it, it's ugly front most angles), and rear door.",5

Most manufactures have put 4wd at the touch of a button and lexus desided to leave it as a shifter to take up half of center console.

Comparing it, today, follow this assessment:  The rearview camera is something we would no longer do without!  At the time, blind spot was not available, nor was cross-over.  Toyota is NOT the king of technology in my opinion--but, the technology that was installed still works and has been without problems.  The interior, except for wear on the driver floor mat, has held up extremely well.  A good cleaning is all that will be required to look like it is brand new.  The exterior of our car needs some repair--as in 2 areas of less than 2 square inches that need retouching, and a good rubbing compound prior to waxing--I think it would be considered excellent.  It is almost impossible to own an auto for 10 years, drive it 90,000 miles and not have a few dents and dings--but, they are minor, and NOT the fault of Lexus.   As for service, we value Kuni Lexus in Denver as  the best dealership we have used.  Expense?  Well, maybe they are expensive--but, we never had any work done on our GX470 only to find that some ""new problem"" was immediately discovered--and, when I insisted on new tires (Kuni told me we still had 5,000 miles left on the old ones), they met the price of Costco......!  Furthermore, the tires lasted 80,000 miles--unheard of in my experience!   Same with the brakes--I practically begged Kuni to put brakes on--they lasted well beyond our expectations!   But, had not been driving a Lexus prior to this one.  Overall, 10 years with almost no major expense--the transmission didn't go bad, the engine didn't go bad, the electronics still work (including the heated seats, the stereo system.........nothing has gone bad on us!

Have grown to love the navigation and ML sound system. The only CON would be the gas mileage...but I went into this purchase knowing that it would not be that good.  As long as you are comfortable with that, I would recommend this vehicle highly!",4.25
5521, on 03/04/09 21:08 PM (PST),Jim ,2006 Lexus GX 470 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (4.7L 8cyl 5A),Well Built SUV, We bought a GX and have over 30K miles on it now.  It is a very comfortable vehicle for trips and is very quiet for its size.  Fuel economy is fair with 16 in town and about 19-20 on the highway.  The Lexus dealer is easy to work with and fixes any issues without argument. Handling is average for an suv and has a fair amount of lean on corners.  The 3rd row seats are useless for anyone but small children and should be designed to stow under the floor like other SUVs. Quality of interior and exterior materials is excellent.,4.375

With Lexus, you can't go wrong mechanically-what you get for your money is a total bargain. When you are in this price point, you can't skimp on some items and the navigation system is one of them.  Of course if you choose to go with a stock stereo system it's a good system as well, but don't expect the  best if you don't want to pay for it. The interior spacing is very comfortable-we often seat 4 adults and 3 kids in carseats in our vehicle.  Of course that is using the third row - which is ideal for carseats or children who do not really need leg room. Driving it is a dream - I feel safe in all weather conditions.",5
5524, on 04/03/08 11:32 AM (PDT),Jim R ,2006 Lexus GX 470 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (4.7L 8cyl 5A),Disappointing," I have been so disappointed with this truck that, in the middle of my lease, I ordered a BMW X5 (I'm going back to this better performing, more luxurious SUV).  The GX 470 is boring to drive.  It lumbers down the highway like a full sized American car.  The ""premium"" sound system is no better than average.  The gas mileage is worse than the X5 - I rarely get more than 12 mpg.  The interior is average - the leather and wood trim are not nearly as nice as what is offered by BMW or Audi.  Overall, I paid 55,000 for this truck and it's worth about 35,000.  I can't wait to get back into a BMW.",2.375

Well, the technology in this car is phenomenal.  Full, split axle 4-wheel drive for mud and snow slopes that some trucks could not even handle.  Computer assisted 4-wheel drive for on road use in snow and ice, along with a brilliant ABS system, though unnerving at times, and you can be sure of a safe fast stop in any weather.  I also got a special suspension option (one of the few options offered on a Lexus) and I am amazed at how it handles bumps.  Riding in this car is an absolute pleasure.  Its computer technology is amazing as is its build.  Cost is high, but I can say, it's worth every penny.",4.625
5526, on 02/13/07 05:58 AM (PST),Francis ,2006 Lexus GX 470 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (4.7L 8cyl 5A),Great , I purchased a 2006 GX 470 with the navigation/Mark Levinson package in Nautical Blue Metallic with dark gray interior on 3/25/06. The vehicle itself is beautiful inside and outside. The interior is a little dated however still very classy and functional. Fit and finish is impeccable and to Lexus standards. The ride is very smooth and stunningly quiet! The Mark Levinson system is excellent. The navigation system is a little too fussy: you have switch from region to region if you are going to do any traveling between states and require assistance.  The V8 is silky smooth and more then adequate to power the vehicle. Overall the GX 470 is a great SUV that I would highly recommend to anyone. ,4.375

Keeping in mind that our first snow was over 24"", we were temporarily stuck on our street.  However, I threw the SUV into low range 4WD and off we went!  It made my wife feel so comfortable about being able to effortlessly move through almost any situation.  The height- adjustable suspension also came in handy during the storms as well.

The flawless quality of the product brought us back.  Where you notice the smaller size from the LX is in the back seat and to a lesser extent, the cargo area.

We wanted a vehicle safe for the family, with a comfort ride without a huge size and better gas mileage than our gas guzzling Hummer.  This vehicle is all the SUVs wrapped up into one.  It's comfortable, roomy, looks sporty, and gets an average SUV gas milage.  We get about 16-17 in the city and 20 on the highway.  We also use premium gas, it burns cleaner and allows better gas mileage. This is our first Lexus and we are so pleased with it! It has given the others a run for their money by far!  ",4.875

I haven't had much time to drive it since the rest of the family has experienced the comfort and reliability of this well built vehicle.  My only concern is fuel economy.

We were in a major wreck and the vehicle is totaled with less than 800 miles.  We rode up a guardrail and hit a tree head on at about 35mph.  The truck also rolled onto the drivers side.

I was really impressed with the gas millage and the long trip. The road noise is almost unnoticable. Extremely quite and very comfortable. For 50k, it's worth it. The only flaw in this GX is the 3 row seating.  It's useless. But if not included, back row passengers don't come rear air installed.

Dealer wisely let me take it home and there was no going back.  Five years later, 185,000 miles and it rides like new, quiet and smooth.  Replaced all brakes and rotors, which was fairly expensive, replaced the radiator (which I expected after reading up on it), and that's about it.  By far the nicest car I've ever owned, and for years I bought all new cars (because of a family discount).   We've used it for family trips in the winter in Michigan because it handles the weather so much.   I could go on.  Everything on it seems to be made with excellence.  Every little feature still worked when I got it.  Highly recommended.  Keep in mind, it does only get about 15-18 mpg (still get about that), but consider that it is FULL TIME 4WD (not all-wheel), and it is a heavy vehicle.  Also, if you have a lot of kids, when they get bigger, the third row is cramped.

I also had to replace the sensors for the rear air leveling as they both failed on separate occasions which was VERY problematic on a 500 mile road-trip.

The Bad: Just a couple of issues. Have brought to the shop to fix the sunroof 2 times, it doesn't close all the way and creates air flow noises and leaking. 3 lights came on dash which was intimidating and only had to replace the gas cap.

With two kids, two large dogs, and the needed ability to tow and secure a motorcycle carrier to the tow hitch, the choices were limited. I researched several SUVs in this class, but all reviews and stats kept leading me back to the GX. I started looking for certified pre-owned GXs with low mileage, and there weren't many. I took that as a sign that these vehicles were sought after and kept. I finally found an immaculate '07 with only 25K miles on it. After we drove it, we realized why everyone gushes over their Lexus cars and suvs. It drives much smaller than it is, and it's really comfortable and very quiet. The power is awesome, especially off the line and charging uphill. It tows easily and has a tongue weight of 650+ lbs to handle my moto carrying needs. Interior storage space is more than ample. The 3rd row is handy when you need it, and easy to remove when you don't. Other than the 16mpg avg, I really have no complaints.

We took out the third row seats, and removed the 1/3 section of the second row.  This is perfect for getting the dog in and out, and when traveling long distances, one person can completely lay out from back door to back of the front seat (though it may not be the safest thing to suggest).  We have never regretted taking out those seats, as it about doubles the space in the back.  We removed the third row from my LX too, though kept my second row intact.  The GX has just come through it's second sunroof leak, only this one is really bad, because it sat for weeks before we were around to notice.  Don't know if it's related or not, but the shocks spent so much power trying to equalize, due to a malfunction, that they drained the battery.  Now that the car is dried out, we see it's still broken,  a $4,000 fix, and the whole interior mildewed from the leak.  The roof problem wasn't fun the first time, when the water filled the glovebox, but when it's the whole car, it's debatable if we keep or move on.  Apart from these problems, I would have nothing negative to say, and are so pleased to have towed so many trailers, hauled heavy stuff, dog and people year after safe year.(UPDATE)  After it was 'fixed' from second major sunroof leak, drove the car from one house to the other, did fine for the 700 mile drive, just like usual.  After it sat in garage a week, took it out to go somewhere.  The mildew was coming back and I couldn't stop coughing.  We put the car back in garage, and then gave it to a non-profit trail conservation group, whose pickup truck had just died.  We feel it should do well for them for many years, maybe another decade, as a substitute for the purpose they need, despite the mildew.  My husband decided to get the 2017 Honda Ridgeline and see if that can be a good substitute.  When it comes my time to get a new car, though I'm not sure when, as my 2005 LX 470 is a workhorse on its own and doing well, too, I'll probably stick with the Lexus, maybe the LX570.",4

It is a heavy car without being too big.  I wish there were turn signal arrows on my side mirrors like I've seen on other cars, so I never leave the damned turn signal on, confusing other drivers.  I also wish the navigational system were easier to operate. I'd like a camera in the front too.  But the only really big safety change I would want is for far better ""blind spot"" vision.  Changing lanes is still not safe enough and the Lexus doesn't make it easier. Overall, it is a much more comfortable car than the two Mercedes I had before it, including a large Mercedes SUV.  It is a softer ride.     ",4.75

Our city does not have a Lexus dearship, had to travel 125 miles to test drive.  It was well worth the trip. The test drive had me sold, didnot want to leave the GX, but had not come prepared to buy.  Within the week, we went back and drove our GX home. Once you drive or ride--you're hooked.

The gx met these requirements.  But, the interior left so much lacking.  I wanted the quality of a Japanese built car and this is built in Japan, but this suv was designed for the Japanese.  The seats are way too small (no one should buy this vehicle that is anywhere near 6 feet tall) and the drivers compartment is crampedbase of seat is inches shorter than the expedition, ashtrays everywhere but no personal storage.",3.375

In the end, Lexus reliability and interior finish were what sold us.  For the money the interior of the Lexus felt more polished (totally a personal choice here) than the M.  Although the GX does have a tape deck, which definitely is dated!  Seats are comfortable and layout of dash made sense.  Also, the crossover drive feel of the ML, RX and MDX was unappealing to us.  The GX works well for male & female but the Xovers felt very girly.  After 2 months of use we really are pleased with it.  Ride is comfortable around town as well as freeway, fuel economy as with others in this class is OK.  Fits 2 car seats easily.  ",4.75

The interior materials are cheap, rivaling fisher price products, the seats are hard and unsupportive, the suspension sqeaks and the dealer can’t fix it, etc. The car also suffers from technology that is slow, frustrating to use, and severely outdated. For a 4.6 Liter V8, power is minimum with poor braking to assist it. The steering is very vague.  The car has had 4-5 unexpected visits to the dealer, fortunately covered from warranty. Did I mention rust? This car is already rusting, with it only covering 70,000 miles. The good points of this car include the dealer being easy to work with, and lots of room with the seats folded.

It was a wonderful vehicle but I really wanted something more refined. The GX 460 fits the bill perfectly. I am not a fan of the over rounded rear vehicle cross-over SUV’s. They all look the same, the shape of the cargo hold isn’t practical and they rarely even handle a few inches of snow well due to run-flats and low profile tires. I applaud Lexus/Toyota for refusing to go along with the cross-over crowd on the GX and 4-Runner models.   When I compare the GX to the 4-Runner, I would say it’s much more refined on all fronts. The V8 engine is smooth and quiet, the acceleration is very solid - not a turbo, but more than sufficient, the seats are extremely supportive and comfortable, the Mark Levinson sound system is fantastic, the build quality and reliability are exceptional.

Now, this car is old school and  it lacks some of the latest gadgetry but other than that this car is best the SUV ever. For starters, I like the driving position a lot. It gives you the nice commanding view of the road for which old school SUVs are famous for. The overall visibility from the driver seat is amongst the best. I took the test drive of 2018 Q7 and MDX and I can tell you the driving position and visibility of GX460 is superior to both. Second I like the silky smooth engine and the transmission which in my opinion is the best in the industry. Third I like the ergonomics of this car a lot. Once you take the driving position, every button on the dashboard and steering is very ergonomically located. This is where I feel inspite of lack of technology when compared to the latest cars like Q7, GX460 is still very easy to drive. And the last, the turning radius of this big SUV is surprisingly very small. Its just so easy to maneuver this car because of such a small turning radius (smaller than both MDX n Q7) that you dont find any need of any park assist features that the Germans carry.Also, the 4X4 of this vehicle is legendary, along with the Lexus reliability, this car is perfect Zombie proof vehicle with can go anywhere capability.Now everything is not good, there are some shortcomings like this car is like a tank, its torquey but its slow.

He didn't even realize the vehicle was leaning, not puling to the right but came up with a lie right away. I guess that is what they are instructed to say because everyone dealing with this problem throughout the country is getting the same answer: your vehicle is within specs or this is a characteristic of your vehicle.

I spent the last three years agonizing whether I could afford the LX 570 and ended up buying what I thought was a fair compromise between my heart and my head. Surprisingly, I found myself absolutely in love after driving the GX a few hundred miles! Let’s be clear: DO NOT buy this car if your intended use is dropping the kids off to school or going shopping; you could be disappointed. And yes, Lexus could have done better with the placement of the USBs, the dull-but-practical instrumentation gauges, and even the navigation display which was upgraded in all other models but this one. Other than that, if you don’t like the gas mileage, I recommend you buy a hybrid! You feel vibrations? Take your left foot off the brake pedal! Suspension feels wimpy? Take it out of the Comfort mode! The GX 460 is an incredibly luxurious, serious and TRUE Sport Utility Vehicle, which means a car made to get you through places you could not imagine walking, climbing or descending; effortlessly and safely towing significant loads and elegantly taking all abuses a luxury sedan would be crying about.

Although I had and loved a Grand Cherokee ZJ limited, I don't really like the size, comfort or look of the modern Grand Cherokee, so that was not an option. I own a land rover Discovery 2, and although I love it, it is not the most reliable car. The newest generation, the new discovery 5, was louder, uglier and felt less comfortable then the GX. The Velar has a nicer dashboard, but no 4Lo or locking differential AND it is a lot smaller. The Range Rover and Range Rover Sport are both more expensive and neither felt all that much more comfortable then the GX (tbh, I think the GX rides better). In addition, it seems that ever rover dealership has a few buy backs for sale and my experience with land rover dealerships leaving a lot to desired, I decided those were not for me. Then there was the GX. Large, strong, dependable, good looking, locking center dif, quiet and comfortable. Is it a sports car?

The ride is also surprisingly comfortable and absorbent for a true body-on-frame SUV designed to tackle some really tough terrain. Sadly that is where the positives end. The GX masquerades as a ""luxury"" vehicle when it is not luxurious in the least. There is more to a luxury vehicle than putting some leather and some fancy gadgets inside. The GX has one of the ABSOLUTE WORST powertrains there is. The engine is simply horrendous! It is EXTREMELY noisy, sounding like a vacuum-cleaner on the slightest of grades. Even on the freeway at about 60 to 70 mph the exhaust drone gets very tiring after a while. Pretty shocking for so called ""luxury"" vehicle. The engine is also not the smoothest and pretty bad actually for a V8. There are some on here that have stated that this vehicle is ""extremely quiet"". These folks are likely certifiably DEAF if they can't here the constant droning from the engine, which is the worst from around 1800 RPM to around 2600 RPM. That was an absolute deal breaker for me, and it is why I got rid of mine, even though this was a very difficult decision, as I do consider reliability as one the top most important aspects of  a vehicle. In short, I do not recommend this vehicle at all. If it were a bare bones vehicle it would probably be OK, but for a high end luxury vehicle it is a joke!",3

I traded a 2014 VW Touareg TDI for the Lexus. I got tired of the running that the dealer give me. ( Is normal  is a German car, is build for performance). Well, in my eyes , the most important thing is to get me where i want to go without having to call a tow truck. Lexus , please don't pay attention to all these spring journalist that think , they know what and how a truck should perform. Please keep making this truck the way it is.

It's cooling pipe went bust on the freeway, by the time we pulled to the next exit it over heated.  It ran another 6 months afterwards before we sold it to CarMax.  We bought the new '15 GX and it was totaled a month later after being rear ended by a careless driver.  The frame buckled and the rear bumper had the guys front end imprinted on it.  I was able to walk away with only a stiff neck.. the other driver had a fractured jaw, broken arm and leg and ribs.  The GX saved my live.  We bought our third GX a few weeks later.  This is a heavy traditional SUV, the acceleration is measured and ""stately"".  Fuel economy is in the high teens, not bad for this type of vehicle.  Handling is good if you get used to the truckiness.  On the freeway, it is stable and quiet.  It's not the quickest, but it does get to 80 to 90 mph before you know it.  The only complains I have is the poor placement of the two USB ports in the center console.  When plugged in, the sliding hatch cover have to be open.  And there are no power ports for the 2'nd row.  It got a little irritation having to charge the Kids' ipads on long trips.  The Lexus roof rack cross bars are nice looking, however, they sit too close to the roof making tying down cargo a bit difficult.  also you need a Torx key to move them.  I liked the old GX's roof rack, with plenty of tie in points to strap your cargo.Update, we got side swiped by some guy in a beat up 300.  We must be cursed in our GX!  The damage was extensive, from the front bumper to the back bumper.  The wife barely felt the impact, another testament to the safety of this truck.  Luckily only body damage sustained.  6 weeks and $13000 later, the truck was fixed with new bumper, fenders, doors, side step.  The only new gripe I have is the stock tires worn out faster than the tire warranty, and the ride is noticeably harsher than before.  We will be getting new meats for the truck soon.",5

Apparently Ford decided to do away with 5.4 V8. Too bad. We looked at all of the other domestic Suv's and nothing really hit us. By chance we stopped into the Lexus dealership and noticed the GX460.Granted it's not as big as the Expedition but the kids are all married.  The ride is firm solid yet refined and in, many ways better that my exp. Fit n finish  is excellent . The overall driving experience is second to none. Acceleration is strong and reliable.We still tow the Whaler and it does it with ease and I have no regrets. After 1000miles we re getting 21.8mpg combined while getting 23 highway. We have not seen or experienced the concerns/issues of prior reviewers. It's an excellent Truck! Since the initial review we now have 3 K miles and it just keeps getting better. Driving in bad weather and snow/ice doesn't phase the GX one bit. Really unbelievable traction and no slip whatsoever in some major snow and ice conditions. The most solid and sure footed truck I have ever driven  even without haveing to lock it into 4WD. Much better than the expedition ever thought of being. Fit and finish still great no vibrations or unexplained noise or rattles. Most solid truck I have ever had while still being a refined ride.We now have over 6k miles on the Lexus and it drives as good as it did the day we drove it home. My previous comments regarding fit, finish, perfprmance and overall quality are still on point with no degridation what so ever. Truly the best truck ever, exceeding our expectations . Much better than the expedition ever was. To be truthful though I do on rare occasions miss the extra space of the Expedition but not enough to make me go back to one. I just hook up the utility trailer.No regrets.It’s now been two years since we purchased the 2016 Lexus GX460 Luxury Edition and it is truly the best SUV we have ever owned. It is a smooth, quiet, powerful, refined and go anywhere vehicle. No issues at all just fun and great to drive. My wife likes it so much she want one this time I. Red.  I guess another trip to the dealer is in order.",5

5849, on 06/07/16 06:56 AM (PDT),Julia ,2016 Lexus GX 460 SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (4.6L 8cyl 6A),Love this SUV," This is my second GX.  My first was a 2012.  I am always surprised by the expert reviews of this SUV.  I have driven a Subaru outback, a Volvo XC70, a Toyota highlander and a Chevy Suburban and none of them can come close to the performance of the GX in the snow. I live in Wisconsin and missing a workday due to snow is not an option for me. I have been on the interstate in three blizzards this winter alone and the GX is solid on the road.  The gas milage well outperforms stated (22-23) and in a SUV with true 4 wheel drive capability I am pleased.  Unlike my husband's suburban, and my neighbors Mercedes and BMW, my 2012 GX has had no mechanical issues, even minor, ever!  I traded only for new tech options and safety features and because my neighbor wanted to buy my 2012.  I wonder if the reviewers have ever really driven in snow... because the is no better SUV in my mind.  My teenagers often use the third row and have never complained.  The way the back door swings open, even when parallel parked has never been an issue.  The blind spot is huge and the addition of the blind spot monitor will be welcome, I did not have it on my 2012.Update:  I have now had my  GX for about 6 months and put just over 5000 miles on.  I am getting used to the adaptive cruise but I wish I could turn it off if needed.  The brake assist has prevented an accident when another car pulled in front of me.  Compared to my previous 2012 the touchscreen is more difficult to deal with and at times doesn't register my touch (I am due for maintenance and this may just need an update). The most annoying feature is the front camera that comes on at every stoplight and stop sign. When the camera comes on it interrupts any phone call I am trying to make or any commands that I am verbally giving the navigation system, very annoying!  On snow the SUV remains amazing and I have driven a subaru, Volvo, highlander and suburban through Wisconsin winters and this SUV is by far superior.  Would still highly recommend and would purchase again despite the annoying tech issues.",5
5850, on 11/20/15 11:54 AM (PST),Mike ,2016 Lexus GX 460 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (4.6L 8cyl 6A),Please make a V8 4Runner again Toyota!," Let me start by saying we did NOT buy this because of the badge on the hood!  I have read so many comments at the bottom of reviews for the GX that rip it shreds and proclaim it nothing more than a mall crawler, trophy wife truck and an outdated one at that.  I will not disagree that in many instances those comments apply, but I applaud Toyota for offering a BOF SUV with a V8, I only wish I didn't have to buy a Lexus to get it.  This vehicle is for my wife, and yes she's my trophy and yes she does a fair amount of mall crawling, BUT....we also regularly tow a travel trailer and aren't afraid to traverse trails, cross small streams or other off road activities with bikes mounted on the roof, kids and dogs in the back.  We actually NEED capability and USE it! I am a long time Toyota fan, having owned multiple Tacomas and Lexus LS400's when I was in sales and I can't say enough good about their quality and longevity.  I sold my last LS400 with 267k on the odometer running strong!  With a travel trailer, two kids and a dog the '03 Tacoma double cab V6 wasn't cutting it for tow duties any longer and we test drove and fell in love with the 4Runner's looks and attitude.  What I didn't fall in love with was the 4.0L V6 and 4,700 lb tow rating.  With that bad news, my research led me to the ""Lexified"" version of the 4Runner, aka GX460.  From the moment we drove it, she loved the interior feel, looks(controversial) and smooth V8.  I liked the 6,500lb tow rating and the interior upgrades over the 4Runner.We looked at Tahoes/Yukons but didn't need that much size, looked at Jeep GC's but wanted a 3rd row and also looked at the Land Rover LR4. I absolutely loved the LR4 and was smitten with it's feel, looks, heritage and off road prowess.  She didn't care for it at all, and since we plan to keep this vehicle for a long time I figured it was much wiser to go with a Toyota rather than a Land Rover.I quickly realized that Toyota took a smart pill and figured out ""Why sell a V8 4Runner, when you can push consumers to the Lexus brand?"" We bought in hook, line and sinker.  It's a great truck, albeit heavy,thirsty, and expensive but if you want or need to tow and go off road your choices are pretty limited these days.  I'm confident it will serve us well for years to come.  If you don't have a need for ""duty"" get an RX or one of the other countless lifted sedans out there.11/23/16 UpdateWe have owned the vehicle for a year now and towed a 3,500lb camper over a thousand miles on two occasions.  The truck doesn't mind a bit and transports its occupants in style and comfort. A couple caveats:1) We have seen significantly better mileage using premium fuel, not sure why.2) It returns about 9-12 MPG when towing our camper3) It sags a bit more than I care for when towing, but we do not have the self-leveling suspension.4) The ""leather"" on the seats is sub-par for a $57,000 truck in my opinion.It is my understanding that this model is going away after 2017, so if you want/need a big body on frame SUV for towing in style with Toyota quality you'd better act quickly.",4
5851, on 08/09/17 09:45 AM (PDT),David S ,2011 Lexus GX 460 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (4.6L 8cyl 6A),This SUV is for people who want a luxury truck," I own the older GX470   That was a car.  This is a truck.  Its basically a Landcruiser Prado in a tuxedo. Its big. It's comfortable. The stock radio is great. The Bluetooth is excellent . It's power train is smooth.  ...I didn't say great.  Here is the one problem. It's not underpowered. Not at all. The problem is the gear ratio. On moderating steep hills, whether going up or down, the gearing is tuned for gas savings   So there is no downshifting in time.   In other words, the engine is laboring uphill wanting to get to higher rpm and then down hill it won't shift down for any engine breaking.  Hard on breaks. The solution is to shift the knob over to manual and go up or down as needed.   It's quite pleasant driving it that way.  But that's me. I drove a shift for many years .  I can see why some reviewers were freaked out by the too large gearing ratio.   That being said this is a badass truck. If you keep your cars a long time like me, you will probably die before this vehicle does if you maintain it per schedule.  I would want my kids to drive a Landcruiser or Prado over anything else on the planet for their comfort and safety  They will likely inherit this one.  That's why they are no cheap.   That's why it's got 5 stars for reliability on most car websites.  But the odd ratio gear tuning really does improve mpg. On  the highway driving 65-70 I get a consistent 19.8 to 20.1 mpg    Around town it's about 16 give or take a bit     If you can deal with shifting yourself on steep hills, there is nothing more comfortable or reliable on the planet other than a Landcruiser or LX itself",4

From a stop when you accelerate the vehicle has a stall or hesitation for 2 or 3 seconds.  This does not occur every time thus creates a problem for Lexus.  I have complained to Lexus and gone through the hearing process which is a waste of time.  The representatives from Lexus and the hearing panel drove the vehicle across the street from the hotel and around the Costco parking lot and said the vehicle did not demonstrate a problem. The vehicle has a problem!   ,3.125

This is a safety problem if trying to accelerate quickly through an intersection, one can get into an accident. Lexus is addressing the issue, but do not believe this is safety issue because no accidents reported yet (although this is new + expensive vehicle).  If there was not this safety issue, I would say that the small area for 3rd row is an issue and leg room for drivers side.  It is build on 4runner chassis. The exterior and style look very nice.

The acceleration is to say the list impressive and off road is as good as an FJ. The third row is pretty comfortable, accordingly to my passengers, if the second row is moved forward.

When i sat in the GX I said out loud, ""this is it"" only to seal the deal with a test drive. You might get another car that has more bling or another feature that you might want but you will never find a car that can take on the GX 460 in its entirety.

The interior is luxurious. The 460 has lots of power and a very smooth ride, much softer than the 470. Exterior styling is more Toyota than Lexus but still looks sharp.

The interior is very elegant and comfortable as you'd expect from a Lexus. Suspension is tuned to give a soft ride but tight enough for you to know its a sports car! Infotainment system is very easy to use in my opinion. The V6 engine is quiet and has ample horsepower to rival other cars in its class. One downside is the V6's fuel economy, which is so-so. Also the RC is a little heavy compared to others in the class. I usually get about 21mpg combined. I opted for the FSport package which included FSport exterior/interior styling and badges, adaptive variable transmission, 19in wheels w/ all-season Michelin tires, and a host of other features such as heated steering wheel and seats, back-up monitor with rear cross traffic alert, LFA inspired digital dash + more!

First, daily driving impressions:  When you start it up cold, it sounds like you would expect a muscle car V8 to sound.  AMAZING.  Not like ""annoy your neighbors"" loud, but just right.  If this car does not put a smile on your face when you start it, you're already dead and can't possibly be reading this.  As a daily driver, the car is stiff.  If you drive on rough roads, it might get old.  But I will say that I have grown to love the stiffness of it - and the seats are even more important than the suspension.  The seats in this car are so amazing that even all day drives in the seat will leave you feeling great.  They are truly a work of art - I would drive this car across the country without hesitation.   In keeping with Lexus tradition, the car is exceptionally refined, with great fit/finish and excellent materials throughout.  Track impressions and spirited mountain road driving:  A lot is made of this car's weight, but let me tell you:  this car is exceptionally balanced and it is absolutely track ready.  I've got 3 separate track days under my belt, some of which in mid 80 degree weather - the car never gets too hot, the brakes never die on you and you simply drive it home when you're done.  This car will hang with all but the fastest of sports cars.  On twisty mountain roads, you simply can't approach the car's limits.  Braking, shifting, steering feel are all excellent; plus you get the amazing (and now, RARE) sound of a naturally aspirated 5.0 V8 roaring when you press the skinny pedal.  If you can find another naturally aspirated V8 GT luxury coupe, buy it!  Just kidding, you won't, because there are literally no other choices.  This car is special .   - Last, and this bears mentioning, this car will GET ATTENTION. If you spend $150k on a Porsche 911, no one will look twice at you.  If you spend $100k plus on a Tesla, people will casually comment on your nice car.  But if you pull up in a Lexus RC-F, jaws hit the floor and everyone wants to talk to you about it.

5913, on 03/23/16 17:15 PM (PDT),Ron Palick ,2015 Lexus RC F Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 8cyl 8A),The RC-F Has  Alot Going For It.," Ok, so let me say there are a lot of choices in this type of car category, however, if you are looking for something that has ""Snap your Head Back performance', excellent build quality, and an interior that reflects an attention to detail , this is going to be a car you should take a close look at. Better yet, take it for a drive, you will be suitably impressed. Before purchasing this car, I owned my first Lexus, an RC 350 F Sport, a nice car no doubt. However, while the RC -350 is nice, the six cylinder just did not do it for me. I looked at the M4 and then Came back to Look at the RC-F. Yes, the M-4 is a nice car and has a lot going for it , however, so did the RC-F. While the RC-F is heavier, there were four things which won the day. The first is the V-8. When you fire this up in the morning you know you are riding a rocket as this baby really rumbles to life. The second thing that is really attractive, is the over all design and lines to this vehicle. I see all kinds of BMW's and the body shape and size all looks very similar, not the RC-F, this has a very distinctive look to it. Third, is the interior and seating. The attention to detail in this interior is flawless, something I think Lexus has dialed in. Finally let me say the overall performance of this car is truly breath taking. Dial; this in to Sport + mode and its ready to rip. Now I will never take this on a track, but lets just say when you put your foot into it, the rocket ship takes off. Are there faster cars out there. Yes, no doubt and while you could look at any one thing and say its no big deal, I think when you put them all together they made a compelling reason for me to purchase the RC-F. Okay, as with all things there are some things I don't like, or, feel they could be drastically improved on. The first is the Navi Screen. I would like to see a bigger one . The M-4's Navi looked nicer. The other thing I would like to see improved is a faster shifting transmission. No doubt when you are in Sport plus mode this does does shift faster, however in my opinion it could be improved upon, nevertheless to me this was not a deal breaker. I think at the end of the day the RC-F delivers performance and quality. for me, whats not to like?Up-Date: 11/2017Let me just make a brief update. I have had this car for just about two years. First let me say, I have had Zero Problems mechanically with this car. Taking it on long distance trips I have gotten 28 miles to the gallon. Do not miss understand , I did not buy this car for the mileage aspect, however, if you keep your foot out of it, the mileage can be very respectable. The hard part is keeping your foot off the accelerator. Let me also mention, Lexus did a software up date on the Transmission last year. It now shifts faster and is better at anticipating how you drive. Let's be clear, its not a dual clutch tranny so don't expect that, nevertheless, its still a thrill ride. Okay, so let me sum this update up. I like this car a lot and would not hesitate to buy another one. I am not a gran Prix driver, but like the acceleration and fine handling characteristics. This is a fun car to own and drive with zero, or minimal problems.",5

This is my second F, the first being the IS F.  This is a world-class machine with exceptional handling and performance. The car will run head-to-head with the M4 and defeat the RS5.If you are looking for a car that will run 4.3 0-60 mph runs all day and climb to 176 mph in 40 seconds, this is the ride.  Road & Track's Motown Mile had the RC F beating the M4 and RS5.  The Motortrend Head-to-Head on the Streets of Willow had the M4 and RC F finishing in a near dead heat with Randy Pobst driving.The RC F will destroy most tracks, if that is your thing, but most of us will drive it 363 days per year to the office and 2 days per year on a track.  And if you just want a daily driver with a huge fun factor, this too is your ride.

You are simply NOT getting anything worth it’s hefty tag of $100K! Let’s start with what it is LACKING that SUV’s 1/2 its price have.....NO Lane Assist, NO Panoramic Sunroof or Power Sunshade (manual only), NO Quiet Cabin (I clearly hear all road noise and the super irritating noise of the fans whenever the cooled/heated seats or cabin controls are on anything but low...(no excuse for this CHEAP design), NO Touch Pad screens, NO Color Changing Ambient Lighting, NO Choice of Engines, NO Keypad for phone dialing, NO Easy Interface (I am very good with technology but this thing is a joke), NO Rear USB ports, NO Digital Clock (only a hard-to-read analog one). In addition, it has poor leg room in the third due to bad floor design, Poor Cargo Space due to poorly designed folding seats, and ready for this one???!???...it comes with a car starter, but you only get to use it for ONE YEAR before they force you to pay for their Lexus Enform App to keep it going! NO yearly $300 App = NO Starter!! The drive is so clunky and tipsy around turns that I would compare it to navigating a tall cinder block on lego wheels. Oh, and the split truck is actually a big pain b/c they “forgot” to add power to the lower hatch, so if you have something heavy in your arms, you have to set it on the ground to manually open the dang lower trunk first! The controls are in horrible spots (coffee cups will block the single USB port and phone “cubby”, no other place for your phone. I have to constantly take my eyes of the road to try to navigate through the dinosaur limited options screen and buttons. Seriously, every question I have for Lexus on if there is something I might be missing, is met with a resounding NO! Unless you think it is ok to pay $100K for a vehicle that raises and lowers (no big deal since many other SUV’s do this too), and you’re OK with getting 10MPG b/c they didn’t bother to improve consumption, then save yourself from this headache and buy something else.

The engine in the newer model is more sluggish, and if a more rapid acceleration is desired, the engine sounds like a 4 cylinder that is about to throw a rod.

Not a very good tire and I am at this moment in my 3rd week without being able to drive my car because the tires are nationally on a back order.  The vehicle is sitting at my Lexus dealer, who doesn't really know what to tell me at this point.    The screens for watching television in the back seat stick so far off of the backs of the front seats that they encroach on the headspace of the rear seat passengers.  I found this almost scary when I sat in the back seat.  Anti-lock brake mechanism is not smooth and if hard braking is required, the tires seem to skip around on the road.

I've never owned four of anything, and every time I think about getting another LX570, I read about all others in the same category and drive them to see if there is something better. There isn't. And with each passing year, the LX570 just gets better. Yes, there are two other brands that are perceived to have higher status, but both have crappy resale and are filled with antiquated technology. I've taken mine in soft sand on the Washington Coast, without any problems or fear of getting stuck. I have used crawl control twice. There is no vehicle better suited for a road trip. It's the ultimate for that purpose, except for the low gas mileage. Don't pay attention to the computer that shows you getting 12. I'm getting closer to 15-18, which still isn't great, but this is a massive, very heavy SUV. I keep buying them because given the value and high resale, the overall cost of ownership is far lower than the other two in the same price point. American SUVs feel cheap to me and don't have the same attention to detail. I also have an S550 and I still prefer driving the LX570. It's also the little details, the quality of the switches, the feel of buttons, all the touch points that make the LX a better vehicle. Some of the others look cooler, more trendy, but you pay for it in lost features and horrible resale. If this is a dog hauler, it's best with the third row seat down and a seat cover. With the two seats up, the critters don't have any side visibility and the window line is high. Best to toss them in the third row seat, which still leaves enough room for groceries behind the third row, and a hair-free back seat. It's that third row seat for dogs that is a must for me. When you put it in Sport mode, it really does stiffen up and you can toss it around while paddle shifting. Yes, it's a beast and don't expect it to want to grip the road like the family Lamborghini, however that said, it will delight you if you let it. What I love about Lexus is that they just don't break. In my years of owning the brand, I've only had a few occasions when I had any unscheduled maintenance and that was in the 90s. I have about 4,000 miles on my 2017 and I'm thrilled with it. I do wish the second row had a tiny bit more leg room, but it's still not bad. Other gripes- though minor, would be the way you can't control the GPS while in camera mode on split screen. Also, when it comes to media, you have to spend some time getting to know the full capabilities. It can do a lot.

You likely will not buy it.  I bought it before the snow flew.  In years past, I had driven other LXs on snow and ice and they were great.  Thought this one would be even better with improvements over the years.  NOT!  First, all LX models in the US are shipped with the ""optional"" 21"" wheels/tires.  NOBODY makes replacement tires for the size that comes on the car.  You are stuck with what comes on it - great in the summer, junk in the winter.  Literally the absolute worst tires ever on snow and ice for an SUV.  They will not stop this heavy vehicle.  When I called/wrote to Lexus to complain about buying a $100k SUV that cannot be safely driven in the snow in Colorado, Lexus was beyond uninterested in the problem.  I would not buy this vehicle again, which is unfortunate since in good weather it is very nice.  It rides more comfortably than any of the competitors I drove (many) and is much more quiet and refined.  The technology is outstanding as is the Mark Levinson stereo (best I have ever heard in any vehicle).  The acceleration is very weak though.  Definitely not up to par in this class.  But it is livable.  Gas mileage is abysmal but let's face it, people who buy these cars are probably not terribly concerned with that.  Still, it has a relatively small gas tank so I fill it much more than I had to fill my previous Yukon XL Denali (which also got an average of 2-4mpg better than the LX).

It feels as though it was built to go the ends of the Earth and, more importantly, MAKE IT BACK unscathed!",5

This SUV is identical to the Toyota Land Cruiser underneath and even the interior is roughly the same. Lexus added a little more leather and changed the badge. Speaking on the Land Cruiser it handles and drives the same. One of the greatest off-road vehicles you can buy right now, and it will probably outlast you. I do think that there are better options in this class of vehicle if you are not constantly driving off-road. The Range Rover is possibly a bit better off and on road but also has a higher price and checkered reliability. Not a bad vehicle but save yourself $10,000 and get the Land Cruiser.",4

The more I drive my LX, the more I am convinced that I made the right choice!When I did my search for a new car, my only requirements were to drive a large luxury SUV. As an owner of 2 companies that drives approximately 20,000 miles a year, my needs were ""Luxury"" and ""Utility"". I test drove BMW's X5, Mercedes GL-450, Land Rover, The Audi Q7, Cadillac Escalade, and the Lincoln Navigator.In my opinion, the LX-570 had many advantages over the others. It's ride was the smoothest and quietest. It was COMFORTABLE! (Extremely comfortable in fact) Ergonomically, none of the others came even close. It's navigation with Destination Assist was by far the most advanced and easiest to use. (I use it all the time and love it). Fit and finish and especially reliability are second to none. It's size was also very appealing to me. It's not too big such as the Escalade and Navigator, and yet it's still big enough for a 3rd row seat. It's also very wide and roomy inside which I really like. The European SUVs on the other hand, felt very narrow and tight and many lacked the 3rd row seat. I have had the opportunity to drive my LX in various driving conditions. From day to day L.A. traffic, to a 300+ mile drive in stormy rain and snow thru windy mountain roads and even driving all the way to Montana and back with 5 adults and fully loaded with gear. (5500 miles in 19 days to visit all the major national parks in the western states, including, Yellow Stone, Teton, Glacier, Olympic, Mount Rainier, Mount Saint Helen, Redwood Forest, etc) I have also done several day long trips to various other cities such as Las Vegas, Phoenix, Tucson and San Francisco to name just a few. (I do several trade shows each year) In all my travels, whether I'm driving thru the desert at 120 degrees Fahrenheit or in inclement weather, I find the LX comfortable, luxurious, quiet, smooth and reassuring.

If you seek or compare either to a Range Rover you haven't owned one, driven one and/or done enough research to know what a hunk of junk the RR really so please stop with the nonsense. I have driven and know the Merc is super solid and reliable, not sure it is as nice unless you compare to the G wagon or maybe AMG packages. I bought the LX for my wife and I want to get one for myself because it is bad to the bone. I towed my 7,000 lb boat on a 2000 mi trip just to see how it would do and while I probably didn't look as cool as the guy is his F-250 I can guarantee I was more comfortable as the LX was an absolute beast.

This vehicle will definitely not attract most of the SUV lovers. It's fuel economy is not great and it holds too less for what it needs.

If you want to buy a large, flagship SUV that has awesome ""Lexus"" reliability and descent maintenance cost that you'll keep for a decade or so while treated welcome at the dealers, this is your car.

Drive train is strong. Supercharger gives it plenty of power. The driver’s seat leather shows some wear, but the rest of the interior is immaculate. No rattles, no squeaks, no abnormal wind noise. Looking forward to driving it this winter. This vehicle is proof of Toyota’s durability, even after 20 years.Update: Decided to sell the LX as the wife was using it as a daily driver and needed something that got better mileage. We hated to see it go, but it was fun while we had it. It started consuming a bit of oil, probably the valve stem seals as it had sat for a long period prior to us buying it.

I was shopping for a Toyota Land Cruiser when I found this LX, and if you have done any research, you know that they are the same vehicle, with different badges and a few extra toys. The locking diffs are great off-road, and the factory stereo and CD changer still sound great.Everything inside works as it should with the exception of the power seats, which seems to be an issue with most of these cars. The motors are $500 apiece, and luckily mine broke in the right spot for me to be comfortable in. The A/C is great and the heat is fantastic. Oh, the light on the dash that illuminates the ""D"" has burned out, really, I cannot complain about that.Mechanically, this truck is amazing. The engine, gearbox and 4WD system are still running flawless. The only thing I have had to replace is the radiator, and will soon need a new power steering pump, but other than routine maintenance, it has been trouble free. I would not hesitate to get in it and drive cross country tomorrow.On the outside, the paint is fade-free and the clear-coat still intact. The upright windshield gives great visibility but is prone to catching rocks. The rear bumper finish is starting to crack and come off, but it's not really a great concern of mine since it does not affect the way the truck drives. I have a mild lift and am running ""35's so the gas mileage is not so great (getting 14 mpg. in mixed use) and the ride can be a little harsh, but if you want a cloud like ride, buy a Lincoln Town Car (which is what I did).I am a wildlife photographer and needed a truck that I could trust to get me into nature and back home when I was done. From rocky tracks to muddy trails to snow and ice covered roads, my Lexus has never faltered or given me a reason to be concerned.

I called Lexus in July 2016 to tell them that while driving on the freeway, my ABS VCS light went on, I heard a high pitched sound that went on continuously and I lost my brakes. I was with my 8 year old daughter.  She was very frightened and thought we were gonna die.  I called Lexus Jim Falk Beverly Hills service department and they said this was normal.  They said to just turn off the engine and wait a few minutes because the ABS needs to reset.   So after this incident, it happened to me 3 more times and I just did the ""normal"" procedure  of turning the engine off and waiting 5 minutes.   But just last week, I was driving my pregnant wife to the doctor and this thing happened again and we almost hit the car in front of us.  So I brought it to Longo Lexus service department immediately and they told me that my brake actuator needed to be replaced and that would cost me $4,000 to fix!!!  They also told me that this is a known issue with the Lexus RX400h and that they had a campaign that replaced these for free in 2016 and this campaign had expired December 31, 2017.  It is March 2018 already so obviously I can't avail of that free replacement.  So I called Lexus corporate office and told them my story about losing my brakes, not knowing about the campaign, and Lexus telling me this was normal (They actually verified that phone call in their records).  They said they would escalate this to the highest manager in Lexus.   So now, they just got back to me saying that even with the record of that phone call to Lexus, there is NO PROOF that the car did lose its brakes because no one inspected it at that time it happened.  Let me get this straight LEXUS, YOU WANT ME TO DRIVE A CAR WITH NO BRAKES TO A LEXUS DEALER WHICH IS 10 MILES AWAY???   All i could do at that time was call.

First is it's incredibly dumb that a passenger can not program the vehicle while the car is in motion.  Second is the warning notice which displays for 5 or 6 seconds everytime you hit the NAV button.  There should be a way to stop it from doing that.,5

What's truly remarkable is the outstanding power performance when you need it, and the equally outstanding fuel economy in stop and go city traffic.

I purchased this car in a nearly new condition with less than 100 miles on the odo.  It's backstory is too involved to repeat here. I've owned a number of SUV's over time and this vehicle is indeed a very indulgent selection. Ride, Road Noise and the like just vanish when inside the cabin.  This year's 2006 Tech does not compare with what is available  today but the Bluetooth hands free phone link and DVD navigation are a huge plus for any busy commuter or road warrior. My only real con's are the voice recognition is terrible as it can not recognize anything outside of the pre-programmed script input. End guidance is proper but stop navigation will get you nothing. Also the Hybrid returns a minimal improvement in overall gas mileage although it does provide a great boost in acceleration in the road. I did find the hybrid ""boost"" causes the car to lurch forward and pulls to the side... not good in some situations. My model has a rear DVD player with 2 wireless headphones to keep little one's busy, a nice touch that I rarely used.

A recent 300-mile road trip to the Antelope Valley Poppy Preserve averaged 28 mpg on the mountainous roads of the Angeles National Forest.    My normal everyday driving has never seen below 26mpg combined, and during open highway cruising I average 31mpg -- that's amazing for a heavy crossover!   The key is -- regular maintenance, tire pressure 34-36psi, keep to 60-65mph on the highway and 40-42 on the streets.   A very comfortable road trip car!   I like the RX because it sits higher than most crossovers and lower than SUVs, you still step *up* onto your seat like a SUV but it's must more fuel-efficient.   While it doesn't get the 50mpg of my old Prius, it's much more comfortable and feels safer due to the higher seating position.  Gas prices in CA are going up again so I am very happy with my purchase.    Besides mpg, the electric hybrid motor makes car accelerate like a V8 and feels much faster than regular RX.

The gps is akward and outdated, and updates are definitely not worth the cost.  There is no way to add an auxiliary input for audio from any other source, the back seat passengers can modify your gps entries from the rear seat entertainment system and you cannot stop them from doing so because you can't make that system stay off if they turn it back on.  The car has horrible body roll in corners, worse than any other vehicle I've driven in 40 years of driving.

But in thinking of doing all this work I decided this is a overall very reliable car and worth doing as the car rides well, looks good,and is nice to drive. I figure the Prius 's I have seen used as cabs are going over 300,000 miles so there is some precedent for long term ownership. Yes I would buy one again ( and I guess by fixing it I am planning another 90,000 miles , I hope ! ) ",3.75

I find myself constantly playing the game of trying to maximize the efficiency and in the process developed a lighter right foot to allow the car to ""glide"" more (CVT is gearless so no downshifts like the conventional transmission when you let go of the accelerator). The car slows down mainly from the force of friction between the road and tires. Hate to admit it, but the car has trained me to become a better driver.",4.75

Previously owned a 2000 RX 300 and 2004 RX 330. I've driven the car about 3000 miles and find it to be a completely different car than the previous Lexus models I've owned.  So far, getting about 30 mpg with a mix of city/highway driving (my RX 330 got about  21-23 mpg).  I live in the mountains and drive up steep grades and around sharp curves and love the handling and performance.  Achieving peak mileage in a hybrid requires some adjustments in driving technique, but this doesn't mean slow driving!  Fit/finish are better than on the RX 330.

However, it is a hybrid so one shouldn't expect sports car performance but don't expect any at all.  The car is slow. Period.  Even though I liked the car a lot, one problem I had with is was the maintenance and repair costs.  I am sure that it is because it is a Lexus which causes the prices to be so high.

Mileage drops a bit once you start cruising at 70 or above.  Note that this car is designed for optimal performance and not optimal fuel economy.  Don't buy if your main goal is to save money on gas.",5
6145, on 03/11/07 12:17 PM (PDT),GKC ,2007 Lexus RX 400h SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Poorly Built," You should think twice before buying this vehicle. I am only 5'6"" and when delivered, the front seats of my 400h would not go back far enough and had to be unbolted and moved, at a $500 expense to me. Also my head is against the roof with the seat all the way down.The front seat belts are too short and extensions have to be used which compromise safety. The car lunges forward, usually in park, when it switches from electric to gas engine. Gas use runs 20 mpg in town and 17 mpg on the road. It has been back to the dealer and they say there is nothing wrong with the vehicle. ",2.25

Lexus certainly has the market cornered when it comes to combining luxury, sport and fuel economy! The best purchase I have made yet!",5
6147, on 01/24/07 13:15 PM (PST),RAC ,2007 Lexus RX 400h SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Extraordinary Engineering," We needed more cargo space in our vehicles but didn't want a gas guzzling SUV.  The Lexus has proved to be a wonderful solution - we have plenty of cargo space inside and on the roof and the hybrid system, while taking some time to get used to, has been just terrific.  The ride is smooth and quiet - the hybrid drive works flawlessly and is a wonder to watch on the monitor and there is more than enough power when you need it.  The entire vehicle is beautifully built, roomy and very well equipped.  The navigation system is a bit daunting at first, but use the quick guide - you'll be fine.  Mileage is getting there - when broken in we think it will be just about at published levels.  Fantastic!",5

Originally came from the Volvo for Life Family but Volvo sold me a 2003 XC90 with too many problems. I want quality, safety, service, and piece of mind. Instantly fell in love with Lexus hybrid ride. Could not tell SUV was on.  Talk about get up & go. This baby has power. I keep the cruse control on because I am worried about speeding. It is like floating on a cloud, dont realize how fast youre going. Was hoping for better gas mileage. Getting anywhere from 26 to 27 mpg (drive both highway and city). Better than what I was getting before so Im still pleased. Manual says it gets better after 5000 miles. Will see.  ",4.625
6149, on 12/31/06 20:59 PM (PST),Amy Smith ,2007 Lexus RX 400h SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.3L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid CVT),Superb Vehicle," I was determined to buy a hybrid this year -- one that would last until the market would be open wider in terms of alternative fuels.  I currently get about 30 mpg, and this is almost 2-1/2 times my previous vehicle.  LOVE IT -- superb.  Bravo Toyota.",5

Could have more room between the front seats. Good gas mileage, not as expected but good enough. I've been driving it since February/06 and can't get over how quiet it is. I'm never tired of driving this car.",4.75

I'm still trying to get used to no engine starting when I turn the key.  Very quiet and smooth ride.  Fuel economy is avg. around 24-25 mpg over the first 100 miles (about 50/50 hwy/city) -- I have a little bit of a foot, but have been going pretty gentle on the pedal.  I have made a couple of individual 5-10 mile trips in city with up to 32 mpg.  I'm happy with 25 mpg compared to my Lin. Nav at 10 mpg. Had an issue this morning with a dead ICE battery.  Lexus sent out AAA who didn't know squat about hybrids, so I ended up reading the owners manual to the tow truck driver.  A quick jump start and everything was fine -- I hope. ",4.875
6152, on 09/11/16 15:34 PM (PDT),Rich Haapala ,2016 Lexus GS F Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.0L 8cyl 8A),GS F Refined nastiness," I was disappointed with the initial pricing of this car when it first landed at the dealerships.  I thought it was a little overpriced for its comparative group.  It lacks that punchy torque its competitors have, but makes up for it with an awesome sound and plenty of upper range power.   I'm a larger guy and I find the side bolstering to be a tad snug, but my wife loves the  seats.  My Cayenne had adjustable bolstering which for the near 90K range this should have as well.  Also, I am less than thrilled with the unusual color of the side mirrors and A/B pillar.  They are a boring grey color that really doesn't match my Atomic Silver, and the side window surround is chrome while the front end has a very good looking black chrome.  Seems like poor attention to detail by Lexus.  Overall, I am VERY satisfied with this (my 4th Lexus). I have been following this car since 2010 and really wanted it, but would not have purchased if not for 5K rebate from Lexus.",4
