0, on 01/01/05 19:28 PM (PST),Jeff ,2004 Maserati Spyder Convertible Cambiocorsa 2dr Convertible (4.2L 8cyl 6AM),Maserati Thrill Ride," I bought my Maserati Spyder Cambiocorsa in May of 2004.  The car is a light metallic blue with a light tan and navy interior.  The car is fully optioned.  The interior is the best looking interior of any car I have ever been in.  Leather is everywhere and it is of the highest quality.  While ferrari does own maserati they are very different cars. This car is a GT car, smoother ride and without the wild looks of a ferrari but it still gets tons of attention. It is in the same price range as the SL500 but much rarer and faster.  Do not get the nav system it is almost useless,  barely showing any information.  The paddle shifters are amazing, though the 6 speed manual is very smooth too.",4.875
1, on 12/05/04 06:07 AM (PST),Francie ,2004 Maserati Spyder Convertible Cambiocorsa 2dr Convertible (4.2L 8cyl 6AM),My second Spyder," I got the very first Maserati Spyder delivered by Ferrari of Washington when the new model came out. I traded in my first, silver Maserati with a black interior, for a black Spyder with a tan interior.  I have driven it on the road and on the racetrack, it is totally responsive to all commands in both situations.  This car is tight, smooth, powerful, fast, and beautiful.",4.75
2, on 12/04/04 15:28 PM (PST),West8 ,2004 Maserati Spyder Convertible GT 2dr Convertible (4.2L 8cyl 6M),Fast & Fun," After owning several comparable cars in the past the Maserati Spyder holds its own with preformance and style.  It's great to drive a car that is unique and not typically seen on the road.  Now my Porche spends much more time in the garage. The only problem I have found is in the design of the soft top.  When the lid is up there is an over the shoulder blind spot that creates a problem. But who cares...when is the lid up anyway? Other than that, this car is well worth the price tag.",4.375

I don't think so!, Ok so I am a 55 year old man who has come to the point in my life when I can afford some of the nicer things in life. I know this might be sounding like a CRISIS Eulogy.. but let me tell you after a week of The John Barber Racing School and then the following week my felivery of my Masserati and there is nothing midlife about this baby.

The car handles great. I took it through an autocross, and it ate it up.It outhandled my friend's Ferrari 360.The interior is classic Italian, beautifully stitched leather covers the entire interior.  The seats hug you and hold you in place for when you are at those high speeds.Also like an Italian sports car, all of the power is in the higher RPM's. If you are in the city or just cruising along, keep the car in the ""normal"" mode; as this gives you a softer ride and normal shifting. If you want to open it up, put it in ""Sport"" mode and push the pedal all the way to the floor and watch this baby perform.FYI-This en",4.5

I had already owned a S2000 and Boxster S, Found the new BMW Z4 underpowered and ugly. So decided on Maserati mainly due to the V8 390 hp Ferrari motor in it. After ordering one last Nov. without even sitting in one let alone driving I started to wonder if I had made a mistake. It seemed most reviews were not that favorable to them. I found that all my fears were unwarranted. Car was everything and more than what I was looking for. Found the Shifting excellent and had the dealer put on Tubi exhaust and car sounds better than any Ferrari I have heard. ",4.875

This new <Maserati is just a super, fun car to own and drive.  It wants to be driven.  So far, its quality seems very good.

The engine is the highlight, 400 horsepower with a Tubi exhaust, sounds great and it is pretty fast.  I like the looks quite a bit but that is personal taste.  Interior is well done, but fit and finish is average at best.  I understand buying a car like this will have some flaws and so far the car has been in twice for issues.  I like this ride because you don't see many of them on the roads, like Mercedes SL 500's and Jaguar XK8, and Porsche 911's.  This car is understated compared to pricier exotics.",3.875

I have driven many different, high-end sports cars and my Spyder is the most fun to drive because of the Formual One transmission.  The car can be driven in automaic mode or you can shift manually with the paddles on the steering column.  The top goes up or down in about 30 seconds with the touch of a button, and it is really a head turner on the road.  I had the Tubi Eghaust put on mine and it souds awesome!  I love it!",4.875

The thrust of the V8 is incredible and the sound is very satisfying. The electric top neatly stows in within seconds. I previously owned a 2002 BMW M3 convertible, and their is no comparison. My M3 struggled in winter driving as I live in Minnesota, but the skyhook suspension on the Maserati makes winter driving suprisingly pleasant, I have driven this car through the 2 winters without a problem. The customer service could be better with Maserati, my car has had numerous problems with the windshield wiper motor, and needed to be replaced, but thats it, great car would highly recommend.",4.25

Engine is wonderful both in appearance and performance. Wide rev range and great Ferrari sound over 5K. A chain belt gives a Ferrari- designed engine performance without the superexpensive belt changes.Interior is beautiful, throttle progressive, brakes good, steering and clutch light, but first and second gear are baulky. Free dealer upgrade helped a bit, but still not as good as Porsche. Scuttle shake is the only other issue, especially when starting off for some reason, but overall this is a super secondhand value and a fun ride. ",4.875

They arrived at the same time and I test drove them back to back.  The plastic interior, cheap feeling switchgear and contrived exterior design of the SL compared poorly with the Maserati (and with the previous SL).  The real difference was in the driving.

The two could not be more different. This car has soul! It also drives beautifully,My wife mostly uses the auto mode which works great around town.

But for those who believe that beauty is only skin deep, get in, hit the gas and hold on. This car is not only fast but it corners ""as if it's on rails"". Another nice feature is that at six foot three I fit comfortably in the car and also can get out gracefully. I was on a waiting list for the new SL500 but saw the Maserati at the car show.

My Jaguar was a great car too but I did not care for the GPS. I paid more for this car then I should have due to the shipping in to the US from Italy. This is a great car, though it is not a family car. So for my wife I bought her the S80 T6, in my opinon it is one of the better luxury marquees.

In our younger years, we've had a brand new Corvette and some Mercedes too, including a 560 SL, all of which we have grown tired of over time.  We briefly considered a BMW, but it seems nearly every college kid has one now or at least a friend who does and quite frankly, there are so many BMW's on the road today, they  are even becoming boring to the eye.  So, this time, while we had our eye on the upcomming re-styled 2017 Porche Panamera, we just got tired of waiting and found ourselves attracted to the Maserati Gibli.  Not only did we save some cash, but we are convinced we made the right choice when chossing the GIBLI S instead of the Panamera.  We just took our first long distance road trip (about 2500 miles) and we probably received more compliments about our Maserati in a week, than in a lifetime of driving other vehicles, because it is simply the nicest vehicle we've ever had.  We love ours!!!",5
44, on 04/25/16 18:02 PM (PDT),will ,2015 Maserati Ghibli Sedan S Q4 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),One of the best I have driven," I really love the way this car drives. It is very comfortable.  I have the sport suspension and it really is about perfect. The engine is really spectacular.  I have read some reviews that mentioned that it did have to build boost,  I can sometimes feel the hesitation when starting from a stop.  It has incredible acceleration.  The exhaust sounds fantastic.  My main complaint in this car is the stereo.  It just really does not sound that great.  The infotainment system works really well.  I have read where some critics have blasted using the same system from a Jeep Grand Cherokee,  but I think it is one of the best I have seen.  It is very easy to use.My last complain is the parking sensors.  It would be nice to have a switch to toggle it on and off. The car really looks good and I get tons of compliments.  I also think the interior is very nice.  The seats look and feel great.  If it weren't for the stereo,  I would say it was the best car I have owned.",4

It is Q4 quick, handling is fantastic and the interior is plain but elegant. Many will notice this is not the typical everyday Mercedes that are all too common. Many will notice this the Ghibili is packing some power simply at start-up. Many will also like to go for a ride. I really like the trunk space! The lines are unequivocally unmatched with a simply beautiful paint job that was meant to last. The wheels are sweet and the stagger is perfect. Now, for the just ok. The stereo needs aftermarket help and the gas mileage is not that great. Anyhow, go drive one and get to know it! The Maserati Ghibili and I think you will find that it really is a car that you will love.I put in a 10"" JL sub and amp. Lots of cutting but came out fantastic.UPDATE:  after owning this car for a couple years now I've put a set of Michelin 3+ and the ride even better than it was before !  I am very pleased with my purchase and happy I did not buy an Audi, Mercedes or BMW.UPDATE:  The more I drive this car the more enjoyable it has become.  There is nothing new to report. I am pleased with my choice over the other noted above.",5
46, on 03/04/16 15:29 PM (PST),"Richard DeLoskey, PhD ",2015 Maserati Ghibli Sedan S Q4 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Very nice luxury sports sedan," I have owned this car for about 6 months and have driven it just under 6,000 miles.    I have driven a Porsche Panamera for about 120 miles.   Both cars are excellent and a blast to drive.  The Maserati Ghibli is not quite as responsive as the Porsche Panamera, but it has a softer ride and nicer interior.   The navigation is the best I have ever used, very user friendly; you don't have to read the intruction to use, it is that intuitive!!!!!   I do not understand the complaints by reviewers about the shared Chrysler knobs and similar navigation system.  None of the other manufacturers (Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi, or Porsche) use significantly better knobs and most have less intuitive navigation systems that require one to at least read part of the instructions.  If your only compliant are the knobs and the easy-to-use navigation unit, then I would say, it is a great sports sedan.   I chose the Maserati Ghibli over the Porsche Panamera mainly because of the price for two very comparable cars;  these 2 luxury sports sedans stand out from the others in style and driving performance on windy roads.  Don't believe the reviews, drive it for yourself and experience the Ghibli or the Quatroporte.

47, on 03/01/16 22:44 PM (PST),Michael Harper ,2015 Maserati Ghibli Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),The Maserati Ghibili Is That Car!," I have owned a Mercedes for over 10 years, test driven few of the new models and spoken to the mechanics a the Mercedes dealer. Why? Because once you own a Mercedes it is very hard to change to a different sedan much like Corvette owners. After testing the Maserati Ghibili, inspecting as much as possible with an eye for detail and speaking to mechanics, I have a feeling that some of the reviews on this car are written by the competition. I do not know this for sure but I have to tell you I have decided to make the switch to the Maserati S Q4. Here are my reasons. The power is flat out amazing. The exterior and interior is very unique and absolutely stunning. The leather and comfort in the front two seats is fantastic. My kids are happy in the back seats. The gauges are very easy to read and the handling is better that most in its class however the ride is a bit stiffer vs many of the Mercedes models but not by much. The trunk has quite a bit more room that you would think. The stereo needs work but I will get that straightened out somehow. The gas mileage is not great but with gas prices so low, I am fine with that for now. I wish I could speak toward the reliability of the Q4 but I can not at this time. One of the main decisions that I considered was that every day while driving I see soooo many Mercedes-Benz vehicles on the road that they have become a bit boring to look at. Anyhow, good luck on whatever you decide :)",5

At the same time I was also very intrigued by other very positive reviews and comments. It looks like objectivity is not a parameter commonly used to review the Ghibli !   So.... I tested (test drive) against other upscale cars I was interested in and decide to buy the Ghibli based on my own taste and driving experience. As of today I am sooooo glad....    Yes, objectively, there are aspects that needs improvement (gear paddle, belt locking mechanism easier to reach, quality of audio system) but compared to the car style (class on its own), the performances and (sublime) handling these are just minor issues (or vile excuses for a few detractors).    I have only 1200 miles on the car and cannot completely  assess the reliability, but as far as brake,  handling and overall performance (these not subjective...)  I really cannot (logically) explain negative comments in those areas, go figure !",5

This is a great car. for the price of a 5 series or  boring E class you get an all wheel drive Ferrari powered car and you can pre-pay for all service costs for 4 years for less than $2000.00. People complain about Chrysler parts ... but they don't call these same parts Chrysler when the see them in a Mercedes! (most modern Chrysler stuff is from when Mercedes owned them) Certified deals are out there making it an even better choice (5 year 100,000 mile certified warranty).

56, on 12/09/17 13:23 PM (PST),JBR ,2017 Maserati Ghibli Sedan S Q4 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Worst seats in history," The front seats are so painfully uncomfortable they could be used to coerce confessions. The upper part of the seats, behind the shoulders, is too narrow and sticks out way too far, so you can't really sit back into the seat without feeling like you have two fists in your shoulder blades. I can basically drive the car for five minutes without being in pain. And there's really no fix to this, especially because the corporate office is totally nonresponsive, and the dealer is just happy to have one less of these things to have to move.  I guess I should've leaned back more into the seat during the short test drive.  And that's just the front seat.  Back seat passengers have difficulty getting in and out, and then complain that the seats are too wedge-like, like their butt is being pinched together. Anyway, I've been trying to sell this car from the moment I leased it. I know I'll take a hit, but it's better than being in pain for the next three years (and maybe I'll just sue the company). Next time I'll just spend a little extra money and get a proper Mercedes or Jaguar or something like that.",2

The customer service is brutal unless you pay out the ass for their premium customer service. I CANT WAIT for this lease to be end. It would take an INSANE deal for me to even entertain the thought of getting another Maserati and even at that it would only be the Levante. This is not a good everyday driver. The minute there are more than 2 people in the car it bottoms out when you hit a rock. The Front end constantly feels like its on ice skates.

If you think you have somehow stumbled across a $150,000 car for half price, you will be disappointed. On the used market, these cars are a great buy, but don't expect the hand crafted interior of a Bentley. A high end Italian sport sedan on a budget has to have compromises, and they can be found on the quality of materials, Chrysler sourced components (the nav interface is actually quite good, albeit cheap looking), and lack of high end features. The driving experience however, is all Maserati with one of the most intoxicating exhaust notes I have ever heard. The power, sound, handling, brakes, and overall performance are everything you would hope them to be. Let's be honest, a major reason for buying the car is the name, and I can say it does get just as much attention as you would expect. When it's time for service, do your self a favor and take it to an independent, although the aftermarket parts market is all but nonexistent. Hopefully this will change as more of these cars reach a mature age and numbers increase. While I think this car is tough to justify at the new price of competitors, it is truly a great buy on the used side and the chance for the average guy to own a real Italian exotic super sedan.",4

The transmission stops at Reverse mode and does not go all the way to the Parking mode easily after you park your car, A few times car moved back caused dangerous situations for me.It was a recall on it but they could not fix it.The mirrors has a larger blind-spot area compare to other cars.Sound system and Bluetooth stops working sometimes and I have to turn the engine on and off to makes it work again and dealer did not find any solution for it.There was about 10 recalls on this car since 2015 and I had to make appointments to drop it off at dealer to fix it.It is very inconvenient if you have a busy day schedule to commit yourself to amount of services that this car requires.The loaner from Maserati while your car is in the dealer for repair or service is from car rental  companies and it is not even a Luxury car usually.The appointments to fix this car was long and I had to drive my other car in between when there was a major problem with this car.

There is considerable lag when you punch the gas, unless you pre-rev it.  The power is, however, astonishing for a car weighing over two tons.  Comfort is better than many snobs acknowledge, as are the controls.  I have hit nearly 30mpg on the highway at 80-85mph over distances, so the fuel consumption is better than expected.  The handling, even in rain or snow, is very good.  Obviously, it looks great.  I have not had much in the way of maintenance trouble, though there have been a number of recalls (fixed for free).  The pain job is unfortunately susceptible to dings, especially on the hood, and Maserati to date has not offered any touch-up paint, so one would need to get a clear plastic protector or periodic paint jobs.....The bluetooth is not the best, as it is much better in cheaper cars like Acuras.

Don't let you drive for the awesome exterior design. In six month has been 4 times at the dealer because of several issues. They said the car has 400 horse power. My mistake was not to ask what kind of horses were those. Looks like they are hungry small ponies. The fuel consumption is insane for what you get. Forget about acceleration. I had a Diesel Porche Cayenne before and that was really fast. I've paid for an upgrade for the sound system ... the sound is worst than a cheap Korean car. The quality of the screen for the rear camera is the same one I got with my old Commodore 64 in the 80'. If you want to buy something to drink do not expect to find a cup holder where your drink will fit. The mats are going to be wherever they want, the clips are not going to hold them. Sits are design to drive short distance. Diver sit couldn't be more uncomfortable. If your plan is to travel and leave the car in the Garage, make your trip shorter than 3 weeks otherwise you will need a battery charger.

The Maserati Quattroporte was a looker, but I was familiar with its issues. Hence, the Ghibli made a lot of sense on paper. Price was right, size was right, looks were right. Ordered the car without knowing the price. When it was delivered, my word it was like the first time I saw an R8, it was gorgeous. However, after owning it, I've found it to be a Chrysler in an Armani suit. The transmission is clunky and slow in comfort mode, but too aggressive in sport. It'd be nice if there was an auto mode to filter that issue. The car is TOO LOW. It scrapes everything. For a mid-size sedan, why must I treat every incline like a Ferrari. A lift-system is necessary. The brakes are the most sensitive and inconsistent I've ever felt. I thought that my A8 was difficult to modulate, but this Ghibli is another animal. Lastly, the maintenance....it's a sub-$90k car full optioned, so why is the maintenance the same as a Bentley. You'll be paying easily $1,200 for an annual maintenance. Save yourself the money and purchase a proper German vehicle..unless you enjoy teenage boys taking pictures of your car wherever you go. That's my two-cents.",2

However, at the same token, I expected a lot more for the price. I traded in a 2012 Merceds-Benz C300 4Matic and the Mercedes had more reliable features than the Maserati! And aside from the power of the Maserati, the performance of the Mercedes was comparable (and much less costly). I do hear a slight rattle at time in the front that of course the dealer can not replicate. Additionally, I hear a ""swooshing"" sound at all speeds (perhaps this is the Turbo intake but it is distracting and seems a bit odd to me. Dealer denies any issues found). By far the worst feature on the car is the Garmin navigation. It is horrible! It often just shuts off (very annoying when in the middle of finding where I am) and resets. Literally happens at least 4-5 times in a one hour trip. Never had a single time where it did not do this. Horrible. The Mercedes GPS - 100% reliable, 100% of the time. I understand most cars are going to this but the lack of a hard copy user manual is a bit frustrating. The Sirius radio also does not have as many available features as I had on the Mercedes. All that said, it is a head turner and I really like the design and it does not give me much trouble. Would I buy one again? Probably not, but again it is not a terrible car.",4

You need winter tires and summer tires. If the weather drops to 50 degrees or below, the tires sense the cold and cuts the fuel to the engine causing a severe ""bucking"" feeling when pulling onto a main road from a stop street. Masserati isn't doing anything about this issue and they have been the worst customer service company I have ever dealt with. I would not recommend Maserati to anyone.

The car has the worst 'upgraded' radio of any car most readers of this review has today. The dealer replaced my amplifier but the problem persists. The airflow to the floor is terrible, comes out mostly at the windshield. That they also don't know how to fix. The seat belt clip is low that it takes spraining ones back just to click the seat belt. The car even would not start on 2 occasions, embarrassing! It's a shame that since 1914, Maserati has not figured out these seemingly simple things. If you have more than $75K to spend, you better spend it on a car with luxury and performance. I own high end BMW, MB, Porsche, AUDI. Ghibli is a disgrace.In addition to the above, none of the above issues have been resolved. I now have a few more years of driving this car since my last review. Unlike other new, high end cars, it would be nice if adaptive cruise control, touchless homelink and touchless start could be incorporated into the vehicle. Most of these could be done by computer updates, I have since bought a new Tesla Model X. Only a nimble car company will survive in the future. The car still has an awesome engine and braking system, but that's about it. I will not buy this car today!I almost forgot that there is NO good way to charge your phone or other electronics because it does not have a charging USB port and the cigarette lighter receptacle is too shallow that I have literally tried more than 8 different ones and none of them fits well.

I had a 2003 Mercedes-Benz CL600 for 5 years and it was braking the bank!  For reliability, it was the worst car I have ever owned!  I looked for many months for a good replacement and also decided to go with a 4 door car.  I found a stunning bespoken 2008 Quattroporte Executive GT car with the most beautiful paint job . . . ever.  It has the very rare ""blu malogo"" paint.  For our crappy road conditions in California I believe that 18"" wheels would have given a more comfortable ride.  My 19"" wheels are a bit too stiff, with their low profile.  The 4.2 Ferrari V8 performs quite well, especially when you give it some revs.  Keep in mind, this is a street car, not a track car and you will be very satisfied.  One of the best things I discovered, after owning it for three years, is that, so far, it has been extremely reliable.  In fact the only problem that I had was the driver's window-regulator had to be replaced.  I chose the 2008 model over newer ones because I thought it best represented the true Maserati sedan styling, such as the classic grille, headlights and tail lights.

106, on 11/04/16 11:20 AM (PDT),ARG ,2007 Maserati Quattroporte Sedan Sport GT Automatic 4dr Sedan (4.2L 8cyl 6A),Six figures on my QP's odometer," First off, one needs to realize that owning one of these cars isn't going to be like owning any of its German competitors. Parts and service costs are higher, wait times are longer for parts and consumables like brakes and tires will go at double the rate they would on an S-Class or 7er. That said, the fifth gen QP (in Automatica spec) has proven itself in the field of reliability. My own car, an '07 Sport GT Automatica, has a shade over 100K on the clock at the time of this review and everything works as it should and the car still feels well screwed together. Yes, the quality of some of the interior trim is not quite as good as the Germans, however the hide on the seats holds up very well and the seats are supremely comfortable on long hauls. My only wish would be that they would raise up a bit higher to allow better legroom and a little bit more thigh support would be nice. Otherwise, no complaints about comfort at all. The suspension system does have a tendency to eat bushings rather quickly and they're expensive to replace and handling can become a bit ""wet noodle-like"" over certain imperfect roads but I put that down to my car needing new Skyhook strut assemblies. Maintenance is very straightforward; a major service every two years which covers all fluids and filters and both belts and otherwise just keep up with oil changes every 5K miles. The only major engine issue you may face is replacement of the intake cam timing variators which, if done out of warranty, is a $9K job at the Maz dealer. My car had them done at 54K miles and once they're done, they're done for good as the new parts are re-designed. Otherwise, the ZF six speed is bulletproof as are the electronics with the exception of a few niggles here and there but those can just as easily happen to any German car too. So in summary, if you've always wanted one, do yourself a favor and get one! They're tremendous value now that depreciation has taken its toll and as long as you have either a competent (and fair) dealer or a good Italian car indie nearby, you'll have no problem using this car every day. Just be prepared for frequent replacement of the rear tires and brakes. Remember, go into Italian car ownership with expectations set! It might be more maintenance but as they say, nothing beautiful is easy to keep!Update as of 5/7/17: still going strong, front end bushes have all been replaced along with anti roll bar bushes and also had front skyhook strut assemblies overhauled with new bushes, spring pads and upper mounts. Front end now tight as a drum and I figure on seeing this car through to 200K miles barring any major failures, of which I expect none.UPDATE: 117K Miles as of November 2017 still going strong with no failures and four big trips this year. 200K here we come!UPDATE: 124K Miles as of May 2018. No issues whatsoever save for one oil leak fixed at the recent oil change (o-ring on the oil level sending unit in the oil pan and also valve cover gaskets replaced). Still love the car, still as reliable as anyone could ask, still beautiful!",5

It just draws you in...," OK, I'm going to try to do this quick. If you are considering one of these cars, You wont be disappointed. I sold my 2002 911 cab and my 2004 BMW 7 Series and moved to this 2007 QP Exec GT and 07 Escalade. This Maserati is so cool. The engine with 400 hp and lots of torque, the sound of the exhaust (it gets louder on Sport Mode) the handling, interesting interior and the exterior styling are like no other in its class. The engine block in these cars was shared with the Ferrari F360 and F430 however the tuning and resulting HP output is higher in the final Ferrari versions. These QP's  are not mechanical nightmares at all. I have had nime for 4 years (from 2011 through present/2016) and have had no problems. Maintenance prices at the Ferrari/Maserati dealer are more than at Cadillac dealer but that is one of the trade off for driving a hand built Italian semi-exotic. The way this car drives above 50 MPH is hard to describe, All I can say is that it feels better than my modern day 911 did at speeds over 80, it seems to beg you to give it more gas. I know this really sounds weird, I find myself taking care of this car likes a living pet or something, I like it that much. If you are ""car"" person, these 2005 - 2008 pre-face lift (minor changes to bumpers and lights) are a steel right now! The list price on mine was $128,000. You can find good, reliable versions these cars now for between $30k and $45k. The ""duo-select"" same tranny as the Ferrari 360 paddle shift with clutch, but has an automatic mode is less sought after and expect to replace the clutch for about $4k every 35,000 miles. Conversely, the fully automatic transmission was released in 2007 models and it is flawless.  It is made in Germany by the same supplier that makes the Mercedes and BMW transmissions. Its one of the smartest  things Maserati ever did. These cars will sell for more and hold there value better than a duo select. If you aren't limited in your budget, then also consider Quottroporte 4.7 Liter ""S"" model. That engine is very powerful and am told it makes the driving experience even that much better. I believe the ""S"" engine option was available starting in 2011 I hope this information has helped any of you that are considering buying a used Quottroporte.",5

It looks like nothing on the road and people will constantly stare and give appeasing gestures.  It drives like a dream.  It corners absolutely ridiculouslt for a 5,000 lb. + four door sedan.  In fact I think it handles better than my Dad's heavily modded Porsche C4.  After driving this car I just don't think its possible to go back to the mass produced German and British cars.

With the engine tucked low and behind the front axle, and the tranny on the rear axel, this 4200 lb luxury sedan handles like an F-16.  Its big sticky Bridgestone runflats keep it glued to the road, encouraging you to accelate through ridiculously tight turns.  The faster you go, the more stable the ride gets!

The 4.7 engine + the 6 speed ZF tranny is as good as it gets, and the paddle shifters are very user friendly in sport mode. The quality of the materials is top notch inside, the leather is way more durable than the Jaguars and BMW's we have had, the Mercedes E and S Class are almost as good. The navigation sucks as does the Bluetooth. I did not buy the car for these items, if they are very important to you, this car is not for you. The maintenance is not bad except you are forced to buy the parts (air filter, oil filter, light replacements, etc...) from the dealer. You can't buy Maserati parts at retail outlets like Autozone or O'Reilly's for  instance. The bushings are another hidden issue that creep up on you, because the car weighs 4389 lbs,  if you run the car hard you will be replacing them and other suspension parts in less than 30,000 miles. I bought mine with 12K miles 2 years ago and will hit 29K miles this weekend. Will put front brakes on at 30K. Have Michellin Pilot Super Sport tires and hope to get 15K to 17K miles off them.

From 40 mph to 120 mph+, the car is really quick in normal mode. I bought my 2011 in July 2016 with 12k miles and have put 9k trouble free miles, I choose to change the oil every 6k miles and use a German synthetic called Liqimali, my exotic repair specialist recommends it, better than American synthetics.

We have driven over 6k miles now and the quality is much better than expected (no rattles and everything feels solid; Feels German, looks Italian, great combo!).  There are only 2 complaints: 1) The 21"" wheels come only in summer tires (there are winter tires available, but why not great all weather tires, like my 911 has?), and the traction is terrible when temperatures are below 40.  You really have to deal with the nonsense of winter tires, even in Atlanta (must be the global warming...).The 2nd and much bigger problem is the terrible support from the dealers.  We have 2 dealers here and they don't seem to be too interested in returning phone calls.  Even the Maserati Importer cannot get a hold of them.  Just go there, get in their face and they will tell you that the (simple) recall items will take 3 days to complete and they will give you a nicely equipped Mazda 6 as a loaner...  Their service is worse than that of a ""reasonably priced car"" dealer, absolutely unacceptable for a luxury car brand.  Maserati, please go see how Porsche, Mercedes, BMW and Audi do this.I have seen many complaints about borrowed parts (such as the Navigation system and window buttons, which come from Chrysler), but I couldn't care less.  It all works well and other car companies (VW - Audi, Chevy - Cadillac etc.) do the exact same thing, no biggie.Update: still loving car, Dealer support has been greatly improved. They now have Ghibli’s as loaners and response time is good.Maintenance, as is to be expected, expensive: New tires, every 10 to 12,000 miles, $2500, oil change every 12,000 miles, $500, new brake pads every 20,000 miles, $1700 (front and rear).",5

After my BMW phase (Z4, 7-series, X5) came my MBz phase (ML, CLS, E, S) and then my Porsche Phase (Panamera, 911, Cayenne, Macan) and then the Jag phase.  The 911 and Panamera are great cars but the 911 is not a touring car and has no real backseat or cargo room (just had to have one once) and the Panamera's overall styling, especially the side view, didn't hold my interest. The Jag F-Type V8 was very good overall and I enjoyed this car more than the others, especially the exhaust sound, power and overall styling.  However, with consideration to drive comfort, power, sound and overall styling, the Maserati GranTurismo is my favorite so far.  State of the art technology is not my primary reason for buying a car of this nature, as long as it has the basic requirements such as parking sensors, navigation, etc. and the Maserati G-T does, excepting a rear view camera and blind spot detection which I truly miss in this car.  The car feels much heavier than the others but provides a truly comfortable ride and it is a beautiful car.  In ICE mode, I recently got 25-26 mpg on a 100 mile highway trip which was a pleasant surprise.  Have not had the car long enough to assess maintenance or reliability (bought it used as second owner), but I am expecting huge eventual costs for tires, brakes, etc.",4
158, on 03/25/16 18:23 PM (PDT),Charlie Hawkins ,2014 Maserati GranTurismo Coupe Sport 2dr Coupe (4.7L 8cyl 6A),The best care we have ever owned!," We love this car more than anything we have owned yet and that includes the Porsche 911 Cabriolet, Range Rover HSE, Mercedes s550 and BMW 7 series. First of all, the thing is just drop dead gorgeous. We bought ours in White with the Pearl Beige leather interior with the black dash and accents. The car has plenty of horsepower (454 hp) and lots and lots of torque. The sound of this engine is like nothing else we have heard from other manufacturers. Throaty and sensual, loud but still classy.  You can keep the sound lower if you stay out of SPORT mode (which opens electronic baffles in the exhaust, adjusts suspension, for speed and cornering (adjusts shock and other components),  changes the electronic mapping for the ZF transmission shift points and advances ECU) mapping a kin to putting a ""chip"" in the ECU. pretty cool! Dou you know what I would have been willing to pay for that if it was an option? Lots of money. Luckily its standard. The cars handling is great, its heavier than the 911 but much more predictable on the edge because the engine is in the front.This Maserati allows us to take our kids (middle school and high school) with us at any time because there is plenty of room in the back seats. Small to medium sized adults are fine too. The front seats automatically (+ electronically) slide forward to create a comfortable in/out process for a two door, four passenger car. The trunk is not optimal for a Costco run, that's what a bigger car or truck is for anyway. In my opinion, this car is a sports car with eye-popping good looks that provides the luxury ride when needed and its a back road eating exotic when desired. We loaned it to our friend for a couple of days and when she brought it back, she said ""the only way I can describe this car is that its like great sex! , I have to buy one"".Btw, we have not had a single problem with the car in the 2 years we owned it. Its been to the dealer once for a scheduled maintenance.",5

However, ENGINE light came up twice in the 13th month, 1st time it was cleared by computer but 2nd time, had to have it towed to dealer to fix a faulty valve. Then within last 3 weeks, I had both side mirror's glass piece separated from the base/frame with cord attached (driver side first then passenger side 3 days later). Dealer said same mirror glass problem only happened to some 2010 models, I guess I am the ""lucky""one to have both sides failed. They determined that the adhesive between glass piece and base was weak, new replacements had them glued together. Well, funny issue with this luxury car.",4

Even with the top down on the highway you can carry on a conversation without raising your voice.  It's a one of a kind vehicle that draws a lot of attention.  In sport mode, the Cambiocorsa gearshift works beautifully; it's a bit sluggish in normal mode.  Turn off the MSP and it definitely lays rubber down.  The seats are supportive and comfortable.

It's finniky, and the electro-hydraulic clutch takes some getting use to. You NEVER see them on the road, and they sound amazing.  The torque is unreal.

When a friend suggested I look at a Gransport or Gran Turismo, I drove them both and loved both of them. Easy to say, the Turbo is much faster but the Gransport is just much more satisfying. I chose the Gransport for a couple reasons; 1st, at $32k it's an incredible value 2nd, it's lighter and unless you buy the 4.7, the GT feels much slower.  The sound, the engine flexibility, the way it revs... it's just an awesome vehicle. You hear, usually from internet warriors who've no idea what they are talking about, that these are unreliable or poorly made but my experience has been the complete opposite.

The sound is definitely addictive and the handling is great.  I must add though that I installed aftermarket anti-roll bars as for track driving the suspension even in sport mode is more GT than Sport car biased (a little soft).

It has proven to be a totally reliable, strong performing GT which is much more fun and exciting to drive than anything German. It feels like a bargain Ferrari - which is exactly what it is. If you need four seats and a supercar you can use everyday, this is it. I own and have owned several BMWs, Ferraris and Maseratis, and the Gransport is one of the best balanced cars I've ever had.

All the cars are stunningly beautiful, ferocious driving machines, and comfortable GT cruisers.  The problems with transmission that were evident on the 3200 (pre GranSport) have been fully resolved to the point where Ferraris now use Maserati's Cambiocorsa F1 transmission.  The ride is smooth unless you utilize Sport mode, which also acts as a volume and power control for the exhaust system.  Responce is superb, shifting is fast, acceleration is amazing for a 4.2 liter v8.  Compare the GS to the v8s of other makers, and you will wonder why non-Italian builders bother trying!",5

In 'Normal' mode it drives refined, much smoother than expected.  In 'sport' mode it gets going in a hurry, with shifting up like a madman (I am not sure if the new automatic transmission is as fast) and the roar of a jet. It has no trouble handling BMW 6 Series Ms or most Mercedes Benz AMGs through the mountains.  While its 400 horsepower seems light compared to the V10s or massive V8s of MB those cars are also have several hundred pounds heavier than the Maser.

Its tires got around 10,000 miles.  I attended the Master Maserati Driving school, which used mostly Gransports.  I was amazed at how stable the car was on the Road Atlanta race course.  It was almost impossible to get into driving trouble. I saw the spy photos of the new Maserati Coupe for late 2007/2008 and thought the car was going too large and too much like a 2-door Quattroporte, despite the 470 (est) horsepower.

It's quick in the straights, brakes well, and quick in the curves, but it lacks the swiftness and agility of a track car like say, the Porsche GT3 or Lotus Elise. Although this is probably good, it's soft over bumps yet turns in sharply on the corners. F1 shifting is very fun, hitting 0-62 in 4.9 seconds an the needle swings to higher sppeds very quickly. The seats are comfy an hold you in while manuvering like a fighter jet and look, oh so nice. Hit the sport button an the sound of the exhaust becomes a beautiful symphony.

My neighbor has a New BMW M5 with the V10 505 HP engine, and although it is a bit quicker than the Gransport or my Quattroporte, it doesn't come close to the feel of driving an Italian piece of hand crafted artwork. Keep in mind my Maserati, even after two years, sees the mechanics only for routine service, whereas the M5...well, let's just say it is a very lonely automobile, constantly craving companionship at the dealer. The biggest bonus is the sound...nobody can duplicate the sound of a Ferrari engine (yes it is a Ferrari engine) purring...just waiting to pounce.

Owning a Coupe teaches you any number of advanced-level life lessons:  you have to pay to play; be careful what you wish for; and Italian cars really are as good and bad as people say they are.  It's a remarkably affordable exotic, considering its prestige value and premium drivetrain, but mine lived up to its Italian-ness.  During the thirteen months I owned it, it was in the shop every month or two, all but once for minor things.  And the funny thing was, I didn't really mind--until one day the car's bad points outweighed its good points and I decided to bail.  The only big repair was replacing the clutch, and I knew going in that they're good for about 20k miles on average.  You really need to know a good independent repair shop--having a dealer replace the clutch would have been three or four times as expensive.  Aside from that, the drivetrain is reliable and appears bulletproof.  It's the small bits that are always breaking in your hand or falling off.  Don't buy a Coupe just for its acceleration or handling:  it's fast (and makes great noises), but there's faster, and while the factory sorted out the handling by the end of the model run, they're too heavy to handle great.  It's a GT, and a striking one at that, with even more personality than the GranTurismo that replaced it in 2008.  Additional perk:  people will think you paid way more for it than you did.  Besides eating clutches, the Cambiocorsa automated manual has a few rough edges, but I loved it--it shifts with *authority*.  And by all means, do not--repeat, DO NOT--actually drive the car.  Put miles on it and its value plummets.  I bought mine with 12.5k, put 8k on it in one year, and took a beating when I disposed of it.  I guess the market expects these cars to be garage queens.  Maintenance costs, while frequent, aren't terribly expensive when done by an independent shop, but judging by how impressed the local Maserati dealership was by all my repair receipts, I get the feeling many owners just live with the broken bits and pieces.  Finally, be aware that the market for these cars is extremely thin.  That's why you get an apparent (but largely illusory) discount on these cars when you buy, and why you give a very real discount when you sell.",4

In Tennessee on the curvy mountain roads the Shyhook suspension kept the car flat and predictable.  It is much easier to drive at high speeds in the curves than my wife's Corvette.
