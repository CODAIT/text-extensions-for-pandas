0, on 11/19/17 04:58 AM (PST),Colleen ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV 4WD,Crossing My Fingers," So, I just bought my first used car.  It's a 1999 Jeep Cherokee.  I've read Kelley's Blue Book, and the price was right on target.  It has 179,000 miles on it.  Jeep owners tell me it will still go on and on.  I've also read most of these reviews, and they all seem very positive. .The man who sold it told me it just needs a muffler; it is a bit loud.  Other than that, it rode well.  One owner.  It's my first Jeep, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.  I'll be very happy if I can get at least a year out of it and, hopefully, not spend too much money on it for repairs.  But time will tell.",4
1, on 11/10/15 09:46 AM (PST),Dunn ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV,awesome vehicle," We bought this 99 cherokee inline 6 back in 2004 with 70,000 miles.  Over the years the biggest repair that was needed was the rear main seal replacement at 280,000 miles.  Other than that it has been the usual replacement of parts that will eventually wear out with time. The engine has never been stripped down to do an overhaul or replace anything, besides spark plugs and the like.  Now at 305,000 miles the engine still sounds the same from when we bought it. The mpg reads 15 but i tested this and found that it is getting 21 in the city. Awesome. Oil change every 3000 miles and other regular maintenance and I believe this engine will go to 400,000 without an overhaul.  People complain about the ride being crappy which is correct, but then you don't buy a jeep for comfort.  This vehicle is a true utility truck. And it actually handles quite well in the city.  Jeep designed a great truck with the cherokee and plan on keeping this going for as long as I can. Eventually will restore this back to factory look and feel.",5
2, on 10/04/15 23:35 PM (PDT),Tony ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV SE 2dr SUV,Great vehicle if you can turn a wrench," I bought my Jeep kind of knowing it'd be an experience. After a year of owning it I've replaced a lot of components, but I also bought a high mileage Jeep. If you're looking into buying one it's a good purchase. It is my favorite vehicle I've owned despite being less reliable than other cars I've owned.",4
3, on 09/05/15 19:59 PM (PDT),JEREMIAH ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,IT'S A BEAST UNSTOPPABLE TANK," I bought my jeep, 171 thousand miles on it, no oil leaks or anything interior is great small areas the ceiling liner sags, but solid engine, you start it out just a get up and go, take it off road and it's agile it's quick, I take mine out to the river bed and it just goes, I mean the power and handling is perfect, I've been in lifted chevy's and toyota 4runners my STOCK jeep practically out performs them all,My only problem is which but my jeeps fault, but for where and how I drive needs a lift in the front especially but other than that it's GREAT",5
4, on 08/21/15 18:47 PM (PDT),LuckyL1111 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV,Longest Relationship To Date," I bought my 1999 Jeep Cherokee, 2WD, 6 cyl, automatic, 4-door from my employer in 2003. It was about to roll over to 100,000 miles, and they wanted to get rid of it. I paid $2500.00 broken into 4 payments. I continued to use it for work travel which was sometimes brutal temps and environments. Whenever I got my per-diem pay for using my Jeep, I would take her into Pep Boys, NLR, AR and give her whatever she needed. In 2015, she rolled over the 200,000 mark. The last 10 years I have cut way back on driving, and have not had the money to put into her care and maintenance, but she has always been true and faithful. The repairs have been few, and the cost of owning her has been a dream. I am recently at the point where I could buy a new car, but instead; I am going to have her completely restored. As I have had many mechanics tell me over the years, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Maybe I am too emotionally attached, but this Jeep has been everything I needed.",5
5, on 07/03/15 15:49 PM (PDT),scooterluv1 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV,Love my Jeep!," Needed an inexpensive SUV (wanted it to American built), so I bought this Cherokee in late 2013 w/16500 miles on her. I've added 50000 miles since I've owned it. She gets lots of looks/positive comments and at least once every couple of months someone asks to buy it. Overall, it's a great SUV.  ",4
6, on 08/29/14 21:39 PM (PDT),laneoc97 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV,Definitely Won't be in The Market for Another Jeep," This car was a hand me down from my aunt. She and my uncle take very good care of their cars, so don't give me the whole ""you must not have taken care of it"" thing. This car has been nothing but problems. Endless electrical problems is the first issue. In less than a year that I've had this car, the automatic door locks, cruise control, trunk light, horn, airbag, and the windows have all stopped working. I've had several mechanic friends check all of the fuses and everything and they are all completely fine. I haven't taken it in yet cause I can't afford the huge costs. On top of all of that it has completely broken down twice AGAIN in just a year of having it. All in all just a huge pain. ",2.25
7, on 04/15/14 17:19 PM (PDT),pkelly502 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD,An old work horse," Let me just start off by saying I love my JEEP! And there is no denying it this baby is a Jeep. Some people think the only real Jeeps are Wranglers but that's not the case, this bad boy even stock has the capability to do some pretty amazing things off road. The best part about this jeep is that while being able to take it for a fun weekend camping or 4x4ing is nice and easy its also a great car to drive on the road,in the city or on the highway. I have a 99 cherokee sport in automatic (not listed on this site if im not mistaken) and she has over 230,000 miles with nearly no major repairs aside from a starter and a new ac pump. And of course some body damage fixes but that' my fault not hers",4.875
8, on 01/18/13 18:15 PM (PST),buttered ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Amazing car," I bought this car from my uncle at 127,000 miles. This thing is a beast. iv driven it to 182,000 miles and iv only had 2 problems. i had to replace the water pump and the rear O2 sensor. both cheap to buy and relatively easy to repair you self. i have never had a starting problem, well when its -30 out side in the morning she doesn't want to start, but she always starts. and people who complain about the drivetrain i have never had a problem, probably because i changed both rear and front differential fluid along with the transfer case fluid at about 160,000 miles, AND, i regular grease the drive shafts. All of theses are very easy to do and can significantly increase the live of a jeep.",4.125
9, on 11/28/12 10:18 AM (PST),rickd9 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV,HORRIBLE vehicle: DO NOT BUY," This is the worst vehicle on the planet.Constant ""Death Wobble"" issues.Poorly designed.Aggravating Crank Position Sensor issues arise throughout the year (engine will not get spark causing no-start issues).",1
10, on 09/26/12 20:40 PM (PDT),colorado14r ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 2dr SUV 4WD,1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 3DR," After buying my 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport 3DR new, I proceeded to log over 168k miles in it until 2012. No power windows, roof rack or fancy bells or whistles. I just sold it last month. Most of my milage was city/hwy driving. I averaged 17/22 MPG. Not too bad with an air conditioner. The off roading in the snow was as impressive as a Jeep commercial can leagaly put on the TV. My service record shows normal maintenance. I needed to replace the clutch at around 90K and the air conditioner was replaced at 120k. The only real problem was a clutch sensor that kept burnig out 15A fuses in the fuse box. The sensor was replaced and it ran well ever since. I liked it so much I purchsed another Jeep.",4.375
11, on 07/19/12 22:28 PM (PDT),yz250r ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV,NEVER," I AM NOT SATISFIDE! This jeep was good for about 4 months mialige 118,000 to curently 123,000 miles. Resently I`v had some major scairs. The engine on and off shakes the car. I can tell because normaly it would be a smoother feeling. At about 20 to 40 mph the car will leack forwars vilontly and will not produce power for 10 to 25 seconds.DO NOT GET THIS CAR!!!!!!!!!!!!",2.5
12, on 02/24/11 10:02 AM (PST),carguy03 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV 4WD,1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport," I had a 1999 Jeep Cherokee Sport. This Jeep had the 4.0L I-6 with a 4 speed automatic transmission. It was a very good vehicle for the West Virginia winters, my driveway is just over 2,000 ft up a hill, and it never failed to make it all the way to the top. I liked the vehicle, but it didn't have enough room. I would reccomend it to any of my friends.",3.625
13, on 01/22/11 20:24 PM (PST),tlrthnu ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,This thing is a tank," This thing is a tank. Parents bought it new in '99, never had a major problem with it. The engine is rock solid. 190K miles on it and going strong as when it was new. Never had any leaks or any problems at all. Have replaced some parts outside of wear parts (rear springs, U-joints, front stabilizer shock), but this thing is tougher than nails. With new shocks and rear springs, rides better than my sports car. Even ran into a tree two years ago, had it fixed, and you could never tell anything ever happened to it. We expect to keep this Jeep at least another 100K miles. We live off three miles of rough dirt road and it takes the punishment and asks for more. Best vehicle we've ever owned.",4.875
14, on 10/13/10 00:00 AM (PDT),Austin ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV,"Undervalued, in my opinion."," First car. Had it for six years until it was rear ended. Literally drove it from coast to coast with no problems. Smooth response at lower speeds with just enough torque on the highway to get you around a semi in a hurry. Handling was great around town. Good turning radius. Bumpy ride. Passengers don't enjoy it much. Backseat kinda cramped. But from the driver's seat it's not a problem. Front shocks went out along with water pump and compressor after a few years. Other than that, the engine never gave me any problems, even with my terrible upkeep. Engine was abused with stop and go driving in 100 degree heat with few oil changes the whole time I drove it. Held up great.",4.25
15, on 07/08/10 20:00 PM (PDT),josh.w ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV 4WD,"Over 200,000 and still the best"," I got this great suv in march of 2010 for my first vehicle. I love the style and ride with the 4.0 L 6 cylinder. It's easy to drive and great for a new driver. Mine has over 200,000 miles and still sounds great. I wish jeep still made these because they are the best.",4.5
16, on 03/08/10 07:38 AM (PST),Joe ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV 4WD,A great friend," I am retiring my 99 Jeep Cherokee Classic.  I love this vehicle!!  It still looks great after two wrecks and a 150,000 miles.  I plan on having a little work done on it and then putting it in storage until my son turns 18 (18 years from now).  It will be a hell of a gift for him - this is truly a classic vehicle and, in a way, I wish Jeep would bring the XJ style back but in another way I love the fact that I have one and they are not as easy to get anymore.",4

18, on 09/06/09 09:35 AM (PDT),Rabbit ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Really Crappy Wiring," After 10 years, nearly every wire in the Jeep is cracking and beginning to fail. Intermittent failures in the window operators, instruments, radio. Cruise control, horn and airbag are all out of commission.  Car has never been crashed or bumped and has had only light 4wd use, but body panels are coming loose, trim strips and bumpers are falling off.  Transmission is noisy. Death wobble is getting steadily worse even after new tires, shocks, dampener and alignment.  The Jeep is the newest of my three cars and the only one that I seriously want to get rid of. VERY Disappointed.",3.75
19, on 06/28/09 22:52 PM (PDT),skaboss ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Impressive quality/reliability," No major problems.  Can't believe that it has lasted like this.  We take good care of it, and it looks almost new. Almost no rust - surprising for WI. Strong engine/tranny.  Interior shows almost no wear.  All repairs have been maintenance issues - nothing major. Easy to work on.  Would highly recommend.",4.75
20, on 06/17/09 17:15 PM (PDT),Genevieve ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Love this car," I bought my jeep as a college sophomore back in 2005.  Purchased in New York where I'm from, and attending school in Savannah, GA, I knew I was in for some serious mileage.  I did my research and found a great Cherokee.  That car has been up and down the east coast at least 10 times, been in rough road in the swamps of the deep south, and it never died.  There were a few minor electrical problems, along with no CD player, however it was perfect.  I just sold it (and miss it so much!) due to another long trip across the country, but will probably buy a jeep again.  ",3.875
21, on 06/09/09 11:31 AM (PDT),bostonman1212 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Great Little SUV, 1999 Cherokee Sport with 4.0L I6. My 2nd Cherokee (had a 1990 5 spd) and I love both of them (family's had 4 Cherokees and they have all been great trucks). Tough little SUV that does everything you want it to. Never complains when I hit those huge New England pot holes and you can drive it in any weather you want. Taken it out in white-out snow storms in a foot of powder and it does excellent. Never crossed my mind that I'd get stuck in any condition. Not the most comfy/efficient car but its a tough little SUV that rides stiff and never complains. Great for someone looking for a tough reliable truck that will take you anywhere and won't complain about a little tough drivin,4
22, on 05/30/09 15:23 PM (PDT),Ian A. Neether ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,"Go Anywhere, Do Anything!"," I absolutely love these vehicles. They are so reliable. I can go back to my favorite fishing spot, put the seats down and load up the back with equipment, go camping in the back, drive inns are a blast, go anywhere my wrangler owning buds go, get better gas mileage that full size trucks, all power, all electric, tow my boat jet ski four Wheeler or car trailer. This is the most awesome vehicle ever made. My 4dr 4x4 sport has 246,000 miles and still going strong. I will repair it when it needs it and never part with it.",4.75

25, on 03/24/09 10:55 AM (PDT),keljo1976 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Die hard Jeep fan," Absolutely love my Jeep, I bought it from the construction co that I work for when it was 3 years old & the lease was up.  Had 60K miles on it then.  Has 185,000 now, March 09.  rarely had problems with it.  It's been all over the beaches of NC & VA & thru the snow in PA.  handled well in every situation.  Other than changing belts when they get worn, and changing the oil faithfully, I don't normally put any money in it.  I have had to replace a window motor & brakes once, but that's really about it.  My daughter will be 16 in a year & I plan on handing this reliable car down to her.  & she can't wait!!  I wish there was another Jeep I liked as much as this one that I could replace it with.",4.75
26, on 03/02/09 16:19 PM (PST),chelsie ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,ok," My parents bought my 99 Cherokee sport in 2000, drove it for about 5 years, and then handed it down to me. It now has 140,0000 miles on it. I have no complaints about how it runs, never had any problems with that. However, the ac has stopped working, the front speakers blew out, the rear windshield wiper doesn't work, and the handle that pops that hood was so sticky, that mechanics changing the oil completely pulled it off and now the hood won't latch and I have to put a ratchet strap around it to keep it down. It gets me from place to place, but that's about it. ",3.75
27, on 02/16/09 15:15 PM (PST),medic 812 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Love my  Jeep," I bought my black Cherokee Sport 4x4 off the showroom floor. It had a whole 9 miles on it. It currently has almost 130k on it. It has only been in the shop once, for a loose torque converter. It has always gotten 19 MPG with good gas. The engine set up makes preventative maintenance easy. Even the transmission pan has a drain plug. The I-6 is essentially a tractor motor. You can't kill a tractor and you can't kill a Jeep. Maybe they should have provided a PTO, that would've been handy. I still can't believe they quit making these great vehicles. I'll run mine until the wheels fall off.",4.125
28, on 02/06/09 15:15 PM (PST),Cherokee Limited ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD,What a truck!," This is the third Jeep I have owned aside from the old '86 Grand Wagoneer and the '93 Jeep Cherokee. Reliability has improved over the years, I bought the '99 Cherokee Limited with 72k. I have enjoyed driving this Jeep and probably will never own any other make of suv. There is not one bad word I can say about the Jeep Cherokee!",5
29, on 02/05/09 16:04 PM (PST),zayla4 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV 4WD,Ride or Die Vehicle," I absolutely could not live without my Cherokee. I've had it for 11 years. Bought it with 13,000 miles on it. It's been in four accidents (1 while parked), extensive road trips throughout upstate NY during my sorority days, and survived NYC potholes. Within the past two years, I've had to change the brake pads, thermometer, radiator, steering box, battery and have multiple electrical problems resulting in shortages in the front and rear lights. Overall, she has lasted me well as hard as I drive, and I'm looking for another vehicle as equally reliable.",4.75
30, on 01/05/09 08:52 AM (PST),Tyson ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Love My Jeep," I bought this car car new. It has been reliable. 187000 miles now. Never had an issue with the transmission. Awesome offroad, and snow performance - never been stuck in mud or snow.  Part time 4x4 is great. 17 mpg average. Got 21 mpg once on highway trip. Replaced normal things- alternator, belt, brakes, tires. Stuck with regular maintenance. Replaced several window motors, and has had several electrical glitches.Recently had head gasket replaced (approx. $800) due to oil leak - first leak I've had.  Now evaporator coil is cracked ($1300 repair, or no AC). It may be getting close to time to replace, but I really don't want to get rid of it. With new tires, it's impossible to surpass off road",4.25
31, on 11/24/08 08:11 AM (PST),SL ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV SE 2dr SUV,There's no replacement for Cherokee," Bought this very basic 4x4 last summer with 125k on the clock, and just grow more enthusiastic every day. Its not a luxury car, but is very tractable on-road and there is NO vehicle still in production in 2008 that can come anywhere close to matching it for balancing on-road manners and sheer offroad capability. Its also built like a tank and is unbelievably reliable. Important stuff just does not fail on this car. Fuel econ. is quite good in commuting. They're so common that they're almost forgotten- but just look around you in traffic some day and start counting, and note how many still look great. Then remember there hasn't been a new one built for 7 years. Take THAT, Toyota.",4.375
32, on 10/14/08 21:05 PM (PDT),Steve ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Great 4x4," I bought this new in 99 and now have 116,000 mi on it and have not had anything go wrong, love the 4x4 goes anywhere and through anything, 3' snow drifts, no problem!  ",4.375

U-joints failed. rides rough. Gas mileage is the worst of any car I've ever owned. This thing sucks gas big time!,1.875
34, on 06/02/08 11:23 AM (PDT),MissBailey ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD,Jeep Trifecta," Bought this new in 99 and we love it.   This was to replace my car and after test drives of others kept coming back to the Cherokee, we had bought a used 90 Cherokee in 91 that my husband used for work. When we decided to replace the 90 my husband went looking for another and we now have a 2000 Sport Cherokee. These are all going strong and shouldn't need to replace for years.  The 99 gets the most mileage now as I have to travel for my job but at 130K it should last until retirement. The 90 still gets lots of use at the beach, when the kids need there cars fixed, still going strong. Bring them back Jeep, there is nothing quite like this SUV. ",4.75
35, on 05/17/08 20:10 PM (PDT),Jeep-it ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,My First Car," I bought my red, 5-speed Jeep Cherokee in Sept. 2006 and still have it to this date. I bought it with 85k miles on it and it now has a little more than 100k miles on it. In that time, the only problems I've had are glitchy power windows and a cracked evaporator. I was slightly weary about buying a gas guzzling SUV for my first car but after driving it for a while, I've found that it does real well. It gets about 19/20 city, but I find that keeping it just below 65 on the highway will get me 30 mpg for highway trips (and that's with a fully loaded college vehicle!). This has been and will remain a fun, reliable, and efficient first vehicle. I plan to hold onto this for a long time.",4.75
36, on 04/22/08 20:25 PM (PDT),Tim ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,99 Sport, Always wanted a Cherokee since the early '90s.  Bought new in '99.  Goes just about anywhere you want.  Only problem was with the front windows. Both driver and passenger motor brackets broke within a year of each other and caused the window to drop to the bottom of the door. I pull a 2000 lb camper all over the Tennessee hills at 80 with no problems.  Easy to work on or modify with uncountable parts available for greater off road performance.  Limited only by your imagination. It is truly a shame that Jeep stopped making the Cherokee.  Nothing else can compare.  ,4.75

I have always loved jeeps.  The boxiness is great.  The L6 pulls my trailer and 2 atv's with no problems (sportsman 500,600).  The fuel is decent for something like this.  The auto trans is bullet proof.  They should never have stopped building these.  My only complaint is the power windows.  The sport is the most expensive to replace as it is a dealer only item.  ",4.5
38, on 04/08/08 23:30 PM (PDT),tom ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV SE 4dr SUV 4WD,Great off road vehicle," I use the vehicle in extreme off road hunting situations. Only modification is a 3 inch lift and 6 additional lights. It goes anywhere. I am a professional guide & retired law man, & I go where a goat should not. The only thing I would like is better fuel mileage on the highway. It has the 4 ltr./auto trans. Great vehicle, for what it was made for. Have tried many others, including imports. They cannot stay close in the off road situations. Requires more than normal maintenance, but that is the price you pay ",3.875
39, on 04/01/08 23:39 PM (PDT),Rescue515 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,3rd Jeep I've had and the best so far.," I bought my Jeep when it only had 3 miles on it. I saw the truck driver when he was backing it off the delivery truck. It was Chili Pepper Red with Grey inside. I bought the extended warranty for 7 years or 100,000 miles. (DID NOT USE IT) The only problem that I have had is that the alternator went out at about 75,000 miles. I change the oil every 3500 mi and have a regular maintenance schedule. This Jeep looks as good as it drives. ",4.875
40, on 03/08/08 07:10 AM (PST),Jarmbru ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Bring it back!," Bought this with 50K after riding through very rough terrain in a friend's Cherokee that had 250K.  I'm now at 140K. I meet people all the time who tell me they are the best vehicle ever, and who have very high mileage. I use it on very, very bad ""roads"" in the hills of backwoods East Tennessee and also to commute and to haul electronic equipment. This Jeep does it all. It's true it's not a pretty soccer mom's car, so what, that's not what I want. Oh please bring it back!  By the way, people around here love them and keep them forever.",4.875

I had it for five years, put 90k miles on it and  only did routine maintence.  This was an awesome vehicle and I hated to get rid of it.  The only down spots were hard plastic interior.

I bought it with 75k, and since then i've put 23K on it since. I've had to replace the orginal brakes on it (i'd suggest the ceramic brake pads), tires, and shocks, but that's been it. I also put a 2"" lift kit on it, because stock 4x4 vehicles tower over it. Now it's about the height of a stock 4-runner. The best thing is that it's never stranded me, it's been the best car I've owned and I've owned and sold a lot cars. ",4.375

It got me to and from college countless times, three moves, and even an annual 1,000 mile round trip vacation.  This car has never broken down and I have never needed roadside assistance in the 8 years I have owned it. However, AC finked out at 90,000 and many minor repairs were also made, adding up quite a bit.  But I can't complain, this car is the epitome of reliable- snow storms, white outs, blinding rain? No problem, always has got me through! The design has no bells and whistles, mine doesn't even have cruise control, but thats's what makes this car fun!  It's a truck and meant to be simple.",4.625

The V6 is capable and the 4 wheel drive is awesome. The truck got me through any type of condition with no problems. Overall reliability was great. The only items that I replaced (outside of normal maintenance items like brakes and tires) were a steering linkage piece and a power window part. Other than that, the vehicle was free of problems. If they still made them I would buy another. Since they don't I bought the new Patriot which is the most similar thing Jeep now makes.",3.75

I get good fuel economy with the 5-speed manual, and the 4wd works well in the snow.  Never breaks, but when it does it's inexpensive to repair and easy to do-it-yourself.

My Cherokee is a lemon! I purchased the extended warranty which would cover it fully until 2009 or 100k. I have had to bring it in to be serviced 6 times and only 2 were covered under warranty! Thankfully the REALLY expensive fixes were covered under warranty: driveshaft and transfer case cracking which would have set me back thousands of dollars.

To be able to travel the roads during any weather conditions.  Except for icy conditions, nothing has stopped the Jeep. 2.  Towing:  I tow my 4000 pound boat/trailer without concern and do not worry about being able to get the boat back out of the water.  The Jeep brings the rig right up the steep, nasty public launch that I use.  The only problem here is that the weight of the boat tries to drag the Jeep down the ramp, even with brakes locked. 3.  Durability:  My family has owned numerous Jeeps and they have always served us well (except an early 1980's 2.8L Cherokee). This Jeep is the best I have owned so far, even with putting  15K/year on it.",3.75

It takes me wherever I need to go.  The engine is very powerful, I can spin the tires whenever I want.  I've wanted a Jeep since I could remember and I don't plan on ever selling it.

It had 166k on it when I bought it, and its now nearing 175k. Only things I've done to it is put a bigger set of tires on it and a serpentine belt.  After totaling a new TrailBlazer last February and getting into the Jeep, it is quite a bit smaller, but gets far better gas mileage.  Handling is way better then the TrailBlazer also.  I guess I lucked out when I found my black Cherokee. It has the 4.0L with the 5 speed, and it downright HAULS with the manual.  It's no nonsense exterior design makes this Jeep awesome in the woods.  VERY easy to maintain. Sure it's loud, not very comfortable, and somewhat small ... but hey it's a Jeep and that's what a Jeep is.",4

Cherokees were a low cost SUV that were passed by the modern minivan/""SUV"" that are being sold now.  It was one of the last real SUVs. SUVs were not nice to ride - they were utility vehicles.  That being said, my Cherokee does exactly what I need it to do. It rides nice, decent mileage, and can carry a few people.  Jeeps are easy and cheap to maintain. Use aftermarket replacement parts (there are A LOT of them out there) and you'll be happy with the Cherokee for quite some time.  If you want a cushy, roomy, nice riding car: buy a minivan. If you want an SUV: buy a Jeep (except the Liberty).",5

This is no different. Tires, shocks, battery, brakes, etc. are normal. Electronics should be a bit more resilient. The air conditioning coolant has a leak. Of the 3 Chrysler vehicles I have owned, this seems to be their plan to encourage us to sell the vehicle; the system always fails around 90,000 miles and the transmission fails around 100,000-120,000. Planned obsolescence? Other makes seem to be more robust for this, but I digress. Other that that, a nice vehicle, fun to drive as an SUV.",3.5

I bought it with 55,000 miles on it, and it has 59,000 at the moment. I would suggest getting a high performance air filter and an inexpensive lift kit. I put a 2"" lift on mine and it really makes a difference, not only on the outside, but the ride quality is much better. I would definitely recommend this car, especially because of the cost of gas these days. I get about 18 miles per gallon, and where I live, I pay about $40 to fill it up. Also, the 4.0L 6 cylinder engine has a lot of power, especially when you add the air filter. When i bought it, it had about 190hp, now it's cranking out about 205hp.",4.125

My Jeep Cherokee is no different. I have 69,500 miles and will pickup my vehicle and its repair tab of about $1000 tomorrow. No repairs were due to negligence -- they were due to normal wear and tear (power steering, power window and front end). My last American vehicle was from the 1980's and my next probably won't be until the 2080's! Additionally, electrical features stink. I've have repetitive problems with a speaker wire crimping in the driver's side door and a repetitive yet intermittent problem with passenger side power window.",1.875
59, on 08/16/05 13:08 PM (PDT),0wn ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Unstoppable," I bought my Cherokee from a salvage yard after it was hit on the front left wheel, ran into a pole or stoplight, and then flipped on its side.  After that much abuse, I didn't expect it to start, much less be drivable.  But amazingly, all it took was a new battery to get the Jeep started.  I had a mechanic shop replace most of the steering system (the impact to the wheel bent a few parts), and then I replaced the panels that were damaged. It's quite amazing that I could pull the Jeep's exterior apart using simple hand tools and I was even able to salvage some the bent pieces.  After repairing it, I never had any trouble. The engine will start in zero temperature and never causes problems.",4.875
60, on 08/08/05 10:03 AM (PDT),jeepsport99 ,1999 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD,Not that great.....," For a Jeep I expected more.  This vehicle has been nothing but problems. Shocks every 30 thousand miles, $1500 for upper and lower ball joints, both front bearings/hubs replaced, passenger rear leaf spring replaced, both O2 sensors replaced, clunky drive line. Now at 107,000 miles, water pump may be going.  I think the most annoying thing to me is how the rear end sags because the leaf springs wear by design.  Luckily I had a extended warranty up to 75,000 miles otherwise I would have been really upset.  One thing that is good is that during the summer months I can get 20 mpg from the 190 hp inline six.  This is a poor product and Chrysler Jeep should be ashamed. ",2

Even more fun than a BMW 320I (had one of those -- that's another story).  I have had this vehicle for 6 years; bought it new, never had a problem.  The only time it was in the shop was when I hit a deer and wanted to get the grill fixed.  Gas mileage is great for an SUV. I constantly go 320 miles or more on a tank.  If it's a road trip I've gotten as much as 450 miles a tank.  Not too bad!  Love the Cherokee, I wish they would not have discontinued it, the Liberty is too cutesy, not my style.

I originally bought the Cherokee for $2,500 in Arizona. Beforehand, I knew nothing about jeeps, much less offloading. The Cherokee originally had 97,000 miles with perfect condition interior. No dents on the sides, no mechanical issues. The Cherokee has powered windows and mirrors, as well as 4WD. With the SE edition, I did not have the regular gauges that other vehicles have. Even without these gauges, I have had no problems. The only major issue with my Cherokee, is the fact that the wheather strips seem to not work. Water constintly enters the vehicle from the top and side of the doors. Other than the weather strips failing, the jeep is a very reliable vehicle. I would recommend to any first-time offroaders, or those first time snow travelers. It does amazing!",4

140, on 02/26/18 08:58 AM (PST),Vance Jochim ,1997 Jeep Cherokee SUV SE 4dr SUV,Great engine and transmission but rest sucks," I bought my 1997 Jeep Laredo 4 Dr Cherokee used in 2010 for $3400 with a busted odometer showing about 75,000 miles.  Now it is Feb. 2018 and the odometer shows over 100k (it is underrecording mileage, but does work).  I am retired and am the only driver, and drive it mainly 3-5 times a week for local meetings, with the longest trip being perhaps 60 miles.  It still has the original shocks, 6-cylinder engine and automatic trans.  The engine and trans still run well, but everything else goes to hell and it is only 20 years old and not abused. I had to have the starter replaced and it cost over $500.  Compare that to my 1965 Mustang where many more parts still work vs this Jeep.  The speakers go in and out - not sure if they are stock. The headliner has fallen out, so I had to pull it all out after trying to glue it back up.  The 4WD didn't shift right in 4WD after I got it, so I have been afraid to use it since then.  This Jeep didn't have a tow bar, so I installed one and was surprised it cost over $400.   Then Jeep had a recall due to gas tank safety, and the fix was to install factory tow hitches, but I already had one.  The dark green paint clear coat has ""crizzled"" so it is flat (it does sit outside).  The rear two door electric windows failed soon after I got it, and it cost me $400 to fix that.  The mechanic said Jeep cheaped out on the switches so they always fail.  The horn has failed, and apparently it is because the switch is in the steering wheel airbag, and you have to replace the costly air bag to just ensure the horn works.  The dome lights go in and out.  The return spring and bushing in the driver door hinge has fallen apart, so the door squeeks each time it is opened. It is on a welded fixture, so can't easily be replaced.  The left rear door window just fell out of the track and down into the door.  I finally had to just wedge it to stay up and had to disable that switch I had put in earlier.  The driver seat material has failed and ripped.  I hit a truck with a trailer hitch at about 5 mph and the entire front plastic bumper fell off.  Had to re-attach it with screws.  The bumper ""black"" finish has gone ugly flat.  Apparently, like the paint, it wasn't designed to last past 15 years.   I recently had to tow the vehicle becuase a fuse blew, and found there was absolutely NO tow hook or place under the front of the vehicle. So I hooked the chain to a steering bar for a short 8 block tow and bent the rod, costing $600 to fix.  So, I will continue driving this until the engine or trans fail then junk it.  I will never buy a Jeep again because their quality control and longevity of many lesser parts and electrical systems suck.  They are great to drive in the heavy Florida rains, but not that great to put up with bad quality in a lot of small things.  Before buying a Jeep or any other vehicle, be sure to check for Federal government recalls to know what they are.",2

Overall, it does great. Headlights are great, steering is great. Most of my driving is highway so I get around 26 mpg. What isn't so great is the electronics. Within a month of having it, the screen would randomly turn off by itself. Couldn't replicate the issue with the dealer. Stopped once the weather warmed up, did it a couple more times once winter hit again. I really dislike the automatic stop when you're idling. I've gotten into the habit of turning it off as soon as I start up, but I had several close calls because of it. The vehicle is so quiet, if you have music or passengers you don't always notice it's turned off. Until you go to pull into moving traffic and it does a weird idle jerking motion as it tries to start back up and you have to slam on the brakes to keep from getting plowed into. Fun. Can't turn the radio off so you have to mute it every time you get into the car. And it does NOT do well in snow. If you're on a straight, snowy road it does ok. If you have a steep, slushy driveway it does not. I've gotten snowed in twice this winter. The 4 wheel drive doesn't engage until your tires are already spinning and you can't engage it yourself. Good pavement princess, I'd say. Not so good at the ""sport"" part. And sitting in it for more than 30 minutes or so hurts my butt and back. Can't adjust the head rest so if my hair is up too high, I end up looking down at an uncomfortable angle.",4

197, on 11/27/17 12:25 PM (PST),DM Burnett ,2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Stay Away!," Since purchasing the vehicle in September 2016, it was seen in the service department in October 2016 for a loud click from the brake (told this is normal) and the vehicle shutting off during idle twice. An update was done but the issue continued. November 2016, I brought the vehicle in because the back seat would move back and forth if someone was not sitting in it (they had to replace the whole back seat) but as I was driving into the service doors the vehicle skipped and tried to die with lights flashing on the dash. Service could not duplicate. December 2016 brought in because the vehicle kept skipping when trying to take off from a stop. On two occasions it completely stalled but service was unable to duplicate. The vehicle also had issues with shifting too early at times and then shifting was delayed other times. Once again issue could not be duplicated. Later in December I brought it back again and was told there was a fix. January 2017 the vehicle was brought back again due to stalling and the multiair actuator was replaced. The issue continued as the service manager searched for an answer until I had enough in October 2017 when it came to a stop for no reason and the vehicle would make a terrible noise in reverse at times. Service along with FCA attempted to fix it but could not duplicate the issue. When I received the vehicle back it now skips in idle, makes a lawn mower sound in idle and when shutting off make a whining noise. I have stopped driving the vehicle and am trying to get FCA to do the right thing via Georgia's Lemon Law. I have done my due diligence following FCAs required steps and they said they cannot duplicate my issue but would give me a good faith payment for my time. I have asked to talk to supervisors etc. but am told that is not their protocol. This vehicle is unsafe and should not be allowed on the road!  I have video of the issues and one of the service agents commented on it having delayed shifting but FCA closed my case and said it is fixed, regardless of the fact you cannot fix an issue that cannot be duplicated. I sent my Lemon Law paperwork over 1 week ago certified mail and now USPS want to send it back because FCA hasn’t come to pick it up. I will not drive my children around in the vehicle and I will never buy another Chrysler product. I love my dealership but FCA has no business making cars.",1

199, on 10/31/17 09:05 AM (PDT),Donza3D ,2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),"Well, let me say this about that ..."," Finally had to retire my 17 year old (207k miles) much loved Ford Explorer. Picked a new  Jeep Cherokee with a 6-cyl upgrade mostly due to the fact that the new Explorers are butt-ugly and another $10k in price. I really like the look of the Cherokee over the other comparable SUVs and the price is the most reasonable considering purchase as well as future repairs. Plus a Jeep is well, a Jeep! I needed a reliable, well-rated 6-cyl, 4wd SUV with the ability to tow a 2-horse trailer locally, and I knew a Jeep would fit the bill. Sooo ... the good news - it's cute and sporty and really comfy to ride in, the technology is useful as well as fun and it rides like a car - pretty quiet. Haven't had occasion to tow anything yet but not expecting to find any problems there. The gas mileage is great - have been getting 20-21mpg just short trip driving around town so mechanically I'm pretty happy with it. But then the cons - basically the car seems to have been designed for a 6'+ man. I'm 5'5"" but can't see the end of the hood while I'm driving which is a bit uncomfortable - it would really be nice to know where it is, especially to keep from running into the car in front of me when parking at the local Walmart. The visibility trying to see out the back is REALLY awful for a SUV. The headrests are too tall (and uncomfortable) for a woman and block your sight when you try to turn your head to see out to back up, while the passenger seat headrest blocks a large expanse of the right side windows that the wide posts aren't already blocking. Backing up is a REALLY scary trick because there are so many blind spots you just have to pray you're not getting ready to run into or over anything (guess that's why they want you to pay extra for a back camera - no thank you). Headlights are pretty small and wimpy too and no fog lights. The back of the car is designed smaller than the front so that makes it seem even more closed in coupled with the poor window visibility. All that combined with the minimal cargo space with the back seats up REALLY makes me miss my Explorer!  And there's no automatic on/off headlights?!! What's up with that????? Again - 17 year old Explorer had on/off headlights?? What idiot thought that was a great way to save money?? This is almost the thing I dislike the most (other than the multiple blind spots) and it might have been a deal breaker if I'd realized it before I bought it. The drivers seat is too low even on the highest setting and if you don't have long legs you are practically against the steering wheel to drive (even at 5'5""). Explorer had moveable steering wheel which helped with this.  It's also a little tight and awkward trying to get out of driver's seat (probably due to having to be so close up to reach the pedals). Do I have buyer's remorse - yeah maybe a little. Maybe I should have done more homework as I just decided I wanted a Jeep and bought it.  But then again maybe all the new cars are like this one. I do have confidence in the Jeep product and don't have any doubt I bought a good solid car that will serve me well. Would I buy it again - just not so confident about that,  will have to take a closer look at a new Explorer.",4

It is a Latitude with the V6 , 9 speed auto and all wheel drive-select one. I recently drove from Minnesota to Phoenix, a distance of 1800 miles and was pleasantly surprised at my gas mileage. My highway speeds were generally between 60-80 mph. On I90 in South Dakota my mileage dropped from 30 to 24.9 due to stiff crosswinds. When I turned south, the crosswinds became tailwinds and the mileage went back up to 30 as I arrived at Ogallala, Nebraska. It stayed relatively steady thru Colorado Springs and all the way to Gallup, New Mexico. As I approached Flagstaff, it had dropped to 28, but then the ride down the mountain to Phoenix bumped it back up to 31.4. The seats are comfortable, and the vehicle was quiet, except for varying tire noise on different pavement. The nav system worked well, although since it was just installed, the updates should have been more recent. They weren't.  I maintained speeds at or near the legal limit. Overall, I would give this suv a 4. I also carried a full load of cargo. On combined trips, 80/20, highway/city, the mileage was between 25 and 28.",4

Polk ,2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV Overland 4dr SUV 4WD (3.2L 6cyl 9A),Impressive features and handling," After test driving a 2017 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 4x4 with a 3.2L V6 9-speed automatic last month, I purchased one this past week to celebrate my 50th birthday. After buying my new Jeep I promptly drove it home from a dealer 250 miles away, and left on a 600 mile round trip vacation with my family.  I was thrilled to get 30 mpg when most of my driving was freeway at 70-75 mph, and happy with the 25 or so in town.  This was better than the 4-cylinder 2014 Toyota RAV4 AWD I recently sold, and the Jeep is much more comfortable! I chose the Jeep because I could get a tow package capable of towing 4500 pounds with the V6 engine, and still get an amazingly luxurious smaller SUV for a great price. I actually paid $10,300 under MSRP for a Latitude with the Comfort and Convenience (power liftgate), Cold Weather Package (heated seats and steering wheel), Comfort and Audio (power seat with lumbar adjustment and a 9 speaker audio system with a subwoofer), tonneau cargo cover,  the V6 3.2L engine upgrade, and the tow package. I didn't want leather (the True North Edition has it) and found it was very tough to find a Latitude with both the tow and the power liftgate, so when I found one I was very interested.  The dealer discount, factory incentives, Chrysler financing incentive and a USAA bonus incentive gave me a great deal and I'm very happy with my first-ever new vehicle and Jeep product!   It's comfortable to drive, handles well, has a quiet cabin, lots of cubbies to store things (my favorite is hidden under the passenger seat), feels luxurious inside and out, and yet still has lots of off-road 'truck' capabilities at the right price.  I've owned SUVs by GMC and Toyota, but this Made in the USA (mine was made in Illinois) vehicle is much more impressive in terms of performance and style.  I look forward to putting my roof rack and rear cargo basket on it and seeing where the roads (paved and dirt) take me!",4
207, on 07/14/17 15:26 PM (PDT),Steve ,2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV Overland 4dr SUV 4WD (3.2L 6cyl 9A),Fast not so Quiet Cherokee Limited V6," I had a 2015 Mazda CX5 that I liked, but the road noise was out of control. I am an outside salesman so I go through cars very quickly as you can see. The CX5 had all the bells and whistles, but I didn't like some of them so I'm glad I had more options with the Cherokee. The first thing I noticed when I looked at the car is the design is fantastic. It looks like a Grand Cherokee, but more compact.  It is just the right size for me. When I opened the door the huge display screen was a sight to be seen. It has many more options than the CX 5 did on the display, which is a nice addition. Now lets get into the driving. It is a little quieter compared to the other compact SUV. If you want the same quality of sound and drive you will easily be spending over 45K with other similar models. It is fast with the V6 and honestly, who wants a 4 when you can get over 100 more horsepower for almost the same price and identical gas mileage? Here are the cons: It doesn't handle as well with corners as the CX5, the engine is loaded when you gun it (I actually like that about it but some might not), cargo space is a little smaller. I wanted a quieter ride but I'm no where near satisfied yet. I'll keep it for 4 years than see where Jeep is at.",4
208, on 06/14/17 09:47 AM (PDT),Jerry Boettcher ,2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Wife's Dream Vehicle," If you want a quiet easy to drive SUV this is the one.  We have had this Jeep for  three months.  We use it for shorter trips of 60 miles or less.  We get up to 40 mpg on the 6 cyl engine.  The transmission is smooth shifting.  This was a concern on earlier models, but since the 2016 this has not been an issue.  We had the front struts replaced under warranty because they were noisy.  Now they are fine.  We enjoy the sure-footed handling and the many features like adaptive cruise control, parking sensors and rear vision camera, rain sensitive wipers,  radio that uses usb thumb drives, and SD cards for music.   We enjoy all of the features that are on this limited model.  We use our 2014 Town & Country Touring L for longer trips because it has more room and a longer wheelbase and do not need a quick turning sporty handling vehicle.",5

Our last car was a Chevy Tahoe 4wd and it was a good car and still in great condition for a 2004.  I take very good care of my cars that is why they last so long.  This one so far is very comfortable for my wife and myself.  It is quiet and although it has a lot of fancy goodies; I love it and am getting used to using the back up camera which if fabulous, and for 75 a great addition for my safety and anyone or anything that goes behind me.  I am getting very good gas milage 25 plus and expect to get the full 30+ as the engine gets broken in.  It has a lot of room for us and our dog and for with the seats folded down has a lot of room to haul garden stuff and wood from the store. Our dog already knows how to get from the back seats to the front so she can find the most comfortable place to ride.  The 4 cyl engine is ok, but we thought the 6 cyl was better and the milage and power are are much better(esp. when using 4wd) The Tahoe was an 8 cyl and the 6 cyl latitude is just as peppy and the milage is so much better. If you need a great car(and by the way my wife picked out this car) get a 2017 Latitude; you will love it just as much as we do.",5

The Cherokee rides very nice, handles well and is very sure footed.  The leather seats of our North edition Cherokee are very comfortable and it has a very roomy interior.  I am pleasantly surprised with the power level of the 4 cylinder engine, don't get me wrong it will not win any races, but the 4 cylinder engine in combination with the 9 speed automatic transmission does a good job.  The transmission does a good job matching the correct gear with acceleration and road speeds, while keeping the engine speeds low when possible and appropriate to save gas.  I was reluctant to buy the 4 cylinder version at 1st, but since I was not too crazy about the idea the start stop feature of the 6 cylinder engine, I keep my cars a long time, the car I traded, in, that I bought new was 23 years old and the idea of the engine shutting off on every stop and restarting when accelerating again was asking for trouble down the line.  So I decided to go with the 4 cylinder engine, that does NOT have the start stop feature on the Cherokee, I am glad we went with the 4 cylinder engine.  My wife has wanted a Jeep Cherokee for years and I am glad we finally were able to buy a brand new Jeep Cherokee.  I am also glad that Jeep builds the Jeep Cherokee in Ohio with a high U.S parts content. Thank you Chrysler for making such a great small SUV, we could not be happier with our 2017 Jeep Cherokee, North Edition 4 X4.Update regarding our 2017 Jeep Cherokee after owning our Cherokee for 10 months now is that we still are very happy with our Cherokee and have not had any issues with it at all. We love our Cherokee!",5
211, on 05/25/17 10:18 AM (PDT),Tim ,2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),6 cyl Latatude," Having done some research prior to making this purchase, I didn't waste my time even looking at the 4 cylinder model.  The 3.2 6 cylinder does a very nice job with excellent acceleration and a very smooth feel.  It is a bit hesitant to down shift in response to increased throttle; if you want the sportier feel you can set the 4 wheel drive to ""sport"" mode and the transmission response feels much quicker.  The sport mode does cause a hit to fuel economy so there is a trade off.  I've been getting right around 25 mpg for mostly highway (probably 70/30) driving in the standard setting which I feel is quite reasonable.   As I'm older (65) the ability to easily get in and out of the car was important to me and as one would expect with an SUV, it is quite comfortable to enter.  The seats are comfortable as well and the power adjustment along with adjustable steering column provides for very comfortable seating.  That being said, leather would have been a nice option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Of the other vehicles I looked at the Chevy Equinox came closest.  The Jeep won out with a more substantial feel, was better equipped for the price, and the jeep dealer was much more willing to discount the price; the discount for the Jeep was about $4500 while the Chevy dealer seemed to hit a hard stop at about $2300.                                  I'm sure there are other small SUVs that might be better choices depending on the buyers requirements, but given my need for towing capability as well as basic transportation, the Jeep really seemed the right choice and after 2 months I've found no reason to believe otherwise.   As things are right now, I'd make the same buying decision and would recommend the Cherokee to family or friends.Up date at 8 months and 6000 miles.The gas mileage has settled in to about 23 mpg as I've stopped trying to keep it up and become a bit more heavy footed.  Still very happy with the car.  It has been completely trouble free to this point (as would be expected for a new car in this day and age).  I've had reason to use the heated seats and, unlike other cars I've owned, the heated seat can be set to two levels and the lower is quite comfortable with the high setting being a bit on the overkill side.  The heated steering wheel, while not dual level causes a temperature rise that is quite comfortable.  The performance continues to impress.",5

The 4 cylinder lacks bite, and will leave you disappointed. I have the 2.4 cylinder right now and am truly wishing I had the six as the four seriously is sluggish and unresponsive. Not sure what JEEP was thinking putting this engine in a Cherokee...I will say If acceleration isn't that important to you then the four will be fine for you. It does it's job, but for me not impressed ! I enjoy driving it as it's seats are comfortable and the ride is smooth for the most part. Have 10,000 miles on mine now and have no problems and changed the oil once. The 8.4 Connect is user friendly and easy to use, the auto climate dual climate control is nice and works well and maintains a comfortable cabin. Gas mileage is average for a SUV I guess, but not bad. I do love my JEPP and am not disappointed in it thus far. But, because of the engine I am trying to turn it in early as it is a lease to upgrade to a Trailhawk with the V-6 or get in a grand Cherokee if possible ! Stay away from the 4 cylinder if possible.....other then that I am not disappointed in the JEEP Cherokee, great SUV and is stylish, comfortable, and you will have a sense of pride driving your JEEP around !",4

I traded my BMW, so just to let you know the differences, the jeep overland 6 cyl, has much more technology, and the interior is much nicer than my BMW, as is the sunroof and front and backseat comfort.  The acceleration on the jeep and the road holding are not as good as BMW, but that would be as expected.  Overall, I am very happy with the jeep, and hope to keep it many years.  The only reason I was looking to trade is that I put about 24000 miles/year on my vehicle (so no lease) , and the BMW maintenance and repair cost after warranty is very expensive.

I just got married and my wife just found a job in the Seattle area so we needed a 2nd car.  After looking at used vehicles, we came across Jeep's President's Day sale and they were offering $5K rebates for downpayment plus discounting the sticker price for all basic Cherokee Sport models. So we were actually paying less than what we were looking at for used Cherokees.  I wasn't impressed with the acceleration but it is a 4 cyl. My wife liked the features and it was new! So we pulled the trigger. 500 miles into the car, we realized there was puddling water at driver and passenger sides.  It was storming so I asked if her door was shut.  It was.  We drove it back to our dealer who proceeded to hold onto it for over a week.  Not once did they contact us.  We had to initiate the discussion and they seemed upset that we were upset.  A response of ""that's why there's a warranty"" doesn't comfort a consumer when the cause was a body part that needed to be welded shut, seals in the door and windshield that needed to be replaced/resealed.  It simply shows shoddy workmanship and low grade parts quality.",1

We could not get a car in our price range to buy at all at the Buick dealer, we could not get a 6 cylinder in a Ford Escape unless we waited 6-8 weeks.  At the end we got the Jeep Cherokee because they had a 6 cylinder loaded with sun roof, and a lot of upgrades for less the 35,000.00.

224, on 02/06/17 19:36 PM (PST),Edgar ,2017 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),"Cherokee tops Honda CRV ..USA,USA, USA"," I just purchased a 2017 Cherokee Latitude a few weeks ago, and  continue to be impressed.  To put it in perspective, I also have a 2016 Honda CRV and can make a good comparison now.  I had shopped both cars and negotiated rock bottom deals on both.  The sticker price of the Jeep was $36K but with big rebates to be had the price of both cars ended up within $100 of each other, or $27.5K out the door going with their mid level trim; Latitude for the Jeep and EX for the CRV.  But compare what I got in terms of value:  Power: the 6 cylinder engine of the Jeep is is much more powerful and smooth than the 4 cylinder in the Honda..a 90 hp difference..advantage Jeep.  Convenience: The Jeep has Power tailgate, Much better/larger LCD Infotainment System, Remote Start, More Adjustable and comfortable power front seats Auto Mirror, integrated 911 system etc not on the CRV. The CRV came with heated seats and the blind spot camera, both nice things but not of the value of the Jeep.  Utility: The Jeep came with Roof Rails, Tow package (can tow 4500 lbs!), and full size spare.  Honda did not include roof rails at that price point or tow hitch, and can tow only 1500 lbs if so configured.  Advantage Jeep.  Design: The Jeep has a unique outdoorsey presence about it, with off color stitching.  The Honda is a good design, but more boring. The Jeep has a full panoramic sunroof, while the Honda just has a small standard one.   4WD: The Jeep has adjustable settings of the drive system, not to mention higher ground clearance and approach angles.  While not a Trailhawk, the Jeep Latitude wins vs the CRV re offroad capabilities.  Ride Quality: This is a big factor.:The Jeep is as smooth as can be; The Honda is great compared to other small SUV's and has an impressive CVT transmission but compared to the Jeep ride quality is not as good and does not feel as substantial.  Especially on long highway trips, the Jeep with the V6 is just a better place to be and feels like a luxury car.  In fairness the CRV scores some points with more cargo room, better mpg, and the blind spot camera.      So in terms of Value, the Jeep is the clear winner and would even be worth the sticker price.   In terms of reliability, I guess that is TBD, but the Jeep seems impressively solid and unstressed.  If that is a big concern, Jeep offers an  insane Lifetime/Unlimited Miles Warranty Upgrade  for $2-3K.     Being an import car buyer since 1982 ( my CRV was assembled in Canada), I am now changing my perception.  Honda and CRV are always rated at the top of pack, and there are some outdated perceptions out there that imports are somehow better.  Jeep Cherokee has one of the highest US contents of any vehicle.  It is great to support fellow hard working Americans who make a product that is world class.    USA, USA, USA!!",5

The jeeps frame may have been slightly damaged, but I was perfect without a scratch.  Only going 30mph the jeep actually pushed the front end of the suburban, aiming it into the other side of the road where it should have been in the first place.  Insurance gave me $500 more than my original jeep was worth, which had 130,000 miles on it.  I did not hesitate and found another cherokee with a 4.0L inline 6 engine, 4 doors, and 4 wheel drive.  When you step on the gas peddle you feel the power, it's nothing like the V-6 engines out today.  It may only get about 13 miles per gallon, but it's well worth it.  Mainly, if you're a car guy or someday want to be, this is the car for you.  Knowing simply how to use tools, I've fixed most issues myself, learning a lot about how cars work in the process.

227, on 03/12/16 16:28 PM (PST),MtnRoad ,1998 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4dr SUV,Just kept going and going," I owned the 1998 Jeep Cherokee 4.0L engine, 2WD, auto trans, base model no electric power options. It served it's purpose well. I could load a lot of stuff into this vehicle as the backseat would flip forward and down and made a lot of room in the back. The full size spare tire was side mounted inside the rear cargo area and it really didn't take much room so it was okay. The Jeep had nice acceleration with the 4.0L engine, and fuel economy was pretty good too. I drove mine with respect and it rarely gave me trouble. I put some moderate all terrain tires on it and the Cherokee performed great in winter while I spent time in Northern New York dealing with the lake effect snow that was pretty bad.  Now the bad......The check engine light would come on intermittently. This caused somewhat of a problem during my yearly smog test I had to have done in California. I got lucky a few times and it went off so I immediately would drive into the nearest place doing smog tests and would knock out my annual test. Soon thereafter it would come back on. When this first happened the dealer in Huntington Beach, CA told me it was a sensor in the transmission they had seen it many times and nothing was wrong with the transmission just the stupid sensor, and to just try and deal with it. They said the transmission on these Jeeps were the best they ever saw, but the sensor in my model was a stupid tiny little part that did nothing. Otherwise a repair was going to cost a lot to drop the transmission and replace the sensor located above it. So I just dealt with it. Another thing that happened, probably associated with that sensor was the electronic gauges would just fail.  All the warning lights on the gauge cluster would light up, then go off, and the odometer would stop clocking miles. I have to admit the non functioning odometer was awesome because the Jeep remained a low mileage vehicle for almost the entirety of my ownership. Sometimes it would work, and most times it did not. I attached an old school GPS with velcro to my steering column to see how fast I was going.  I parked the jeep for many years while I was overseas and upon returning the a/c failed, the power steering failed, all the attachments to the engine failed and would throw a belt if I drove too much. I felt guilty about trying to sell it to a private party but instead went into a Chrysler dealership one day after the check engine light went off and looked at a used vehicle (not a Chrysler product but a low mileage Japanese model) on their lot. They kept trying to bring my Jeep into the deal and wasted my time all damn day with nonsense offers for warranties, upgrades, etc and I held firm and got a great deal on the used truck they were selling. They kept asking over and over if I wanted to trade in my Jeep but I kept telling them no it was the best car I ever owned and wanted to keep it forever which was total bull but they bought it and made a great offer for a trade in on it and reduced the selling price on the other truck I was looking at. They never even once went out to look at my Cherokee or asked to drive it. Just gave me way more than it was work. In hindsight they probably drove it around back and poured sludge in the engine to destroy it under the Obama bailout to give dealers $4500 for clunkers. Kind of sad to see that Jeep go. If you can find a low mileage well cared for Cherokee XJ from that time period, buy it.",4

REALLY.  84K.  It's my 3d Cherokee.  Prior a 2000 and a 2001 Cherokee Limited.  I sold the 2000 to a friend when it had 160K.  He reports just this week that he's at 245K and still going!  The 2001 was much the same.  These cars are, by my way of thinking, absolutely bulletproof.Now.  1998 Cherokee Classic.  The only addition to the car is a set of 2000 Limited alloy 16"" wheels.  Other than that, just as it came from the factory.Within a week of this last purchase, the turn signals just stopped.  I bought a $15.00 flasher relay, and back to the road!  Of the three I have owned, this was the first electrical problem I have encountered.It handles like a Jeep.  Not the best, but predictable as the sunrise.  Never let me down.  Goes where it's pointed.  Never stuck, and NEVER left on the side of the road waiting for a tow.  When the A/C is charged, you can almost hang meat in the front seats!  The heater is capable of burning your feet.  The radio is really not bad (the 2000 had the good stereo with door mounted tweeters and and amp under the back seat...that was REALLY great).  I wish it had a CD, but I wish I were taller...neither of those things are going to happen, so the radio is fine.This is a SIMPLE car.  Point/coil ignition.  Climate control with cables.  They're adjustable.  Not like the vacuum operated controls.  Manual 4WD engagement.  Everything in the cabin is push-pull-click.  No push-pull-click?  Replace switch.  Repeat.  Read the gauges.  DO REGULAR MAINTENANCE!  Change the oil (You don't need a lift, or a jack).  Don't forget the auto trans, transfer case and the two differentials (I do them every 50,000 miles, but I'm obsessive).  Lube the suspension zirks.  How hard is THIS?I guess I rant.  But as long as I can get these, I'll keep buying them.  They're getting rare, but they're findable (I made that word up) with a little searching.The car looks good.  Anywhere.  Party in the high end part of town?  Fine.  Running down a dirt road producing billowing clouds of dirt?  Fine.  Axle-deep snow?  Smile.  You look good and you ain't stuck!  By the way, this is essentially a new car!The long and short of it is, this car is a throwback to a simpler time when things broke but could be fixed with a pretty sparse toolbox.  My dad the engineer said these cars operated with ""tractor technology"".Under the hood it's all simple.February, 2017 UPDATE15,000 miles later the usual stuff.  The A/C evaporator, dryer, and heater core were replaced. After 3 of these cars, I think I can surmise that it's  certain  these components fail after 15 years. Had transmission flushed, and both differentials and transfer case drained and refilled. Fog lamp and rear window washer/wiper switches replaced. So one year out I've spent a little over $1,000.00 on maintenance items. Total into this car is $10,500 and I expect at least 3-5 more years before I sell it for $7,000.00.February, 2018 Update:  Had to get a radio with CD player.  1 Factory Radio LLC in Virginia supplied a re-furbished original AM/FM/CD and gave me $ for the old radio.  Transaction took a week,  Bolted right in.  $200.00.  Leaky radiator.  As long as I replaced  that I replaced the water pump too.  I was already in the engine bay anyway.  This car is Emerald Green and looks new.  I actually get asked (more often than you might think) if I want to sell it!  Gas station, traffic light, Costco parking lot, by complete strangers!  I was offered $10,000.00 in the Costco lot after the guy gave the car the once-over.  I kept the car.104,000 miles now.  Still pulls like a train.  And looks great.  And I haven't had a car payment for over 2 years.Summer, 2018Ok.  I've replaced the a/c condenser, compressor, dryer, and the evaporator (the heater core as well)   I CAN hang meat in the front seat it's so cold.  The water pump and the thermostat and housing.  Belt as well.  Generally, if I'm in there, it's just easier to start replacing things rather than wait for a failure.  The rear springs are getting tired, so I'll replace them at the end of the summer.  Remember, I HAVE NO CAR PAYMENT.  My son and I are going to Arizona from Michigan in mid-August (I was raised in AZ,  so I can take it!)  And we're taking as much of Route 66 as we can.  I really can't wait to take the Hatch Cutoff (if it's still there) off 66 going south out of northern New Mexico  ( I took this short cut to  Tucson years ago and spent two hours at 105 mph and never saw a living soul).  Hatch has become somewhat famous for their chili.  Anyway, Tucson appeared pretty quickly.  Holding a 1976 Chevrolet Monte Carlo at 105 for two hours was a spiritual experience.  A carton of cigarettes and a thermos of Holiday Inn coffee were my constant companions.  So that's my plan.  I have no fear of taking a 20 year old car on this quest.  I'll fill you in on the road.",4

I keep it completely standard and I just love it! it has the tough SUV looks from the outside but once you get in, you have the leather, heated and powered seats, powered windows and locks, the wood trim dashboard and so on.

Since it doesn't always do it it is easy to continually make the mistake of thinking park=park then backing up a few inches before realizing it.  This 'feature' killed someone so they recalled and instead of fixing transmission (and admitting flaw) they added a feature where your car cannot back up with the door open.  So it still happens but can't kill you.  The 'capless' gas tank doesn't work at 75% of gas stations and I had to hold the black rubber pressure catch on gas nozzle to pump gas.  Nearly every time I got gas.  The performance of the vehicle is nice but these other items ruined the entire experience of driving every time I got behind the wheel.  Additionally the AC makes constant noise like there is an issue with the freon but was told ' just kind of happens' by the dealership.

I was actually mad at “her” for almost a year! My eyes were finally opened when we had our 1st snowfall in 2016 & I realized the benefit of 4WD. Then I realized how fantastic the fuel economy was compared to my Dodge Journey R/T. In addition my Jeep has been extremely dependable & I believe only had 1 or 2 recalls for very simple things. I would say my favorite thing about her is the 6 Cylinder 289 HP (I believe that’s accurate) she gets up & goes without any hesitation. I have a heavy foot so I like my car to have that ability, when needed, or just for fun! Overall I am sad that my lease is up & our time is over. If the buyout wasn’t ridiculous I would totally have bought her, just on a strict budget currently. This has been my family car for almost 4 years. It held up to having 3 kids, 2 who are messy, sloppy teenagers, & a Chiweenie who wants to go on every single car ride (and mostly does)! The cloth interior held its own, however that would also be my only negative comment. I hated the fabric used for cloth in this vehicle. Every single hair from my clothes or dog weave into the fabric. It’s damn near impossible to get it out! I keep about 4 lint rollers in the Jeep so I can keep interior clean but also to remove hair that transfered back to any dark clothing we wore. Also almost forgot, the UConnect has a mind of its own. Half the time it won’t connect, there doesn’t seem to be a particular trick to fix it either. Used to turn vehicle off & back on but it doesn’t help. I believe it’s based on if your phone connects to the UConnect App. But the stock radio sounds like garbage as I guess does any stock radio, but I’ve had days where even the radio wouldn’t come on wouldn’t do ANYTHING! Definetly needs more thought & effort on Chrystler’s behalf. Even in my Journey with the upgraded sound system that sounded amazing, the connection was almost rare. It works when it feels like it is the best I can say.",5

After nearly 3 weeks in a dealer for repair, it is ""fixed"".  Though I am concerned about this happening again and will not be buying out my lease.  Also, read the warranty carefully when you buy/lease a new vehicle as Chrysler does not include a rental for any warranty repair work!  I really lucked out that the dealership provided me with a loaner or I would have been without a car for 3 weeks!  And the support from Jeep/Chrysler is a joke.  They assigned a ""case worker"" to help with the warranty process and all she does is make phone calls on my behalf.",1

I was leaning towards a Charger or similar car and i drove a Jeep Cherokee Latitude and feel loved it. After doing a little research I saw that the Cherokee is a heavy vehicle and the V6 was a much better option. I ended up finding a 2015 Trailhawk model with the 3.2L V6 for a good price and I've been in love ever since. I wasn't sure about the 9 speed transmission 2015 being the first year but I must say I've had no performance issues at all. At 270+ HP it's got plenty of power and i pass people with no problem. It can be a little sluggish off the start while the 4x4 is in auto mode but not if you need a little extra boost put it in Sport Mode and your good to go. I've even taken the Trailhawk off road twice and I was blown away with the performance and ability of my new, ""used"" SUV. My only complaint is that I've had issues with the 8.5 inch Uconnect touch screen and have read that the issues with it are common but it's getting replaced free of charge. I've heard a ton of complaints about the limited power of the 2.4L 4cyl engine but as far as mine with the V6 so far I couldn't be happier.",4
314, on 09/14/17 20:59 PM (PDT),Joe ,2015 Jeep Cherokee SUV Altitude 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Needed a new engine at 23k miles," I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Altitude Edition. The Jeep had 4,500 miles on it when purchased and was owned by the dealership. The Jeep was only 6 months old when I purchased it. I purchased this vehicle for my wife for dependability and weather since we live in Pennsylvania where seasons vary. After one year I received a phone call that my wife was broken down on the turn pike and the car stalled out. We had it towed to the nearest repair shop. It simply ran out of oil. No leaks, no nothing. Just burned through it. I topped it off, and noticed it burned over 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Ended up taking it to the dealership and had an oil consumption test. I was not expecting them to tell me I needed a new engine, but that was exactly what they said. Engine had severe scorn marks. Took 4 weeks for the engine to be installed, provided a rental. It was covered under warranty. I got the Jeep back two days ago and it is back at the dealership because of a very loud humming noise coming from it as I drive it. After this is repaired we are strongly considering getting rid of the Jeep and trading it in and never purchasing a Cherokee with a 2.4 mopar engine ever again. Engine replaced at 24,800 miles. First sign of damage was around 19,700 miles. Took 3 weeks to schedule an oil consumption test. Only reason why I feel it deserves two stars instead of one is because of the hospitality I have received from the dealership.",2

Once was just because I was getting worried that the vehicle hadn't asked for maintenance in a long time! Hopefully I don't jinx myself by saying that. I've had no mechanical issues, although I do agree with those that say the transmission generally isn't great - it's just kind of a pig, and takes a little bit to get in gear. But this is an SUV, and that's pretty common to SUV's (this isn't my first Jeep, either). It's just not the most responsive vehicle ever made, though once it does engage, it's really quick with the 270hp V6. I did have mine built to order and maybe that made a difference (it wasn't an early build, and maybe they even take more care with BTO vehicles), but I just haven't had anything I needed to worry about since getting it in February of 2015. I also love the comfort and the interior, though I wish it would remember the auto start/stop setting. I don't want to disable it forever but I only use it in specific situations so I'd like it to default to off.One update: I had always meant to upgrade the tires, but was forced to after only 15,000 miles because two of them cracked. OEM tires usually aren't great on any car but the Cherokee Latitude's tires are even worse than most.",4

I purchased the car brand new in July 2015 and immediately experienced problems with a rattling/squeaking panorama sunroof and rusting of the paint on the hood of the brand new car. Repairs were made on both by a local Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge service station, where an employee informed me ""the sunroof rattled because all Jeep parts (with the exception of the Jeep Grand Cherokee ones) are made with the cheapest parts they can get, and that's why they rattle."" This should have been a warning flag because this conversation occurred only 5 weeks after ownership. Time went on and the rattling/squeaking sunroof came back, the speakers rattled a low volumes (again an indication of poorly manufactured parts) and I starting experiencing new problems where the check engine light would come on and spontaneously go off, and issues with the fuel gauge. The fuel gauge would only ever fill to 3/4 and would have huge swings while driving (one minute have 1/4 tank, the next 3/4). To fix said problems, the local service department would have the car for 6 days (of which I was given a loaner car). Chrysler parts headquarters is located only on the west coast and we were informed,  ""Chrysler rules do not allow for overnight shipping of each part"" thus, adding to the delay. To add to my frustration, on numerous occasions when I picked the car up, noticeable collateral damage from the repairs would occur, including a broken rearview mirror, a torn passenger leather seat cover and door trim, and other various dirt and scuff marks of which I would yet again have to return to the service station to have addressed. I am coming up on 36,000 miles, the end of the manufacturer's warranty, just under two years of ownership (yet another flaw that Chrysler puts so little faith in their cars). I was greatly encouraged by the local service department to purchase the $1,500 extended warranty because in their words ""the radio, which controls almost everything electronic in the car, will be the next to go (cost of $1,400 to fix)."" In summary, although I was attracted to the interior design and look of the car, it is built with poor-quality parts that rattle and break down, and I made over thirty trips (I counted all service records) to the local service station for repairs and collateral damage fixes in just under two years. Prospective buyers of this car, I recommend do not purchasing this car and consider a certified pre-owned higher quality car with a long-term warranty.",1

I have had one shifter issue, where all the lights came on and the dashboard said service shifter. i took it to an out of town dealer, because i travel, i received a rental car and it was fixed in two days.. i did not schedule, i just drove it in there. I bought this new in 2015 when they first came out, i had the very first one out of the dealership.  this first issue happened around 36K, it just happened again at 76K but it went away. so i have not taken it in.   everything runs fine, and i'm a mountain guy as well as i travel a lot.  i am not nice to this car, i hammer the gas and drive it consistently at 70 to 80.  i also take it off road to my property and to a mining claim where the jeep does great, no issues when flipping from 4w low to 2w high.  i bought it to put miles on and commute. i get around 32mpg on average.   the interior is great, comfortable, i love the seat heaters, but they could use seat coolers!!!  I will say that i have never towed with it, but i plan to tow one of my jeep trailers i built for the Rubicon.  its only about 300 lbs, so should be no issue.   also looking to tow a boat soon, which is around 3500 lbs, 1000 lbs below the limit they state the tranny can handle.   One thing i dislike and i would love to shoot, is the GPS and the navigation chick,   seriously stupid.  pretty much this i my biggest gripe with the SUV.  i need this in the city's when i travel, i dont do well with other people around in a small car. id much rather be driving my other Chrysler product an 02 dodge diesel 6 speed, and now people they just move out of my way with that... back to the Jeep.   i have 79K and change on this jeep and have had some great trips and zero issues. i have install a rocky mounts cargo rack, i carry all my camping gear, sluice box, hunting, misc on the roof, about 300 -500 lbs on average, still no issues.  i am 6'2 and 220, ive had four guys in it all my size, it does get sluggish with all of us. but it is what it is, i wont complain about that.  Although this is my experience, and i can only speak for myself.  One other item before i go, ive also wheeled it to the slabs and the back side of loon, this was a far as i was willing to take it, and not one issue!!  I hope this helps some of you out there.  one thing I've been looking for is upgrades, minor lift kits, and aftermarket accessories, not to many out there.  when this rig hits 200K she will get some Unimog axles and be turned into a wheeler.",5

323, on 04/10/17 14:51 PM (PDT),Matt W ,2015 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),KL is way underrated! Bad rep from bad drivers?," I was skeptical when I first purchased my Jeep Cherokee Sport (KL) two years ago. It was the second year (2015)  for this body style and the return of the Cherokee into the Jeep lineup. Many longtime Jeep enthusiasts dogged its crossover styling and the technology over its offroad capabilities. For those who want a serious offroading vehicle, the Trailhawk is going to be your best bet from the KL family. Cherokee hobbyists have now created a two inch lift (and some change) which allows for beefier tires and a more aggressive stance on the Trailhawk, while all other models can find something similar to give their Cherokee a bit more height and light offroading abilities. For the large majority of Cherokee owners, offroading is not on the agenda, so I'll stick with things that definitely stand out for me. I've owned 12 vehicles in the last 20 years, and that includes everything from Ford and Chevrolet to Honda and Toyota, Mercedes and BMW. I'd rate the Cherokee as a 4 star SUV in its class. The interior might not be the most impressive that I've come across, but you get an SD card reader (for audiophiles), bluetooth connectivity, USB ports, CD player and auxiliary input - 5 options for connecting your music! The aesthetics of the dashboard and front cabin are very welcoming and easy to reach everything. The cargo area is about the size you would expect from a Cherokee; anything bigger needed and you should look at the Grand Cherokee. The engine boasts about 184 hp and 170 ft-lbs of torque for the 4 cylinder (cannot comment on 6 cylinder power) and is very nimble in traffic. In the past two years of owning this vehicle, the servicing has been very minimal and light. This Cherokee does feature a lot of computer enhancements, so you will need software updates of your vehicle once every 9 months or so. If you've owned any other modern car from the 2010s, you will know this is not specific to Jeep or the Cherokee. I believe a lot of the bad reviews come from people who have had unfortunate luck, or they just have little patience. I probably would not have even written this review if owners had not rated it so low. Realistically I would give this vehicle a score closer to a 4 out of 5, but these Cherokees are really fun and I won't be getting rid of mine anytime soon. There is also a whole community of Cherokee KL owners who absolutely love their Jeeps (and modifying them!), so don't let a few sour reviews turn you away.",5

This car has been nothing but a heart and headache. It is absolutely terrible. Purchased car in the summer of '15 brand new (less than 35 miles) and just recently traded it in (with a little over 26k). If I could give this car negative stars I would. This is a death trap on wheels. While driving this car it literally completely shut off in the middle of the road. I was driving up a steep hill and around a bend. The engine completely shut off and the check engine light came on. I'm so very lucky to not have been hit. After getting car going again (which was a miracle itself) I made it back to my destination. I was 3.5 hours away from home. I attempted to drive it home to have it serviced. It made it less than 15 miles up the road before AGAIN having the engine completely shut off, in the middle of an intersection. $300 and tow to get it to a dealership anywhere close to home. It spent three days in the shop and one long commute to pick up my ""fixed"" car that wouldn't shift out of park. I've lost so much money on this having to trade it in. In just a year and a half it's worth almost HALF of what it was purchased for. I will never ever buy another jeep the rest of my god given days. This car is not worth a stick of gum.

Bought it used in 2000; excellent condition inside and out. Problems: Always present. Electonics, transmission, A/C, front and rear axle bearings .... you name it. Nonstop issues. Swore I'd never by a Jeep again, especially considering how little Mercedes Benz seemed to care about building up the brand after acquiring it circa 2000.                         Enter the 2006 Audi A4 2.0T Quattro. Flawless. No issues. Perfect. But, wanted an SUV again, and the Audi/MB/BMW versions are just too damn posh and elitist for me, esp. as I enter my lat 30s. Wanted something that says ""rugged"" and is rugged.                           Extremely impressed, after trying out  several SUV makes, just how much care FCA has put into the Jeep brand. Every bit as luxurious as the Audi, more advanced (about 10 years newer), best NAV/media interface I've ever used, unbelievable off-road abilities, my transmission has been flawless -- not one issue, although I know it's been a major general complaint. No reason for 9th gear, though.           So, ""old"" Jeeps = poor quality but complete awesomeness, nonetheless. Audi = my favorite upscale brand -- so precise, well-built and, as an added bonus, less ostentatious that it's rivals. New FCA Jeeps = Luxurious, rugged, sleek, precise and high quality. And the V6 with the Trailhawk's capabilities equals perfection in its class.

I only found out from the service department when I picked up the vehicle from one of numerous visits to the service department that they thought it drove ok for a 4 cylinder.  I was stunned.

I don't even know what else there is to say at this point.  My next call is to the General Manager and then to Chrysler.Update 1/4/2018- and the saga continues with this vehicle.  Chrysler replaced the transmission and when I picked the car up from the dealership I drove the car to a friend's house.  When we got back in the car and I put the car in drive and stepped on the gas, the car went in reverse.  We both looked at the shifter to see what gear it was in and sure enough it was in drive.  In addition to this issue, on 4 occasions while accelerating from a stopped position, the engine will stop pulling the vehicle.  The RPM reading 4-5K rpms and the car is drifting to a stop.  Chrysler says they cannot recreate the problem.  The car will engage after coming to a full stop and start accelerating again.  The owner of the dealership recommended that I trade the car in and take the loss because there are problems with all 2014 and 2015 models and as of the date of our conversation, they weren't having the same issues with the 2016 models.  The service manager put in writing that this was not a safe system.  When I asked him if he would let his wife drive the car, he said absolutely not.

My 2015 Jeep Cherokee has been in the shop 7 times since I bought it a year and half ago. 9-speed transmission has no idea whether it's coming or going. RPMs spike (3500-4000) when going down or up hill and does not lower till you're on the straightaway. By that point, you have minimal power and when the transmission figures out what gear to be in, it clutters/jolts and puts you in a lower gear then you can continue accelerating.     When approaching a STOP SIGN or you YIELD, you slow down and then accelerate and the transmission hesitates then shutters to get you going.

336, on 09/01/16 13:43 PM (PDT),Tommy C ,2015 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Absolute Lemon.," To start simply, this car had a rebuilt engine and transmission within the first 2,500 miles. I was warned in years past never to buy a new model's first year because the companies are usually working out kinks and i wish i listened. The engine started overheating really badly at about the 1,800-2,000 miles mark. I bring it in to the dealer and those inept mechanics told me it was a faulty spark plug or something and gave me the car back next day. Within three days i had to bring the car back and on this second trip they told me the engine got so hot it cracked the engine block! Three or four weeks later i get the rebuilt car back and within 10 days of that, the transmission was completely out of whack. I bring it back and about a week later they ""fixed"" it and returned it to me. I fought with chrysler corporate for months to get me out of this car that i didn't feel safe in but they only care about their bottom line and basically told me to sue them. I don't have the money for lawyers especially for a lease so i'm left counting the days till i can dump this trash. I know one coworker who had similar problems to me but because he financed his he went the whole 9 yards got a lawyer and the car was deemed a lemon and he got his money back. I CANNOT ADVISE STRONGLY ENOUGH AGAINST THIS CAR OR ANY CHRYSLER PRODUCE AFTER THE NIGHTMARE I WENT THROUGH. You've been warned!",1

LATTIDE 2 JEEP CHRE.," From the first week I complained about the transmission as to how it jerks the whole car while changing gears. This is a 9 speed transmission and believe me the  Jerking is so bad  that it will give somebody a whiplash. It does not behave like a new car.  I took it  to the dealership and was told that it has a very intelligent computer and once it (the computer) figures out my driving habits it will smooth out. I now have 16,000 miles on it and it is getting worse.    I purchased a life time warranty for that reason,  I don't know what that is worth. One thing I have to admit it is great in the sand and snow. It is dangerous in the rain.  While on All Wheel Drive, do not accelerate around  curves as you will find yourself in the next lane over.

After owning a 1998 Cherokee that gave me ZERO issues and a half million miles (literally) I decided to try another twenty years later. I'm not stupid, I realize nothing will produce what the old fashioned straight six would in terms of dependability and torque, but it's a new era and it's all about mpg and style.  I test drove the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and of course this rolling hemroid before burning my cashier's check away on the Trail Hawk. Ranting about how terrible everything from acceleration to zero torque, to the plastic interior and cramped quarters won't do it any justice. Please just realize that your better off buying a Honda fit and spray painting a 4*4 Badge on it. Their about the same except maybe the fit has more testosterone. I just cannot get over how Daimler murdered this brand name. The other two ""jeeps"" I test drove had mini van V6 engines in them and also needed a strong wind from the back and a downhill to get up and move. If your thinking of buying a ""jeep"" after 2003 model year then do what I should have done and burn your money outside the dealership and know it's better than driving out of the lot in your new Fiat with an awd option called jeep. I paid cash for mine and plan on donating it to heritage for the blind or cars for kids in order to regain at least some of my dignity.  Rest in peace Jeep.",1

After two months, violent shifting of transmission and trembling of the engine became severe. I went to the Jeep repair shop several times to fix this problem. They always said that this transmission is the worst one ever and there was nothing they could do except S/W update from Jeep. But officially they said that there was no problem with this car. Even when my car stalled on the crossroad two times on the way to children's school, they repeated the same word. It was very risky situation to my family.

The transmission sometimes slips during shifting, or it stays in a higher gear for much longer than it should when coasting downhill. This issue was a simple fix when I took it to the dealership and explained the problem. Everything about this Jeep is perfect for me. The price was right and the vehicle is very smooth on the road. If you've ever owned a previous body style Cherokee, then you may be more partial to that look, but 2014 and later models look better to me. It's more aerodynamically designed, and that's reflected in the fuel efficiency of 24 city (up to 26) and 31 highway (up to 35).",5

I went to visit my family 4 hrs away for Memorial day 2 1/2 weeks later and the transmission light came on half way into the trip- less than 1500 miles on the car! I had to park my brand new car for a holiday weekend until a dealership opened up on Tues. They reset the light- said it was nothing. It came back on during  my ride home. I drove directly to the dealer. They had the car from May 27th-June 9th and replaced the transmission. I hadn't even made a payment yet. June 12th the light is back on!!! 2174 miles on the car. I only had it back 3 days..back to the dealer I go. Now they have the car from June 12-July 2nd and they tell me they have replaced the valve body. July 7th on my way to work and the light goes back on as well as the parking brake light and the 4x4 light. I smell something burning. The dealer has to come and tow the car away. Now I am calling Chrysler asking for a repurchase- I don’t want this car! They don’t call me back for three weeks. July 22nd I get the car back after a 2nd replaced transmission. July 28th back to the dealer again! This time a 3rd transmission is placed in the car and I get it back Sept 4th. The car at this point has 2664 miles on it. I filed a lemon law suit with FCA Chrysler on July 17th 2015. I am still fighting this claim. I have been driving the car since Sept but the transmission is not right. It screams down hills and does not shift. It screams up hills and shifts so hard the whole car jerks. The dealer tells me there is nothing wrong with this transmission. It does not shift well- this is not normal. Chrysler is not responding to the lawyers on this claim and they are trying to make me settle with a deduction for the miles I have put on the car. I cannot believe that Chrysler is handling this so poorly. I will never but another Chrysler/Jeep product again nor will I recommend them. The car stinks- the company stinks!11/25/16 update*** it took me until last week to have he lemon law competed. The transmission still slips and still screens going up or down a hill.

As I  write this and make a car payment my Latitude is with the dealer having its engine replaced. It has been there since last Wednesday and they are not sure if I will have it back by next week. The dealer's service department has been great. Chrysler's response has been disappointing. I am concerned about this vehicle and have wavering confidence about a safe resolution to my issue. The only way I knew there was an issue was when the car simply stopped working while I was driving. Thankfully, I was not on a major roadway and was able to safely restart and get to the dealership. While a recall may not be in order, I would suggest that Chrysler, at the very least, have each of these vehicles inspected for the defect as I know I am not the only one experiencing this issue.

Don't like a car that leaps out from under you or hesitates. I think eventually this can cause a serious accident. It's embarrassing to be at an intersection at a stop light and the light turns and you cant go and people are honking. Not ideal situation at all. Causes road rage to some people.,5

My Great Dane fits in the cargo area just fine. I love all of the features the Cherokee offers, heated steering wheel & seats, Uconnect and sound system are great. You can go just about anywhere you want with the low range transfer case and rear locker. The select drive which has auto, snow, sport, rock, and sands/mud settings are a nice feature to have.

363, on 03/01/16 10:10 AM (PST),Courtney Smith ,2015 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),FCA Drops The Ball;," Purchased a 2015 3.2L V6 Jeep Cherokee with the Auto stop feature on 04 Nov 2015 with 95 original miles on it. Within the first 150 miles of ownership the vehicle was taken back for a terrible back up camera and the odd shifting patterns with forward lunging in first to second gear. The dealership I purchased the Jeep from kept a full day to tell me theirs was nothing wrong with the camera and didn't even talk about the shifting patterns. So I assumed they tested and repaired. Nope was wrong to think that at all. Took jeep back again  at around 265 mile to again bring up the issue with the horrible hesitation and shifting problems. Service rep explained the vehicle needed to learn my driving habits and to break-in. So read the Jeeps manual and it stated break-in period of 350 miles. So I drove the vehicle with apprehension due to nearly being hit and almost hitting another vehicle. Jeep was taken back to service department with 587 miles where they performed a Trans quick learn procedure which only made the shifting and lunging worse. Was told to drive so the vehicle could learn my driving habits also. So I drove it to break-in as they stated but the issues never improved but just became worse. Vehicle was taken back at 858 miles and I explained it was progressing to get worse instead of better. They tested it and stated they could not duplicate the issues. Then was told that is how this model operates and it still is no broken in yet it required more miles  for break-in for that transmission and engine control modules to learn. Of course I knew this was nonsense. I contacted FCA customer care over the these issues and a case number was given at that point and was advised to take to a different dealership for a second opinion, huh was my response to that suggestion. A trip to Mississippi popped into the picture so had to wait till  I returned to follow their suggestion. I decided to drive the jeep to Mississippi and add these so call break-in miles to see if a change would happen. It became worse at times not wanting to accelerate through intersections to not wanting to accelerate while merging into traffic on I20 it was a scary drive. FCA was in contact with me and I told them what it did in Mississippi and Louisiana. The Jeep now has a long delay when going into reverse which nearly caused a on coming vehicle to strike my vehicle when I pulled out a little on a side road thinking it was part of a Canes restaurant parking lot in Ruston Louisiana. On the same trip returning from Mississippi on I-20 in DFW it became stop and go traffic heading west. Near Arlington I came to a complete stop on a slight incline with bumper to bumper traffic when the auto stop turned on like programed to do. Removed my foot off of the brake while hill assist was to remain engaged the engine had a slight starting delay more than normal and my jeep rolled backwards nearly hitting the vehicle behind me. I was under the assumption the Jeep would remain in place till engine started and transmission fluid pressure was back for the forward gear. Of course I became more frustrated with the dang thing now so took back to the service department  at 2256 miles for these added issues that could not be ignored. Service drove 6 miles and said can not duplicate after sitting several hours. Believe one of the sales people took it out for the drive instead of the technician. I know they are getting frustrated with me taking it back to them to repair but over $29,000 was paid for an unreliable vehicle. I finally wrote the CEO of FCA and explained the problems I was having with the vehicle and that I am only getting ""can not duplicate at this time"" response which I believe is now the policy with FCA. I received a call from a woman higher up the chain of command asking to take to a different dealership for second opinions which to me sounds like being pawned off and starting this run around all over again. I stated to her they were quick to put me into the vehicle so they should take responsibility for this since they know its history. She told me to set up an appointment at dealership I purchased it from so they could send a field service engineer so he could trouble shoot and see if a transmission replacement is required. Well two PCM re-flashes and of course no change it still runs the same. They kept from a Tues till Fri and it sat waiting on the field service engineer to advice the service department what the next step would be.

364, on 02/29/16 15:50 PM (PST),Tiffany ,2015 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Wish I kept my 1998 jeep cherokee," I have always had a love for Jeeps. My first Jeep, Pigeon was a 1998 Cherokee Inline 6. I loved that car to pieces, she did me good the 5 years I had her, however, I'm driving a further distance to work and school so I had to give her up sadly. Ended up buying a KIA Soul, traded that in after a year because I was scared for my life in that car. Here I thought I was getting a dream car because I always dreamed about owning a new Jeep... Then this car entered my life and I regret driving this off the lot. I don't have as many problems as other reviews, but it's a BRAND NEW CAR and shouldn't have to worry about ""what if my warranty runs out and then all this happens"". This Transmission is really sketch. I hate the way it jolts at random. The acceleration in this car is just as bad as the Kia Soul that I traded it in for. The AC and heater are terrible. I can never be at a comfortable temp. You're either freezing or burning up. The gas is terrible on this car. I feel like my 1998 did way better in gas. The Uconnect is a joke. It works when it wants to work. I literally have to turn off my car at times for it to sync.  When it rains the tires spin and I'm not trying to jet off since it won't even do that if I tried. I'm very disappointed in Jeep. I was always proud to be a Jeep owner and now I'm kind of embarrassed. After seeing the crash videos on this car I hope I NEVER hit a pole or a wall because it seems this car like to burst up in flames. If I could get rid of this car I would. I want to take this car in and have everything  checked but from the looks of it, Jeep doesn't really care.  My love for Jeep has died. Whenever I get the chance I will get rid of this car. Unfortunately I have to wait many years before that happens. I better start saving now since my year is almost up in May. Do yourself a favor, don't get this car. I should have gone Import. I hate to say it but it's true.",2

I didn't notice it did not have one until taking it home.  Also, never buy the extended warrantee at the time of purchase, as a better offer will come from Chrysler/Mopar shortly.  In fact, I have had multiple better offers than the one I purchased from the dealer.  I sometimes feel what I describe as a slip in the transmission when backing out and then going forward.  The dealer checked it out and could find no problem.  Please read the extended service contract.  You must have the required maintenance done at the proper dealer for warrantee to stand.  Other than that, I love the luxury feel and safety features of the 2018 Jeep Cherokee Overland.  I'm looking forward to driving my first SUV for many years.",4

This is the first time I’ve had leather with heated and ventilated seats, and I haven’t been disappointed by them.  I especially love the heated seats and steering wheel coming on automatically when the temps are really low.  I didn’t have a need for 3rd row seat, but I had to have a 6 cylinder engine after being underwhelmed by 4 cylinder cars in the past.  Unfortunately, V6 engines are getting harder to find in midsize cars and crossovers.  I’m not super impressed with the power of the V6 Cherokee’s engine climbing hills, so I can imagine the 4 must be sluggish. The controls for radio and heat/air need to be easier to operate while driving. There are buttons for controlling the temp but most of the controls are in the touchscreen which requires too much visual contact to fool with while driving. I would also recommend Jeep make the active drive setting default to off rather than on. Aside from those operational critiques, I love the fit and finish. The cabin is quiet and handling is great. It’s a fun car to drive.",4

It's a mixture of great and disappointing. The look, interior, and base model features are above average. It looks good, the inside is spacious and comfortable, the Bluetooth connectivity and backup cam are nice semi-modern touches, and it's nice to sit it. Unfortunately, the engine is not great. The 2.4L V4 is sluggish, under powered, and frustrating. It's fine for basic commutes where you never go over 45mph. However, the car has no pep, no get-up-and-go, and at higher speeds, you really have to push it to pass slower cars on the freeway. I wouldn't recommend the V4 Jeep Cherokee models to anybody.

I do 75-80 on the way to work (30 mi) and am averaging 27 mpg (80% hwy) with the 2.4 engine. RPMs sit right at 2,000 cruising, lower than the Escape and Sportage. If you need a comfortable, affordable vehicle, consider the 2.4 model and drive others to compare. 184 HP is plenty unless you want to tow >2,000 lbs or do 90 all the time. Also, trans is so smooth compared to ‘14-15 complaints. Love the 8.4 UConnect. Hope I get an easy 100k out of this Jeep as it’s far too early to assess reliability.

Check for corrosion on any part inside of the engine compartment as this could very well be a sign of potentially serious damage that will lead to expensive repairs. I paid $2500 for my Jeep in 2014, it is now worth about $1300 if I tried to resell it and I have put nearly $1500 into it in repairs with another $1000 for parts and labour just on the engine alone.

Scott ,2001 Jeep Cherokee SUV Classic 4WD 4dr SUV (4.0L 6cyl 4A),17-years and 339K miles," Purchased in 2001, this is the 3rd Jeep Cherokee owned and the best, as by 2001 the Cherokee had enjoyed purposeful improvements and technical upgrades.  Still on the original inline six engine and 4A transmission.  The 4.0 seems to tend to leak and this one started dripping oil (never measurable) at 170K, but initially a valve cover gasket solved the first occurrence.  Oil changes every 3k-5k miles.  The typical O2 and cam position sensors in first few years of service, but not since repaired.  A computer at 318K, and normal wear items as expected, including the AC compressor at 170K, radiator at 200K, heater core at 250K.  Brake rotor warping solved by mechanic's choice of replacements by 2003.  Lots of torque and smooth run at highway speeds.  Nimble in town.  Excellent stock solid axle 4WD capability.  Have driven through many on/off road conditions that stopped other vehicles.  Have been up to the axles in mud, up icy hills on the road when others stopped making headway, waded through flooded streets (safely) in bumper-deep water when others became stranded and pulled a make-shift plow to break up beaver dams in a creek.  Served as neighborhood taxi in snow/ice covered roads with steep hills - no problem with good street/trail tires.  Shifts in/out of 4WD easily.  It's not trouble-free but its performance and on/off road capability, great stock ground clearance, weight and overall reliability and ruggedness of the drivetrain always outweigh any issues.  Keep up with the maintenance, make repairs when needed and it should provide reliable, highly capable stock 4WD on/off road performance with reasonable operating expense.  Purchasing this year/model/configuration with well over 200K miles that has been maintained properly should not be a concern.  Parts are readily available and generally not too costly.  Abundant aftermarket parts/accessories.  Still on original paint/clear coat, carpet and seat covers, all of which are in remarkably good condition.  Still 17-19 mpg city, 20-25 mpg highway.  Still commuting 300+ miles/week.  Other than driver's door speaker, all other electrical items still function as when new.",5

It handles well on tight curves and despite it's classification as an SUV it doesn't have that vague steering I have noticed on other SUVs.

I've taken it off-road and it handles nicely, while on-road is even better. In general, for a vehicle with this kind of mileage (+50000) it's in good shape. It does have some problems, though. When 4 wheel drive high range is engaged, if you make a sharp turn the wheels lock. Also, when put in reverse for too long, it sometimes stalls or sputters. You need to find the right kind of tires, too. Wet handling is below average, even with 4WD. The vehicle corners well for an SUV and has a good turn radius, just make sure it's not cornering heavily above 50mph. At speeds above 80 on a straightaway highway, it becomes very shaky.",3.375

The first four were great very reliable and very few if any problems. This one has been a nightmare! 3 warranty issues which all required multi day visits to dealers with in one case my dealer having the car for 5 weeks. This vehicle constantly breaks. Electronic issues, misfiring engine, failed engine mount and now a blown radiator. In addition to paying for the car and regular maintenance I’ve spent countless hours at the dealer for warranty work and many thousands on unexpected failures. I’ve owned 7 new cars in the last 20 years and this vehicle is by far the worst! I will never again even consider buying a Jeep brand vehicle",1

I have owned a Wrangler, Jeep Grand Cherokee and now this trailhawk. I feel like each Jeep I own, there are more and more issues that plague these vehicles.  Most recently I have a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk, since acquiring this, it has required a new transmission (under 20,000). This vehicle also required some other work (which slips my mind at the moment) that was done six months outside of the 3-year warranty. The cost was roughly $2700, thankfully Mopar refunded the majority of costs. I thought this should take care of everything but it is turning into a nightmare of a money pit. I have also had to replace brake pads, rotors in the last few months, the passenger rear handle came off I still need to order a new handle and have it installed but haven’t had the opportunity, so I have been avoiding using this door.  On occasion my tailgate won’t close, I usually have to unplug the battery in order to reset this issue or google a quick fix. 2 weeks ago, I needed to replace the battery because my car wouldn’t start while visiting family, one of the connectors needed to be replaced at this time as well. The final straw has been finding out today that the ball joints need to be replaced. I understand that repairs sometimes need to happen and there is always routine maintenance, but this is excessive. I spend a significant amount of time without my vehicle and spending a lot of money for a car that is about 4 years old. I feel with the issues I feel extremely disappointed at the number of repairs and issues that are occurring and am looking to get a new vehicle when I was hoping this would last a couple more years. I feel that it is quite ridiculous to have to invest so much time and money in renting cars, seeking diagnosis for a relatively newer vehicle, and have never needed to bring in a car so much. This vehicle has become a laughing matter among my friends, family and coworkers. I am embarrassed that I am having so many issues and I wish there was a better warranty, or another option besides getting a different vehicle.",1

Inside and out is comfortable and stylish with utility built in, many storage places, tow hooks, all weather package etc.  The back however is small for loading any large gear. Acceleration at times takes gearing a few seconds to engage so making intersections hairy. A whistling noise was a costly repair not covered under warranty. A solid Jeep!",4
450, on 11/30/17 15:45 PM (PST),Mike ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Poor Reliability," As a previous reviewer also stated, I really wanted to like this vehicle.  After owning a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude for nearly four years, I grew to resent it.  My family only owns one vehicle, so it must be reliable.  Nobody enjoys car problems and when you only own one-vehicle car problems can become even more stressful.  I will try to provide fair input in this review, as there are things to like about the Cherokee.  However, its reliability became a major issue for my family.    When I purchased the vehicle, I knew it was the first time Jeep implemented the 9-speed transmission.  In hindsight, it was probably not a good idea to buy a vehicle with such a new feature that had not been tested.  After buying the Cherokee, I noticed some owners mentioning harsh shifts on forums.  I noticed some harsh shifts from time to time, but nothing too bad.  I saw some forum users state they had dealerships reprogram their transmission, but the update had to be followed-up by an adaptive learning procedure by the dealership (the manual does state this).  I contacted the dealership I have my Jeep serviced at and while they were familiar with the update, they seemed to know nothing about the adaptive learning procedure.  As a result, I opted not to have them do the update, as I knew they would not complete the required follow-up procedure.   After about 2 ½ - 3 years, I noticed a whining sound when shifting from 4th to 5th gear.  The car did not jerk or anything, but it did not seem right.  At about the 3-½ year mark, I began to notice the same sound when completing a higher shift.  Since it was spreading I knew it was probably a bad sign.  Also, the shifting became more and more jerky.  My wife and I would tell others it was jumpy, and a little unsettling at times.At about the 3-½ year mark, my wife got stranded running errands when the Jeep suddenly would not start.  Ultimately, we had to have the vehicle towed to a dealership and have the starter replaced.  Of course the 3-year warranty had expired months earlier, so we had the pleasure of paying around $800 for the fix.  Last week, we noticed the odometer flashing.  The odometer would just flash from the moment you turned on the vehicle until you turned it off.  Considering the transmission getting progressively worse, the starter replacement, and now the odometer issue I brought up the idea of buying a new vehicle, as we could not rely on the Jeep.  We were planning on waiting for a bit, but days later my wife ran an errand.  When she came home, she said the Jeep had some really harsh shifts and almost to the point where she felt it would stall.I subsequently decided to immediately trade-in the Jeep for a new Ford Explorer.  The next morning I took off work so we could head to a Ford dealership.  Now the check engine light was on!  We headed to the Ford dealership and traded-in our Jeep and bought a new Explorer.  We did not get a great trade-in value as the dealership saw the flashing odometer, check engine light, and noticed the whining sound on at least one shift.  We had planned on keeping the Jeep for 7-8 years.  We ended up getting rid of it after 3 years and 10 months of ownership.  Things were just getting worse and worse and we could not trust the vehicle.  After our experience with the 2014 Jeep Cherokee, I will never purchase another Jeep.  They have lost my business for good.  Having problems with a 3-½ year old vehicle, which we were the only owners of and had driven lightly is unacceptable.  There are some things I liked about the 2014 Cherokee.  My wife and I really liked the interior of the vehicle.  It had a really nice design and quality materials.  We also liked the upgraded infotainment system – we had the 8.4-inch screen.  It was easy to use and had a sleek interface.  We liked that it had the capability to handle poor weather and modes to enhance the vehicle capability, such as snow mode.  We also liked how there were various storage compartments in the vehicle, more so than many other small SUV’s.  Maybe on the newer models Jeep has solved the 9-speed transmission problems.  But if you Google the 2014 and 2015 models, you will see a lot of complaints about harsh shifts.  For us, our Jeep was getting progressively worse.  Not only were there what I believe to be transmission issues, but also other problems which you should not experience with a newer vehicle. If you really want a Jeep, buy a regular Jeep such as a Wrangler.  Stay away from anything else they make.  I previously owner a Jeep Rubicon and had no issues with it.  If you are looking for an SUV, you should seriously consider other brands.  For anyone who owns a Jeep SUV, and in particular a 2014 Cherokee, I really hope you do not experience the problems we did.",2

It burned so much in between oil changes that the engine SHUT DOWN in the middle of the road with NO WARNING. It had consumed all the oil to empty in about 6000 miles. I took it to the dealer who recommended to Chrysler that the engine be replaced. Chrysler responded that it did not approve the procedure because ""WE HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE. NEEDS TO BE AT 1000 MILES PER QUART""  this quote is from the reports I received with my invoice. In conclusion, they did nothing because per Chrysler, THEIR ENGINES ARE OK IF THEY CONSUME UP TO 1 QUART OF OIL FOR EVERY 1000 MILES. This means I have to add up to 6 quarts of oil in between oil changes. Per the dealer recommendation, I should keep oil in my car and check the oil every time I add gas. Is this normal for a 3-year old, 50,000 mile car???  I would recommend to stay away unless you are willing to take the risk on the engine.",1

Except for the transmission that seemed to want to scare us on a regular basis, this was a solid vehicle. But unfortunately that was a HUGE if, as the unpredictability of the transmission from a stop made it solidly unsafe. Cons: unpredictable transmission that felt like it slipped into first gear. Multiple flashes and trips to the dealer yielded 'no problems'. Oddly, one trip for an oil change fixed the problem, until they did the next repair and it went back to slipping.  The 4-5 recalls didn't help, although all were covered at no cost to me. The tires wore out after only 18,000 miles. Wow. The cruise control worked fine on the flats, but in the hills it would wait until 4-5 mph down from the set speed before kicking in, and there was zero control going downhill. The transmission Sport setting turned off the DSC (stability control). Why? Did they think we're running the Jeep on a track? I used Sport in traffic and on hills to make the reluctant transmission more responsive. We also experienced a few nagging buzzes/rattles that the dealer couldn't find.  I couldn't help but hit the phone activate button the steering wheel at least once a trip while making a turn. Pros: Beautiful, well thought-out interior. Excellent controls (other than the phone button location). Plenty of room. We loved the hidden storage under the passenger seat. We never got stuck, even in nasty ice & snow. Blizzaks definitely helped. The cabin heat worked well and kept the windshield clear. The sound system was well-balanced. Plenty of power with the V6.

458, on 02/21/17 22:45 PM (PST),Mark ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Solution for transmission and all negative reviews," There are a lot of unfair negative reviews for the Cherokee KL. Like any relationship, the solution is to listen… in this case to the vehicle messages and dealer service center. Yes, I too was frustrated at 7k miles when my transmission cut power on the freeway and I had to pull over, but I listened to the vehicle message prompts and was on my way to the dealer in ‘Limp Home Mode’. The industry’s first 9-speed transmission is incredible, but not perfect and it actually knows that by including a fail-safe of putting the Jeep in 4th gear while in DRIVE allowing speeds up to 40 mph. PARK, REVERSE, and NEUTRAL all still work according to the owner’s manual… yes, I actually read it and the service manager did not know all this which was annoying.It was also annoying that after a suspect ‘computer control update’, the transmission dropped 2 days later at the exact same location. I read up on the issue and had a sensible discussion with the service manager who agreed to install the improved 2015 design. FCA contacted me with a claim number and provided a rental car along with a voucher for 5 free oil services. My V6 Cherokee now has 34k miles on it with no issues, other than a noticeable shift from 2nd to 3rd which I understand is worse with the 4cyl, but nothing is defective. The Chrysler 200, Acura TLX/MDX, Land Rover Evoque/Discovery Sport share the same 9-speed and same complaints/good reviews. I did too much research and test drove many crossovers to find the Cherokee to be the best value bar none; 100k mile warranty, Smooth V6, over 270 HP, 4,500 lb. towing, 7 sec 0-60, over 30 mpg hwy, industry’s best 8.4” infotainment system, standard leather finishes, LED lighting, lots of hidden storage space which explains why reviews claim ‘less cargo space than competitors’ as in visible cargo... all for about $20k new. These features are better than base ‘premium’ crossovers which explains why the Cherokee is marketed in Europe as a Premium model.FCA did provide some oil changes years ago but did not put me up to writing this review. Good work making things right Jeep, I’d definitely buy another and recommend it to others as well.",5

Then the new transmission supposedly came in already broken and needed to be taken out and sent back.  In the meantime, I traded it and went back to a Chevy Equinox.

Because there is nothing on the carfax for this vehicle showing that it sat in the Jeep garage for a month.  Wow.  Shifty.  (No pun intended.).",1
468, on 08/18/16 10:50 AM (PDT),Bob ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),No confidence in Jeep," My Jeep Cherokee 2014 has already been recalled 5 times. On August the 17th the car stop abruptly in fast moving traffic when the transmission failed. A little internet research reveals that Jeep has had multiple transmission issues with their 9 speed transmission. I contacted the manufacturer and requested a 3 year extension on my vehicle as I have no confidence the car. So far they have refused. It is incomprehensible and outrageous that you can invest $ 30,000.00 dollars in a automobile that fails, puts your safety at risk and Jeep refuses to back up it product. My previous vehicle was a Chevy Colorado. It has over 140,000 mile on it and is 15 years old. I have have never had it in the shop for anything other than an oil change. It has a 10 year power train warranty. I never had to use it.My son is currently using it for college and still no mechanical concerns. I took a leap of faith and purchased a Jeep. It clearly was a mistake. The internet is riddled with Jeep owners transmission issues. I will never purchase another Jeep product and advise all buyers to beware. The only good note the people at Tate in Glen Burnie have been courteous and helpful in helping me repair my faulty vehicle. When you make a $30,000.00 dollar purchase you should have confidence in your vehicle. I currently have a Jeep case manager reviewing my issue. Will see where this goes.2/21/2017: Initially received little help , follow up or assistance from Corporate customer service Jeep case manager. I filed a complaint with the Maryland Attorney Generals office. They assigned me a mediator who contacted Chrysler/Fiat. After having my concerns ignored the Maryland Attorney General Office got their attention. The Maryland Attorney General's Office was wonderful. Government does work for it's constituents.  A Chrysler representative called me at home and asked- how they could resolve my complaint. I requested a 100,000 mile extended bumper to bumper warranty as I was no longer confident in the vehicle. They agreed. The transmission after several repairs has been operating with out issue although the shifter now needs replacement which the dealer service department has ordered. The dealership service people have been wonderful and I have nothing but good things to report on their efforts to resolve customer concerns satisfactorily.  I think Chrysler has resolved some of the major transmission issues that plagued the 2014 Jeep Cherokee. I am still somewhat disgruntled that $30,000.00 dollar vehicle should have resulted in 7 recalls and suffered a major transmission failure. If when I purchased the Jeep the sales representative had suggest that I could expect multiple recalls and perhaps transmission issues would anyone have purchased this vehicle? Of course not. To be fair I have to say I really like the Jeep it had what I was looking for in a small SUV. But Jeep customers should not have to endure this level of inconvenience and difficulty for choosing to buy Chrysler.",1
469, on 07/28/16 10:02 AM (PDT),agarcia ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),MY JEEP IS TURNING OFF---WHILE DRIVING," I have a 2014 JEEP LATITUDE. My engine is burning my oil and it shuts off my jeep- WHILE DRIVING! I've now had it looked at by the dealership 4 times and even ended up in a minor car accident because of it and still Chrysler insists they have to continue running oil life tests on my vehicle.  I've even had to go to a local Auto Zone and purchase 5QTS of oil just to get my vehicle to turn back on and get it back to the dealership. The whole situation is very frustrating and Chrysler is doing nothing about it, saying they have official bulletins stating that it's normal for Jeeps to be burning oil. Trust me if I knew I would be struggling with my new Jeep more than I was with my old car I wouldn't have even considered JEEP. Dealership only suggestion was for me to monitor the oil daily!--Who buys a new car and has to check the oil DAILY just to make it down the street",1
470, on 04/19/16 16:01 PM (PDT),jssr ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Do Not Buy This Piece of Garbage," Fiat Chrysler of America must be paying people to write positive reviews here.  That is the only possible explanation for this POS  receiving glowing reviews from a few individuals here.  Be careful when you see superlatives that are out of place or language such as ""you must buy this item"".  This is by far the worst SUV I have ever owned.  Mine is the 6cyl 4x4. It has been back to the dealer for three seperate recalls and we have experienced the same transmission problems that others have noted here.  Why, just last night the battery went dead for some unknown reason (this is a two year old vehicle) and when my wife attempted to start it, there were all sorts of warning symbols displayed (Check Engine, Parking Brake, Transmission, Traction Control).  The vehicle had applied the parking brake on its own and could not be shifted out of park.  I bought a new battery and started the car.  Initially, it would not shift out of park.  When I was finally able to shift it into reverse, it slammed into gear and I was able to back down the driveway.  Once in the street, it would not shift into drive, only neutral.  Guess what, you can't shut this thing off in neutral....only in Park.  So there I sat, with the car running, in Neutral, in the middle of the street.  Finally, the car suddenly let me shift into Drive and I made my way to the dealer in 3rd or 4th gear.  At the dealership, the service writer attempted to move the car and it got stuck in Neutral again.  They had to pull a fuse to shut it off and push it into a service bay.  We'll see how long it takes for them to figure this one out.  This car has problems with the electronics and the electrical system in general.  What may seem like a transmission issue may actually be the electronics.   We bought this to flat tow behind a motorhome.  Guess what?  Fiat just came out with a TSB warning that modifications may have to be made to the steering wiring harness to make it towable.  Even then, the electronics seem to have a life of there own.  I would consider this car unsafe for flat towing.  I owned a Wrangler prior to this and had -0- issues with flat towing.  AVOID THIS VEHICLE AT ALL COSTS!",2
471, on 04/19/16 12:19 PM (PDT),Bryan ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Fantastic Jeep!," I lease this car and it is a great Jeep. I love the way it rides and handles. All of which are very smooth. The MPG is a little cruddy but thats expected when you are driving a Jeep. The pick up however is really good, I used to drive a Trailblazer and this car with the 9-speed transmission can go! We have had this car for two years and we love it. We pull a 23' trailer with this small SUV, we have the 6 cylinder engine. The interior is perfectly laid out and the seats are so comfortable. I am 6'6"" and There is room in this car for a person who is 7' which is really hard to fine. The 2014 model had some transmission kinks that have been worked out in the newer models that I have test driven. I strongly suggest you buy this car and put it in your driveway!",5
472, on 03/10/16 07:53 AM (PST),Chris Richter ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Best Vehicle I've ever owned," Wow after reading all the bad reviews of this vehicle I guess the stars and planets all lined up when ours was built. Our V6 Trailhawk is a early build model Dec 2013. The only issues we've had was a water pump that squealed and a sunroof rattle. Both were fixed under warranty. I've had all the transmission updates done. It shifts very smooth. Yes there are few recalls which is not surprising being that's it's a new model first year build. Other than that it's been very reliable. I have over 40k miles, taken it off road several times. I participated in two Jeep Jamborees. I pushed it really hard. It came through totally unscathed. I'm really impressed with the versatility of this vehicle. It can tow 4500 lbs,  great comfort, latest technology, and excellent off road capability. It's possible that many of the negative reviews on here are a vocal crowd that have had bad luck with their vehicles. Hopefully most other owners have had better luck and do not participate in writing reviews. Of course if I had all the issues that others had on here I would be just as vocal and extremely unhappy with my vehicle. I just hope ours is not a fluke.",5
473, on 03/04/16 21:24 PM (PST),Kat ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Love My Jeep!," Currently at 14k miles no major issues. Transmission takes awhile to break in and can still be a bit jerry but nothing big, the software updates helped. I only have the 4x4 with active drive I but this little jeep tames the trails like nothing! Took it up a terrible 5 mile dirt trail to a cabin through mud, snow and ice and was scared wouldn't make it up the mountain but it sure did! No loss of traction or control and plenty of clearance. I was amazed. Putting into manual definitely helps and is a great feature along with snow mode. No chains needed and I just have the stock all season Le 2 tires. City driving is good but sometimes sluggish on acceleration  with the little 4 cylinder but hugs the road and fun to drive. Big enough for me, the 3 kids and the dogs. Comfortable and stylish. Love it and am definitely a loyal jeep patron!",5
474, on 02/01/16 07:45 AM (PST),George ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Consider putting one of these in your driveway," Purchased a low mileage 6 cylinder Trailhawk with all the bells and whistles. We are extremely happy with this vehicle. Ride,fit, finish with attention to detail are impressive. Very comfortable all around. Storage behind the seats is a bit cramped. We have owned (currently) several mid level Mercedes products as well as Infiniti, Acura, BMW, Range Rover, (and Jeep). Not as luxurious as an Range Rover but detail finish is pretty close, impressive ride and quiet with off-road ability, and less operating cost. Interior seems more durable than BMW.  Front is a bit odd style wise no more so than Lexus or Audi gaping mouth style but outstanding cars just the same. We have had zero transmission problems but this had been addressed by the previous owner. I would have been upset if I had just purchased new and had to get to the dealer several times to correct problems. Tires are starting to get noisy at 48k miles but still look like they will last for another 25. No significant interior wear, no significant squeaks or rattles. Most of our MB  and Infiniti service experiences were positive not as much for jeep. Most  of the  Japanese brands we had problems were unsolveable transmission related and ALL should have had recalls but the press seems to ignore customer complaints. At least The JEEP brand addresses and corrects problems in an open manner. They should build an SRT model. already have driven 30k + miles with zero issues and has been our primary vehicle.",5
475, on 01/26/16 19:40 PM (PST),Katcave ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),DANGER DANGER!!," Loved my new 2014 Lattitude when I first got it.  Everything worked very well, main problem at that time is that the headlights were not automatic so I had to get used to remembering to put them on at night in a lighted area. Then it all started to go south!  First the Bluetooth stopped working, couldnt get sound, voice mail, texts or anything from my cell phone to the car - it worked at first. Never got that corrected after many tries and calls.  Then transmission started to act up, at same location every day when I had to accelerate out of my development ( on to a 60mpd road) it would shift and slow down while I was trying to accelerate to avoid an accident. This was attempted to be corrected several times at the dealership but it always came back shortly thereafter. Then last Sunday, again in the same location, instead of slowing down, the transmission just quit!  The dash looked like a christmas tree with all the flashing lights and sounds.  I could not accelerate or anything, just luckily was able to roll to the next street and pull over. Normally this road is loaded with cars going 60-70 mph but it was late and it was not the case. It said to put in park and then shift to drive but every time I did it it would make a very loud clunking sound and light up SERVICE TRANSMISSION. I ended up just shutting it off for a few mins and was then able to make it back home with the engine light on. It was towed the next morning and the only thing that the dealer was able to do was reprogram the damn computer again!  How many times does this need to go on before someone gets hurt or killed?  Fiat Chrysler Jeep should be ashamed for putting people in harms way.  Get these vehicles off the road!  I am putting in a case at Customer Care but I am not hopeful. I got the POS as a lease and have 16 mos to go. God help me if I can't get out of this thing!  I am afraid to drive it now and I have a 10 year old daughter to drive around as well.  It hurts my stomach every time I have to pay my monthly payment on this thing. Don't even consider this vehicle!  Not worth the safety risk and aggravation.",1
476, on 01/08/16 09:53 AM (PST),Cyn ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Just walk away," I was so excited when we first purchased this Jeep! Bought it brand new! Hadn't even had it two years and we finally washed our hands of it last night, thank goodness! The transmission is so temperamental, the dealership made us feel crazy when we would complain how it drove. The acceleration was not very responsive and one month after having it we had to have a defensive tore replaced because it would shimmy the entire vehicle when driving high speeds. Comforting let me tell you. Oh! Let me tell you about comforting. My husband and I are on the highway going 75 and the car completely turns off. OFF! I had my daughter in the backseat so that freaked me out even more. It turned itself back on and all these alerts kept dinging and then saying our 4WD no longer was working. We head to the exit ramp and the car shuts off once again bringing us to a complete stop. When my husband finally got the car to start back up he had to floor it so we could get home at 11mph. Once we arrived home, as soon as my husband let off the gas, the rpms shot up and made a terrible sound. He tried to turn it off by pushing the button and it wouldn't turn off. It was ridiculous. Needless to say this was the worst vehicle I've ever purchased. It's a shame it drove so terribly because the inside was pretty comfortable. save your money. Please.",1

It was same problem again, so this jeep Cherokee looks good on the outside but mechanically SUCKS. So I hired a lawyer and here we are lemon law case and they end uo buying it back from me .

480, on 12/22/15 17:54 PM (PST),Bill ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Never Buy this vehicle, Very thankful for good consumer biased Lemon Law. This vehicle went back to Jeep for Lemon Law. Total ownership was just over 1 year. It was mostly in the shop for 5 months. Another month or two for Lemon Law to flow through.  We had a 6 cylinder Trailhawk. Options for Edmunds were not available. It took multiple times in the shop to figure out the driver rear knuckle was machined wrong from the factory. The dash was removed a few times before the entire HVAC was replaced. The defective HVAC would cause a vibration/droning intermittently. The final straw was an intermittent cooling system leak. Dealer acknowledged there was a problem. They were unable replicate at the dealer. It would leak at odd times. The transmission was never correct. The Jeep 9spd was almost like driving a Nissan CVT. Rear cargo storage was less than expected. The wheels for the moonroof cover would constantly rattle while on the road. Infotainment system worked great. Satellite radio would cutout in the city. Front seats were comfortable. Navigation worked ok. Not as good as Google Maps on a smartphone.,1
481, on 12/01/15 05:34 AM (PST),JoeN ,2014 Jeep Cherokee SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Never again!," We bought a low serial number 2014 Jeep Cherokee with the V6 and Active Drive II 4WD. The Jeep looked nice and handled really well on the test drive. It came semi-stripped with manual seats, no nav, and no backup camera, but had the low range 4WD and heated seats, mirrors, and ,my wife's favorte part, a heated steering wheel. Having had a 1996 Grand Cherokee for over 300,000 miles we decided to give this one a try. Well Jeep has made a wrong turn with this one. Instead of the reliable simple 1996 ZJ, this XK Jeep is horrible. The overly complicated 9 speed transmission has been in the shop six times now for updates and repairs. The infotainment system can be hacked and used to take over the throttle, steering, and brakes. I mean come on, who connects the radio to the steering? The 4WD system is not up to par either.  I took it on the lawn to drop off a smal tree I had bought and it got stuck! on level grass! The factory tires came off the next day and better ones were fitted, but it will still spin the tires in the wet and that is with the traction controls on!. The transmission shifts like a 16 year old learning to drive stick, the gas mileage is averaging 21 and not hte 30 they claimed. SInce my 1996 ZJ got an average of 19, I do not see what benefit the new 9 speed is giving. In fact it does not shift into 8 until you hit 70 and I have never gotten it into 9 which is only from 100 and up - Believe me nobody wants to drive this at 100mph.The visibliity is horrible out the back due to the styling and you cannot see the front of the car either. This makes this Jeep not really off-roadable. If you buy one you will need the backup camera or get used to backing up using your mirrors.On the plus side, the seats fold easily and the space once they are down is pretty large. the controls are pretty well placed and easy to use and since it has a push-pull shifter you can go through the gears yourself, which is smoother than letting the transmission shift for itself. It looks nice and the oil filter is on top of the engine making it real easy to replace it, which you will be doing alot since even with synthetic oil it seems to get dirty around 3000 miles. The power from the 3.2 six is nice at 272HP. I was told by somebody about somethign else, but it applies here. It looks great, is horrible to operate and breaks down often. What do you expect, it is Italian. Basing this Jeep off of an Alfa SUV was a mistake. I wonder if the new Renegade, which is based off of a FIAT is just as bad... To make matters worse, all thoughout this Jeep are things like a silhouette of a WWII Jeep MB on the windshield, the words Jeep, since 1941 on the steering wheel, and the Jeep grille/headlights logo stamped on random things under the hood, which is funny since the grill of the XK looks nothing like that of a MB/CJI am going to be looking for a 2003-2004 Grand Cherokee Overland - a REAL JEEP to replace this.",2

With 4 visits to the dealership for transmission software upgrades and 2 tranny replacements later, I am now waiting on an arbitration decision for replacement or reimbursement.  Very disappointed as I loved taking this truck off road.  It handled mud, hills and dirt trails with no issue.  Highway driving, however has been far more thrilling than it should be with ""wobbling"" between gears in downshifts and acceleration from standing position.  Lurching forward in traffic is not fun. Slowing down 50-60mph and feeling like an anchor was dropped changes your plans for stopping distance. Hoping to replace this with  new SUV that works.",1

Several times electronics blacked on for a while and hatch wouldn't open or close with switch (worked with remote).  Dealer never found problem....just reset system.  Front strut mount made rubbing noise in cold weather.   Dealer replaced it after months of waiting for part.  Now radio shows many songs, hatch don't open manually, and vehicle won't start!

It had alot of features for a great price and we already had a grand Cherokee we were very happy with. It turned out to be the worst car I have ever driven. The transmission wasn't a problem during initial test drive but started to act up soon after the purchase. I found myself taking different roads to work because I feared it wouldn't pull out when I needed it to.  Also had a bad vibration or wobble in front end. After numerous visits to dealership they said hopefully a service engine light would come on and maybe then they could help me.  About 3 weeks later the transmission failed completely while driving! Thank god I wasn't on a highway or I could have been killed. Tow truck driver had trouble even getting it on truck because it wouldn't go into neutral.That was it for me. Chrysler finally approved new transmission control module but too little too late for me.  I looked into lemon law but was told it could take months to go thru the process and I needed a car to drive. Had part replaced and drove to a non jeep dealership the next day and got rid of it...and lost $10000 from what they would give me for trade verses what I had paid for it only 1 year earlier. My husband and I felt our family's safety was obviously most important.Stay away from this vehicle. Chrysler needs to do something because it is unsafe to be on the road.,2

I cannot recommend strongly enough to avoid this car until ZF comes up with a working transmission.

This can be frightening when you are expecting the vehicle to go and it doesn't.  My other suggestions would be to change the front window opening mechanism because if my dogs are in the front seat and the air is on, they can step on the window button and open them.  If I lock the windows, then I can't open them for the dogs to stick their heads out when I want them to be able to do that.  When the window is partly down, there is no way to keep them from opening them all the way.  I had a Jeep Liberty and those window controls were dog proof and much better.  The other suggestion is to move the voice controls from the steering wheel location.  My husband continually hits that button on accident and has to say cancel.

A month later, I get locked inside the car. Yes--inside. Can't open the doors, the windows, nothing. Tow comes (3 hours, thank you Jeep Roadside Assistance), and again ""nothing."" Then the car started vibrating and shaking. Now the diagnosis was ""transmission problems."" Each time, the service took longer and longer, and it never got fixed. Each time = 5 times. And through all of this, I had to deal with the abysmal service through Chrysler Customer Care and their dealers, who are surly and condescending. Imagine calling for a service problem with a safety issue and being told that they have an appointment 9 days away. Yup--that happened. At first, I thought this was an isolated instance: my car was just a bad car. But after I did a little investigation, I discovered that these issues were known Jeep issues, especially the shaking and the transmission problems. Do yourself a favor and stay away.2016 Update: unloaded this POS in July. It had 4 recalls in one year. Couldn't be happier with my new Lexus. 'Nuff said.",1

I ended up suing Daimler Chrysler. Hired a Lemon Law Attorney who got me out of this Jeep. They bought it back under TX Lemon Law regulations. Car was paid off and I returned it to the dealership and went to Ford and bought an Explorer. They also covered my attorneys fees. Back experience that ended well. Original post:I bought this car just over a year ago. When on the test drive I noticed it was shifting hard. The salesperson told me, ""oh that's NORMAL"". I shrugged it off because after speaking with her I went and talked to the service technician who told me the hard shifting was normal for this particular vehicle and it would cease once it adjusted to the way I drove the car. I'm not mechanically inclined at all when it comes to cars but that response sounded absurd. But, I got a SUPER GREAT DEAL and bought it anyway. After having it for a few months, I took it in because the hard shifting had gotten worse. (Love Field Jeep Chrysler Dodge) They told me it was something minor and the issue was fixed. After about a month, I started to feel the hard shifting issue again and I before I could take it in, I received a recall notice in the mail. I took it in again and they ""reset this"" and ""adjusted that"" and they told me it would be fine. And, for about a week, it was. I took it in for the 3rd time and the service advisor called me after a couple of days and said, ""we have to replace your transmission"". They kept the car for a couple of weeks and when I got it back, the problem was finally fixed. BUT....about a month later, the car started dying while I was driving it. It would die, hesitate to start, start, die again, and finally it would stay running. After about 2 weeks of this I finally took it back to the shop to have it looked at. They kept it for a couple of days and then called me to say that they're having to REPLACE THE ENGINE!!!! Something about leaking valves engine compression...yadda, yadda, yadda!!!! The only good thing about this experience is that the service technician is a cutie!!! Other than that, DO NOT BUY THIS RAGGEDY CAR!!!!!",1

However, the knowing looks of other owners betrays that they are aware our Jeep is much more capable.  The all wheel drive system seems seamless as we negotiate icy, twisty roads, deep sand or even deep snow. We continue to rack up carefree miles and truly enjoy our ownership experience. The few times we have needed Jeep support it has been there in first class style.We look forward to many more years of this love affair exploring the country. Well, that was then.UPDATE:We have since had the unhappy experience of tens of thousands of other owners who have had the complete transmission fail leave them stranded in dangerous spots. This happened to us a total of 5 times! We knew we were in real trouble when the Arbitrator was in the dealership trying to resolve the dispute with other owners on our last 2 visits to the service department. And I must say we felt lucky in our dealership experience; at least they were open and honest about the issue and as helpful as they could be. I have read and heard numerous reports of others being nearly completely abandoned by their dealer, who just took a hard line ""tough s*%t"" attitude with them. But, Jeep controls the repair process and it is long, tedious and will repeatedly put you in harms way. The last time we got stuck with a dead transmission was in the middle of a busy highway. Very Very scary situation. The transmission fail issue on this car HAS NOT BEEN FIXED. Many many people have opted for full trans replacement, but I have not heard a single one have confidence that this was truly a long term fix. More like they are just waiting for the new trans to start having the same fail. Face it, you buy a Jeep brand product in the expectation of at least occasionally taking it to a remote location. Otherwise you would settle for a different brand. With the prospect of complete transmission failure this becomes a serious risk if you are 50 or 100 miles from nearest help. Not acceptable. We wound up having to trade this in on a lightly used Grand Cherokee Overland. This was not an ideal solution by any means, but got us out of this dangerous vehicle in the best way we could.",1

This has been a very nice vehicle, keeping my wife happy (replacing a totaled Caravan) with enough space for a reasonable amount of hauling in town. We generally drive it on road trips, also. Don't overlook that this really is a Jeep, a little heavier than otherwise would be the case, but you find the advantages when driving over rough roads, as it just glides along where most cars would be shaking themselves to pieces. MPG is great on the highway, up to 27 mpg, with excellent merging acceleration for on-ramps. Cornering is good, also. The 8.4 inch touch screen is easy to read and works well.Update June 2016: At 26,000 miles the Cherokee is now getting roughly 28-31 mpg on the highway at 75 mph. We have done the navigation update (remotely adds navigation to the existing 8 inch display), and it works well, though it's not cheap. The vehicle has been at the dealership for several recall updates and replacement of an oil pressure sensor, all at no cost and none of it causing any difficulties to us in driving. We still think the Cherokee is a winner. My wife (primary driver) particularly likes the forward visibility and maneuverability. Comfort/convenience features like power liftgate and heated seats/steering wheel are favorites for her also.Update June 2017. Now 38,000 miles with a couple of more recalls done but nothing that has caused driving difficulties or stranded us. Repairs to power liftgate latch under warranty about six months ago, no cost to us. We will get new tires before next winter just to be prudent, but there's still a reasonable amount of tread left.Update December 2017. Now 44,00 miles. No additional repairs. Original tires were replaced at 41,700 miles. They no longer had enough tread to be safe for driving in snow though they were OK for other use.Update June 2018. 47,500 miles. No problems.BTW, our Cherokee is the 3.2 liter V6, not the 4 cylinder.",5

I now give the transmission a poor rating! It seems to have problem syncing with the engine speed. This is noticeable when slowing to a stop for a red light but not coming to a complete stop because the light turned green.

That was a mistake.  You get what you pay for.  It was inexpensive, because in simple terms it stinks.  From the very beginning it has burned excessive amounts of oil.  We took to the dealership and were told that a quart of oil every 1,000 miles is normal.  Well, that's not normal in my opinion for a brand new vehicle.  I have an 11 year old Chevrolet that does not come close to burning that much oil.  We were advised to check the oil every time we fill up with gas.  What a joke.  They performed an oil consumption test which resulted in them telling us they would send the findings to the manufacturer.  We called several times to check status of the oil consumption findings only to be told that they hadn't heard back from the manufacturer.  Two weeks ago, while driving the Jeep in rush hour traffic the engine light started flashing and service transmission light came on and car went into limp mode.  I was almost rear ended because car wouldn't move.  I was finally able to slowly move over 3 lanes and pull into a parking lot.  I shut the car off and once I restarted it, it seemed to be fine.

My husband was driving us to his parents house and we were on a local highway and when he sped up to pass someone suddenly the transmission service message came on as well as the check engine light. The jeep basically went into limp mode and we could barely take off at a light when it changed. When we were able to park it he turned it off then back on after a minute and it reset the transmission message but the engine light was still on.  Of course we eventually had to go home and after a couple of miles the transmission message reappeared and again was in limp mode. I called the dealership I bought it from immediately and spoke with an advisor who tried to insinuate it was probably a battery issue and not a transmission problem because he never heard of any issues like that until I mentioned finding out about all the issues with 2014-2015 Jeep's which resulted in a recall which made him stop talking about it and told me it could not be looked at for two weeks.  Lucky for me in Savannah we have two Chrysler dealerships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The check engine light went off eventually but on 11/27 my husband was driving it and once again the same situation happened so he contacted the other Chrysler dealership and was able to get it looked at the next day. They ran a diagnostic on it and the code that came on was related to the transmission control module. They ran a software update and as of right now the message and light has not returned but it has only been two days. I reported the issue to FCA and the national highway safety institute to start a record on this issue for my vehicle. Luckily GA has strong lemon laws and if this happens again I will probably pursue it.  It's very upsetting because I love the Jeep but I'm really nervous and scared to drive it now,especially with my baby in the car.  Surely if a vehicle needs updates there would be a safer way to let owners know about it instead of your car going into a dangerously slow speed on a highway. From reading what other owners have written my fear is it's not if this will reoccur again but a matter of when it will happen again.",3

No problems with it after a few initial issues upon delivery.  Car sat on the lot nearly a year and the front brake rotors were pulsating as they were warped and the car felt like it wobbled a bit on low speed in traffic.  Took to a dealer near my work (not where I purchased) and they turned the rotors and replaced the front axles due to a service bulletin.  After picking it up, noticed a grinding sound when braking.  Called the dealer who serviced it and the service manager was a real jerk telling me it was noise from turning the rotors and it would burn in quickly.  I know what the sound of turned rotors sounds like, this was different.  Argued with them and they wouldn't even look at it until after I put 1000 miles on it.  Told him I'd rather drive it through his showroom if I had to listen to the noise on a new car.  Called Chrysler, told me to go back to selling dealer who fixed the problem by replacing the right rotor which still had a high spot on it and also straightened the dust cover which original dealer bent.  Although it took some work, it was fixed and Chrysler gave me 25 free oil changes of full synthetic oil for my trouble.  Overall very happy with Chrysler's response but not Colonial Chrysler in Hudson, MA.  I won't even go there to buy parts for my 05 Grand Cherokee anymore I'm so mad at them.  Has been a great car.  Good acceleration, smooth transmission.  Ride is as smooth as any Mercedes I've owned.  The 3.2 L is based on Mercedes architecture.  Looks nearly identical to my SLK 280 3.5 L Motor.",5

It is also faster, way more efficient and loaded with tech.

I have the Trailhawk with the 3.2 V6, and love it. My ONLY complaint is the 9 speed transmission. It works well, it's just S-L-O-W to respond; downshifts to passing gear takes forever, it hesitates to accelerate from time to time, and I honestly think the 9th gear is like a great white buffalo - It RARELY touches 9th, and when it does, you're going at least 80mph, which is speeding. Jeep dealer has updated software twice on my transmission (it was required by Jeep) and that certainly made things better, but there's room for improvement yet. HOWEVER - this is completely livable - you just have to expect to wait a couple secs for the transmission to downshift when you put your foot down.  As others have said, yes, cargo is a little small for the class, but there is still more than enough and this vehicle performs amazingly. There's nothing else in the segment that can come close to the capability and comfort of the Cherokee, especially in this price range. I would absolutely recommend it with one caveat: Spend the money for the v6; I test drove both, and the 4 cyl just doesn't have enough ""umph"", especially when you need to pass or merge into traffic on highways.",5

I've used the 4WD on some off road hills in WV and it did just great (as good or better then any of my old Subaru's)  I just purchased another 2017 Cherokee for my wife.

Mango Tango! It was love at first sight; a work of art with unsurpassed comfort! But it's been just one year (14K miles) and I no longer feel safe in it, nor can I count on it to get me to my destination. Today, I write this review from my back deck when I should be enjoying my camping vacation, however for the 4th time in a 6 week period, the car completely shut itself down. Twice in the last few weeks the car has just shut itself off, requiring me to pull over. Each time it restarted after a few minutes. Thank goodness it was always where I could pull over. Today however, packed for my vacation, camper in tow, traveling 65mph EVERYTHING shut down: the electronics and the transmission. Dead as a doornail. No power brakes, no power steering. Nothing. Roadside assistance sucks. It took two hours for them to get a wrecker to me, but refused to take it to my local dealership, a whopping 4 miles further than the ""closest"" Jeep dealership, and made me abandon my camper. Furthermore they told me they would not get me home from the dealership they were willing to tow to (placing me 85 miles from home). So I paid the wrecker guy the FOUR MILE difference to take the car to my local dealer and my son-in-law rescued the pop up. I can't say enough for the service guys at my local dealership who did a diagnostic on the car first thing the following morning (Monday) to try and get me back on the road, but they could not replicate the issue and returned my car to me. :( I guess I'm stuck driving a $40K safety risk until this happens again, and again. Here are a few other things that annoy me about this car: the cruise control is a joke. Unless you are on flat land, it will take off on you going down hill as though it isn't engaged. I've had the car bolt from 55 to 68mph of its own volition. You can't turn off the radio; you have to mute the volume every time you get in the car if you don't want to listen. Bluetooth connects sporadically and often can't send messages or takes several minutes to respond. If your iPod/iPhone is connected to a USB port for charging, you can't get it to run through the speakers for music. I just paid $3K for the extended service plan; looks like I'll be needing it.  This vehicle has a history of issues. ITS TIME CHRYSLER DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT; 3 MODEL YEARS IS ENOUGH! 07/25/17 update: spoke with a Chrsyler REP who has authorized looking deeper into the stalling issue AND got me a rental so I can tow and experience a vacation this summer. Let's see how the repair goes. I'll update as information becomes available.",1

The back up camera only worked half the time, on top of that when I had enough of this pc of crap and decided to trade it in with 16,000 miles the car was worth 1/2 of what i paid for it. The depreciation on this vehicle is horrible. I did not just take the dealers offer on the trade in. The Kelly blue book also shows the value is 50% after 1 year. My grand Cherokee was 5 years old and over 50K miles and I got 60% of its purchase value at trade in.

The thought was to get the baby into a nice, safe and smooth ride.  This car has been terrible.  The dealership and service area have been absolutely horrendous, but that's not what you guys care about.  I have had this car for six months and have had to bring it in for service 4 times,  not including the windshield wiper recall.  They have had to replace the radio system 3 times.  The touch screen and radio continue to black out which does not let me control the heating vent system, radio and rear view back up camera.  When I hit 30 MPH the back up camera goes on while driving forward.  The radio is in and out when this happens, not that I can control it.  This happened during the recent snow storms in Southern Maine and I was not able to select my rear and front defrosters as the buttons did not work on top of the touch screen.  Luckily when the radio and touch screen went it was already on these settings.  Currently still in the shop now while they are adding a new radio.   I also had to have my right signal repaired because it went out after 2 months.  They think it was actually the wiring connecting to the light.  took them 2 hours to figure it out. The interior is nice,but poor vision around corners due to the frame.  Smooth ride, but the 4 cyclinder is a little sluggish.  Actually impressed with handling in the snow.  But, I asked for options to replace the jeep from the dealer and they said to call Chrysler and complain as that's my best course of action or they could have me trade it back into them for a new Jeep but I they said I would have to pay more for it.

It wasn't until we were stranded for 3 hours do to a transmission failure with 10,500 miles on the vehicle that we found out just how unreliable it would be. The Jeep was towed to a local Jeep dealer for repair. They provided excellent service by the way; five computer modules were upgraded and the problem appeared to be corrected. A day later, the problem reappeared, died while on a highway, and the vehicle went back to the shop. This time they determined that it would need a valve on the transmission that had failed. The unreliability of a vehicle with only 10,500 miles made me very nervous for the future. My wife and I were visiting Florida at the time and the thought of driving 1,400 miles to get home to upstate New York with a vehicle that could shut down any time during the trip prompted us to trade the vehicle immediately.

That being said, the 2.4 4cyl tiger shark with the 9 speed transmission has kind of ""learned"" my driving habits, The transmission software issues from the '14 models are worked out and fixed.

We have taken it on three road trips and just absolutely love it.  Comfort, ride, visibility, power I could go on and on. I am a car guy so upkeep and cleanliness are top priority for me, this thing is put together like a Mercedes Benz. In fact, my parents liked ours so much they purchased one too. So far very pleased with product and dealer network and hope it stays that way. Note: I found no option for the Trailhawk with a 3.2 V6 so I used the 4 cylinder.Update: We are still just as happy with our purchase two years later. No creaks, rattles, leaks, etc.  It just does everything well for us. My only complaint would be the headlights & Fog lights, but I did some research and corrected that problem. I replaced the OEM headlights with Sylvania Silver Star Ultras and a pair of LED fog light bulbs. The lighting is 100% improved. The 2019 has had the front end redesigned, so I assume the lighting issue has been resolved. We will keep driving this one until the wheels fall off.",5

We looked at and drove several other suv's but keep coming back to the 2016 Jeep 75th Anniversary Edition with the 2.4 motor. It just felt more solid, comfortable, quite and interior was laid out better to us. We wanted to like other models more, but the Jeep just won us over. Having owned and driven many cars from around the world, the Jeep just keep being the best option for us. The ride is solid, the seats firm, but not hard and the interior is very quite, which should make it a treat for long highway trips. Looking forward to our first. The 2.4 motor has plenty of power for anything we need, equal or better acceleration than our old 1.6 turbo, and surly better fuel mileage. We were lucky to see 25 mpg with eco motor even using a light foot. The best ride and handling I've ever exeperienced was an older RR. The Jeep is the closes I've come to matching it. So far we are both extreamly pleased with the Jeep. Now the cons: the dealers lack of knowledge of the product. Navaid a $600 addition cost on a $30,000 car, supplied by the same clueless dealer. Chrysler Finanical is the least customer oriented company I've dealt with in the last 20 years, and unable to reconcile the difference between a 911 address and mailing address. My only hope is the Jeep will outshine our last plagued Chrysler vehicle, a 2006 Grand Caravan.  18 months later, still very happy with our jeep. On a 1400 mile trip, we got an average of slightly over 29 mpg with 3 adults and all our luggage. Still enjoy the comfort, ride and handling. We have had no issues or problems. Only trips to dealers was for oil changes. I was impressed at the last oil change, I was able to see under the motor, and the underbody shield has access openings for drain and filter without the necessity to remove the shield. Great for owner maintenance.",5

In all conditions it handled very nicely. Going uphill was never an issue. It's power was more than enough to help us up the hills at a nice pace, and it's handling made it unnecessary to use the brakes except on the sharpest turns. On the freeway, there was no trouble merging at the right speed. Acceleration was always just right. Very smooth ride, even at highway speeds, and also very quite. Interior is great.High quality materials made it feel almost luxurious.  Very comfortable seating for 5. Plenty of leg and headroom. We really like the front grille and the daylight running lights too. I was really pleasantly surprised and would recommend it to everyone. If you don't need 4wd, the 2.4L is really great, and along with the 9 speed transmission it provides a smooth very quick way to arrive at your destination, relaxed and refreshed, no matter how long the journey. Just wanted to update the review. We have driven over a thousand miles more since the initial review. Everything is still great. I really, really enjoy driving this car. Very smooth. Very comfortable. Very quite. Acceleration is just right. Everyone who had driven with us is very impressed. My friend, who is 6'2"" said he had plenty of head and legroom in the rear seat. He also said how comfortable it felt. I can't wait for a very very long road trip. I wish I was driving it now.",5

I even had customer leather seats installed with the matching tangerine and white trim and had all the windows tinted. On August 11, 2016, Baton Rouge experienced an enormous amount of rain. I've owned at least 20 cars in my lifetime and they've been through hurricanes and rain before, so this particular day shouldn't have been any different. It wouldn't have been if Jeep had made sure all the wheel wells were sealed. I brought my Jeep to a dealer and that's what they found. The LF wheel well wasn't sealed properly and I had several inches of water in my drivers floorboard and behind the driver. The carpet held 2-3"" of water for days before I noticed it. (10 total while trying to dry myself and waiting on the dealer)  I'm hoping that's the only area to leak and that it was repaired properly. I'm still waiting for the dealer and Jeep to contact me if they will replace the carpet. Waiting and waiting!! The dealer did not dry my carpet or the pad at all. I had to do that myself with fans and blow dryers for days. I guess they thought if they put it back down I wouldn't notice. They didn't even remove the seat to check for any further damage to electrical or to dry. I'm hoping I don't have any future electrical problems with my new purchase. Currently, I'm having the Jeep inspected by my insurance and a second opinion from another Jeep dealer. As long as I know there is no future damage and that Jeep will stand behind replacing the carpet if needed, I still feel I made a good purchase. Out of all the suv's I looked at, the 2016 Cherokee was the most comfortable and easiest to handle.",4

I bought this machine so I can flat tow behind my RV.  I always keep a car for 10 years or more, and given my age this could be my last car.  Hence I bought all the bells and whistles and sure glad I did.  The more I drive it the more I love it.  Regarding fuel economy, maintenance, etc. it's too soon to tell. UPDATE:  I've had the car for several months now, got it primarily because I can flat tow it behind my RV.  To do so there is a mandatory accessory electrical harness that must be installed.  Most dealers didn't know anything about it.  That said, I pretty much love the car.  Good power, good trail capability, GPM up to 30 on highway & tows great.  I have almost as many towed miles as I do driven. (odometer shows only driven miles).2017-09-02  I've had the Cherokee for about a year and am basically very pleased with it.  HOWEVER:  I am currently 700 miles from home, in the mountains, in a tinny town.  Yesterday the liftgate would not lock.  It goes up and down, tries to lock but won't.  I called my dealer who walked me through some trouble shooting steps and it was determined the actuator is bad and needs to be replaced.  I called the closest dealer to where I am (97 miles) and the best they could offer was for me to bring it in, they look, order part and fix.  This I was told on Friday before a 3 day weekend.  Only thing I can do is abort my vacation and go home and let my dealer handle it (they stock the part).  In the mean time the car won't lock, interior lights stay on and the gate stays open about a 1/4"" providing ample opportunity for rain to come in.  This failure occurred w/in 30 min of me telling my wife that the more I drive the car the more I like it....which is still true.2018-03-05  I still really like the car but I have to downgrade the interior a bit.  The moon / sun / panoramic roof has developed an annoying creaking noise.  You can tilt / close the roof and the noise goes away for awhile then returns.  Dealers claim they can't repeat it or don't know how to stop it.  There are MANY on Facebook (Cherokee forums) that complain about the same thing, on the same side (passenger) and the problem is consistent from 2014 on through at least 2017 year models.  One person came up with a permanent work around by adding a piece of sticky back foam between a piece of metal on the roof track and the plastic part it is rubbing on.  If it is that easy I'd have thought Chrysler would have fixed the problem by now.  Other than that I love the car.",5

But there was something vaguely not quite right with the Latitude.  It had no tow points (had to hook a tow rope to the suspension to pull a car out of the snow)..it didn't seem like a Jeep; it sat a little lower (though it had 18"" low profile tires).  It was more a sports car with Jeep characteristics.  I was afraid to take it onto the beach - wasn't sure of the tires and with no tow points I had my doubts. So after just 5,000 miles and 7 months I went back to Jeep and test drove another Wrangler, both the JK and JKU.  Though I'd had the equivalent since 1975, this time it just didn't work - I just didn't want to go back.  So, I wound up buying a 2016 Cherokee Trailhawk 3.2L with every option available including tow package, full sun roof, leather with ventilated seats, sound group, etc.  The tow package was key but the way the car sat, the ground clearance, the tires, everything was just balanced and perfect - a stunning Jeep; what a difference something as simple as 2"" of ground clearance and 245 tires will make.  This is the SUV I've been looking for for the last 5 years ever since my wife of 36 years first complained about being jolted around in the JK Wrangler.  It will do everything I want it to do including rock crawl (I installed Rock Rails just in case I go to Moab though they're unlikely to be used). It rides, handles, stops, crawls, goes through snow, sand, mud, handles interstates beautifully.  It has a beast of an 3.2 6 cal engine that makes it run like a mini-Porsche Carrera.  This Jeep will be with me for many many years.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  two years later +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The Cherokee trailhawk continues to be my perfect SUV two + years into owning it.  The milage is just short of 20,000.  It is comfortable, powerful, will do everything I want for a Jeep at this point in my life; it rides well, handles deep sand on the beach, snow on the road, has enough ground clearance to go where I want it to go and looks good;  I even like the old shark-like nose better than the modern version.  Of the options that I got with the truck, the Trailhawk version and the 3.2 engine are obviously the two most important.  The Trailhawk version is a real Jeep.  Surprisingly after these two the most important option was the premium heated/ventilated seats.  They are light-years ahead of the standard seat - firm, supportive; a lot of time is spent in the seat and I now realize it's as important as the tires.  The tow package turned out to be a great bargain.  I'm not enamored with the 9 speed automatic transmission because of well-documented tendency not to down-shift or to down shift too often - with the 3.2 you don't really need 9 speeds - but I have gotten used to it - and the option to put it into manual is always there.  To sum up, I have no interest in changing trucks; this continues to be the best SUV for me and my wife in terms of size, performance, comfort, off-roadability, and versitility.  It stays in the garage and in the family.",5

I had been researching the new Cherokee since it's introduction but wanted to wait to buy one until all the kinks had been corrected. I fell in love with the Trailhawk and finally bought a 2016 Trailhawk in February of 2016.  I am extremely happy with this vehicle.  My Trailhawk came equipped with the 2.4 liter four cylinder and nine speed transmission. When city driving just put  it in "" sport mode"" and the four banger performs well with higher revs. When highway driving put it in automatic mode and I am getting 31 mpg on the highway(awesome). I have gone off road and this is where the Trailhawk really shines.The Trailhawk is exceptional on dirt and sand and on hills (ascending/descending). I am really impressed by how stable the Trailhawk feels when off road.  By the way, I get many compliments on how great the Trailhawk looks. Most people don't recognize it as a Cherokee until they take a close look.  It seems Jeep has made the perfect SUV for me and my family. I handed down the 2008 Jeep Liberty to my 18 year old son and he is happy with it. I look forward to the day when I can hand down this Trailhawk to my younger 11 year old son. Keep up the good work.

I purchased the trailhawk with the 3.2L engine and with all the upgraded packages. I test drove the 2.4L and that model was sluggish. This is the reason I went with the larger engine.

Overheated and blew thermostat, leaking anti freeze liquid, with only $75000.00 , this was covered under warranty. Does not hold its value at all.

Needless to say my driveway has been a mess a lot of the winter and the Compass has never been stuck.  I have confidence that it will plow through.  The reviews say that the Compass is not a ""true Jeep"", but my driveway is rutted and graveled and very much off road and the Compass has peformed well. (actually as well or better than my 4X4 Pickup)  Safety features are also great! My wife and son are the principal drivers and I have confidence they are protected.  ",4.375

A smaller SUV with good fuel economy. Also a lifetime and I mean lifetime powertrain warranty. This vehicle rides better and drives better than my last SUV (Ford Explorer). You can tell it's a Jeep by the extra safety features like ESP and anti-roll mitigation. Everyone that likes small SUV's should buy this model.

Applying gradual pressure to electronic speed control pedal will give you the best acceleration. From take-offs and passing you will notice a difference. And for added speed try running RPMs up and then back off a little on ESCP. This is an analog input devise with no direct connection to throtle valves.

I had some condensation issues in the daytime running light and felt somewhat let down as far as build quality goes. I was not expecting to have these kinds of issues this early. Of course, Jeep fixed the light under warranty. Fast forward a year, and I have to admit to liking this vehicle quite a bit. The fit and finish are good, there are no squeaks or rattles, and everything is working well. The 4-wheel drive capability is nothing short of astonishing. You will not find another vehicle in this class that has a fraction of the off-road capability of the Compass. If that’s at all important to you, then you’ve really only one choice at this size. I absolutely love the rugged styling and I receive many positive comments from random people in parking lots. If I have one complaint, and it’s a big one, it’s the terrible reluctance of the 9-speed to downshift. The transmission is programmed for EPA estimates and not spirited driving. I get around the issue by doing a lot of “manual” shifting with the auto-stick. It’s a little frustrating that Jeep doesn’t add a sport mode for better transmission performance. I’d sacrifice a couple of MPG to not have to manually downshift so often. I keep hoping that Jeep will offer a software update to the transmission to make it less lazy on the downshifts. Come on, FCA! You have the technology and you’d put a lot of smiles on Compass owners’ faces. That said, I really do like this vehicle and believe that its positives easily outweigh its negatives.",4

I opted for undercoating, was given a loaner which was brand new and exact model and it was great. Not so with the one I purchased. Put 400 miles on both  the loaner and my car. I CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE!  The car I got has issues with driver door panel warpage, wind noise/cabin  noise  and engine/exhaust noise, none present in the  loaner vehicle. I could not swap them out.. The gas mileage stinks. 16-17 mpg when advertised average is 25mpg.  The muffler is getting noisier and it is brand new. Heard there is a recall on it but nothing official yet. The dealer is evasive and is just plain lying about the noise issues. Not done pursuing remedies with the dealership or Jeep Chrysler. I hope to get some resolution.   I am just sick about this. I  am disabled and being taken advantage of. The Chrysler Jeep people are helping me with this, but the dealer is ""independently owned and operated"", which I have heard 100 times.

First of all, I'm a long time Jeep user, around 12 of them over the years, so I considered gas millage when shopping for my new Jeep. The Trail Hawk Compass I purchased gets over 30 MPG HWY when driven with MPG in mind. What I mean is no heavy acceleration when passing or climbing hills, just ease into any acceleration scenario. At any rate, I've read reviews where folks complain about the acceleration, but one has to get used to pushing the accelerator with this new Compass. Believe me, if you punch the gas this thing is plenty peppy, it's just a matter of getting used to how much to gas it. They have installed a 4 cylinder engine for good MPG so getting used to the 9 speed transmission and how to punch the pedal takes a while, but this thing has plenty of pep. Also, I don't understand why folks complain about the stop/start feature that the compass boasts.... It works perfectly for fuel savings and can be turned off at the press of a button.... I love my compass and for the MPG I get I'd say it's a great vehicle for any type of travel outside pulling a heavy trailer load, but isn't that why they make trucks? I purchased a factory lifetime bumper to bumper warranty for $3,500, so warranty options are a huge plus. Take a chance on the Compass and enjoy its great sound system, comfort (for SUV), stylish looks, and killer interior, you won't be sorry.",5

The Detailing in the interior with it curves and chrome accent gives it a solid expensive look and attention to detail look. Everything appears to be laid out perfectly. Best handing car I have drove so far. Very smooth ride on highway, and excellent on turns. Lot of technology and electronics in this car. Too soon to see how they all hold up. Very stylish exterior with nice curves with no wind noise. This is my first 4 cylinder car, and I have to say I am impressed! Power and acceleration is just enough even with 5 people in the car. I don’t know why people are complain about this, lets get real, this is not a sports car where you going to feel a gravity pull when you gun it. I think it’s plenty for a 4 cylinder and size of the vehicle. I am averaging 20 MPG, I kind of expecting a bit more since its rated 23 city and 30 highway.

Just leased it a week ago 4x4 latitude with all the gadgets etc. Anyway, I was driving down a busy street and It was a red light so the ""start stop"" system which turns off the engine at stop lights to save fuel started working (You can turn it off by hitting a button everytime you get in the car, but is that really the solution to hope this never happens again). Normally, this system has worked fine. HOWEVER, as I felt the engine turn off, all of a sudden, the car went CRAZY. The parking brake was on and I couldn't turn it off, the wheel wouldn't move, the gears would shift but they flashed, the screen turned on and off, and I COULD'NT TURN THE CAR OFF. I was sitting in the middle of a busy one way street on a green light, people were honking, and I couldn't move. I was stuck and couldn't do anything about it. I tried to hold the push to start button down but to no avail, my car WOULD NOT MOVE NOR RESTART. I was sitting in the road for about 10 minutes freaking out and about to call AAA. It was like the car was off, but it was on. Cars wouldn't move around me so it might even be possible that the emergency lights that I turned on weren't even on. Suddenly I tried the on button again and it worked. So I turned the car around and gave it to a dealer and explained my problem. They said it would be done in a day. TWO WEEKS LATER, I still do not have my car. No one could figure out what was wrong with it. They told me since the car was so ""new' (It came out in feb and it's July) that they didn't have the technology to figure out what the problem was. The had to call Chrysler who STILL hasn't send over the parts. It was a computer problem, but it took them a week to figure that out, when I told them that the first day. I am very upset that a new car would just stop working like that and I could do nothing about. The dealership and even the own JEEP company didn't know anything. It's scary to think that when they get the replacement part they are going ""to fix it"" but yet they couldn't even figure out what was wrong with my car. Before leasing this car I checked what people had to say about it, and not once did someone say it stopped working. Well that happened to me and I want everyone to be aware before they think about the New Jeep Compass. (By the way the replacement courtesy vehicle they gave me was NOT sufficient at all. It was a base model with no backup camera, no blind spot, and no automatic headlights. The vehicle I brought in was equipt with everything, even a sun/moon roof. It would be nice if they gave me a car to drive that was somewhere close to that. If I had brought in an SRT Jeep GC would they give me a Dodge Dart?)",1

One blind spot is the front windshield pillars. The pillars create a momentary obstruction to pedestrians crossing the pillars..  be vigilant!!  That said, other models have similar obstructions.  2) As is common with this genre of vehicle, the vision to the rear both left and right is limited.  Jeep needs to include blind spot monitoring in all levels  of the New Compass, not only as an option.  However I would purchase the option in a moment if I could do it over again.  The New Compass provides a solid feel and ride, which is important to me.   Getting used to the shift points on my six speed manual (which I opted for) is a normal learning curve.

It was very cute, very cost efficient and I loved the fact that I could get a Jeep product for that price.. I am now regretting it.          1.) I had the car a few months and something in the transmission slipped and came loose. It was fine when I would put it in reverse to back out of my drive way or parking spot but when I would put it in Drive, it wouldn't actually go into drive. I would have to Put it in park and then put it back into drive a few times. I was not very happy considering that is not safe.           2.) I complained a few times about the transmission because of the ""Whining"" noise that it made when I got off the gas. I was told by service department that it was just the CVT transmission that was making the noises and that it was ""normal and that there was nothing they could do.""         3.) When I reached about 25,000 miles, the brakes started squealing. Brakes shouldn't have to be replaced with that low of miles. I went ahead and had them replaced to see if the squealing would stop. We have had them cleaned and scuffed and it still squeals. All other reviews that I have read has the brakes squealing in Reverse but mine only does it in Drive. I took it to the dealership to have them look at it and We were told that there was nothing they could do to make the squealing stop. It would be a continuous problem that couldn't be corrected due to the fact that there is disc brakes in the front and drum in the rear. With the drums, the brake dust doesn't have anywhere to do. So now every time I take it to have the oil changed and tires rotated, I have to tell them to clean and scuff the brakes while it is in their possession.     4.) Don't expect to get up to full speed very fast. Since this is only a 4CYL, it seems to have problems getting up to speed as any other 4cyl's I have drove.

So far I'm happy even though I loved my fun punchy Kia. I decided to get a new 2015 instead of the current year model (better warranty and discounted price.) I have the 2.4ltr 5spd manual FWD. I have already taken the car on two 200 mile round trips to Vegas. It handled great and was a comfortable ride. After a few times driving I had the shifting dialed in. The clutch is a soft clutch. I was expecting it to be a lot stiffer, but happy it wasn't. As someone else mentioned, it's not a Porsche. I get good acceleration with enough power to get up to speed and move through traffic. I did notice that very steep hills it did require downshifting (to 4th) if under 55 in some cases, but that's why I wanted a manual. I hated ""putting my foot in it"" just to get the Kia to go sometimes. The Kia paddle shifting is a joke. The Compass handles speeds up to at least 85 with no problems at all.  I'm sure it can handle more, I just haven't pushed it yet since it's still new. There's plenty of pedal left for accelerating. The ride is smooth and fairly quiet. Braking is smooth and not grabby like my Kia which makes me, hubby and our dog happy. The only thing I miss is some of the technology the Kia had. I have to use my mp3 player instead of having an internal storage built into my radio. The ""miles till empty"" and ""miles per gallon"" features were nice on my Kia as well. Keyless entry (will be installing aftermarket soon) and power windows are missing on the Compass too. There's a good bit more room in the Compass and it does ""sit up"" a little higher which I really like.",4
662, on 05/27/16 20:17 PM (PDT),Mike McGantic ,2015 Jeep Compass SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Jeep should be ashamed!," I have never written a review for an automobile and do not do so frivolously.I recently rented a Jeep Compass for two weeks. It had 8,000 miles on it and was relatively new.Let me start by saying that this is by far the worst vehicle I have ever driven. When getting in the car you are instantly jarred at how poor the visibility from the driver's seat is.The most troubling aspect of the vehicle is the acceleration power. I have driven Hyundai cars with more power. The engine is totally inadequate for this size vehicle.I would go so far as to say that this vehicle should not be legal for driving on highways.If you are in a situation when you need power, it will not be there.The steering is also very shaky at speeds over 60 and great concentration and focus is necessary to keep the vehiclegoing straight. Driving this is very much a chore and it is not a vehicle that you want to take out unless absolutely necessary.The instrumentation is a joke and is a sad feat for American engineering.In any case, whatever you do, do not buy this vehicle.",1
663, on 01/27/16 09:00 AM (PST),J G ,2015 Jeep Compass SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),The little Jeep that couldnt....," So I got stuck renting this ""SUV"". I have never liked Jeep. Never had the aspirations of buying one. When the first told me this is what I'd be driving my ears perked up.... Maybe I was wrong... It was a 16 model so I assumed it was going to be nice. Yeah...no. I first got into it and instantly got transported back to the ""Stone Age"" with the most sub-par interior I've ever seen (in a 2012 and newer). I told myself ""It's only for a few days, you'll live"". About didn't. Upon leaving the rental place, the car switched from Auto to bump shift manual. Not gonna lie, scared the crap out of me when you're on a busy 4 lane. Back in automatic I start to accelerate. Thought the car was going to die. Now I own a FRS so I was used to a little bit of get-up-and-go. This was more like get-up-and-go die in a hole. In my opinion there is no excuse in such a poor quality vehicle. I think I would drive an Aztek over it. At least the Aztek came with the fold out tent. With seats the make you feel like your sitting on Play-Doh, a dash and center console straight from the 90's (minus Satellite radio), the acceleration of a 2-legged turtle, the comfort of a bed with only a boxspring, the ride like you felt as if your on a surface equivalent to bubble wrap, the amount of blind spots to make Ray Charles jealous....Sorry Jeep, in my opinion this is a failure...only gave 1 Star because 0 wasn't an option.",1
664, on 10/12/15 16:39 PM (PDT),Alan Parks ,2015 Jeep Compass SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Worst Rental Ever," I had a Jeep Compass 2015 for two weeks and it was just bad. I picked the Jeep over others in the line I could choose from mainly because I had always want a Jeep  and it was white colored, I figured in the AZ heat a light colored car would be cooler than the dark colored ones.The first thing I noticed was that I sat very low to the ground for a SUV. My Tucson sits higher. You also sit low in the car, at 5'6"" I could not see over the windshield wipers to see the hood. The wipers also took up a lot of real estate on the windshield.The next thing was the shirfter just wan't straight from park to drive or drive to park, you had to go right and around each gear, that drove me nuts for two weeks.3rd the Jeep is VERY bad at accelorating, getting into traffic was dangerous. If you stepped on the gas be prepared to wait a few seconds 3-5 at least for it to go.4th Poor rear cargo space, again my Tucson is much better.5th small gas tank and average or below fuel economy.6th The rear door handles are vertical and not horizonal like most cars, what a pain that was. The sit high near the window.7th Poor storage in the passenger area, not seat pockets. Although I will say the center console was OK.8th Parking was again just ok.9th Slanted dash means nothing could be placed on it, like a GPS with out falling down.10th The damn seat belt chimer would charm non stop even if the passenger un buckled their belt for a few minutes.I would not buy one.",1
665, on 08/27/15 19:50 PM (PDT),Jeff ,2015 Jeep Compass SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Holy Blind Spots Batman!," OK, I don't own this Compass, so I can't speak much for the reliability, longevity or maintenance, but I had one as a rental on a business trip. I was actually a little excited to drive it, because Jeeps are generally great cars to drive. It took me about 5 minutes to despise this car. I was switching lanes on the drivers side and I realized this is the least safe car I have ever driven. When I looked over my shoulder, all I saw were headrests (front and rear) and that gigantic rear column. And the side mirrors were no help. I couldn't see anything. I have honestly had better visibility in U-Haul trucks. Crap visibility does not stop there. I was backing up out of a parking spot in my hotel. And all of a sudden I see a couple with their baby come out from behind. I could not see them. I am lucky I was already weary of the visibility, or I could have hit them. This is flat out a dangerous car. On top of that, there is horrible storage in the front of this car. Nothing in the bottom of the dash, side door storage is as bad as I have ever seen. I couldn't even put the paperwork from my rental in them all folded up. Maybe Jeep just figured people would just put that stuff on the dash, because it is way too long. Technology is pretty darn dated. This base model had no Bluetooth, no USB hookup, No satellite, but it did have an aid input though, so I guess they are finally catching up with 2007. No steering wheel controls either, what car doesn't come with those nowadays?  Hell, this Compass didn't even have a compass. It even had one of those old school antennas on the front; my '03 Outback has more advanced antenna technology. Braking is lackluster at best. I always felt like I was coming in hot when I was taking a turn. I felt like I had to slam on the brakes to get them to react. I do give them props for driver comfort though. I had a couple decently long drives on the trip and I was very comfortable.The drivetrain was not bad. Whine seemed very peppy for an I-4 2.2L in a larger vehicle. Transmission was not bad at all. A little weak in low gear, but great above 20 MPH. This was surprisingly stable car. We hit major rain storms on the way back to the airport (those big Florida storms) and it was pretty darn windy, and I felt no push from the wind. Although I could barely see in front of me (certainly not behind me). All those niceties don't matter, the lack of visibility is a hazard, I would never recommend anyone to buy this car, I don't want to see them or someone else hurt because you can't see anything. Jeep should pull this car off the road.",1
666, on 08/27/15 10:49 AM (PDT),Michelle Sams ,2015 Jeep Compass SUV Altitude Edition 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Sick of noisy Jeep," Our experience has been terrible. We bought a 2015 Jeep Compass Latitude in January. It has 4 wheel drive, moon roof, automatic with capability to drive as manual. Our issues have been the following. Navigation didn't work 2nd week over owning it. They replaced it, works now. Next week as I back up you can hear high pitch noise.(like when your brakes are going out) We took it in 5 different times. And overtime after we have picked up still the noise. Especially if you have put the emergency brake on and then try reversing. Now it has been making the noise as I stop. We have been given the excuse of humidity. The current line we are given is all Jeep Compass makes this noise. (Something we didn't know before the purchase). Wondering if anyone else is having these issues? Because to date mine still makes this terrible noise.",1
667, on 04/05/15 07:19 AM (PDT),brian228 ,2015 Jeep Compass SUV High Altitude Edition 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Don't listen to the critics!," We have had our 2015 Compass High Altitude for 6 months and are very pleased with it. First of all it was a great value-$25,599.00 out the door. This model includes leather and moonroof. We find the ride to be compliant and composed. It is surprisingly quiet and when going 65-70 on interstates it's all good. A couple of minor complaints- first, there is no auto lamp feature so have to remember to turn on headlights when it starts to get dark. Also the six-speed transmission sometimes delays shifting into 6th gear longer than seems necessary. Overall we are very satisfied so far. We live on a rural gravel road and it has been great in the mud  and also in snowy slippery conditions.  Update April, 2017-- 40186 miles:    Still very satisfied with the Compass - no mechanical issues whatsoever. Front brake pads will need replacing soon, rear pads still good.  My wife and I both are super happy with the radio and heater/ventilation controls - simple knobs and buttons, no touch screens!  We have a Buick Verano and can't believe why anyone likes a touchscreen or why manufacturers even make such a thing- they are very inconvenient and dangerous. We plan on putting another 40,000 miles on this Compass before replacing it and fully expect it to provide dependable  service.  April 7, 2018 - mileage is now 58,000 and still no problems. The front brake pads were replaced at 42000 miles by owner at a total cost of $35.00. This has been the only out of pocket costs other than regularly scheduled maintainence",4

After driving it for a while I started to be very disappointed by most of features of the car It is like an old car once you press the gas . It makes the noise of a tired grandpa and the noise is loud ! .Poor acceleratin , lack of space for the driver and bad adjustment of driving seat .No real storage at all in the car . The door side pockets are for the birds and the back of the seats have no pockets . There is just a minimal storage box in between the chairs . You can store few things .The trunk has no dividers for anything so your goods goes from right to left and all other directions .

I was expecting cheap and thrashy, and instead it's smooth, quiet and very composed. Soaks up bumps. Firm, supportive seats. Interior is not nearly as cheap as some of the reviews would lead you to think. I mean, lighted cupholders, cruise control and Jeep floormats on a car I paid $13K for brand new! The plastics are soft enough in most places, a decent quality vibe.Update after 1.5 years: I don't drive much, but it's city driving. In that context the pluses and minuses include (pluses) nice turning radius, responsive controls, perfect size, very useful cargo-wise, firm suspension, great ground clearance, easy to park. (Minuses) a bit too firm on washboard surfaces, watch the tire pressure since if too low the abs gets wonky. No real problems to report. I think this is the perfect city car: good size for driving with decent cargo capacity. Great visibility. Gas mileage OK for the capability of vehicle. I get an honest 30mpg on freeway, but I do mostly city and get around 22. After 1.5 years of parking on the street and driving over potholes the Compass is still tight and responsive. Really glad I didn't get a bigger or heavier car; this one is perfect.",4

Had several white knuckle moments while driving caused by a faulty drivers door switch sending intermittent error signals to the ECU causing it to run, drive and shift erratically.  Drivers door panel accidentally damaged while replacing that switch and after nearly 2 months of being on back order; the wrong one was sent.  After nearly 3 months, the door panel has been finally replaced but it only makes the noises from all the other panels in the vehicle more pronounced.  High beams flash nearly every time turning on the left turn signal but was told that it was operating as designed.  Radio seizes multiple times nearly everyday.  Auto-stop feature has a mind of its own by turning off not even half the time it should.  Idles very rough occasionally especially after auto-stopping several times as if stalling.  It is 2018 and it barely gets 22 miles to the gallon for fuel economy; seriously...my smaller engined, turbo-charged sports car gets better gas mileage using premium.  The shifter can be easily knocked or bumped into manual.  Everything being controlled by an digital display that seizes all the time makes you thank the engineer that put a voice command button because without it, you may as well not even have air conditioning.  You can hear the front doors moving within the frames on the gaskets when driving as if the mounting is weak or insufficient.  Carplay often stops music while driving and causes major distractions.  The only thing that is consistently good about this Jeep is the dealership that services my Jeep staff.",2

I purchased it from Jeep Freehold. The service at the facility is excellent and professional. Darrell Williams is an excellent dealer and listens to his clients questions and concerns. The car drives great and is smooth on the road. The interior and exterior design is perfect for someone who is looking for a suv feel but not a huge suv. The car's fuel economy could be better but thats a sacrifice most have to make when purchasing a SUV. The car feels great driving as it feels like you are driving a sporty heavy duty car but it drives so smooth. I opted to lease the car because I can't see myself owning the car for a long-term - primarily because of its poor fuel economy.

I recommend getting the safety package with blind spot monitoring and rear traffic alerts.  That option is available at a reasonable price, without having to move up to the Limited model.

AWD SUV under $25k in most cases but you get what you pay for. The seats are extremely uncomfortable due to design (although the design is very appealing to the eye). The bucket leans back too far and the head rest stick too far forward placing the spine at an awkward angle pushing the head forward. There is no room for a standard infant car seat in the cabin unless both front riders move seats essentially into the dashboard.... thus an uncomfortable ride for passengers when going long distances. Im not particularly a fan of the auto off feature to save gas on this gas guzzler. I need to refill every 4 days to cover the same distance I drove in my much larger Tuscon which didn't need filling until every 8-10 days.  The exterior design is quite sleek and comparable to the Grand Cherokee at a fraction of the price. Some models have cargo mats that change the sleek look. The Uconnect app is not available for many 2018 which sucks for remote start during the colder days.  This car isn't going to blow your mid on performance and probably isnt the most comfortable for long distance drives but the design is magnificent,  the  reliability is great and price is amazing.",4

The first time the 4x4 had a issue I was driving in the snow and a loud banging noise started coming from under the vehicle. The dealer ""fixed it"" 2 weeks later it happened again this time they stated that its a known problem with the rear axle engagement with the 4x4 system that causes the driveshaft to strike the undercarriage of the vehicle. I was told there was no repair available yet and they did not know when one would be available however it was safe to drive. 2 days later the issue happened again however this time the rear axle locked up causing me to loose control of the vehicle and nearly miss a accident. At the time of this review the dealer was trying to find a fix with Jeep and the part of Jeep that handles Lemon law initially contacted me and has since been unreachable as they refuse to provide real names, email addresses or direct phone numbers.

Most people need to remember, for WHAT IT IS, this is a good vehicle! Compact, but handles great, the 4 cylinder does quite well for a 4 cylinder, and I've had no issues with the 9 speed as of yet. Doesn't have a cheap feel, everything seems layed out well, and it is a sharp vehicle. In the week I've owned mine, I've taken on dry pavement, heavy rains, and a snowstorm that dumped over 6 inches of snow in a matter of hours. I've even hit pretty sizeable potholes and barely noticed them. The 4x4 system is remarkable, it feels stable anywhere (although I have yet to go off-road... But I'll bet I will!) Mine has quite a few creature comforts including heated seats and steering wheel, remote start, a whole list of other options, and one of the larger screened media centers, as well as upgraded wheels, and was still under $30K. The interior isn't cramped for me at all (I'm 6'1"") and is comfortable. I even sat in the back seat, plenty of leg room. It's not the largest or most powerful SUV out there, but it doesn't claim to be. It is what it is...

It started shaking in the floor board and steering wheel. Was told that time that one of my tires was defective. They replaced it. Shaking was still persistent. Brought it back a week later (thank god I have a RELIABLE 2014 Chevy Cruze to drive in the meantime), they told me they didn't feel any shaking. This was after it was there for 3 days and all they put was 5 miles on it. I couldn't figure out how they would have went on the highway and back in 5 miles. The highway was 5 miles away to get on it. I was so upset that I decided to bring it to another Jeep dealer. This time they felt the shaking. They told me it was an issue with the tire balance so they did a balance and a test drive. Said it was fine and I picked it up the next day. Driving to work and there goes the shaking again, but worse. Called the dealership again and they told me to bring it in. They took another test drive and confirmed the shaking. They took the tires off and said my brakes we missing bolts and my tires we all defective. Had to wait for an adjuster for the dealership and they agreed to replace all tires and bolts for the brakes. They took it for another text drive yesterday and now it's not shaking until they brake. Was told the need to keep it again and it's not safe to drive until they figure out what's going on. Would not recommend the Compass or the first dealership where I bought it from. They should have inspected the vehicle before it was sold and obviously they NEVER did.",1

I love the way this Compass drives and gets through heavy snow excellent. I have a 70mile drive round trip to work and home and I am very comfortable in this Jeep sit up high and straight and seats curve your body just right. So  far mpg is ok not great so far avg around 26 to 30 on highway I'm not easy on the accel and most of time cruise is set at 71 to 76. Some have complained of 9 speed but I have not experienced any concerns at all when driving a round town or hwy., mine may be later model build with proper software updates new vehicles in last 3 -4 years seem to have updates all the time just ask your dealer if any can be performed when bring in for oil change. Love the looks to have not really went off roading per say but that is not why I bought the Trailhawk model I bought it because it looks cool. Look I test drove other makes of this size SUVS and they all just seemed a little boring look all cars have there problems some a bit more than others but they are all fairly equal to each other so I do expect to bring any car I own into the shop once in awhile I have owned many different manufacture vehicles and they all had to have some repairs and or maintenance, after all they are name by imperfect human beings.

697, on 12/24/17 18:20 PM (PST),Casey ,2018 Jeep Compass SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Confident on/off roader," 1st off we(my wife and I) live in northern maine where we get ALOT of snow. At the time we owned a 2015 jeep compass fwd  with a standard transmission. Which for us was ok. We put 48000 miles on it with very little issues. Loved that thing. However, we recently moved where the roads aren't plowed as often and needed something better when we woke up and there was over a foot of snow on the ground. Ive had my eye on the new redesign compass since it came out. So one day on my way to work I saw a tractor trailer 8ler drive by with a BRIGHT ORANGE and black trailhawk dangling off the back. I followed it to the local chrysler dealership and took photos and sent it to my wife. She immediately fell in love. Fast forward al and we've put almost 4000 miles on it and love it. No, it's not the fastest vehicle out there. But that's not why we bought it. We love where everything is about a half hour away. So it's a combo of highway/city. Mostly rural. I get about 26 mpg with it. Which I find is decent. Maybe if they put the 2.0 turbo in a couple years it'll be a better performer. For the winter we put a set of Nokian studded tires and this thing is a BEAST. I'm not a fan of the factory falken tires, but not much is out there in the size. so will be changing them out come spring.  We dont really plan on taking it crazy offroading but its really nice for the snow which...is half thr year. The interior is very nice, soft black leather, red stitching. Heated seats power seats and heated steering wheel. Stereo system is AWESOME!!! sounds excellent and Bluetooth works flawlessly. Buttons on the steering wheel work great and are very easy to use. We get complements on this EVERYWHERE we go. 4wd system works great. As far as start stop, I see people complaining, if you don't like it? Hit the button. So pros: looks awesome, rides great, great stereo and infotaiment system, 4wd works great. Cons: could use a little more power which would help fuel economy.  But really if it wasn't for that it'd be 5 stars from me.",4

They ask me to leave the jeep overnight because it was not legal to drive it with the CLUSTER problem it had. It's been 6 weeks and I still don't have my jeep yet I'm making monthly payments and insurance payments.

The 1st issue was that the radio display was HOT to touch. It startled me terribly. Just to make sure, I went to touch it again, but that wasn't necessary because I could feel the heat radiating from it. 2nd issue was that the language kept changing from English to french on its own (odd I know). I thought I might of touch something and changed it but no that wasn't the case. 3rd issue is the auto/stop function symbol kept coming up on the dashboard. When I first called the dealership (Garden City Jeep in NY) with these issues , I was told to refer to the owners manual...really?? I brought the vehicle in to the service department and they had to order a new radio from the manufacturer and they were not sure why the auto/stop signal was on and they did not know how to resolve the issue (that sure is reassuring). As of this review I have brought that vehicle to be serviced 2x and I have only had it for a month. In addition, the car does not have a smooth acceleration (feels like it pulling or working overtime) and the auto/stop function is pretty abrupt and loud. I know this is not a luxury vehicle but it could be a little less obvious. The joke is when I brought the vehicle in for service their was a new owner there with the same vehicle and the Auto/Stop function stopped working completely on their vehicle, and they had it for only 2 weeks. Pros: its a pretty vehicle and the interior is roomy for a smaller SUV. I am requesting a new lease vehicle because I refuse to keep wasting mileage, time and mental space on a vehicle that is suppose to be issue free, I mean come on its a 2018 model. I highly suggest waiting until Fiat/Chrysler/Jeep iron out the kinks before leasing/selling any more. Specs: 2018 Jeep Compass Limited.",1

705, on 09/20/17 07:57 AM (PDT),NJ1 ,2018 Jeep Compass SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Great Small SUV," I've owned the 2018 Jeep Compass Limited for a little over 3 weeks now and I have to say it is a fantastic car. Some background before I jump into the pros and cons. I primarily use this vehicle for commuting, but will occasionally bring it on trails/off road. I've seen a few reviews on the new compass which I felt were a little extreme and not too accurate. If you want a basic, un-bias review continue reading.                                                                                                                          Pros: Exterior re-design - This is a sharp car. In the 3 weeks I've owned it I've received many compliments on the look. The face lift of the Compass is extremely similar to the Grand Cherokee and at a quick glance looks like an Evoque with it's two tone color format. There are a few LED light upgrades which give the car a more luxury prescience. Interior: Keep in mind this is in the small suv class, but the car is comfortable with a surprising amount of room for backseat passengers. The seats and trim also feel sturdy and well made. Not to mentioned the U-Connect system allows you to customize the lights, display themes etc. to make the interior customized to your liking. Most trims also have Apple Car Play. My trim came with a pano sunroof which is a very cool feature. Roof is all glass which passengers enjoy. Drive Comfort: This car isn't going to blow you away with performance. However, if you're simply looking for a car to get you from A to B with a little pep in it's step when needed, this car does just fine. I've driven it on highways, city streets, backroads etc. and the car has a smooth feel on all terrains. This car also allows you to change the drive setting based on terrain (Auto, Snow, Sand, Mud) Safety: The new Compass comes with 7 airbags standard. I decided to purchase the safety package which comes with lane assist, blind spot monitoring and forward collision warning.                                                                               Cons: Engine Shut Off: First time owning a car with this feature and I'm not a huge fan. Essentially when you come to a stop light and are idle for more than 5 seconds the car will shut off the engine until you take your foot off the brake. Not a big deal, and the feature CAN be turned off. Multi Air Engine Up Hill: At first acceleration up hill the multi air engine tends to rev a little higher than I'd like. Again,not a big deal but trying to point out a few things as a heads up.          Overall, if you're looking for an attractive vehicle that gives you off road capability, comfortable ride, decent performance, high tech interior with essentially any upgrade option you could think of this is a great car. If you're looking for a powerful suv with better towing capacity, spend the extra money and buy the Grand Cherokee. 9.5/10 for me.",5

(My Latitude is 9 speed auto with many other upgrades) So fun to drive, great looking in and out. The Detailing in the interior with it curves and chrome accent gives it a solid expensive look and attention to detail look. Everything appears to be laid out perfectly. Best handing car I have drove so far. Very smooth ride on highway, and excellent on turns. Lot of technology and electronics in this car. Too soon to see how they all hold up. Very stylish exterior with nice curves with no wind noise.  This is my first 4 cylinder car, and I have to say I am impressed!  Power and acceleration is just enough even with 5 people in the car.  I don’t know why people are complain about this, lets get real, this is not a sports car where you going to feel a gravity pull when you gun it. I think it’s plenty for a 4 cylinder and size of the vehicle. I am averaging 20 MPG, I kind of expecting a bit more since its rated 23 city and 30 highway. But its way much better than all my previous cars. The ""Stop start and Go"" can get annoying, however it can be disabled by a push of a button. If this car holds up as is, i just might buy it at end of my lease.  Love it!",5

Its a perfect size for me. acceleration is great if you put it in manual mode.  the a/c worked well the infortainment system was nice but had a lag in it.  the seating was roomy for the size.  the exterior is very nice looking.  I really liked everything about the car except.  the start stop technology was the worsttttttttttttttt when at a stop light engine turns off a/c goes lower and radio stayed on but got a fraction of a second turn off.  very annoying like you know something that would have been a test and not perfected and not put in the car but they did anyway!  When taking foot off break you feel the car restart and same thing.  If I was in stop go traffic I would be miserable and embarrassed if anyone was in car with me.  Thirdly how would this be in a year or 5 years down the road this car only had 900 miles on it.  The shifting is subpar also and on highway I read other reviews where people say it can be dangerous trying to accelerate (I thought they were being dramatic) they were not.  I know in order to pass of step on it it just well did'nt .  Putting it in manual mode it changed the entire thing to a very very peppy and strong feeling engine that accelerated perfectly.  SO its the 9 speed transmission not the engine.  I found the engine to be very peppy.  So bottom line ON most thruway drive 200 miles each way through virginia  I averaged 30 mpg with a/c blasting and 100 degree temps. I did not beat it just drove normal so I thought that was decent.  I am not going to buy it, I had my heart set on it but with Jeep reliability ratings and this 9 speed those really cut into the rating of this car.  Too bad jeep you always have soem great designs etc but?????",3

The vent air flow to the driver, by the vent to the right of the drivers steering wheel, is blocked by the steering wheel. How'd they miss that? If someone is hell bent on owning a Jeep buy the Cherokee. For just a few more dollars the ride, comfort, and overall experience is at least 50% better. You still get the lousy transmission but at least you have the option of a V6 (at least in the 2017's). The Cherokee tracks much better on the road also, like its on rails. The Compass, not so much -like to wander more. The interior of the Compass is like a Jeep Cherokee Mini-Me. Fits so much better in the Cherokee. I actually owned a 2015 Cherokee for two years and loved the car except for the transmission. That alone was enough to make me trade the vehicle at 50,000 miles. Maybe they get it right in the 2018 Cherokee. Anyhow.....the Compass is cute.....but you can do much better with your hard earned dollars.",2

712, on 02/06/16 07:20 AM (PST),Jeepmakemehappy ,2012 Jeep Compass SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),The Little 4x4 that Could," I have owned my Jeep Compass for a little over 1 year. I purchased my 2012 Jeep Compass after driving my Buick Enclave down the wrong road and the hill was too steep to drive it out. Yes, large towing bill. I decided to buy a 4x4. I looked at most brands. Nissan, GMC/Chevy, Ford, you name it. I was looking for comfort (I drive a lot), best gas mileage possible (from a 4x4), and overall enjoyable to work in. A sales rep called me about a trade they just made on a 2012 jeep compass. So I took it for a test-drive, after 1-mile, I did not feel any tension in my lower back and I can spend all day in and out of this jeep. It handled great, the acceleration was sluggish from take-off, but with manual options, I have compensated. Other than take-off, passing gear works great.The real test game when I had an inspection of a property with a real steep muddy driveway. It had been raining for days and the driveway was a mud puddle. Here goes nothing and a possible 400+ tow bill if I bought the wrong car. I made it down, now I have to go back up. The truth is, I never slid uphill before, I put the shift in manual, keep in it low, stepped on the gas and went up that hill like an off-road racing champ (in my own eyes). The driveway curved twice so I slide around them and made it uphill, got out of the Jeep and did my celebration dance. I have since been up and down similar roads with ease.My jeep has auto-start, Bluetooth, satellite radio, upgraded sound system, heated cloth seats, standard plug-in, Freedom package II, and a flashlight.Please do not just go by the Edmonds.com review. It has been an enjoyable, reliable vehicle, that I hope to keep around.",5

I've had it 1 year now.  I absolutely love it.  The trail rating is especially great because I drive in the mountains a lot and don't like bottoming out.   And, the MPG is about the same as my Chrysler Sebring.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it's a little sluggish upon acceleration.   The only problem I've had was a couple of times, it didn't want to start right away.   Both times, it was very cold out.",4
714, on 11/18/15 18:40 PM (PST),Sam ,2012 Jeep Compass SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Great unexpected buy," I was really looking for something a little different, but when I stumbled across a 2012 Compass, I instantly fell in love. I've been calling it my beautiful beast. The seats are slightly narrow, but that doesn't affect my comfort. Despite some of the reviews I read, I'm averaging 30+ mpg combined. It costs me 20 bucks to fill the tank and I'm good for quite awhile, but it is a manual and I'm soft footed (I generally get much higher mpg than suggested). This is my road trip/commuter car. I wanted something that would be great for everyday, plus haul the three dogs across the country when needed. I haven't been disappointed yet. ProsGood gas mileage for an SUV, Comfortable, Came with bluetooth/good speakers/sirius radio, the ride is very smooth and quiet, lots of cargo space, only regular maintenance required so far. Easy to get in and out of for taller people. Feels higher end than some of the cars I test drove.ConsThe acceleration isn't great, this certainly isn't a speedy SUV. My bluetooth randomly stops or starts (rarely), The transmission seems stiff at times, especially in first and fifth plus it slips out of first gear occasionally (it doesn't always seem to hold first in place well), The seats are narrow so if you are wider it may be uncomfortable, and my knees tap the dash when sitting regularly because I'm so tall, but if i pull the seat back then my legs aren't close enough to hold the pedals down. I wish it had automatic headlights. I don't like the design of the center console/arm rests, but that's personal preference. Overall it's perfect for what I needed, but if you are looking for industry leading gas mileage, or constant off road driving, this is definitely not the car for you. THIS IS NOT A HARDCORE STEREOTYPICAL OFF ROADING JEEP. I test drove a Nissan Versa, a Kia Soul,  a Saturn Astra, and a Ford Escape, and they all felt very cheap and noisy compared to the Compass. The Versa and Soul made me feel like I was driving a tin can, there was no substance, to the point that I didn't feel safe driving it.",4

It ""bucks"" and skips after coming to a complete stop, then pressing on the gas ped. It does this for about 300 feet, then something catches and it starts driving ok again. I brought the to the Jeep dealership in Brandon Florida, and they say that unless they can re-create the event, there's nothing they can do. The car is narrow, not roomy or comfortable.

We have two kids who fit comfortably in the back and there is ample storage room.  2011 was also the first year the new grill design came out that you see on modern Jeeps so between that and the alloy wheels, the vehicle looks really nice and stylish.  The only negative I have to say is that the interior is not top notch as there is a lot of plastic, but we did get light tan leather added for $1k which looks and feels much better than the stock cloth.

It did not hold value well at all and every time I turned around, some small part was breaking. There is a LOT of plastic on this car. And the seats are extremely cramped and uncomfortable for long drives. Very little cargo space. The power is dismal. Something is also flawed in the design to the point you have to roll all of the windows down if you roll down one window. It makes a very strange vibration if you don't.

But any way just trying to say that I'm very disappointed in this vehicle and jeep themselves,1
762, on 01/19/16 16:59 PM (PST),Jeremy Myers ,2007 Jeep Compass SUV Limited 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 5M),BUYER BEWARE," We bought my wife's 2007 jeep compass, used approximately 2 1/2 years and it hasn't ran for more then 3 or 4 months continuously without a breakdown. I fully understand the risks of buying a used car, but like most people can't possibly afford to buy a new car. This is by far the worst car I have ever owned. Not even a month after we bought it the sunroof quit working it will flip up but wont retract it acts like the tract is stuck & it wont close enough to completely seal so whenever it rains really hard the headliner gets pretty saturated around the passenger door frame. Had to replace the alternator a few months later. You can only get the correct amp alternator from the dealer which was almost $400. I'm pretty mechanically inclined and usually work on my own vehicles, generally if I don't know how to fix something I can figure it out. That in mind, the location of the alternator makes it about an 8 or 9 hour job for an ase certified mechanic. I don't have the tools, time or knowledge an ase certified mechanic does. So I took it to a retired mechanic I know & he still charged me $350 in labor (a lot cheaper then a shop would have charged). Died on my wife several times and when I showed up to get her and look at the car it starts up and runs fine. Rear wheel bearings went out a couple months ago $250 for the set and once again it is something better left to a mechanic seeing as I usually work 60 hours a week and couldn't leave the jeep down for more then a few days. $400 in labor for that one. & yesterday the fuel pump went out on her leaving her stranded once again...in 15 degree Ohio weather. At least I have a pretty good idea it's the fuel pump that or the starter. I'm going to take the starter off first and have it bench tested...anyway, fuel pump is $160 & thankfully looks fairly easy to change.The trade in value is dropping twice as fast as we can get our loan paid down. 2 months ago I checked the NADA & the trade in was $6800, I checked today and the trade is $4900. The car has no acceleration and hesitates and jerks worse then Michael Fox if you get on the accelerator (especially if you have the A/c on.) ""4 wheel drive"" is basically all wheel drive that you can turn off as there is no 4 lo or high. It's stalled on us the past few times we filled up the gas tank immediately after leaving the gas station (this is part of why I think my current problem is the fuel pump, that & I don't hear it prime when I turn the key on.) The transmission fluid fill tube has no dipstick to check the  fluid level so you have to take it to a dealer to have simple top offs. Oil changes take forever, due to the design of the oil fill port limiting flow. My Honda has more cargo room & the trunk then this crossover. On the freeway changing lanes is near impossible due to the design of the rear window creating giant blind spots on both sides, especially the passenger side.The only thing I can say positive about the car is the interior is well thought out and comfortable the gauges are nice and there's plenty of leg and head room. The factory stereo sounds really nice. Needless to say the cons outweigh the pros and I cannot wait to get this thing fixed once again and trade it in on anything else",2

Purchased it 3 years ago used with 43,000 miles on it. I  purchased it for $6000 and thats because it had been my brothers and he was buying new car. He had only had it for 2 years and all problems seemed to have started once it became mine, go figure! It has been in the shop more than ANY other vehicle I have ever owned. Over $3000 worth of repairs thus far. I have had front end work done multiple times, ball joints tie rods etc... throttle control problems, power steering pump problems and so many more that out of sheer frustration at the moment I cant even remember the rest! I have been told that framework on rear end is completely shot. Rusted out and unsafe to drive. I live in upstate NY and am use to driving in horrible winter conditions and because of frame problems I have handling issues and slide all over the place on roads with even the tiniest amount of snow on them while going 20mph!! From my research, all of these problems are typical of this vehicle and it looks like the most expensive fix is going to be the current framework problem. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR!!!!

Those years, I had my car in the shop more than it was on the road. The entire front end broke, I had to replace the control arms three times, the wheel pulled to the left no matter how many times I got alignments or my steering checked, the glue holding in the headlights gave out and I replaced the driver's side headlight twice, plus the fuel economy sucked. I filled up about every two days. The material of the seats were of poor quality and got easily stained. In my opinion, I found the backseats comfortable.My Compass was recently totaled due to hitting a deer. Sadly, I was not going fast, under 10, and it it pushed everything under the hood back and caused major damage. As far as I am concerned, I will never buy another Compass and am leery of Jeeps in general now.",2

I've had it for 2 years now with 34K miles on it.  I travel often to Texas from Iowa and have no issues. ,5

The fuel economy is what attracted me to this vehicle initially.  After I bought it I quickly found out that the posted MPG were very WRONG.

It could be the fact that they transmission they put in the vehicle is not serviceable as in you can't even have fluid added( was told this by a lady in the service department at the dealership)or could it be that the awful squealling sound when you go in reverse and use your brakes is only fixable by going 40mph and slamming on your brakes, or that I only have one more turn on the rotars and it's already warping again.

I have had both tie-rod ends replaced under warranty and the front brakes which I had to pay for. Items that you normally don't have problems with under 30,000 miles.

For instance the new sealed six speed transmission is outstanding as opposed to the CVT of the past. The 2.4L engine is responsive, quiet and powerful enough, vs. the older 2.0L. The front seats are good looking and supportive.The car hugs the road and performs straight and true with no hesitation. The upgraded sound system is wonderful. The only negatives I can find are the broken plastic seat surrounds,  the hard plastic dash, and the vision blocking pillars in the four corners. Also, the interior could use more storage cubbies like those in my daughter's older CR-V. All in all I  love driving the car and I'm happy that it was assembled in the USA by union labor.

I wanted a Compass True North but Jeep does not build one, just for the auto shows.  So I purchased my Compass 2.4, six speed auto,4x4. Using the spec's found for the True North, I built one.  I added the two inch lift kit and added a performance intake.  This is the best SUV I have ever had.  I truly love driving the Compass.  For those who complain that the engine is sluggish, a performance intake will fix the issue without effecting gas mileage. The lift kit is for better off-roading.

Picked up the car one evening, didn't do anything but drive home 5 miles.Woke up the next morning and the remote access buttons on the key did not work, used the key, got in, started the car and the radio wasn't working either.All kinds of similar issues.I'm sure that can be fixed but the biggest problem is the engine/powertrain.The vehicle does terrible when you try to accelerate to change lane or merge, pulls to the point of almost losing control. I drove a '12 Escape with a 2.5 engine, much more powerful engine. Well I was sent an email today (2/4/17) to update my review.  I no longer have the Compass, I have a 2017 Ford Escape.  It's got a 1.5 liter EcoBoost engine (essentially a turbo, not sure why they call it EcoBoost) .  Anyway this little car hauls you know what, well at least compared to the Compass.  It accelerates great and takes hills without crying!    Car is also much more solidly put together.  The Compass door was very light and felt cheap so did the interior.  The Escape feels a lot more sturdy.  While I'm not a huge fan of the exterior of the Escape, I thought the previous models looked like a truck, the newer model doesn't know if it wants to be an SUV, CUV or Mini Van.

I tried the CVT and waited for the 6-speed; I'm glad I did. I drove the 2.0 engine and it was too weak, but the 2.4 is fine. And the 6-speed is a big improvement over the CVT. It has plenty of room- front and back- for a small vehicle. I compared the Escape, RAV4, Subaru, Mitsubishi, and others, including the Dart, Focus, and Avenger. ",4.625

858, on 04/01/16 00:36 AM (PDT),Emile Gauvin ,2009 Jeep Compass SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Heartache with Chrysler," I had an Intrepid which required a fair amount of front end suspension parts and accepted this because of the design of the car (front-end heavy and so on)  when we purchased the Compass one thing that returned was front end part issues and lots of them, started at 20,000 kilometers.  Because front-end issues can cause havoc with tires and steering in general, I like to have this in top shape, but it is a never-ending issue every time it goes in for regular service.  It still goes on today with the most recent lower control arms being replaced for the second time before 100,000 kilometers.  At 25,000 kilometers we started having the sun roof leak into the car.  Being told that the drain lines in the roof needed cleaning periodically seemed a problem because you really don't know when this can happen.  You tube had ways that people gave up with Chrysler and came up with their own solution although extensive it dealt with a lot of modifications to the drain line and this meant taking parts of the interior off.  Then, the front driver's side pan just in front and the back would fill with water - up to 2 inches of water, no rhyme or reason, cleaned this out several times before the dealership finally gave up on the issue of the drain lines and found a body molding without the proper seal in place.  The drain lines are still an issue but instead of paying $126 to have these blown out with compressed air, I do it myself. The last thing to go wrong is the K frame when the lower control arms were being replaced.  The place where I have my maintenance done on the Jeep now has a mechanic that used to work for a Chrysler dealership and alerted me to the fact that the K frame is rotting and that I seek out the dealership warranty, should there be one.  Right now I'm staring at $500 getting it done myself or $900 through the dealership - not even 100,000 K on the vehicle!The only good thing I have to say about the Jeep is in the snow, you cannot beat it, it is a tank with Blizzaks for tires.  However, when we get a wet snow/rain and it freezes, the doors will not latch after opening, major problem since the only way to rectify this issue is to leave the vehicle heat-up, with it not locked (not good!)So, we are getting rid of the Jeep soon.  All of the review of this and also the fact that there is always some sort of hassle with Chrysler has made the decision of what to purchase next, which does not include any type of Chrylser product what-so-ever!",1

Engine good and quiet, no rattles or noises, no false starts. No faults detected, interior build better than other models such as 08 Liberty. Great ride handling, good sound insulation. Tested 4x4 on muddy access trail, no undercarriage hits, good ground clearance for model. All in all a very good purchase for the dollar and only real 4x4 offered with 5spd in this price range.

I AM GLAD THAT I DID NOT RELY ON THOSE REVIEWS! Complaints lodged against the 08 Compass have been rectified in 09:  the interior has been redesigned and looks great, the additional noise dampening makes the vehicle ride quietly and the transmission is smooth. This thing is fun to drive and has a lot of pickup for a 4 cyl. engine. I was looking for a 6 cyl. vehicle but this one won me over after a test drive. Fuel economy is good and the price is fantastic. I personally love the look of the vehicle-as long as it is red, blue or orange-the other colors make the vehicle look long (my opinion).

I am just bewildered as to how any educated consumer would consider this vehicle as doing very minimal research.   If your considering the buying the Compass, just test drive a Rav4 and CRV and compare the vehicles.

Coming from a 2004 Tracker, it was a big change (mostly positive). I really like the layout, fit and finish and features of the car, but like everyone else I found it under powered, most notably on steep mountain roads. However, I learned to drive it anyway. One thing I did was to get it up to 75 or 80 mph in automatic mode, then switch to manual mode and put it in 6th gear. It only dropped the gas millage a little, but gave much better throttle response and made it easier to keep a steady speed as the road changed in elevation.  Down mountain driving?, well it took some thinking ahead as engine braking meant dropping 4 or 6 gears, which can't be done in a hurry.  placing the car in 3 or 4 gear allowed me normal acceleration and engine braking at speeds from 20- to 50 mph, with good torque available, just the thing for tight twisty mountain roads.  Off road in Utah, no problem. Good ground clearance and lots of go go in 2nd gear.  Ride was good too and never got close to getting stuck in super soft sand. Note:  Most of it's under powered issues are with hills in automatic transmission mode,  and trying to drive highway speeds without lots of gear changes and wide variations in cruise, but as I mentioned above, switching to manual helps this.  A V-6 engine and a 6 speed transmission would be just the fix for the car.....maybe next year.",4

When I turned off the vehicle I noticed smoke coming from under the hood, I popped the hood and was about to look when I noticed flames coming from the middle, back area of the hood, around where the transmission is located. I ran into the building looking for a fire extinguisher, by the time I got to the building I could see the flames making it way out from under the hood. Two workers at the rest area saw the smoke and came with fire extinguishers. By the time they got the fire contained, everything under the hood was burnt. The dealership said that they have nothing to do with that, its between me and Chrysler. I filled a claim with Chrysler the same day, Its 29 days now and I am getting the run around.

At first I was unsure if this was the right car for me because I was interested in some others and the styling was (and still is) odd, but since driving it for the past few months, it grew on me and very happy with it. With only 5 gears, I manage to get 26 miles per gallon combined (going 65 mph at 2500 rpm) which is 3 mpg's better considering that the engine displacement is the same at 2.4L, having the same amount of gears, having 4wd, and riding higher. The interior styling is a lot more pleasing to look at, steering is better, seat comfort is amazing. Yes, there is less room than my old car but that's OK because I like the smaller, more compact Jeep.

I can honestly say the $50.00 rental was well worth doing a review of this piece of junk. I cant believe Fiat/Chrysler would have this in the line up at all.

Lets face it, it's not made to be an off road king, a fuel saver nor an SRT.

This comparison is being made to the CRV and the RAV4 that we previously owned.  Overall the three vehicles can't really be compared because although they are in the same price range they seem to be in totally different classes of quality.  The materials, technology, drive and overall feel of the Jeep Compass is far inferior to either the CRV or RAV4.   What bothered me most about the Compass was the seemingly lack of logic when it comes to the design of the vehicle, such as extremely poor layout of gauge instruments, poor lighting and control buttons for audio that just don't flow well.   The acceleration of the 4 cylinder lacks a lot as it seemed to really strain to gain speed getting on the interstate.  In addition the air noise coming through the windows seemed to indicate that there was some problem with the seals around the windows.

The power leather seats, one button 4X4 engage, back up camera, cruse control, leather steering wheel with full controls and 430 digital touch screen with HHD make this SUV a joy to drive! The sky roof and the mentioned options give this mini SUV a very refined ride with the 17"" all season radials...I guess I'm miffed at the editors opinions of this SUV.

It's not perfect but,"," I have owned many vehicles from a lot of manufacturers and purchased all of them new. The Compass isn't the best or the worst, and it certainly has its place. The intended use is for a 25 mile commute 1 way, grocery getter, utility vehicle. It is intended to replace a Toyota Camry which has been less than stellar. The Compass is a small, fun to drive mini SUV that is agile in town. It has decent power for me and I am quite comfortable at 6' in it. It was purchased completely based on sales price and my previous Chrysler vehicles ownership experience. I bought a 2016 4X4 6-speed auto Sport w/AC and minimal options. Price before TTL was $15,985. Please note the vehicle is 1 month old with 900 miles on it so things can and will change.Pros-Price, maneuverability, u-connect, steering feedback, transmission, handling, control layout, lower body protection, towing ability, cost of parts when needed, availability if neat accessories to add. Cons- Shifter, cramped back seat, front fender design, visibility, safety stars given, small gas tank,As a hard core DIY'er, parts pricing and availability are important. Parts are cheaper for this than other cars I have. It uses non synthetic oil and is very basic as far as service goes, helping to reduce ownership costs. The Compass has an autostick transaxle which means it paddle shifts with the shifter. This is my biggest complaint as I like to drive with my hand on the shifter. You can't lock this feature out. The Compass is a unibody and gains rigidity from all body panels being tied together. The front fenders have no top connection to the inner fender well that I can see. A small rear window combined with large piller posts limits visibility. (My 2nd biggest complaint) - a rear view camera is on the horizon for this shortcoming. Gas here is $1.95 right now and I filled the tank for $24! When was the last time anyone did that! 13 gallons will get you ~290 miles of mixed driving. I am not a lead foot. I anticipate mileage will get better as miles increase- its about 24 right now. Drive safe.Updated 2/15/2017 now have 11,000 miles+-This little Jeep has exceeded my expectations.

Gas mileage has increased a bit too, additional 2MPG. No shakes or rattles have been noticed and no warranty service has been needed.I have installed an alarm with power door locks, nice Jeep seat covers, a cargo mat, rear cargo cover and additional 12 volt outlet in backseat console.This vehicle gets bad reviews and I don't know why.

I currently have 18K on it and suffice to say it’s lived up to my expectations for the price point it sells at. I haven’t had any problems with it so far. Very powerful and a rare sight on the streets. The one thing I like about it is it doesn’t make promises it can’t keep. No engine trickery just good old fashion American horsepower. Ride quality is taut but very liveable. Gas mileage is dismal. I average 11.5 mpg with mix driving. UConnect is excellent and probably best on the market at any price point. The GC SRT represents a good performance value for American streets.,5
920, on 08/23/17 10:05 AM (PDT),Rezz ,2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (6.4L 8cyl 8A),Speed and Comfort!," I knew when purchasing the 2017 Jeep Grad Cherokee SRT that it was in the speed/performance SUV category. I did not expect it to be so comfortable. I took a 9 hour roadtrip that in the past, I normally split in half (I'm not fond of driving for long periods of time). The easily adjustable climate controls, entertainment, and seats allowed us to adapt to travel conditions which made for a pleasant family experience. Thank you Jeep for including multiple charging ports for devices!  I especially love the driving modes that cater to different driving styles and conditions. The speed and responsiveness of the powerful V8 is definitely a plus. Now, on to the negative.  I had issues with a rear panel that is located near the hatch. The certified Jeep technician stated that he had seen this defect before. The panel appeared warped and would not connect to the vehicle properly. After trying on multiple panels they found one that corrected the issue. I also had issues with the sensors going off when nothing was near.  It started 2 weeks after I bought the vehicle. The dash alerts would go yellow to red instantly with nothing around the vehicle. It is random and I'm not sure what is causing it. Also, if you know anything about this vehicle you know not to expect great fuel economy. Overall, with exception of a few minor things, I am very pleased with this vehicle.",5
921, on 01/02/18 13:53 PM (PST),Michael L Johnson ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (6.4L 8cyl 8A),Fun and Powerful but Buyer Beware," In August 2017 I purchased a 2015 SRT8 with all of the available options. It's definitely fun to drive and super powerful. The gas mileage is to be expected 15-19MPG. However, the tow lights didn't work. It took a computer upgrade and a week at the dealership to fix it. The interior is beautiful as is the sound system. However the dash and door trim all had to be replaced due to the adhesive failing to maintain adhesion. However the main reason I would not purchase another one is because of the extremely poor service from every dealership that I tried. It seems like the Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler reliability issues keep these service bays backed up. My experience comes from the fact that I drove a Ram truck for 7 years prior to purchasing the Jeep. My trust or lack thereof is from actually catching them charging me for services not actually done. If it wasn't for this, I'd consider a new SRT.",3

923, on 09/18/16 19:26 PM (PDT),GregSQL ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (6.4L 8cyl 8A),Finally I own Grand Cherokee SRT," I was looking to replace my 2012 BMW X5 Sport Activity after owning it for 4.5 years. No questions BMW is a luxury vehicle and at the same time provides great handling. However I wasn't satisfied with 300hp V6 engine. Acceleration wasn't that great. Getting X5 with V8 engine is an option but a pricey one and simply out of my budget. I spend almost a year researching and test driving different vehicles. Finally I decided to purchase 2016 Grand Cherokee SRT. So far I'm happy with my purchase. Acceleration: phenomenal!! There is no such thing as lack of power with this engine. Light touch on the accelerator and the vehicle is going 95mph uphill and this is in Auto-ECO mode :)  Very responsive - rapid acceleration in order to  passing other vehicles is fun. Tried 0-60 as well: 4.7 sec in Sport mode and A/C on! Very impressive. Handling is great as well, still didn't decide if it's better the BMW's. Technology: Active Cruise Control - you realize you can't leave without it once you have it. You can drive hours on a freeway w/o touching pedals. Gauges cluster is well designed, very configurable. One thing I will be there: Nav shows speed limit  for most of the roads which is very helpful. However the speed sign sits in the lower right corner of the Nav screen. I wish it would be possible to have it on the gauge cluster as well. Graphics for Nav systems are ok. Two things I don't like about the Nav: 1. you can't enter a destination while driving. 2. Turning voice guidance on/off requires multiple steps on the screen.  No top/360 deg. camera - I really miss this one. However rear view camera has a wide angle and good resolution.  No power folding mirrors - don't really need it but still a nice feature to have. Interior: quality of materials is decent. Will see how the alcantara will hold over the time. There is definitely less storage in the front seats area then I had in my BMW. Door bins are smaller. The storage compartment under the armrest is small and in my vehicle half of it is taken by DVD slot for the rear-seat entertainment.  Heated/cooled seats are great. Ride on bumpy roads is softer then BMW which is good, but at the same time cabin noise is quite noticeable. Overall I'm pretty happy with the purchase - if I would get similarly equipped BMW I would pay at least $20K more.",4

The soft top is very easy to use and when it's closed, there is very little road noise. The only negative thing I can say, and its minor, is the USB input.

I loved my buddies but just didn't think it was for me - not enough cargo space. Finally took a road trip with him, and was blown away by how much room inside there actually was. We fit WAY more gear than I could in my 2012 Lexus GX 460. So I did a trade in and found a nice 4 door Rubicon with leather seats. I'm really impressed thus far. 4 star for safety because the brakes SUCK - don't tailgate or push it. You will not stop in time. Coming from a Lexus, the stopping distance is abysmal. However, if you're driving a Wrangler, you have no business not driving defensively. Always be on the lookout, don't text and drive, and drive smart. 4 Star for comfort as well, you will get driving fatigue on road trips. 4 hours is fine, but a 7 hour trip will wear you out.

I have followed the development of the new JL. I am not convinced it is the way to go for me. First it is a new model that will have teething problems like the JK had in 07. I do not know how the new models will do with the new metals being used or adhesives, they had to put the character line on the side to give the aluminum some strength.They made some steering components hollow rather than solid. I do not like the built-in roll bars. I do not like the windshield. they said they were going to lighten the Jeep, but some reviewers said it weighed more in some configurations.I do not like the dashboard, it looks like a Fiat design. I liked the adjustable steering wheel and lumbar support, that was about it. I know what I am buying with the JK. It is nice and simple. I bought the Sahara Unlimited automatic again in Billet Silver with a black hardtop. I love the new LED headlights and polished alloy wheels. I stayed with the 3.21 axle ratios for gas mileage. The Sahara has the next step up in shocks, so it is a bit firm at first, but smooths right out after a 1000 miles. This Sahara has a smoother ride than my 15 Sahara had. I feel safer buying tried and true, and I like the style better.I have owned so many vehicles and i keep coming back to the Wrangler Unlimited. It covers all the bases of what I want in one vehicle, a convertible, a tow vehicle, a 4X4, cargo capability with the seat down. a rugged look, easy to personalize. What more could you want !!",5

My only complaint with the Laredo I have at this point is the UConnect system that comes on even when I haven't pushed any buttons. Its great on gas and only needs regular.  My only other complaint is a small one, less gauges then my 2004. The 2013 I have has on demand 4X4 and automatic traction control.  Yes, this is my second Jeep Laredo and with my 2013 came a factory installed sunroof, AC outlet, two cigarette style charging stations, a USB port, a center console box with a shelf and deep bottom.  A 5 speed automatic with an over drive.  When my Jeep is in ECO mode, my Jeep has gotten 45 mpg. Even when coasting in local traffic I've gotten amazing fuel mileage.  What this Jeep is missing like all Jeeps is Blindspot technology but there good aftermarket packages available by auto specialty shops for up to $900.00. The 2013 Grand Cherokee Laredo lost space in the cargo area in favor of more comfortable front and rear seating.  It comes with a locking fuel cap.  When I purchased my used Laredo, I purchased a bumper to bumper warranty from Zurich.  With all the electronics, some from Mercedes, I wasn't going to take any chances.

I have driven it all over California , Arizona and lived in Colorado for 3 years. Bottom line, this car does what it does better than any car in its class. The bet MIX of off road and on road manners you are going to find, ITS HARD TO DO BOTH. Jeep does it the best with this car. I have always had crazy things going off with hard shifting , noises etc from the transmission and transfer case. Pretty sure its a problem with Chrysler because I had a dodge ram truck  4x4 in my 3 years i lived in Colorado and i had the same issues. THE MOTOR: the V6 is bullet proof, gives you towing power that just isn't found in most SUV's in this class. period. In 2018, Jeep is one of the only smaller SUV's that have any real towing ability.  Ive towed a Pop tent trailer all over the mountains of colorado. This is no V8 power but it will get you there.  FIT and finish. Everything till works and nothing is broken. Some wear on the seats but I still have the same battery! very reliable in this section. PERFORMANCE- GREAT in all weather, escpecially in the snow. pair with the correct tires and you can do almost anything. Deep snow, no problem, Rain, no problem. WHEN IT COMES TIME TO REPLACE THE SHOCKS- STICK WITH OEM. I went with after market bilstiens and was underwhelmed.( i have a few on other cars and was super impressed). GAS MILEAGE- pretty much sucks. almost the same as the V8 truck 4x4 I had. 86,000 miles and the transfer case has gone out. Its in the shop right now. $4.500 to replace( it got stuck in 4 Wheel LOW when i was testing it). JEEP stepped up ( i was over the in service years by 5 months but under the 100,000 mile power train warranty. they paid for 1/2 of the cost( their cost which was lower than $4,500). I thought that was a pretty good deal and I appreciated them stepping up to help me. REPAIRS- I have replaced the shocks because I wanted Bilstiens and thought they would need them soon anyway. I have replaced all of the brakes and rotors, I installed a new Water pump( i did this myself because a code kept coming up- i never noticed anything Wrong but had it checked at Autozone for free). This repair was easy and I am no mechanic- Youtube is your friend). I had to replace right front bearing housing. It got demolished from the snow but didn't go out until I moved out of Colorado. THIS took forever to get off because it was rusted/welded on. this repair is beyond most people.I had my mechanic do it because I couldn't get it off. 5 years and 86,000 miles and she runs great with a few small repairs and one big repair( the transfer case had to be entirely replaced- bearing inside went out and tore the whole unit up)",4

I am young and it was still a pain to get in and out of with the kids. It is very stylish and eye catching. The 4x4 seems to perform well and the Jeep handled well. I loved the interior lighting. I traded it for a Chevy Cruze diesel and dont regret it",4.125

It does have the 5.7 HEMI. There isn't anything that makes it drive differently than a regular Grand Cherokee. We found this rare Jeep on the dealer lot for $8000 off. What a deal! It has a really smooth ride from the air suspension. With rugged off-road tires, it still has a really quiet, smooth ride. The seats are big, but firm. However, they're really comfortable. Its cargo space is good for luggage even with the seats up. The interior is well-put together with high quality materials, and many are soft to the touch. We had 0 problems with the electronics, the engine, and the air suspension. We had it for 9 monthsUPDATE. At 3 years, it's still a great Jeep! Only problem it has had was a clogged windshield spray nozzle that was replaced under warranty. Value isn't really great, gas mileage sucks with the HEMI (but I don't mind because it's an awesome engine!), but the overall vehicle is fantastic. I wouldn't sell it.",4

Because I am a mechanic, no big deal! On the 4.7L the biggest issue was the engine! They tend to throw rocker arms! Secondly the steering! Both Jeeps suffered from death wobble for different  reasons. Lastly, the brakes! The rotors tend to warp! Not sure, at this point, if it's a design flaw. So much as I think a ad mechanic.

By adding 31” tall tires I gained 1-2 MPH just by slowing the engine RPM’s Of course I needed to adjust the speedometer with a “tuner”, but also changed the fuel required to regular gas and better performance for highway driving. Mileage, on the interstate with moderate hills and mountains always averages 22-23 MPG. This is staying at the speed limit and easy acceleration. The addition of a cold air intake bumps the mileage up another notch too.I have always used Mobile 1 synthetic oil and a premium oil filter. Change intervals are 10,000 miles. Every three years I flush ALL fluids…brake, transmission, cooling, transfer case and differentials. Not all is perfect. I needed to rebuild my front differential due to excessive bearing wear. I replaced the front hubs and drive shafts at the same time since they were already out of the Jeep. Brakes are indeed a weak point on these Jeeps. The factory brakes didn’t seem to last long before warping became an issue. I replaced them with PowerStop brand and they lasted about 100k miles. I have accomplished this procedure three times now with the same predicted mileage…100k per set. The interior leather is not of the highest quality and the center arm rest needs to be recovered in synthetic leather.All in all, the Jeep performs very well, even in the tough third world environment. Like a contributor before stated…”take care of the Jeep and it’ll take care of you” Sound words of advice.",5

All I can say is nothing but good things. I routinely have done the required maintenance on it, and up until last year 2017 I had to replace the belt, radiator, water pump, plugs. This things went well beyond their life expectancy. If I can get another 280k miles without having to replace anything on it would be golden. I use this SUV for work I use my Jeep as a daily driver and for work. It's never left me stranded and I still can't believe how good of car it's been for me and my family.  Everything on my Jeep is still original stock as from the dealer, the paint is beginning to flake off besides that I love this car. The power it still has is amazing I can perform or out perform any new car or SUV climbing steep uphills or riding in the snow.",5
1037, on 12/07/16 10:51 AM (PST),Scott B ,2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4WD 4dr SUV (4.0L 6cyl 4A),Good value if you capitalize of strengths," It should be obvious, but let's be clear upfront: this is not a good economical commuting vehicle or ""basic"" transportation. Even if you need the ground clearance for snow/sand, the ability to occasionally tow moderate loads, and other AWD SUV type capabilities, there are better options. Solid axles (of which there are 2 under this truck) can never match the ride and handling of independent suspension. And, finally, if you have no need for, or comprehension of, a manually-shifted transfer case—let alone one with 4LO—then just walk away now. This is the wrong vehicle for you. However, if you're looking for an eminently capable off-roader, even just mild National Forest road exploring, then this is a very good start. The bomb-proof straight 6 (AKA I6 <-- that's the letter ""i"") is generally an OK choice if you can't see any hills from where you're standing, otherwise you may as well get the V8 which is far better suited to the Grand Cherokees girth and makes essentially the same MPGs. I opted for the HO version of the V8 as it is matched to the beefier 545FE slushbox and (theoretically) stouter Dana 44a (AKA 44HD) rear diff which should buy me slightly more long term durability when being driven by more horses and getting beat on off road, mechanically-speaking. Or at least it should buy me some additional peace of mind. (Though the aluminum third member isn't particularly well-known for it's physical durability against impacts, that can be addressed with bolt-on solutions, i.e., armor) Coming from a (well-loved, if well-used) lifted 1993 Cherokee (XJ), the road trip worthiness and comfort is night and day between the two. It's no Lexus but the rounded corners and soft body lines go a long way towards quieting wind noise, while also helping economy creep up towards, and occasionally peeking into, the 20s. But when you're used to crawling (sometimes literally) over the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, being able to blast up the highway passes at the actual speed limit is very near a life-altering experience. And doing so for no (extra) penalty at the pump is certainly nice. (That said, I have typically opted for premium octane fuel in the HO for road-tripping the particularly mountainous sections of I-70 since it can legitimately bump engine output 10%...) Interior creature comforts are perfectly acceptable for this age and class of Jeep. My Columbia Edition WJ ups the ante in a couple places, notably the dual 6-way power seats and a tilt/slide sunroof. In fact, I feel like this particular trim has 90% of the best features of the Limited with virtually none of the cons. Especially the cursed auto climate control (which has known issues), instead offering just the basic manual heating and cooling controls. It would be nice to have the Vari-Lok LSD included with the QuadrDrive system though that would mean still compromising with the same transfer case, mine being the even less desirable QuadraTrac II. I only saw a single (non-HO) V8 with the more preferable SelecTrac TC in all my looking and, sadly, that seller never responded to inquiries. That said, performance of the Vari-Lok diffs is entirely dependent on consistently good prior maintenance by previous owners, which you can rarely count on. And you'd also be stuck with far less aftermarket support, something I already accepted with the D44a. The upside is a transfer case swap to a SelecTrac unit, while non-trivial, is a not unreasonable prospect and a something already on the medium term to-do list. So, ya, as an all-around road-trip, weekend warrior wheeler, and occasional tow rig, a V8 GC is a good option for your money.",4

Only reason I wouldn't drive a GC is if I decided to downsize or upgrade to a different vehicle type. Good things: The engine is very strong – everything else on it will fall apart before its 4.0L straight-six does. I change the oil myself, moper filter only, every 3,500 miles. I have never had to fix anything on the interior (e.g. seats, dash buttons). Aftermarket parts are cheap for the value, so fixing things never costs and arm and a leg. For the whole time I've owned it, it's only needed to ""major"" jobs completed. The 4x4 is one of the most reliable systems I've owned. Only had two recalls served, and both affected at least a half million other vehicles across makes and models (not just a Jeep problem). The service depts. I've been to are helpful; I'm very blunt with the associates, which makes them honest with me. Bad things: I watch my gas level drain when I drive it – hurts the wallet when I'm traveling far. I swapped out the trans at 195k miles (most truck trans last longer, so get a truck if you want trans and engine reliability). Chrysler went cheap on the electrical harnesses in the doors and the wires in the door jams, so the windows and doors may stop working. The OEM headlights point low to the ground, so night visibility is very limited. And the headlamp assemblies fog over, so get aftermarket ones. The body rusts too easily (mine has the notorious rust spot above the back passenger wheel well) and that shouldn't happen to almost every GC, but it does.",4

I have no negative comments about this car and will probably never love a vehicle as much as this one. It had all the bells and whistles, smokey gray in color with dark leather. Loved the overall appearance, design/features, and the way the 4.0 ran. (getting rid of the 4.0 was a big mistake Jeep!) I ran this thing hard and only repair was replace water pump at over 100K.

The common complaint of the windows not working and/or the interior lights not shutting off is a simple broken ground wire in the driver's door harness.  Took me 10 minutes to fix.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this Jeep, although some things have not lasted as long as older models I've owned, namely, the hood supports failed at 50k, all 4 shocks leaking at 60k, and rear axle seals at 70k.  Other than that, it's been rock-solid reliable. Fuel mileage is outstanding for an engine whose roots date back to the early 1960s.  By the way, it's an inline 6, not a V6 as some reviewers have written.  I would and do recommend the Grand Cherokee!",4.375

I haven't had any major issues with the Jeep. All the maintenance has been kept up to date and I think that makes a huge difference. The gas mileage is not great. I average 18.8 mixed city and hwy but mostly city. Its not horrible but nothing great. The truck interior looks great to me. I love the stereo. The infotainment works great. The steering feels great. I think it rides pretty well on the hwy and is just the right size to whip around. Plenty of storage space especially when you drop the back seats. It has plenty of power but you have to floor it to get into it as the transmission will hold you back. I drive in TOW mode when I am in a hurry. I have put about 6k miles on this Jeep since I bought it.,4
1108, on 03/18/17 22:46 PM (PDT),Gregg P. ,2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (4.7L 8cyl 5A),My 3 for 1 Diesel Grand Cherokee," I bought a used 2008 Grand Cherokee CRD to replace a 2 seat GT DOHC 4V V8 convertible, a full size van used primarily for towing and my daily driver. I wanted a car that would be fun to drive, be good in snow, tow a 3,200 lb. camper and get good fuel economy.  So far (4k miles, 4 months of ownership) I am very pleased with this SUV. The 3.0L Mercedes CRD engine and trans represent the best of MB components that were shared with Chrysler. I purchased a very well engineered tune that improves fuel economy and reliability while matching the power and torque of the current crop of 3.0L diesel SUVs (255 HP, 455 lb-ft). The acceleration with the tune is impressive and effortless; this torque is significantly more than the hot rod SRT Hemi V8 in the 2008 GC and peaks about 3,000 RPM sooner. I'm still on my first tank after the tune; most users claim a 2-4 MPG improvement. My baseline economy is 21 MPG overall (50/50 mix of city/hwy driving) which is decent for my heavy foot. The most surprising aspect is the handling; it is a lot of fun to power through the turns with this large SUV. The full time 4WD makes the front tires help pull it through the corners. It's not meant to be a ""G"" machine but Car and Driver magazine said it can stay with well driven sports sedans in the corners. It has a very comfortable ride and an attractive interior with a nice sized sunroof and all the features of a luxury vehicle (the 2008 Limited interior has notable improvements over the 2007 model). The biggest problem I had was finding a nice one with the options I wanted at a reasonable price (they only made about 2,000 2008 CRDs so they are fairly rare - low mileage units approach the cost of a 2-3 year old VM diesel equipped current generation GC). I bought mine with 120k miles; some say it is barely broken in. My tuner said a Sprinter van he tweaked (it has the same basic CRD engine/trans as the GC) now has 700k miles on it with no rebuilds. I hope to drive my Jeep to at least the 250k mile point. The biggest compliment I can pay it is that it puts a smile on my face every time I drive it whether it's confidently plowing through 8"" of snow, out-accelerating a BMW or hustling through the turns on my favorite back roads. All this and a 7,200 lb towing capacity.",5

Sure just had to bring it in for regular maintenance but with the 7 year warranty coming to an end this month we traded it in for a beautiful fully loaded 2015 Limited. While no transmission issues like a lot of people have, my 2015 has a lot of electrical issues that just piss you off! However, my 2008 was a Jeep and it drove like a truck. Crappy gas mileage but a great all around car, no electrical or engine issues ever. Had a small hole in muffler at the end that I didn't repair because I was getting rid of but it was very reliable.

However, many of these issues have been fixed for 2007. For 2008, which is the year of my Jeep, the front-end suffered a light facelift and the interior received a major improvement.

My JGC definitely returns the favor!   Nice ride, fun to drive and the 4.7L has great pick-up.  Haven't tried the E85 yet - so can't comment on performance/mileage there. Now that gas prices are down - my purchasing a V8 in June when gas was near $4 doesn't look so stupid.   How are people complaining about gas mileage in these reviews?  You saw what the EPA estimates were when you bought it - as long as you're not getting worse mileage than EPA estimates, how can you rate gas mileage as poor?  I'm consistently getting a couple of more mpg in comparison to EPA estimates.   Got 21mpg on 600 mile highway trip recently.",4.875

I have the 4.0L inline 6 engine, which is known for being incredibly reliable, I've owned the car for about 3 years, purchased it back in 13 with just under 90K miles on it for 4K, today I have close to 145K miles on it and runs like a champ. I've put some money into it when I purchased it, about $750 to fix some steering issues but after I got that out of the way it has been a fantastic car. Basically just general maintenance and upkeep. I've put on new tires and brakes, but that comes with owning any car, as well as had a rusty brake line replaced as well as the crankshaft sensor which were both minor and relatively cheap repairs; it is a 16 year-old-car after all so it will need a few things replaced due to the age. The engine is smooth and never has given me any trouble. This car also handles great in poor driving conditions, the only thing you need to worry about in the snow are the other idiots on the road. I am nothing but confident driving in a snow-storm. The inline 6 makes getting stuck quite challenging, I have been in muddy conditions and the Jeep has gotten me out without a hitch. This is still before Jeeps became the luxury mom-mobiles of today. They were built when Jeep built reliable, tough, off-road, road ready vehicles.If you are considering getting one, get one. Don't shy away because the odometer has a reading of 150-200K miles, these are known for lasting well into the 300s.Great car and relatively cheap and easy to find nowadays.

I did my research and asked previous Jeep owners, and I went with their overall responses.  They said its has a great engine and transmission that will last for at least 200k miles easily with proper maintenance.   I agree with them completely.  The car has about 140k Miles on it now and the engine still runs great and quiet like it was still new. It has only been 10k miles, but that's mostly city driving and a couple of 300 mile trips. I have a rattling and shaking in my front end when I hit small bumps, But not all the parts are going to be perfect after 15 years of age. I have replaced the water pump, upper radiator hose, and tie rods so far.  Besides changing oil every 3k miles, that's all I have replaced mechanically.   I have also installed a higher performance muffler onto my Jeep by choice (Flowmaster Super 44).  The Jeep runs amazing and I hope that it goes at least 250k before the engine dies.I live in a major city, So my gas mileage is piss poor (About 10 mpg), but I fill up with Plus so it lasts a little longer than regular unleaded.  On the highway I get about 25 to 30 mpg.  So not a city car.    My interior is tan with brown moldings, the interior isn't entirely perfect but again its been 15 years.

Headlights need attention, maybe R&R'd. Paint is showing wear but a good detail job & it's still looking good at 13 yrs. old.! Runs great, handles well.

1249, on 09/18/15 23:09 PM (PDT),Jeff ,2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo Rwd 4dr SUV (4.0L 6cyl 4A),Fair ride if you leave it stock - more info below," I have never purchased my jeep, however it was given to me. Several years without an oil change before i was handed the keys. After adding seafoam in the oil letting the jeep run for 15 minutes, drain it out and add new oil. Runs brand new after over 180K miles. Till this day im still driving my jeep! now it has over an above stock. Do NOT underestimate the power of the Inline-6 Cylinder motor. The motors are very durable and extremely hard to bend. I will be writing this review with some small mechanics advice to all of you if you buy a jeep with an Inline-6 Motor. And some advice with the issues of the A/C and Heater Defrost only issue  and other things. First off with little motor maintenance.  Seafoam is NOT only used for the gas tank. It helps a lot of things out. to keep your motor working in good condition. and decrease daily driving temperature, Put seafoam in the oil when its time for an oil change, Let it run for 15 to 20 minutes at idol after warming up. Drain the old oil. and change with fresh new oil. (Removes Gunk and sludge underneath the pistons, valves, rods, etc.) A/C and Heater Defrost only issue - The cause 10 out of 10 times is a $2  vacuum hose underneath the battery tray. There is a valve that soley works for the settings on AC and heater pannel. The hose is cracked or broken and needs to be replaced with a new 1/4 foot long hose. (1/2 inch size i believe)If you believe this can be the problem. Start the jeep up, pop the hood, and put your head by the battery to hear a hissing noise. Whether loud, or seems unusual under the battery.Radiator fan cooling issue - If the radiator fan stops working it has to do with a Relay. This relay is underneath the Passenger headlight and My advice to you is buy an aftermarket one from an auto store like Advanced auto parts or Auto zone with a couple years warranty. Mine went out too but it was a $60 fix. Replace myself. Never experienced any electrical problems myself. But if this is the case for you. Make sure ALL ground wires are properly grounded. Including for lights, Sensors, and your engine computer.  (Secure tight, and make sure there is no metal to paint contact, Metal to metal only)I will advise you that this model jeep includes 2 different types of transmissions. (dont remember the names off of my head)   But 1 of the 2 of those has the issues of Electric solenoids overheating or your rear wheel speed sensors are worn out. (Speed sensors are also very important to jeeps) Causing your transmission to shift very ruff with close or above 3000 rpms, making a nasty meddle knocking noise underneath. No matter on how lightly you touch the gas pedal. If it takes for ever to downshift when you need to get on a freeway these can be the same fixes. Even if you made sure properly Adjusting the TV Kickdown cable in the engine compartment. Window regulators do have a tendency to fail. Make sure next time you replace one. Do NOT put grease all over the wheels and cable. This causes your new window regulator motor to end up off track, bind up the wire, and break.This advice is given to you based on self hand experiences and these were all 1 time repairs for me ever since. My jeep is still running strong. and im gaining 32mpg adverage with some weight reduction, and under the hood upgrades. NOTE:  A lot of the stuff the breaks on a jeep is actually lest cost to fix than you think, if you know what your doing. If you dont? there are millions of youtube videos for simple fixes that you think could cost an arm and a leg. Jeeps are way more durable than you think. Go Big, Buy a jeep!",4

This oversized golf cart is quite possibly the worst investment that you can ever make, save your money and get an Accord.

Let's start with the... Exterior: mine is the green/gold color and the paint has been peeling off of the top and hood since before I bought it (primer failure/paint defect). The driver's door hinge is worn out and the door sags. I went through an automated car wash and the clear plastic face of both head headlights fell off (?!) so I had to replace them. Safety Issues: There is a factory recall because of a chance of the Jeep exploding if hit from the rear (?!)  Electrical Issues: The Crankshaft Position Sensor failed (also a common issue with these Jeeps) and left me stranded on a secluded stretch of road for 4 hours - my mechanic thought it was the fuel pump, so I ended up buying a fuel pump AND the CPS. The Jeep developed an issue where it would sporadically stall (usually at the LEAST convenient time and location) and wouldn't crank back up for 2 minutes. After replacing multiple parts over the course of 8 1/2 months and almost getting killed several times as it stalled in the middle of a busy intersection, it was determined that there was a bad connection with a wiring harness that plugs into the Powertrain Control Module (also a design flaw). A series of zip ties and wooden wedges behind the PCM fixed that problem. The instrument lights flicker off and on while driving with the lights on, because of loose electrical connection somewhere. The AC fan only works on the 3 lowest settings (not on High) unless you jiggle the wiring harness behind the glove compartment.  Drivetrain: I had to replace the rear axle because the carrier bearing housing broke (and apparently this is common on these jeeps).  The transmission slips and leaks. I had to replace the water pump twice, the cooling fan twice and the radiator. I've replaced the starter twice. The freeze plug on the back of the head developed a small leak that I didn't catch until the Jeep ran hot and blew the head gasket and cracked the head (I was in the middle of a long bridge and couldn't pull over). This head freeze plug rusting out is also (supposedly) a design flaw with the 4.0... something about the factory casting sand getting lodged around it, causing it to rust. Other: the carpet on the passenger floorboard is constantly wet because of a design flaw with the ac condenser drain tube.  All 5 of the door lock actuators (rear lift gate too) stopped working/disintegrated because they are cheaply made.   ...I'm sure I've missed something... there has been so much I've been through with this Jeep... never again will I own a Chrysler product.  My Ford Expedition - same year (97) with 250k+ miles... I've owned it for 13 years and I'VE REPLACED THE SPARK PLUGS AND WIRES!!! PERIOD!!!",2

Good as a second (or third) car and local daily driver. A bit bouncy on long trips. No problems to report in first 5000 miles of driving. I recommend using 89 octane fuel rather than regular. ",4.5

Change your fluids my friends. It has never let me down and really never broke except for the A/C in 04 but who cares. I go off road and play in the mud so I beat this old thing.

Thought I was upgrading...boy, was I wrong. Shame on me for not reading the reviews before purchasing; shame on Daimler Chrysler for poor build quality and shoddy reliability. Only owned for 6 months because repair bills kept piling up. Went to four different garages; none could figure out why the vehicle kept stalling.

I have only put a couple hundred miles on it but it seems to run great.  I cant believe how good the body is holding up.  No exterior rust yet. The only issue i have with it is the transmission has a very slight leak.  When I park I see one or two drops of tranny fluid on the ground.  After a tranny flush and new seal, no more leak. In the past I have never been a Chrysler fan and still am not.  But this vehicle so far is my exception.  I like it and I could NOT pass up the deal I got on it.  So far, no major complaints.

Additional minimal problems up until the AC conked out on it's 10th year. Had the freon loaded just to get through the summer. After the winter of 2008, we traded it in for an import.

Had to have radio replaced under warranty but was fairly problem free until the rear end needed replacing. Mechanic said that gearing was misaligned from the factory and it was only a matter of time until it went out. Had other small intermittent problems. Then the computer unit went out. It took Jeep dealer about 3 months to find the problem. We would take it in and they would give it back saying they could not find any problem. It would have same problem and we would take it in only to start the cycle again. Wife who drives vehicle says we will never buy another Jeep. Plan on replacing it soon with import. ",3.75

Only problem I've ever had was the first week when my check engine light came on, but a free O2 sensor from the dealership fixed that. The powerful V8 makes it one of the fastest SUVs on the road, even after over 10 years.  Although the interior colors aren't my favorite, it's unique and never see anything like it.

The new 4.0L gives a little less HP than the 93/4/5 but a few cheep mods can kick it up to about the same. I drive a lot of highway and offroad most weekends. ZJs are very good for both. I have driven no problem 3000 miles in 3 days, and even been excited to start the next day. In the snow this Jeep is as safe as any subaru etc. The balance and traction is second to none, and it is difficult to get out of control.

This is my primary work vehicle and I spend a lot of time working on the road. I also use it to pull an oversized boat and to go into the field hunting and fishing. It goes and comes back where others can't. 4x4 is easy to operate and totally dependable. The only weak points have been the electronic accessories: heated mirrors, photochromic rearview mirror and rear windshield wiper. Fuel mileage is very good considering it's an SUV. I average 22 MPG highway and 16 MPG around town (according to the DIC). 6 cylinder layout is such that regular maintenance is easily accomplished by owner.",4.125

I know Jeeps, and I know they need preventative care, Having said that, regular maintenance is not a problem. If you are looking for a quality vehicle, safe, roomy and enjoyable to drive to that cabin in the woods, or skiing, you can't go wrong with the Orvis. Watch out for ignition switch wear, I have learned to have them pulled and replaced at 100k, wear on this can cause automatic shut-down on the vehicle. ",4.875

Drove it in Los Angeles for 2 + years then mostly in the mid-west, with frequent cross country trips. This car has held up superbly over time. The body and interior are still in excellent shape. There have been a few standard repairs over the years. The only real problem is the rear axle and bearings; they have had chronic problems since around 100K miles - they need to be rebuilt replaced about every 2+ years which can hurt the wallet. This car has been otherwise excellent in all driving conditions and weather. Very good car for long trips! I'm shooting for 250K miles for sure.",4.25

I bought it from a credible Dodge dealer near me and it had around 80,000 miles on it. I got it for a little over $7,000. It was in perfect condition, everything was working fine. So far I have replaced my water pump and that's pretty much it. My rear parking brake broke off randomly and was clanking around in my wheel, got that taken care of but never fixed my parking brake.

You will take the Grand Cherokee for a test drive and think it's the best thing since sliced bread, but just wait....  The first week I had the Jeep I almost died in the name of fuel economy.  I was sitting at a light and the automatic engine shut off shut off the engine.  Pretty cool I think.  Until the light starts to turn red and I hit the gas - the car starts, lunges forward, and dies.  Right in the intersection.  I live in Los Angeles.  Trust me, this is not a good place to be stalled.  It took me half a minute to get the Jeep started again.   I thought it was a fluke.  It wasn't.   I started to turn off the auto engine shut every time I got in the car (there is a button for this) but sometimes I forget and it's so annoying.  I am not the only one that hates this feature, there are actually videos on Youtube to teach you how to disable this feature.  This feature blows and is super dangerous, all to supposedly save a few drops of gas.  Second, the GPS/Infotainment system is terrible.  It's so slow and keeps getting slower.  I use my iphone instead.  The vehicle settings keep switching to metric (like KMPH) for some reason and I have had to reset this several times.  But the worst about this car is what has been an issue for the Jeep for the last several years.  It's the transmission/shifter.  Remember that kid from Star Trek that died when his Jeep ran him over?  Remember the recalls?  They still haven't figured it out.  My Jeep likes to shift out of gear and into neutral all by itself while I'm driving.  Yes, this is very dangerous.   Or it refuses to shift out of park.  I have had it in the shop three times now and they can't fix it.  I found out the 2016 had a recall for this very same issue.  Well, they obviously didn't fix the issue on the 2017.  Then, to make the Jeep even more dangerous, this week I had to stop quickly and hit the brakes...the car just kept on going like I was trying to stop on ice (remember I live in L.A. and it's 95 degrees.  There is no ice).  I had to quickly take my foot off the brakes then hit the brakes again and the car stopped.  Luckily I avoided rear ending the lady with the baby in the car by inches.  Maybe next time I won't be so lucky.  I have 12,000 miles on the Jeep and it's not even a year old and I'm done with it.  LEMON.  Get your act together Fiat/Chrysler and fix the issues with the Jeep.",1
1389, on 07/26/18 09:54 AM (PDT),John Leek ,2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),NOT really intended for off road usage," I purchased this vehicle because I am a bird hunter and in our part of the country that means late summer through winter.  I wanted a capable vehicle to get in and out of snow covered hunting fields and to deal with mud, frozen mud, slick wet grass, the occasional flooded woodland road and unimproved two tracks, BUT I was also hoping to be able to do more regular off-roading too.  Don't get me wrong, the Trail Hawk is a very capable vehicle BUT after owning mine for 20,000 plus miles it is apparent that what I purchased was marketing.  Item 1. You can easily find FCA videos on the web showing the vehicles being used in serious off road environments showing you how the Select Terrain system functions and how capable the vehicles are, but if you look closely all of them have the lower front valance removed and the optional Rock Rails or sliders as some people call them installed.  They protect the vulnerable rocker panels.  Well just try to get them.  After the frustration of trying to locate them, my service provider told me that they are on ""Celestial Back Order"" and no one can get them, plus if you can find them even though the company website states that install time is a reasonable hour and half, technicians that have installed them say it take more like 11 hours, at Dealer shop rates.  Item 2.  The units all come with the TPMS system.  One of the first things you learn in off roading is the technique of airing down for more traction and to put more flex in the tires to avoid fatal side wall punctures.  With the TPMS system not only will the dash board be going crazy while you are aired down, but you run the risk of crushing the TMPS unit as the softer tire rolls over obstacles.  Item 3. speaking of tires, the truck comes with an 18 inch wheel and tire set up.  this limits your choice of all terrain or mud terrain tires to less that 3 choices.  None of the more popular/aggressive tires come in that size so if you want to run them you have to buy a new set of rims for your brand new truck, Plus new tires.  Item 4. for some reason even though the Trail Hawk package is marketed as a capable off road ""Trail Rated"" vehicle the package eliminates the rear tow point and installs a Class VI hitch.  its a minor thing but then you have to purchase a aftermarket receiver link and shackle to allow for recovery from the rear if you get hung up.  Item 5. with the smooth plastic covered bumpers there is no solid mount point for a standard off road High lift jack.  it comes with a standard automotive scissors jack that might not work in a off the pavement situation.  Item 6. If you don't order or pick a lot unit with the LED lighting set up the head lights are terrible and there is no mounting point for additional auxiliary lighting.  Admittedly these seem like small things, but when I spoke to one of the Jeep Brand folks associated with setting up their company sponsored Jeep Jamborees about participating in one, the first thing he suggested was to have the Rock Rails installed and mount upgraded tires.  It's a let down to know that Jeep knows the lower front valance needs to be removed and the rock rails need to be installed before they take the vehicles out and run them off road AND at least one of the folks who organize the Jamborees knows the you need better tires and the rails to participate in their events.  I suggest that if you plan to do any serious off roading or Overlanding  opt for the Wrangler.  The Grand Cherokee is like a divers watch rated to 10,000 feet.  it can go there if it had too but it is mostly going to be worn to the mall.",3

I have spent $600 to replace the blend doors just two months ago and its back in the shop today.

I pull my sleds in the winter and my boat in the summer. Never a problem. When I hit the deep snow the traction is great and any off-roading situations are handled perfectly. I do put on some Blizteks snow tires for the winter and they have proven themselves as well.

We purchased the Laredo model in March of 2018 during Jeeps model closeout and we feel got a very good price. I had been researching the Jeep GC for months and honestly went in with mixed emotions because of the mixed reviews. Normally I don't put much value in reviews as I never know if they are honest or not. So for me every time I seen someone with a Jeep GC I would ask them how they like their rig. Without exception they were all raving reviews, one gentleman said he had owned 4 of them, some going over 200k miles and no problems. So my wife and I decided to buy.  This past week we took a trip to Montana to visit grand kids and family. This is a 10 hour trip, many steep hills to cross in Northern Idaho and lots of flat ground in Washington and Oregon. My wife probably sums it up best when she said ""this Jeep GC just wants to run"". That is a big statement when you consider our other rig is a Ram Hemi which runs VERY WELL. The Jeep GC  handles like it is on rails, accelerates up hills without any challenge, passes slower cars without any effort. We just love the ride, the way it handles and for the 1000 mile trip averaged 27.5 MPG, speed at 65-75 MPH so to us fuel mileage is better then expected. We love the design of the car, fit and finish is excellent and interior is very comfortable, even being the base Laredo model. I am 6'5"" tall and car like rigs just don't fit me, this one has plenty of room for my long legs and plenty of head and shoulder room. Getting in/out is excellent as the doors open very wide so tall people like myself can slide in and out very easy.  At this point I just can't say anything negative about it, time will tell. But I suspect/hope its the same quality as our 04 Ram which has 191k miles with zero problems... I don't know the off-road capability of the GC but because its a jeep I would say it will do fine. For us we just wanted a 4x4 capable rig for traveling on the highway during the winter in Oregon, Washington and Montana, this one does the job. If you are in the market for a 4x4 rig that rides great, has plenty of power, looks very nice and can handle any situation you should consider the Jeep GC. Oh, and gets very good fuel mileage, the Jeep just can't be beat.",5

First snowstorm of the year, and I couldn't even defrost my front windshield. It was replaced under warranty, but only after I had to take it to two different dealerships and file a customer complaint. The second issue I had was with the factory autostart.

In thinking about how long I wanted to keep the car, creature comforts, etc., I decided upon a 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit with the 5.7L V8 (Black on Black). This car is AMAZING! Full disclosure, I've only had it for about a month, but I've put about 2100 miles on it and bought it new.  So far no major issues, but I can say that there are a couple minor things I don't like. First, the multi-Cylinder Displacement system is annoying. I bought a V8 for a reason, and yes it does help with gas but I want the ability to turn it off completely or on. It makes all kinds of random ""juddering"" noises and that's annoying. Secondly, I have the air suspension, which I highly recommend based upon your state's roads. Michigan's are horrible so the air suspension is helpful. My issue is that its sort to of noisy at times, I don't know if that's inside or outside, but it can be a bit noisy. Third and finally, the sunroof shade rattles a bit when I go over large bumps. It comes and goes but it can be annoying. Overall, if you've never experienced a Jeep Grand Cherokee, I HIGHLY recommend testing one out or renting one for the weekend. The trims levels are all different in many ways but also similar as well in others (i.e. the interior to some degree). Take one for a spin, you won't be disappointed! I love my Jeep!!UPDATE:6 or so months later, I still love my Jeep! Its still-functioning optimally and I have no complaints. I made it through my first Michigan winter and it was glorious. Moving to the snow position makes travel in this type of weather a breeze! The V8 engine is a must if it's in your budget. Worth every penny!! I also had the opportunity to take the Jeep on a road trip and it was amazing! Adaptive Cruise Control makes driving a breeze on the expressway and in normal traffic. Overall I would still recommend this car to anyone. Worth the $$!",5

Everything from turning radius to the feel of the wheel when driving, Stereo system, seat comfort, etc...  Heads keep turning and the positive comments keep on coming in.  I am a Mopar- Jeep guy at heart and am truly glad I leased another grand Cherokee. The comments about the engine turning off at stops is a bit ridiculous. All you have to do is PUSH a BUTTON to turn that feature off. C'mon. And this V6 is quick. Very quick with a ""Sport"" mode which I rarely use. How fast do you really want to go in an SUV ? But this one is quicker than my previous two. Plenty of power if you need to avoid someone or something, or pass another vehicle. I Just love this Jeep.",5

'17 JEEP ENGINE SHUTS ITSELF OFF," I owned my first grand cherokee for 17 years.  When I decided it was time for a new vehicle I looked at all the different 2017 SUV's and cross overs on the market and decided that for me, Jeep was still the way to go.  My priorities were, comfort, style, towing capability, storage capacity, and a luxurious interior with great sound (if you get the 600 watt sub woofer option).  The jeep came the closest to meeting all of these for under $50k.  I took my first 1,500 mile trip last week and was very pleased with all the above mentioned (other than I haven’t towed a trailer yet). HOWEVER..... The 3.6L ESS engine (ESS stands for electronic stop/start)  is designed to SHUT OFF EVERY TIME YOU COME TO A COMPLETE STOP LASTING MORE THAN A FEW SECONDS. ).  It does start back up when you release the brake but only after a noticeable delay. This is to save a few drops of gas, but think about this the next time you’re inching along in traffic, waiting in line for a hamburger, or wanting to make a quick right hand turn at a red light.  Also keep in mind that when your engine shuts off so does the heating and cooling. (the sales guys will try to give you all kinds of BS about this major design screw up and will tell you that you can turn it off, BUT you have to turn it off EVERY time you start your Jeep)  Now the GOOD NEWS.  there is a solution on the internet that just takes 3 seconds to plug in your maintenance port and allows YOU to decide if and when you ever want to use this extremely annoying feature (I did drive the first 500 miles with the ESS feature enabled and it was very annoying to both me and my wife).  I would not of purchased a jeep if I hadn’t of already found a great solution to overcome this design flaw at http://www.smartstopstart.com/ .  NOTE: Jeep is not the only manufacturer that uses this dumb stop/start idea so educate yourself before you purchase any car.... 2018 will be even worse.I love just about everything about my new 2017 GC jeep, but would NEVER recommend it to anyone without the smart stop/start module.

This is a very different vehicle for me. I had previously only driven BMW 3-Series (except for brief stint with Infiniti) but wanted to move into an SUV. Every time I open the door to my Jeep I'm greeted with a level of luxury that you would find on a premium make. I opted for a loaded model with the Luxury and Active Safety Group. Both upgrades I would fully recommend. The Panoramic roof really brightens up the all black interior, while the LED DRL add an aggressive look. The adaptive cruise system is excellent. It can control your speed all the way down to a standstill but will only hold the brakes for about 3 seconds. Where it exceeds other systems on the market is following distance, it doesn't leave a huge gap in vehicles (allowing other drivers to cut in) at the closet setting. Making it actually functional in city traffic. Other active safety features include self-parking which works great once it locks onto a spot, as well as the lane keeping system, which subtlely nudges you back into your lane if drifting. The V6 is plenty of power in this car, especially after the 2016 upgrades. I average about 18mpg driving around (60% city/40% highway). My only complaint so far is in regard to the SRT seats included on the Trailhawk model. While the bolsters on the back piece are great, the bottom portion are a little tight. An adjustable bolster system similar to my old 328i would help. My only long term concern is reliability, an attribute FCA isn't known for, hence why I leased. I'll report back after put some more miles on.",5

The CAM sensor doesn't work and at the ignition start sets off your engine light and other issues. There weren't parts to fix it and had to wait. Finally was able to get into a 2017-same edition thinking it was just this one. After only owning for one week, back in the shop with the exact same issue. They fixed it by putting in new diffusers. I have been back on the road for less than two weeks, same issue has come up again. Two brand new jeeps and the same issue. They say there aren't issues with this edition but seriously, two in less than a year with the exact same issue. I have been patient and trying to work with the dealership on this. I have lost all confidence in the jeep brand. Great to hear that so many individuals out there are having a great experience with the brand. It just must not be for me.

However, I do get plenty of seat time behind the wheel, so here's my personal experience. After owning a late model XJ Cherokee for over a decade, my parents picked up this 2005 WK Grand Cherokee almost 5 years ago. I believe it is the Rocky Mountain trim? Not 100% sure, but it is not a Limited model. It has the 4.7 8-cylinder, Quadra-Trac 4x4, two-tone grey leather, sunroof, heated seats, and that's about it on options. It now has almost 154K and it was bought with about 64K. It has generally been a very reliable rig in the almost 5 years of ownership. The 4.7 has been pretty much bulletproof. It runs great, it's pretty quiet, and it sounds damn mean if you lay into it. Not a Hemi by any means, but it and the 5-speed makes for a worthy power-train. With the exception of a new water pump installed and some electrical gremlins resolved at approximately 135K, and a 90K tune-up, oil changes have otherwise been the only maintenance performed. In the beginning of ownership, we did had issues with the vehicle stalling when you're coming to a stop. The dealer couldn't figure out the cause of this either. But, we found that if you run mid-grade gasoline, the stalling doesn't stop completely, but it stalls a whole lot less often, and it even seems to run a little better. It has never stalled on me personally. One more thing of note, the key fobs are not made very well. Both original keys fell apart maybe two years ago. Aftermarket fobs do not last long either, so buy new ones from a dealer the first time. Also, I believe that the TPMS sensor is going bad. Even with all tires filled to recommended specs, the sensor will beep and the light will flash at start-up, and then will flash every so often while you're driving. Not a huge issue really. Quadra-Trac has been flawless. It's a Jeep, after all. Mileage is so-so, it's gotten no more than 19mpg on the highway, and it seems to average between 15-17. Interior wise, it has all held up pretty well. The driver seat has a tear (there when bought), and the climate controls on the dash have never illuminated the whole time we've had it. Not sure if this is a common issue with the WK models, but it can be a pain in the rear to make changes when driving at night. Other than those two things, the interior has again been pretty solid. No leaks from the sunroof, and the heated seats get real nice and warm. Overall, the Jeep has been a good reliable SUV. Being the first year of this body style, it has had its little issues and quirks. Definitely pick up a 2008-10 if you can find one. I believe the 4.7 for those years received a significant bump in power and a small gain in efficiency, and there are a few details inside and outside that I think dress up the vehicle a bit.  But the 2005-07 models won't leave you regretting your purchase by any means. If I didn't need to have a truck, I would not hesitate to daily one of these.",4

It's an all around extremely capable SUV. The interior is simple and spacious (I'm 6'6), the only change I needed to make was adding a new Kenwood radio. And for its size and rugged Jeep reputation its an extremely comfortable ride. As the title entails the HEMI is a plus, especially if you regularly tow like me.

The Quadratrac 4x4 system is a beast in the snow, even better than my XJ or Ranger were. It has more than enough features. The brakes and suspension are both good -it rides pretty nice. I'm also a big fan of the aesthetics of the vehicle, the color scheme and design is tastefully done. If I had to nitpick it would have to be about the door panels.

It does everything and anything you could possibly need. Need to get somewhere? Check. Need to go through bad weather? Check. Need to get groceries? Check. Need to tow something heavy? Check. Wanna attract the ladies? Check.---Now the downsides: You don't get to do the above that often. I don't know if it's just having the 2005 model, but frankly the car wasn't that good. Useful and practical, very; enjoyable not at all. It has a million little issues reliability wise, but with adequate maintenance, you'll never be stranded. Not to mention parts are cheap and very easy to find, but that in mind seeing warning lights and hearing beeps every 10 minutes into a ride gets annoying FAST. ---It has a horrible interior. I'm not nit-picky, but good lord, I have never seen an uglier interior. The colors for the dash can normally be ignored if nothing else, on most cars, but you're constantly reminded of it in this jeep. It may seem tolerable at first, but believe me, it's one of the worst interiors ever created. No where you can touch that won't feel scratchy, rough, or just simply displeasant. ---Onto the absolute worst parts: the seats. Some people like them. I didn't, you have to be fat to sit in them. Or have weird posture. The seats DO NOT hold you in place, unless you are almost fat albert levels of obese. This car has wide side bolsers, and way too much lumbar support. If you're young and charming, like myself, a wily fellow to whom extreme back support is unnecessary, you'll get sore and tired fast. Older folks or folks with weaker backs should be fine, because even the lowest settings for lumbar proved too much to me (the lowest lumbar setting was still excessive and exacerbated by how hard the seat are), and I found the seats to push against the top of my back too (the bulging part where they plant the jeep logo). Compared to the previous generation, these seats feel like lead and iron in terms of hardness and were my personal enemy for the 6months that I was stuck with the thing.As for seating room, I'd rather you think of it as a coupe. The back seats are somehow worse than tbe front seats lacking in depth or space at all for your legs. ---Onto performance, it was actually Not awful. It wasn't very good though; it had body lean in a straight line and I wasn't personally a fan of the way the transmission shifted and felt (1st second and third were rev happy, 4th wouldn'5 budge and no matter how hard you pressed on the pedal you'd have to wait a while for it to downshift), that's all my opinion of course, the first few cars I ever worked on were fords and chevies and even ford didn't have such a garbage transmission engine pairing. Chances are you'd like the jeep if you're used to driving diesel trucks. It has good power delivery I'll admit, and the gearing is pretty good up until it hits 4th gear (and more horribly 5th). It can stay in low gears pretty well when you ask it to I guess. It does have manual shift (poorly executed since you can't lock fifth gear) -and the 290-305 ft-lbs of torque let you accelerate without revving when you ARE stuck in high gear. The engine is good without a doubt, even if it has a horrible transmission pair. As I stated, this car has too much body lean for aggressive driving. You might not mind, you wouldn't expect an suv of its weight to handle at all; it has some low speed maneuverability which at times can be surprising. The suspension isn't as bouncy as the previous generation, and seating position is much lower and less tank like. If you want a jeep that still feels like you can go to war in it, look for the previous body style.---As per the technology, it's without a doubt simple and efficient, I have nothing bad to say.---Off-roading? Hahahahahahahaha! That's so 1963. But I guess it probably does it well, if you do an enormous amount of off roading, buy a wrangler instead. The grand cherokee is more for people who want to camp occasionally on a trail, but also have handy car around for when the time arrives. I sold my jeep to someone who wanted a replacement after he drowned his TJ in a mudpit at some mountain, his was a newer TJ and he was surprised at the tech that came with the Jeep especially its GPS console. ---Bottom line: if all you want is a nice commuter car, skip it. This jeep is for people who have other things to do, mountains to climb, and snowy parking lots to be alone with their girlfriend in.",3

1490, on 02/09/18 17:07 PM (PST),William ,1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4dr SUV 4WD,Last of the ZJ Series," This is my 2nd Jeep Grand Cherokee, so I already know what to expect.  I had a 96 prior to getting my 98.  They're the same with very few changes if any that a typical buyer would even know, and most dealers wouldn't know either.  Overall mine is great condition, and considered low mileage (150k) for being 20 years old.  I have the 4.0L Straight 6 and it gets up and moves just fine.  Gets mid 20's for fuel economy on the highway...its a box on wheels going down the road its not going to get excellent fuel economy...if you want that buy a Prius.  The Jeep Grand Cherokee is quite a capable vehicle in stock form, handles snow/ice/mud very well (with the right driver of course).  I opted for the Selec-Trac 4WD system in my 98.  My 96 had the Quadra-Trac 4WD system.  Both do great in snow/ice, but the Selec-Trac gives you the best of all worlds, 2WD, 4WD part time and full time, neutral and low range.  The Quadra-Trac is full time 4WD with neutral and low range.  These were offered with the 4.0L Straight 6 engine, a 318 (5.2L) V8, or a 360 (5.9L) V8 for only the 98 model year.  Any of these engines will give you great performance, the 5.9L V8 was a special package option of course.  Fuel economy averages around 12-14 in town, depending on your driving style, 4WD usage, terrain, speed, etc.  Highway fuel economy is going to be mostly based on your speed and driving style as well as the tires you have.  Expect low to mid 20's for regular highway driving at a steady speed and around 65mph, any faster and your fuel economy will of course drop just like any other vehicle.  My 96 Grand Cherokee had 232,000 miles on it when I sold it, and it still ran and drove great.  My current 98 has 151,000 miles on it and needs new stabilizer bushings and such, but nothing that keeps it from being extremely reliable.  The 6 cylinder models are rated to tow 5,000lbs, I can tell you they'll tow more but I wouldn't recommend doing so on a regular basis...also they no longer have an auxiliary external transmission cooler so if you want to do any towing I'd definitely recommend having one installed.  The V8 models are rated for 6,500lbs towing.  The back seat split folds 60/40 giving a very nice roomy cargo area.  My Jeep has the flip up glass in the rear hatch, making loading and unloading smaller items pretty easy, and keeping things from falling out that have been stuffed into the cargo area.  The spare tire does take up quite a bit of interior space on the left side of the cargo area, however.  Regular maintenance and good quality fuel and these things are going to take you anywhere you want to go anytime you want to go regardless of weather.  They have very good road manners even in crosswinds and they are balanced very well making them go in the snow/ice much better than many other similar vehicles.",5

But to be fair, I got my first last year (2WD) from a dirtbag liar, and it had never been serviced aside from oil- the battery was 13 years old!! Now that I've seen to the old and rotting Engine bay, the car is a gem. Still rock solid engine and transmission. Got it with 170K and I've put over 40K on it in the past year. The car was overpriced for what I was getting, but the interior was spotless. The speakers still sound really nice with classic '80s playing. The seats are in a lot better condition than my SO's '07 saturn.  I love this car so much I've bought another. This one is a 4WD, and in rougher shape due to leather seats and a busted front light but I'm ready to get it just as nice as mine currently is. I wouldn't ever trade my Jeep for another. If you want to buy a JGC Laredo, just make sure you focus on a few things: Is the PCM in good shape? How does it sound on the test drive? What do the hoses look like? And lastly, if the interior is good, then you're golden.",5

The cooling fan is electric and has two speeds.  The low speed fan switch just went out, the high speed switch is OK.  The shop was unable to find a replacement that day as they're not stock, I'll have to find one on my own.  Oh yes, when I put in the new cooling fan, I found out at a later date the shop stole the front part of the drive shaft.

When I reached my destination, the starter went out.  A guy from Auto Zone crawled under there, replaced the starter, told me the front part of the drive shaft was gone, as in stolen.I just read another guy's post.  He runs the heck out of it, stomps on the gas, drag races from one traffic signal to the next.  He also states he has to run premium fuel.  I always run mid-grade when driving in town, but I drive the vehicle gently.  For a while, I was accidentally running 87 as that's what my other vehicle uses, I didn't notice a difference.  There was some slight pinging but I had to put the window down and drive by a concrete barrier to hear it.  When I'm traveling cross country and going into the mountains, I use premium fuel.",5

And many more things over the years, it's like every other month somthing breaks down on it. Now it's a metal death trap because everytime I slow down/mash the brakes/ come to a stop, the RPMs drop to zero and the jeep shuts off and brakes and steering lock up WHILE IM DRIVING. even as your turning into a parking spot, or almost ramming into the back of a car because the thing just decided to shut off. Alot of times in a nervous wreck when I get home from almost crashing. Have spent many times trying to get the problem fixed but four different machanics at four different shops can't figure it out. It's now sitting in the yard because Im too scared to drive the junk.

After that, basic maintenance and that is all. A new battery was needed at year 6; in the last year the power door locks have given up working and the transmission is beginning to slip.

For the price of the vehicle it is easy to spend that money to have them done. When they are rebuilt they will last an easy 100k+ or more.  It is completely justifiable.

However, I think that I will soon have to replace the CV axles, which will cost me about $400.  My only gripes about the car are 1) the factory stereo system is kind of shot, but I can deal with that, and 2) the spare tire takes up a lot of room in the trunk space.

First off, the car is a beast. Fast and really thirsty. Would probably beat most going from 20-50 mph. I test drove a BMW M3 this past weekend and honestly the Jeep has more torque. For better performance I sometimes kill the OD switch which bumps up the RPMs. The car is also a beast in the snow. It's almost impossible to get it stuck in anything. That said, Jeep really dropped the ball on its construction. The rear differential is the same as the base model 6 Grand Cherokee and can't handle the torque.

1560, on 08/31/18 22:46 PM (PDT),Richard from MA ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),A great SUV ruined by software engineers," Amazingly capable, go-anywhere vehicle.  Rugged but extremely luxurious.  Beautiful interior with quality leather and wood everywhere.  Terrific MPG, over 20, with plenty of power.  Rides like a dream.  Gorgeous metalflake auburn pearl paint and medium brown leather seats and dash covering.  Only gripe about the vehicle per se is poor back seat and cargo room.  But I was thrilled to get rid of it after 10K miles for the following reasons.  Gearshift is awful and dangerous, even after klugy recall fix (automatically shifts into Park if driver’s door is opened).  Radio turns on at random.  Has front and rear bumper sensors, but front sensor alarm activates even in reverse.  Radar controlled (speed adaptive) cruise control is a disaster: it turns off at random, and when it wants to resume the preset cruise speed it does so by accelerating at full throttle if the vehicle is more than 20 miles below the preset speed - very disconcerting.  Navigation alerts you to traffic jams ahead and ask if you want to reroute.  You push the No button, and then the navigation asks you the same question every 60 seconds until you just turn it off.  I could live with all these annoyances, but not the following - if you exit the vehicle with the key in your pocket, but forget to turn off the push button ignition, there is no alarm or notification.  If you are distracted, park in your garage and forget to push the ignition button to turn off the engine, odds are good that you and your family will be dead in a few hours from CO poisoning.  With the right software fixes, which will probably never happen, and a bigger back seat, it could be a great vehicle.",3

Next the transmission was recalled due to a software update.  The Jeep would sometimes still be in D when people thought it was parked.  Sounds ridiculous but it actually happened to me once while I was jumping a friends car off in front of me.  I almost rolled forward and hit their car.  So this week the evaporation vent solenoid is being replaced.  I was receiving a check engine light warning.  Inititally, I was told the gas cap probably was just left open.  They reset it and I went on my way, after I was on my way, I realized hmmm, there is no gas cap.  So a week later, back in the shop getting this repaired.  While they were fixing that, I asked the service adviser to check the AC.  It's makes this weird depressurization noise about every 20 seconds.  They found a leak in the compressor, it is being replaced.  Now, all these problems have been covered under warranty so far.  I have 31k miles on the vehicle at this point and I take meticulously good care of my cars.  I guess I'm stuck wondering what will happen when it's not under warranty?  Yeah, stay clear.

The Caddy was fully loaded, wanted to keep it, but the lease residual was greater than the market :-(.  Looked at the Jeep many times over the years and came zzzzisss close a couple of times.  Now took the plunge and so very glad I did.  Roomier cargo area and that's important for hauling 2 90 lb. German Shepherds, plus a Lab and a Boston (doesn't everyone buy a car to fit their dogs?!).  The car had higher mileage than I initially was looking for, but when I test drove the car, the ride and acceleration sold me.  Whoever was the previous owner babied this car, no dings, scratches, anywhere.  Love the panorama roof, and the interior space is roomy and comfortable.   Good line of sight all the way around.  The navigation, I'm not that impressed with -- too many steps to get from pt A to pt B when entering your destination, but it does get you to where you're going, ultimately.  Controls on the console, especially raising the car when driving on terrain, keep getting stepped on by my Boston, but that's my problem.  Instrumentation, like any other auto, have to figure it out, set it, and then you're okay.  Car runs very quiet, no rattles.  Sound system is very nice.

The Trans has been re-programmed once or twice at dealer whch makes me a littler nervous but thus far it has been shifting fine. I have the rare Deep Forest Green with light tan interior. It's basically almost Black which means its a bit of a 'PIA' to keep clean. If I can pick my favorite part of owning this model it would be its styling. This thing turns heads like I thought it never would. I mean you see a million JGC's on the road and when I stop at a light or at a gas station someone is always checking it out. IMO this is the best looking JGC since it's inception. Good move on Chrysler's behalf to keep this body style until 2018.

1571, on 03/17/17 17:48 PM (PDT),R Miller ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),This Jeep is a Safety Hazard," Redbird2455Mar 10, 1:14 PM PSTSince purchasing a Jeep Grand Cherokee in April of 2015 the forward collision warning system has engaged approximately 6-10 times, with flashing lights, warning on the dash and audible alarms when a vehicle traveling a good length in front of my Jeep was turning right and I was going straight on a city street. Although it has been an adrenaline raising situation I had not had it in for service just because of the hassle of doing so. On February 16, 2017 the vehicle crash avoidance system and brake mitigation engagement which included flashing lights, a warning on the dash, audible alarms and now abrupt, hard sustained braking occurred on a highway at 55 mph. I was nearly rear ended, as there was no reason for this very abrupt, hard braking. I immediately took it to the dealer, Transit Town Jeep in Williamsville, NY where I had purchased it, for service. Of course, all systems checked out fine. The next day following my service visit the same thing happened with all the alarms, lights and abrupt hard braking, (slamming on the brakes) but this time there had been no vehicle in front of me or anywhere around. I was on a two lane rural road traveling at 45mph with no vehicle approaching in the oncoming lane and no parked vehicles on either side of the road. There were no objects on the shoulder or side of the road. There was absolutely nothing to set this “safety system” off. It's very stressful driving a vehicle that may brake hard at any moment for no reason and you have absolutely no control. I took the vehicle back to the same dealer and we went through the same process. After four days, on February 24th the dealer informed me again that nothing could be found to be wrong and that I should pick up my vehicle. The vehicle is still at Transit Town Jeep, as it is not safe to drive. On February 24th I called the FCA Customer Assistance Center and opened a claim. By March 8th I was notified there was no problem with the vehicle, because the technicians could not get the vehicle to engage the anti-collision system while they test drove it.As of today, March 10, the vehicle sits in my driveway as it is a safety hazard. If I were traveling 55 mph with a tractor trailer or large truck behind me and this system engaged, I would probably not live to complain about it. I have 14 months left on a lease that they will not let me out of, so I am stuck.In researching this dangerous safety issue I have learned that this exact problem has happen to others beginning in 2014. It is not a common occurrence; therefore there has been no official recall by Chrysler. It’s interesting that there does not seem to be a remedy either.I have also learned that if you choose to use this collision avoidance system in your vehicle, you need to turn it on each and every time the vehicle is started. I have never “turned this feature on”, which leads me to ask why is this system dangerously and improperly engaging when it isn’t even turned on? Jeep has  not stood behind their product and have given no indication that they are at all concerned about this vehicles safety hazard.",1

The ride, comfort, acceleration, handling jet everything was so much better than the 4Runner.  I ended up getting a used 2015 GC Limited with the technology package and the luxury package. My GC had 12,000 miles on it when I bought it and was in immaculate condition. I have a 65 mile round highway commute for work everyday and live on a very ruff dirt road by the river so My Jeep takes a beating with all of the bumps, washouts and flooding.  It has never made a creek or squeak and still handles and rides perfect! I now have around 50,000 miles on it and it still looks and feels like a brand new one. I've only had one thing replace in the year and a half I've had it and that was my back up camera, it was damaged from a high pressure drive through car wash around 30,000 miles and was covered under the warranty. I always get compliments on my Jeep and my friends want to take my GC when we go out because of the style and comfort. 3 of my friends have gone out and bought a Grand Cherokee of their own after riding in mine.

Buyer beware - read the reviews/complaints before spending all this money on a vehicle that has so much hesitation on acceleration that I'm pretty sure I'm going to get killed.  A vehicle is suppose to move forward when pressing on the gas peddle. Instead the engine rev's really loud like I'm in a plane taking off but your still not going anywhere.  In the meantime, the window of opportunity to pull out is quickly decreasing because of oncoming traffic (to the point where I would no longer feel safe in doing so) Then the car finally reacts and lurches forward throwing everyone back in their seats.  To oncoming traffic and passengers in my car, it looks like I'm pulling out at the last minute and cutting them off.  This happens during All accelerations, back streets and highway driving.

Love the torque, acceleration and great gas mileage and towing abilities and FCA makes by far the best and most intuitive U Connect infotainment system out there. I read all the negative reviews on here regarding the issues w the diesel and 8 speed tranny on the 2014, but these have been fixed on the 15, 16 models.

1586, on 03/25/16 07:38 AM (PDT),Paul ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),HORRIBLE ELECTRONIC SHIFTING SYSTEM," I strongly suggest that you should not purchase one of these vehicles until the terrible, dangerous, unreliable, finicky electronic shift program is changed.1) Every time I start this Jeep and pull back the console shift lever to put it in drive, nothing happens the first time.  I have to repeat this action twice to get the transmission into Drive.  Because this shift lever is not connected mechanically to the transmission, it relies on sensors to read what position (Park, Drive, Reverse, Neutral...) you are trying to get the transmission to shift to.  This system is either very poorly designed, is made up of faulty components, is poorly programmed, or (you fill in the blank...)When I want to back up, it often takes several tries to get the vehicle to move into the Reverse position.  With almost every other automatic transmission ever built, there is a detent, or notch that you feel when shifting into a different gear.  Not so with this terrible design.  The console shift lever has a 'Home"" position that is resides in until you try to convince it to ""sense"" the gear that you're trying to shift to.When I am going through an automatic car wash and get to the end, I can't just move the transmission from neutral to drive quickly to get out of the way of the vehicle that is just 2-3 feet behind me.  NO. Instead I have to push the button on the shift lever (no big deal) AND step on the brake pedal before I can get it into Drive!!!  This really freaks out the driver behind me, often causing them to hit their brakes when they see my brake lights come on.  Since they are still on the transport system of the car wash, this then crashes the car wash drive and they have to stop and reset their system.I have owned close to 40 cars and trucks, most of them with automatic transmissions.  I have NEVER had one that requires the driver to step on the brake pedal when shifting from Neutral to Drive.  This is stupid, cumbersome and DANGEROUS.I have taken this vehicle to the dealer many times, asking them to fix these problems, only to be told that pretty much everyone who owns one of these has brought it back with the same request for ""repairs"".  The answer is that there is NO REPAIR or adjustment available.  They actually designed it to work this way.I wish I had not purchased this vehicle and feel sorry for everyone who has one.If there is any good news in this at all, it is that our lovely Federal Government is now engaged in an ""Engineering Review"" of all the complaints about this vehicle's electronic shift program to see if it needs to be elevated to a RECALL.  I don't know how it can't be.",3
1587, on 03/22/16 05:57 AM (PDT),Ron ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Looks Great But!!!," I really wanted one of these. My son has a 2014 Grand Cherokee Limited and i fell in love with it. The overall ride, comfort, features. So I did a lot of different car shopping and settled on a 2015 Grand Cherokee Limited in Red, the color I really wanted. I got a good deal. Second day I had it I could not program the memory seats. Took it back to the dealer which was great, salesman and service manager looked at it for about 30 minutes and could not get it to work so I had to make an appointment to bring it in. Few days later smelling oil from the vehicle in my garage. Looked underneath it and oil dripping from it. Took it right down to dealer as it is close to my home and they brought it right in and said my power steering pump was leaking and they would have to replace the entire pump. 700 miles and new pump. Said I could drive it as they would have to order part would have it in a day or 2. So I go to take it in in 2 days and a puddle of oil by my back tire. My rear shock was bad, they had to replace that also. So 2 major things with under 1000 miles on it. The power seats the push pin connector was bent. Now fast forward I have 3000 miles on it and my front tire was at 9 lbs thought I picked up a nail or something so took it to dealer. They found nothing in tire so thought it was the valve stem, replaced it. well next day tire low again and the next day low again. Back at the dealer today for low tire issue. I think I may have a lemon. I hope this is it with the problems. I had Subarus for the last 3 years with not 1 problem. I buy this car and nothing but problems in the first month. I really like the vehicle but I am hating the inconvenience and the poor reliability. Paid a lot of money for this. The dealer has been great so far.",3
1588, on 03/18/16 07:56 AM (PDT),Clarence Carlson ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),A great all around SUV," Update 9/22/17:  I've had it 2 years now. Trips to the mechanic have been for oil changes and tire rotation.  Last winter went through 8 inch snow (before the plow) without any issues and honestly I have yet to spin a tire. I've owned 6 Jeeps since 1978 and this gets through bad weather better than any of them. Ave gas mileage is now 23-24 and once, while driving from Iowa to Kansas City MO I was getting 29 mpg @ 60 mph. It gives a solid ride, has great handling and is quiet. Still would recommend it.  When I was shopping for this car all of the other SUV's/Crossovers on the lots had much higher sticker prices. It's a great value. What follows is my original review. I looked over all the SUV's on the market, did research for 3 months. I wanted something that held 5 passengers (don't need 7 passenger seating), decent gas mileage, reasonable creature comforts but not all the bells and whistles. Something that, if there was a sudden zombie takeover, I could drive off the road without worrying about how the car would hold up. Already had a 7 year old Patriot so I knew what I could expect in the way of service at my local Jeep dealer. I decided on a fairly basic Laredo with tow package and a few add ons. My dealer posts the bottom line no haggle price on line so I knew the cost (about three grand down from sticker). Finally saw one listed on line locally and went in to look at it. The test drive, used car evaluation (they gave me very close to book in spite of all the squeaks and rattles) and decision to buy took about 30 minutes. I've been buying cars since 1978 and this is the smoothest experience I've had to date. So what did I get?A very smooth ride: if you need a better ride you will pay much more. Great handling on dry pavement and in snow: I live in Minnesota where this is critical. Nice interior that is quiet on the road. Comfortable seats for everyone; I got the power drivers seat with adjustable lumbar support which is excellent. A peppy 3.6 L engine that does better than I really need (you have to have driven a 4 cylinder engine to appreciate this). Gas mileage: about 22-23 day to day and on one three hour trip I got 28 mpg all highway. I really like the gauges which are well done and controls are sensibly laid out. Room? I just returned from a vacation where we loaded 4 adults and all the luggage and had plenty of room. Overall I've had it six months and can't find anything I would change. So far I've not had any service issues. I did purchase an extended bumper to bumper warranty.",5

1591, on 03/03/16 10:06 AM (PST),Andrew Hastings ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Generally a Disappointment this Time Around," In the Fall of 2014 we purchased a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit and our purchase decision was based primarily on the high level of satisfaction we had from purchasing a 2012 Grand Cherokee Summit in the Fall of 2011. Simply put, we were very satisfied Jeep customers as the 2012 had exceeded all of our expectations at that time. It was a stunningly beautiful vehicle, well designed and performed flawlessly over the first three years of ownership. The 2012 had experienced only two service required issues. One to replace a prematurely wearing seat bottom (warranty at 20,000 miles) and the second a failed heat diverter (owner cost, out of warranty). Other than that it was gas, oil and go for over 100,000 miles in a little under 3 years.At this point (Fall of 2015) we decided to replace my wife's 2013 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab 4x4 with a second Summit and became the proud owners of a new Grey one but this time equipped with the Hemi V8. This upgrade in power really changed the performance of the Grand Cherokee positively and surprisingly only resulted in around a 2 mpg loss in fuel economy which was quite amazing. Most of our driving with both Jeeps is purely highway and the V6 averages around 24.5 while the V8 comes in at around 22.5 with both running at around 70 mph on relatively flat terrain. This sadly is where the good news ends.It is hard to believe that these two vehicles were built in the same factory. The difference in quality is immediately quite evident. Paint quality on the 2015 is quite frankly ""poor"". Botchy and thin paint gives the vehicle a mottled look...as a matter of fact the factories inability to produce a quality paint finish caused them to cease production on several colors during the 2015 model year. This vehicle came new from the factory with more squeaks, rattles and strange noises than our 2012 had after 100,000 miles of driving. After a couple of months ownership the navigation system began giving false readings and this defect spread into all functions within the radio, navigation, heater A/C screen finally culminating in all functions in-operative and a pure black screen. It took numerous ""Updates"", trips to 4 different dealers and finally a complete radio/nav, heater A/C module and screen replacement authorized by Jeep Engineering in Detroit to remedy. During one service attempt the Jeep was in a dealership out of service for almost 2 weeks...not a ringing endorsement for an almost $60,000 vehicle....!!!!!Moving on, the 8 speed transmission exhibits a nasty habit of refusing to upshift through the gears from a dead stop. Upon accelerating it stays firmly in 1st gear and will only come out after pulling over, putting the vehicle into park and then attempting to drive forward through the gears again. Updates to this point have failed to cure the issue. This leads into the electronic gear shift itself. Quite frankly, it is a very dangerous feature of this generation Jeep Grand Cherokee and has been changed completely for the 2016 model year. The chances of a failed complete move to park has resulted in injuries to Jeep owners exiting their vehicle thinking it is park when it is in fact in reverse. A very poor design since eliminated by Jeep.Summing up the 2015 Summit I can only say it is an enigma for sure. We want very much to love it especially with the performance of the Hemi V8 which makes it a really fun SUV to drive. Additionally the size and configuration of a SUV and in particular this SUV is perfect for our use. But, the issues we have had with the vehicle are not what we expected from a highly awarded and expensive vehicle.If I may, I would like to shift gears (pardon the pun) back to the 2012 Summit. Shortly after buying the 2015 the ""engine warning light"" on the dash of the 2012 came on and a distinct engine misfire became evident. A trip to the Jeep dealer netted a diagnosis of a failed cylinder head which was a defect in the early V6 Pentastar engines and which is covered by a Jeep/Chrysler extended warranty (150,000 miles). All costs involved in replacing the left side cylinder head are covered by this extended warranty but this dealership added additional repairs (which I agreed to) and which added an ""out of pocket"" expense of over $600.00 to the engine repair. Also the 2012 GC had developed an annoying rattle in the rear end which they diagnosed as worn and loose shock absorbers that they replaced at a cost of $700.00 (again authorized my myself). Now if the cost of shock replacement wasn't bad enough, when the vehicle was picked up the rattle was still there. Not to mention that when I checked part pricing for the shock absorbers themselves, the OEM shocks they installed cost $138.00 each while a neighboring Jeep dealer quoted them at $96.00 They claim their dealership has its own part pricing matrix. Simply put, the poor quality was bad enough but the recent servicing we experienced cost Jeep a customer...we have purchased our last Jeep product.",2
1592, on 02/26/16 23:55 PM (PST),JD ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),MY JEEP MADE MOTION SICK!!!," I purchased my Jeep  2015 Grand Cherokee Laredo last September 2015, and I was very happy about it cause I was purchasing an American made vehicle. It was my first jeep. After driving for one day, I went back to the dealership service department to find out what that little motor sounding noise was under the hood. Don't you know that no one there could tell me what it was? This sound comes and goes and I was stuck living with it thinking it was just something normal about it. Then after driving for a week or two, I felt as thought I was driving a manual car. When slowing down and coming to a stop, the transmission would shift kind of weird. As it was shifting down and I could feel that jerky motion it in my head and it was making me motion sick. This went on for a while and I wasn't sure what to do. So I took it to service where it was determined that my car needed a ""software update"". But after getting my car back, it was back to the same old thing. So I wrote to jeep about the problem and was told to take it back to service. So I did just that and I had two service people drive with me while I drove my car. The first person tried to blame the problem on the road surface. But then the second person, who told me that he too experienced motion sickness during his life and he drove with me and I told him about the transmission and how it was kind of jerky when I slow and brake to a stop. He told me that Jeep had changed their transmission to eight speed and that eventually will be going to a nine speed transmission. And these are his words, ""the new transmission is more jerky"". I had to agree with him. So after this, Jeep consumers office contacted me and told me that they were unable to help me because my car was okay and there was nothing to repair. What a joke I thought. I spend all this money for a lousy car that I thought was high quality when in fact it wasn't. Since I couldn't drive this car anymore, I had to trade it in for a more reliable ""Japanese"" car and I know I'll be happy with it. And at lease I won't have to get ""software updates"" for it. I'm so happy with that. Jeep, you're history for me!!!",1

I'm always on Edmund's reading up on cars so i wanted to write one after reading other reviews on the GC. First, at first glance, this SUV is absolutely awesome. I got a silver Limited with the Luxury II package, black interior for less than 40k (last one on the lot, they're trying to get rid of them before the 16's, I was already pre-approved, etc). The stance and LED run lamps really set this vehicle off. Not a huge fan of the plastic molding along the bottom (wouldn't look as bad if I had a black one) or the single exhaust pipe but they're not dealbreakers obviously. Love the brake lights as well. The interior is pretty plush. Few "" cheap bits"" here and there but not really noticeable if you're not a car person or have owned higher end cars. This is my first time owning a vehicle with ventilated seats or paddle shifters so I'm anxious to try those out. The panoramic roof is an option I never really considered before but it definitely wowed my wife when she realized it was there. It was fun going through all the display configurations both directly in front and on the 8.4"" screen. We wont be getting used to EVERYTHING it can do for a good while I think. One thing that absolutely cracked me up was no CD player. I guess from having Bluetooth, an SD card slot, integrated music apps, aux ports, etc, they figure no one really wants CD players. But we do! Both me and my wife laughed about it after looking in every logical place for it. Reminds me of when we started seeing less and less cars with cassette decks. I saw someone mention not having a liftgate button on their key fob, but mine does so I'm not sure if that's just an option/package thing. Glad the liftgate also goes back up if there's an obstruction (read: kids).  The Uconnect seems to be a GREAT investment if you can get it. That would be a long paragraph in itself so definitely research it. All in all, just great looking, great feeling car. Could have got a Limited without the Luxury package or even a Laredo and probably been satisfied. The additional options just take it over the top and this is a vehicle we plan to have for a long while so why not. I can only imagine how the Overland and Summit folks feel about theirs. I just personally feel like, at the price I got it for, this vehicle cannot be beat. I'm VERY nervous about the reliability and transmission issues I've heard about (when we parked it for the night, it had 19 miles on the dash). I hope to report back that I'm one of the lucky ones with no issues. I heard the same thing about Dodge Chargers in 2011, but I bought one new and didn't have anything major go wrong. Just a few little gremlins the dealership took care of no sweat. If I can say the same or better about this vehicle then it's absolutely a hit.",4
1611, on 11/16/15 19:51 PM (PST),TJ ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Outstanding Thus Far!," I recently purchased a Summit V6 Platinium Edition. I will not bore you all with a regurgitation of all of the positive reviews. But thus far, I've nothing but very positive remarks concerning this truck.  I am a long time BMW/Range Rover/Mercedes/Porsche owner/fan and believe me when I say that I am pleasantly surprised as the GC Summit has all of the amenities pound for pound of a much more expensive vehicle! I'm deeply impressed with the transmission, infotainment system, 825 HK sound system, ergonomics, etc! I paid 47K and trust me there is not a better ride per the price point! Below, I've listed my hits/misses. Pls note I test drove the RR Sport, BMW X6, Mercedes ML, Audi Q5/7 , and the Porsche Cayenne. All are fine vehicles in their own class but I chose the Summit based off of the criterion listed below coupled with the ability to take it off road. The RR Sport came in a close second but I was highly annoyed to find that it (as well as many other vehicles) utilize a sound resonator to give the vehicle a ""acceleration growl"".  Maintenance was also a huge issue. Hands down, the BMW has the best warranty but initial cost of a similarly equipped vehicle would run over 70K.  I also drove the GC SRT, V8, and V6. The SRT is a hug miss and although very aggressive, it seemed to be very clumsy. The V8 is outstanding but poor gas mileage was a deterrent. I chose the V6 as although it is short 30 HP less than the V8, it is peppy, uses regular gas, and gets over 26 MPG on the HWY. The vehicle lofts a bit (typical truck/SUV) when driving but I did not purchase for a sporty ride. I wanted a tough truck that I could utilize as a daily driver as well as take off road for the occasional camping trip. This vehicle has yet to disappoint thus far, I'm hoping the trend continues. Great Job Jeep! Hits:Air suspension, off road prowess/toughness, good looks, 825 watt sound system, ergonomics/display, usb/power ports galore, large heated steering wheel, adaptive cruise control, warning/safety features, heated/cooled seats, panoramic roof, voice control, multifunction display, smooth transmission, drive / ride comfort quality, and gas mileage...by the way, the V6 uses regular unleaded gas!Misses: Front seats are too boxy/boring and are the same found in some other Chrysler vehicles. There is an immediate need for thigh/side bolsters, quality of leather, the nav system is highly functional but looks cheap / cartoonish, heat/ac thermostat is not accurate, headlight washer only comes on every 12 swipes, wiper fluid is not heated, there is no dead petal for foot fatigue, the rear hatch should have an adjustable height option along with a glass panel opening option, sport mode is pretty much a waste of time, and the 36 month warranty reflects a lack of confidence in this vehicle.",5
1612, on 11/13/15 15:01 PM (PST),Tony Wheeler ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),I got a Hemi!," 6 month ownership review:  I have just under 7000 miles on my Jeep now.  I am still loving it.  No warranty issues so far and no fuss.  I took it in recently for its first oil change.  Driving it on the highway is a pleasure.  The cabin is dead quiet at highway speeds and the stereo cranks out some great sounding tunes.  The seats are comfortable on long trips, short trips and everything in between.  Ride height and view of the road is perfect.  I had the front door glass tinted.  The high roof line allows the hot Southeast sun to come into the side glass even in the middle of the day during the winter months.  The tint took a lot of that heat and glare away.  The Hemi is really coming alive now as the engine and drivetrain have broken in with some miles.  I have no issue with the electronic shifter myself.  I like the sleek look it gives the center console.__________________I searched and test drove just about every SUV model offered.  I just couldn't find something that excited me.  I decided to take a look at the Jeep and was pleasantly surprised at the build quality, fit and finish, and overall appearance.  Finally, an exciting SUV.  I am enjoying my new Summit 4X4 V8 Hemi immensely.  This is my first Jeep and my first Chrysler product since I drove a 1966 Plymouth Fury in High School.  I had an X5 for over 9 years.  I like the Jeep better.  I also love the V8 Hemi engine although it is a bit thirsty.  Still, the torque and the growl of the engine makes me forget all about fuel economy.  I'm sure it will improve as this Jeep breaks in.  The interior is plush and great looking.  I like the look and feel of the leather dash.  The HK stereo is truly audiophile grade.  Combined with the quiet cabin the music is clear and detailed like I'm sitting in my living room.  The only thing I notice is the navigation takes a good minute to boot up and the stereo is slow to start if playing from an iPod or an SD card.  That seems surprisingly slow this day and age.The air suspension seems to give the Jeep the best of everything.  The ride is solid but not harsh.  The handling is firm and sporty.  I like to take the curves hard and this Jeep holds the road well.  The interior is the quietest of any car I have ridden in.  Even at highway speeds a whisper can be heard across the cabin.  All in all a very impressive vehicle.  I don't know about reliability yet but several coworkers have been driving Jeeps with no issues.  That was enough to go for it.",5
1613, on 11/11/15 11:09 AM (PST),Arthur Sentle ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Cheap looking same old design," Friend bought a 2006 GC brand new that I fell in love with. It was a basic model but did have the 4x4 and towing packages. 9 years later and now that I could afford one, I bought a 2015. I wish I would have had the opportunity and had at least a two day test drive period. First of all Fiat has cheapened the exterior by eliminating the dual exhausts and adding that ugly plastic trim along the bottom. Next the Uconnect  is a nightmare especially since the heated seats and other options aren't controlled by a physical knob. The dash squeaks so I know as my Jeep ages these squeaks will become really annoying. The steering wheel is too thick, your hands become sore after a long drive. Even with the lumbar and other seat controls, your back is sore after two or more hours of constant driving.  Cheap interior trim and my leather seats are starting to crack in the FL heat and humidity.  The dealer just repaired my transmission.... others have had the same problem... and now the A/C compressor is bad. It keeps recycling every 15 seconds as if there is not enough refrigerant in the system. Anyone who is really serious about buying this model or other Chrysler Fiat models, read the Consumer Report reviews. You'll change your mind in an instant.  As with all Chrysler products, their styling is stuck in the mid 2000's.",2

Having come from a similarly sized SUV that treated us well for 12 years, I really wanted to upgrade our technology and other features we didn't have. The dealer let me take the Jeep home for 24 hours to decide. Unfortunately the Jeep drives poorly -- it rolls severly in turns and is not quick or zippy like you'd think given the engine. It also drives like a car much bigger than it is. It doesnt help that the steering wheel is incredibly thick. I dont know how any one would want to drive this day in and day out. It's really too bad because the Jeep does come with a TON of features and is a great value for what you get, from that aspect. And the Jeep LOOKS good. Recommendation is to really make sure you've given it a proper test drive before buying. I was *this* close to buying but decided to take the dealer's offer to drive it for a day.",1
1616, on 10/21/15 10:28 AM (PDT),Lisa ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Transmission Stalled and other issues -updated," I purchased my Jeep GC Limited on 9/5/2015. The engine light came on at 250 miles in the first week. The evaporation canister gasket was bad and needed to be replaced.  Dealer was able to fix within 1 day. At 1,600 miles while driving in city traffic slowing down for a traffic light the vehicle jumped forward twice like I had been rear-ended. This was caused by the transmission shifting down from 3 to 2 and 2 to 1. The vehicle then went into to ""limp"" mode and I could not go over 5MPH and the transmission was stuck in 1st gear. I managed to get out of traffic and into a parking lot. Had this happened in a busy intersection or while merging into busy, fast moving highway it could have been deadly.  I called roadside assistance and the JGC had to be towed to the nearest dealer. They have had the vehicle for 4 days and now have told me they will have to ""tear down"" the transmission to try to figure out what is wrong. When the cause is determined Chrysler will determine if the transmission will be fixed or replaced based on their ""70% rule"". The first time we put the back seat down the headrest fell off of the passenger-side rear seat and could not be put back in place. The dealer had to fix this because a clip was missing. Again, could have been dangerous if the headrest had fallen off in an accident and your head was whiplashed against against the two metal rod mounts.My family has been loyal to Chrysler and have owned nothing but Dodge's since 2000. We have owned 2 Ram 1500's, a Durango, and an Avenger.  All were great vehicle.  Chrysler and Jeep you missed the level of expected quality and reliability with the new Jeep Grand Cherokee models!  When you pay upwards of $40,000 for a high-end vehicle you expect better quality, reliability and service than this. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is promoted as the ""Most Awarded SUV"" ever.  Jeep has been long known for it quality and great products however, it seems Chrysler and Jeep are being very silent regarding all of the recent transmission issues.  Perhaps the transmission issues are going to be ignored and swept under the rug to avoid bad publicity.  Come on Chrysler and Jeep your loyal customers deserve better than this!!!Check out the reviews for the 2014's and the 2014 and 2015 Dodge Durango, these vehicles have the same transmissions. The electronic transmissions are shifting from park to reverse on their own, not staying in gear, getting stuck in gear, and shifting roughly.  Also check out the Jeep Cherokee which also has many reports of transmission problems.The NHTSB also has many transmission issues reported and is contemplating a class-action lawsuit regarding the number of injuries and safety issues that surround the transmission coming out of park and rolling away causing injury to people and damage to the vehicle and surrounding property.4/2017 - I have not had any additional issues with the JGC, it now has 23,000 miles on it.  A recall was issued for the transmission ""rolling away"" issues. I did not have problems with this happening but have always been cautious and paid close attention to the gear shifter and indicator lights to ensure the proper gear was illuminated. I had the recall work completed this month and do note a bit of a hesitation at idle speeds, which I believe was the intent to prevent roll aways. I have not noted any additional changes with the operation of the vehicle. While I was very disappointed with the initial performance of my JGC it has been a very reliable vehicle since the transmission was replaced at 1,600 miles and I have not had additional issues. It performs well and provides a comfortable ride for highway and city driving. It handles well in rain, snow and ice.   We took our JGC on a 3,000+ mile vacation to the Smoky Mountains and we're very pleased with how the JGC responded to mountain driving.  There was enough room for 4 adults and a teen and all our luggage/gear in the JGC. It was a snug fit but not uncomfortable.  When planned appropriately you can fit alot into the cargo area and other storage areas in the vehicle.",4
1617, on 10/03/15 06:45 AM (PDT),skycop1226@gmail.com ,2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),First Jeep," I believe that the overall value of this vehicle comparring ride comfort, affordability and quality put it at a moderately high level.   Recently moved from South Florida to the northwest corner of Arkansas. I soon realized with the approaching winter my 2015 BMW 428i coupe was not  going to survive the snow and ice associated with winters in this area. Taking all the variables into account , I started researching viable four-wheel-drive SUVs. Comparing the cost-benefit ratio's and my needs as a single person, I chose the Grand Cherokee over other Jeep models and the competition.  My 4 x 4 Limited is a nice mixture of the luxury amenities as well as the traditional Jeep practicality.   Not 100% sold on the 20 inch wheels however.  Without purchasing the upgraded off road terrain package, it was only available in the 20 inch platform.   For the individual wanting to truly experience the off-road, I would recommend upgrading and purchasing the 18 inch wheels.   If you're looking for a performance vehicle, the 3.6 may not be the engine for you.  With fuel cost currently being as low as they are, I'm personally wishing I had purchased the V8.   Must I must say, I didn't purchase it as a performance vehicle though, so the 3.6 will  suffice.   Interior visibility is less than optimal, but that's attributable to exterior styling. I must say, shifting the automatic transmission takes some getting used to.  I actually took it back to the shop because I couldn't get it into park without getting stuck in reverse. Then going through a two-step process of reengage the ""release button"" and jamming it forward.   After a little tutelage and practical application it was determined that it was operator error. Ha!  All in all, I must say that the Jeep Grand Cherokee is a nice blend of luxury, modern styling and practical usage.",4

When I take clients with me they are impressed that it's a Jeep. Constantly telling me they can't believe how luxurious it is on the inside. Driving at night is awesome the headlights turn on to brights on their own. Wipers have rain sensing on them. Looked at other 4x4 vehicles and just wasn't happy with the dash setup and options offered. Best options for the money I paid. Make sure to take out the MOPAR warranty instead of the dealer warranty. Mopar covers until 2098 bumper to bumper or 999,999 miles  on all major componets with $100 deductible. Take out a transmission at 150k 100 bucks to fix it. Warranty is pricey but well worth it.",5

Gets stuck in middle gears. Sloppy gear transition and overall poor engineering. This is the worst transmission I have ever experienced. If you want the truth on this car, read the 2014 reviews.  If you buy this truck after reading this you are crazy. I wish I did more homework. I know it's a major issue b/c this is the most common complaint. My father in law has exact same year/model and his is fine. Downshift when braking feels like you are in the car with someone that doesn't know how to drive stick. Just terrible.update 9/15/16-""software updates"" are their answers for everything.  Gears not as bad, but still sloppy enough to never buy this car again.  GPS screen has randomly gone black several times, which is a problem b/c the screen controls many features.  Dealership said they didnt see anything wrong and ""did a software update"" which did nothing to change the problem.  Every dealership is a nightmare to work with.  They truely do not want you there and treat you like you are bothering them.  they never have time and are always too busy.  When i tried to book the recall on the shifter, they said it was a three month waiting period.  the supposed recall fix is surprise again, a software update that will do nothing anyway.3/15/17The last update is pretty accurate.  I would actually come around and enjoy this truck if their service dept and crysler reputation were better. In the back of my mind I know that I shouldn't rely on a crysler product after 70k miles.  That and im still not a fan of the 8 speed transmission. Who knows, maybe the V8 isnt as bad. I guess it's possible that ratio between the engine power and weight of the vehicle arent balanced well. Couple that into 8 reminding gears...who knows. Very sharp looking, lots of gadgets and comfort are the good things. And you feel very secure on the road in bad weather.",3

I have been smitten with this iteration of the GC since it came out and bit the bullet earlier this month on a brand new 2015 Overland 4x2 V6. I initially was going in for the V8 but felt the V6 had enough power since I was not planning to tow anything.Overall I love the vehicle. The technology package is really awesome and I don't know how I lived without Adaptive Cruise control before. The auto start is a jewel to have as the cabin cools down in hot Texas by the time I get inside. Everyone who gets inside is impressed with the stitching, the pano roof, and the comfort. Two things to watch for. Just the other night I hit the button to open the power tailgate and it tried to open but didn't. I hit the button again and it opened with no problem so I'll be watching that. The other thing is the center console is ultra flimsy. I just know it will break a few times before I get rid of the vehicle. When you open it, it is very weak and wobbly so that needs to be addressed.

However Jeep say's it can be fixed, so why has it taken close to 5 months and they don't seem to be any closer to fixing it.  So, the person's insurance does not want to total it since they feel it should be Jeeps problem to fix it. They will not take responsibility  I'm left to dry and am no closer to getting my car returned to me.  I will never again buy an air ride so BEWARE!",2

That should tell you a little about my driving style.  Everything out here is far apart.  I do a lot of driving and wanted a vehicle that can keep up with what I'm going to throw at it.  Before I bought the 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Diesel Overland (JGCDO), I was on the fence.  It was either the JGCDO or the 2015 Audi Q5 TDI.  I test drove both, a few times.  I liked the Audi's better mpg and get-up.  However the towing capacity and the interior storage capacity of the Audi was a deal breaker for me.  Along with not being able to put BF Goodrich All Terrain tires on the rig--they just don't make them to fit the Audi.  I don't like having to put winter tires on my rig in the cold and flu season and them take them off to put another set on in the beginning of allergy season.  I like to buy one set of tires every 50,000 miles.  I did a lot of research on both models.  The TDI engine is tried and true--been around for many years, is reliable and bullet proof.  The new diesel engine that Fiat came out with in 2014 for the Grand Cherokee is not tried nor true, however they have been building diesel engines successfully for a number of years.  After combing over the jeep forums, I found many people dissatisfied with their JGCDO due to warranty issues with the catalytic converter and other minor things.  I decided to take the leap into the deep end and buy the 2015 JGCDO last week.  I got the extended warranty to satisfy the uneasiness about the reliability and 3 year 36,000 mile factory warranty concerns I had.   Even with the extended warranty the overall price of the JGCDO still came in below the cost of the Audi Q5 TDI.  It would have been nice to say ""I own an Audi,"" but when I go skiing in a few months and have to drive through a blizzard to get some fresh turns at Big Sky, I will be happy with my decision because I know the JGCDO will be able to mob through 20"" of fresh snow with a little help from the adjustable air suspension and the BF Goodrich All terrain tires.  I just don't know if the Audi--even with top of the line snow tires and Quattro all-wheel drive would be able to.  On a side note, I took a 415 mile trip today over about 10 hours going up and down mountain passes from 5,000 to 11,000 feet above sea level.  My speed ranged from around 20 to 85 mph with BF Goodrich All Terrain tires.  It was mostly highway but some hard miles were up and down steep grades at high elevation doing no more than 20 mph.  With two people in the car, lots of food and gear, we averaged 29.1 mpg.  Take that Audi!      One word of advice:  If you live in a cold weather climate and are thinking about getting a JGCDO, then negotiate for the engine block heater cord to be installed before you drive it off the lot.  Its fairly inexpensive (~$150 with install) and should be standard on all diesel engines but its not.",4

Took it off the lot with 25 miles on it, next day down to the ranch for some 4x4ing, performed great (even with the stock Michelin tires). Next week I was towing my 3500lb boat and a car load of friends. Again, the Jeep performed. I also work in a higher profile office, one where we wine and dine our clients. Again the Jeep performed well, numerous comments from clients. The only faults I have had are related to the transmission. After about 1500 miles it began to clunk and shift erratically. I took it to the dealer and they performed a TCM update and it has since fixed the problem. Granted I have only owned the Jeep for less than a month, however I figured this should have been installed from the factory, not a few weeks after. If you're new to Jeeping, check out JeepForum.com, more specifically the Easter Egg section. Found alot of useful information there. MPG has been so so, around 14 in the city and 25 on the highway.

This  vehicle is so bad that I decided to buy out my lease in 1 yr....sell it for a loss.....and buy a 2016 CPO:  Acura MDX or Lexus 350 or 450; that is if the Bells Whistles in this vehicle don't kill me first.  Nothing electronic makes any sense on the vehicle.  To see the clock the whole electronics set up must be turned on.  To turn it on you must first turn on the RADIO then MUTE IT.  What's that all about?.  Then a PC screen with about 10 icons are displayed.  There are NO instruction booklets for UCONNECT or the Navigation system. Fortunately I am a Computer Programmer and can figure it out. I telephoned Jeep and they sent me (because the dealer doesn't give you one) a 650 page Owners Manual.  They told me the Owners Manual  is on the Autos PC but you can't read it while the car is in motion. So if you need something, and you instruct your passenger to read it he/she cannot until you stop the car.  So get this:  If you want to just sit around and browse through the owners manual to learn how to operate your $44000.00 vehicle, you have to sit in your vehicle. Happy Jeep was able to send me a hard copy.  The ride is bumpier than the test vehicle that they used. (Can't figure that one out) The test vehicle drove like a Lexus 450. This car I feel every crack in the highway. Keyless entry is dangerous. Should be called ""Brainless Entry"" Last week I went to church, parked the car and luckily I backed in and had to cross in front of the engine to get to the church and realized the engine was still running.  Another poor fact about keyless entry:  e.g.  One night your wife goes grocery shopping and hiding behind the vehicle on the PASSENGER SIDE is a 'mugger'.  As she grabs the door handle HIS door unlocks!!!!!!!   Now HANDLING: In this vehicle you cannot take your eyes of the road for a nano-second or you will end up in a tree. The response is way too quick and very dangerous.  So, don't admire the scenery. My last four cars were a 1992 Acura Legend, a 1996 Honda Passport, a 2005 Acura MDX.  All exceptional. Kept the Acura MDX for 13 yrs and now realize that I should have kept it.  Extremely disappointed.  MPG not as promised.  Open Road I got 21.   Around town 15.  Average 17  Getting back to the NAV system Compare:  2005 ACURA I simple had to enter ANY business phone # and it would display the Business and the route (That was 13 yrs ago) Update disk Acura very simple. Purchase the disk and put it in the CDR drive. Jeep from what I understand is a nightmare process.",2

I test drove the Grand Cherokee last and it sold me. It was hands down no contest. I researched Edmonds.com for quite a while. For my driving style, the Grand Cherokee is the perfect fit. I researched the 3.6 V6 Pentax engine including a video on manufacturing, very powerful V-6! There is one feature in the car that I don't use, not yet. It is the automatic shut off when coming to stop and holding your brake pedal. During the breakdown period it is not good to subject the engine to repetitive starts versus saving gas. I am not sold on ""regular gas', I fill it up with medium grade. No need for ""premium gas"".The leather seats are very comfortable and the lumbar support is excellent. The display screen is very intuitive and easy to use. The hatchback electronic feature is a great addition. One touch to open, one touch to close, it is that simple and effortless. I like to do basic maintenance in my car. This one is clear off the ground, no need to jack it up to drain the oil! Most importantly, where I live and when it snows I will not call sick at work that often because I can't get out of the neighborhood, I know the Jeep will get me out!",2

Like the look and features without being over the top (wish it had the panoramic sunroof and hitch). Wife drives it around town with the kids and lives it. I drive it on nights, weekends, and trips when we all are together. Tech is great and convenient and the ride is smooth as butter. Cant wait to take it in the snow. Transmission seems a little jerky at low speeds and the auto off feature is annoying. Thankfully it can be turned off. Unfortunately it defaults to on at start up. Storage is great and pickup is pretty snappy. Sound system is amazing. Uconnect is easy but has some gimmicky features. Gas mileage is so-so. Unsure if my system is not calibrated properly yet because I have so few miles but I drove 2 hours all hwy and the mileage was 21.7 on the screen. that's too low. Costs high 60s to fill up at $2.80 per gallon. The seat was comfy the first hour but I think I didn't have it adjusted to be fine for the whole trip. Started to feel uncomfortable.

Even our 5YO son liked the vehicle. 3 months into the vehicle, I started to notice some minor tech issues. At first I thought it was some kind of fluke, but it was not. Consistent tech issues. GPS wasn't accurate, safety air bag light came on, twice my rear view camera did not turn on when trying to reverse. And just recently 5/30/18 while backing out of my driveway, emergency brakes locked up on me. Nothing behind me or around me, it just locked up thinking I was going to crash into something. Sensor for the gas pump was broken. The sensor would turn the pump off thinking the tank is full when it really was not.

Gas mileage is OK but we're just getting started, so we shall see. Braking is a tad soft, but I am getting used to it. The Altitude model gives the JGC a fierce look.

Needless to say, that didn't happen. I was basically told that they would do nothing more, no swapping it for another vehicle, no buying it back, unless it became a legal matter.

Being the original owner of a 1980 CJ5 , I was attracted to the beautiful leather appointments of the OVERLAND, and its awesome Air ride system. The first problem I had was when she needed gasoline for the very first time, I couldn't get the fuel door open. I was at the gas pump struggling, when I remembered I had piece of metal coat hanger. I used this to unlatch the fuel door,and fill her up. Undaunted as a CJ OWNER , I decided to not close the door fully again, and have them repair it when It was time for her first oil change. On January 8th just after a beautiful snow fall, I was dressed and leaving for work, I headed out of the driveway, ALL OF A SUDDEN...... I heard a blood curdling ~~ CLANK, CLANKETY CLANK, BANG BANG sound, and ALL the LIGHTS turned AMBER on the DISPLAY.... The service 4wheel light came on, just after a message flashed"" FOUR WHEEL DRIVE UNAVAILABLE"" then the Traction control warning light glowed red. It was then that I discovered I was stuck in the driveway ...""JEEP DOWN"" ""MAN DOWN"" I phoned the 1800 number and they dispatched a wrecker. The wrecker driver called and asked me if I had 40 feet of room, because other callers had gotten themselves into a pickle(due to the snow). The wrecker driver and I had a colorful word exchange, before he handed me off to another company. 90 minutes later I was riding in a flat bed on our Merry way to the Dealership in which I had purchased her.

1654, on 12/29/17 16:08 PM (PST),Allan Lees ,2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Overland 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Cut-Price Range Rover," This is a review of the Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland with the 5.7 hemi (there was no option for this in the drop-down menu above) with the upgraded Quadra Drive II 4x4 system. I wanted a commute vehicle that could also handle my frequent off-road excursions, that would be comfortable and convenient for everyday use, carry four adults easily, and yet not be too bulky off-road. I was skeptical about purchasing a product from FIAT Chrysler as combining two companies famous for poor quality and poor reliability didn't seem like a great way to produce vehicles you can depend on and certainly FCA doesn't seem to have much confidence either because they only provide a 36 month/36,000 mile warranty. But I couldn't afford a Range Rover and the standard SUV isn't any use off-road, so that left a very limited range of choices. I'd already dismissed buying a Jeep Wrangler as I've zero interest in returning to the 1970s. So that left the Grand Cherokee Overland or a new Land Rover Discovery or a used Toyota Land Cruiser.  So far in 8 months of ownership I've put 14,000 miles on the vehicle of which around 600 have been off-road in a variety of conditions. The navigation system has many flaws (for example, if I'm using navigation then chances are I'm not familiar with the area, so why tell me ""obstruction ahead between X road and Y road?"" Why not say ""obstruction ten miles ahead""? Once I got informed about an accident more than 100 miles ahead of me, which was hilariously useless). The puddle-lamps are on the mirrors, which means when you step out of the vehicle you can't see what is under your feet. And the rear stowage space is modest, as befits a midsized vehicle. But overall I've been impressed by the Jeep, especially as the 5.7 hemi provides unstressed power and torque for any situation. I opted for the upgraded 4-wheel drive Quadra Drive II and full off-road package and would recommend that to anyone planning more than a picnic-style trail hop. I wish rock rails had been optional for the Overland but instead they cost me $1,000 to purchase and install. It's early days and doubtless FCA will ensure I spend a significant chunk of change on repairs, especially after the vehicle crosses the 36,000 mile mark, but so far I've been more pleased with the vehicle than I expected to be. It's supremely comfortable even on long (800-miles per day) journeys, it handles the trails very well, and the infotainment is acceptable. The auto heating/cooling feature is totally unpredictable, sometimes activating itself at a particular temperature and at other times going well below or above without any activation occurring, but manual activation requires only a few blips though the sub-menus. I haven't yet put the vehicle into deep water, but it should handle 24"" without too much difficulty provided the door seals hold. For people just wanting an SUV for the school run, a rear-wheel lower option Grand Cherokee should suffice, but for people like me who want comfort with serious trail capability, getting the optional Quadra Drive II is a must-have.  I also recommend fitting a winch for those infrequent but annoying times when you really, really need one.",4

Jeep has always been, for me, an excellent vehicle to drive and, with that said, the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Altitude is no exception.  I am pleased in every way, except one. The one item that is very annoying is the engine start-stop function when the brakes are applied.  I understand the logic behind this function but, if anyone at Jeep Corporate is listening, PLEASE reprogram the override button so that it does not reset itself every time the engine is cycled on and off.  Potential customer's should definitely test drive the Jeep before purchase or lease and determine for themselves if they can tolerate the start-stop function.

I breaks my heart that I would pay so much and after a few months have to look at a dash that has started bubbling up. I have OCD and having my dash bubble drives me crazy. I am constantly trying to press the leather down , smooth the leather back in place. My car is immaculate I take pride in the appearance of my car. I took it to Milton Rubin in Augusta, GA and the service manager said he had never seen this before. After lots of research, I see it has happened a lot. Called the home office of Jeep and was told due to the year and milage 81,000 miles. There is nothing they can do.

I was expecting far less problems/issues than I was having with my Mini. That wasn't the case, I have only had the car for 2 years and have been in and out of the dealership for repairs. It is always something, one year in- my keys stopped working, had to get the car towed (and pay for the tow) to the dealership. They said the keys malfunctioned- it would be $675 to replace. Why did this happen? Their response, these things just happen. Great. Then my windshield wiper fluid nozzles broke (never experienced that before...quoted me $200 to fix, yet the part is $8 bucks...I will deal with myself) Now some nozzle is messed up in my engine $3,200 to fix and it's not covered by my top of the line warranty. Getting rid of it right away. Too many issues, too expensive- oh and when your car is at the dealership, good luck finding a way to get around for days at a time, no loaners and shuttle only up to 10 miles from dealership.

Mileage dropped about 1.5 mpg with new spark plugs, but a subsequent fuel injector cleaning restored it.  Although it has as much horsepower as my Yukon, it has significantly less torque and the V6 works much harder to pull a 23 ft boat and trailer weighing almost 5600 lbs.The ride quality remains very good and only two minor recalls and no warranty issues other than a completely dead battery in the first month.  I put the second replacement set of tires on at 105K miles and just recently had to have the original front brake pads replaced.   The 5 speed tranny upshifts smoothly but downshifts in and out of 4th gear frequently when encountering moderate grades on the highway,  and it delays downshifting around town at slower speeds.

Overall I've been pretty pleased with this vehicle.  I'm debating now on whether to trade it in for 2014.  So I have been reading reviews on Edmunds of the 2014.  The only issue I have had that has been a pain in the 2011 has been the cruise control.  It has been in the shop 3 times to get it fixed.  I have found through experience that if I slam the steering wheel up and down with the tilt steering, it will become operable again.  It's some kind of wiring issue.  I've told the service department this, but they just replace the whole mechanism.  But overall, as I've said, its 9 of 10 stars.",4.875

At 25,000 miles I had no tread on my tires (I do mostly in town and highway driving, absolutely no off road) and had to replace all 4 tires.  Now at 27,200 miles, my SUV is in the garage and won't start.  It's completely frozen and every single warning light comes on.  I'm waiting to have it towed to the dealer to be analyzed and fixed.  It's very frustrating to have a relatively new vehicle and to have multiple problems before there's even 30,000 miles on it.  Not sure I will buy jeep",3.875

I am based in Dubai and bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee (Limited) 2011 in July 2011 and was very impressed by it. I even went around promoting the product to my friends and family so much that even my brother in Australia bought a new one. Moreover I was even planning for a Dodge charger as my next car. My best buddy too has almost booked a new Jeep GC 2012.Unfortunately it has lived to its reputation of very poor reliability. I have been experiencing software and GPS issues from day one. The pad of the parking break came off in 5 months time and dealer said it was not covered under the warranty clause and I had to pay for it. Luckily for me the service consultant gave me such a shoddy service that the charge for the same was written off as a measure to compensate for the inconvenience caused to me. (I do not want to give details of the same as it was addressed by the service manager) I took the vehicle on an Oman trip (no off-roading and I have never used it for off-roading) around 6 months after buying the car and it wouldnt start after doing an uphill (again on good tarred road.)I had taken it to the dealer and they said everything is ok. Now the vehicle has developed some engine issues as the Engine fault light (also called as MIL (Malfunction Indicator Light)) comes on.I cannot understand how a new vehicle can have so many issues? I have been perfect with its service and have allowed only the authorised dealer to even touch it.The dealer technicians cannot seem to find what the issue is with and had reset the computers so that the MIL light goes off. Yesterday the light came back on. Worst of all is I am left without a vehicle for all these days and they refuse to give a spare vehicle. I had also called Chrysler Middle East who promised to get back on the issue but with no luck (they did not even call back). The car spent 3 days at the work shop and I guess it is only fair that I am given a replacement car. The warranty conditions in the US covers this factor wherein the dealer should arrange a replacement car (if the car develops issues during the warranty period and KM limit). This clause unfortunately has been conveniently removed for the Middle East. I even searched the net on the same and came across lots of negative feedback on Jeep GC (the new model) at American forums where they are more transparent. I really wish reliability issues were brought up so that other buyers are not caught off-guard after shelling out so much money for a product that only looks good. I honestly regret for not having gone for a Pajero or a Japanese car. This is the first time I ventured for an American vehicle and I consider it the biggest follies of my life (by the way I used to own a Mitsubishi Pajero which I sold to buy the Jeep). So much of American tax payers money has gone to revive the Chrysler Group and I think the people of America deserve more dedication from this group to upkeep the reputation and trust of the consumers towards American products (especially cars), in the international market.Another warning; please do not go by what the sales persons at the Trading Enterprises say as they are extremely economical in the truthfulness area.To all aspiring Jeep owners, my suggestion is to do a research on the net before buying this vehicle.",2.875

The front crankshaft pulley came apart grinding the remaining pulley against the engine block (Chrysler called it ""engine crankshaft damper problems"" and ""harmonizer balancer issues"") and most recently the engine was ""pulling in too much fuel"" and Chrysler informed us the oil separator and PVC valve would need to be replaced. The gear shifter has broken, and further damaged by the dealer 4 months ago and still has not been repaired due to ""a lack of replacement parts"" and the engine has had declining performance since about 5000KM.

Long story short, the reviews were so good on Jeep Grand Cherokees because people were writing reviews on the 1st gen. GC's (the 1992-1999 versions).  These were awesome!  However, somewhere around 1998 or so, Jeep STOPPED building the motors and production was turned over to Chrysler.  We spent about $18k on this SUV, and we ended up putting about $4k - $5k worth of motors in this car.  This car buried us in debt because as soon as we paid it off, we needed another motor.  We'd have to get a lien against the car to buy a motor.  Once that motor was paid off, it would blow again.  I was religious about oil changes and maintenance, but it didn't matter.

The transmission was the noisiest I’ve ever heard in my life. The seat was comfortable at short distances but was like a torture chamber at long distances.

1838, on 07/31/17 17:17 PM (PDT),shane ,2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4dr SUV 4WD (3.7L 6cyl 5A),Great and not great...," First a bit of car owning history: I have owned the Chrysler P.T Cruiser that was an '07, I've owned a 2008 Chrysler Pacifica and now I'm the owner of a 2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo edition with 4 wheel drive. I bought this car for two reasons 1-I've been a long life Chrysler fan and so I took them up on the Jeep line. I will admit with owning a Chrysler product there will be maintence, it's just par for the course. Especially from the DaimlerChrysler years. I would like to say, however, that when Daimler owned Chrylser the designs, such as the one for the 2005-2010 Jeeps are some of the most handsome the company has ever put out. 2-I wanted a classic SUV with 4 wheel drive to get me through my Ohio winter commute to work. I can honestly say the only real issues I have had are the windows (the front two windows seem to act up, want to get stuck but eventually will work) the back window had to be repaired entirely with a new motor. I bought the car with a 100,000 miles even and at 106,000 I had to get a new alternator. Not bad because it had been the first replacement. The car is 10 years old after all. But, other than that, she runs like a champ. I'm in love with the look, much more than I am with the new Jeeps since Fiat bought Chrysler out. I also love the space, the interior design as well as the way the car handles. My Jeep is very responsive. The turn radius is very good for such a big car. The gas mileage for a V6 could be bit better but then again I can't complain because of how large the car is. My advice is this: if you aren't looking to spend a fortune on a Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander (which often come at a much higher cost used) and you don't mind a few little things here and there then the Jeep is for you. Also, it's much nicer on the eyes then the latter two vehicles mentioned and the 4x4 works like a dream--also should comment on how the car detects when to go into 4 wheel drive which is a feature that I really like! And while it's nowhere on par with the infamous 4.0 engine from earlier Jeep models I still love my little buggy. Perhaps if you decide to purchase then also look at one of the larger engines. The V6 can have it's work cut out for it at times. 4/5",4

The transmission went out at 67K and again at 76K. Because we purchased it used from a car dealership, there was only a 30 day warranty, so the transmission was not under warranty. It cost us just under $4000.00 to fix and we were smart enough to ask for a 100,000 mile/3 year warranty with the replacement. So when it went out the second time, it was covered. It has shifted hard ever since it was purchased, it lunges in to park. We have replace plugs and coil packs, brakes and calibers and several other parts. Did I mention there is still less than 100,000 miles on the vehicle?  I was told when the transmission went out that a vehicle usually starts having transmission problems at 65000 miles. I informed the mechanic that this was not the first vehicle I had owned. I had one Chevy Blazer that was 10 miles from 300,000 when I parked it and the transmission was still going strong. I had a Toyota with close to 200,000 when it was totaled. I will never purchase another jeep and wish I had not purchased this one.",2

1913, on 06/07/16 08:19 AM (PDT),Jay Asheville ,2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 5A),Used not abused," This site does not offer by default to add the 5.7 Hemi engine or any V.8s. I have had 5 Jeep Grand Cherokees all V8s. The latest a 2010 4x4  5.7 Hemi Limited S, which is great & the power is just so much more than the 4.7 models. I believe that this WK model (2009-2010) with the 5.7 Hemi is by far the best power to weight ratio in all the grand Cherokees to date including the newer ones (2011-2016). The 2009-2010 got a small boost in HP & economy with no weight increase. I also had a 2009 4x2 5.7L Hemi & I thought being a 4x2 would be faster.. not so and I like towing with the little heavier 2010 Type S WK 5.7 (hard to find model)  To get to the reason I'm writing this is easy. You take care of your G.C. and it will not fail you much, windows always in Jeeps go bad. I bought all of mine used and had put some money into them always at first to start from zero on fluids. I have always changed all fluids to synthetic the moment I have bought them. Never had much problems unless not garaged and in cold weather. When I tow heavy loads then some problems have come up but no big deal. With synthetic proper fluids and oils you should not experience problems when towing acceptable loads. Don't force the transmission or the engine too much.... it will smell like is burning once you park.  These Wks are not large SUVs & do have good ergonomics. Driver kind of cramped left foot when up and flat.  These wk hemi feel fairly tight and performance orientated for the price. The ride is soft not what I expected on the 09 & 10. I guess accomadating women too. The seating arrengemnet or size is fine, not having hardly any people in the rear seat suits me fine. The towing is very good on the Limited S model(stiffer front) but on the Limited (2009) not 4x4 is just ok. I would like stiffer suspention and did added a heavy dutty rear sway bar and stiffen with Air Lift bags the rear. Other good things is the sound system. Not a huge vehicle and fits just fine in garage. They are very practical parking in downtown too, the rear camera helps. I'm sold on the 5.7 Hemi because I tow a car here and there and the power is there when you step on it, it will GO! I will say any driver can drive these since they are not a HP bouncing machines. I used to hit the pedal to the metal often when I first got them but now I know the power is there when I need it. They do get thirsty if you pedal it down in city roads. Find the used ones with no signs of towing if possible. No matter the miles on the hemi it should be fine if not abused. People get bored of same vehicle and not necessary sell them because they are bad. These Grand Cherokees (WK) with the V8 Hemi are a great vehicles for multi uses, even city driving if you got $ for gas. Using 89 octane is the trick when towing or mountain driving. No need for 91 or 93 octane won't do any better. Have fun and if you find an Type S (2010 only)  get it, much nicer than just the normal one. Despite any repairs I have enjoyed driving the V8s only for any kind of towing, and this hemi with vvt (variable valve timming) is better than all other ones I have ever owned. Add heavy duty ceramic brakes in front for great stopping power and even more safety. You should have no oil leaks at all if all tighten down good that could leak. Fun driving easy parking. Hwy driving with cruise control & @65 mph  Florida flat hwy gotten 22mpg. Otherwise 18-19 mpg.   :-)",4

Love the manly Jeep body style. The thick, heavy, solid body and all time 4WD make me feel very safe in this SUV. The 5.7L Hemi has tons of power for uphill acceleration.

Surprisingly the cabin is very quiet even at 70mph. The dashboard layout is simple and straight forward. The GPS is easy to use without reading the manual.

You think you pushed it all the way forward for Park but no, half the time, it is in reverse. -----SCARIEST of all is the transmission! It hesitates whenever you need sudden acceleration like trying to make a left turn! Almost got into a few accidents because of this potentially deadly flaw. I have to drive knowing that my transmission will seize and not to try and to do any rapid or quick accelerations. Had it looked at many times and they tell me nothing is wrong.

I usually swap vehicles every 3 or 4 years, but dont think i'll be doing any swapping anytime soon. Performance tires only last 17k miles! But that's performance tires for you. Swapping them out for far cheaper performance tires that last twice as long. Only had to do oil changes and tire rotations otherwise. Still decently fast. Sounds awesome! Fastest time is still 4.3 seconds, althought computer shows 3.8 after last upgrade. Hmmm... overall very satisified with the Jeep.Original review : I laugh when some claim a Porsche Cayenne or BMW X5 M are better or are in a different class. I originally was looking at an X3 M-Sport, but couldn't swallow spending almost 60K for an X3. I also considered the Audi SQ5, a used X5M. And I couldn't stand the snobby dealers with their nose in the air. I eventually ran into the Jeep SRT. Not only is it the most appealing of the luxury SUVs, the new interior for 2014 was bar none the best. Perhaps Audi and BMW can take a lesson from this. And it is FAST! I love that it's only marginally 'slower' than a Cayenne Turbo S that costs more than 2X! I DID 0-60 in 4.3 SEC! You decide if that's slow!Love the SRT and looking forward to many years!",5

I commute daily about 20 minutes and it is a lot of stopping and starting.  This is horrible for the newer diesel engines!  I found out the hard way (paying $200 at the dealership) for something that should happen automatically if it were driven at highway speeds for extended amounts of time.  The exhaust filters need to reach a certain temperature in order for them to perform what is called a regeneration, basically burning away the soot from the engine.  If the temps are not met, the filter clogs and the engine goes into “limp mode”.  It then will not accelerate properly and only reach 30-40 mph.  It basically forces you to go to the dealership for a forced regeneration.  That cost me $195 and is not covered under warranty.  Oil changes are also costly, roughly $160.  These vehicles are wonderful for long commutes but the “around town” driver needs to stay clear.",4

I am impressed with its very low road and tire noise, engine and transmission smoothness, and its gas mileage. On the drive back from Knoxville on a 400 mile trip, its actual mpg was 27.5mpg.  Its 25 gallon tank is great for road trips.   My son's 2008 GC with its thirsty 3.7L V-6 hardly got 19mpg on highway.  Seat comfort and handling are very good.  The IP info are easy to scroll thru while driving.  The U Connect is one of the best and simplest to operate I have ever seen. Many people think how wonder Toyota is......I sold my ( purchased new) 2016 Toyota Tacoma TRD sport since I could not stand its wimpy V-6 and terrible 6 speed transmission.

That’s why in oct 2016 at the age of 31 I was thrilled when I purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee. That’s when my nightmare began. I received recalls in the mail every week (I wish I was kidding). One day while driving home from work my car went completely dead while I was going 70mph on the interstate. Thankfully I was able to pull off onto the shoulder before it completely turned its self off. The Jeep just doesn’t drive smooth. The alignment has always been off. The car would hit any bump in the road and slide around very easily. I eventually became very scared to drive the Jeep. I didn’t know if it was going to break down yet again due to another recall, or if I would lose control while driving due to the poor alignment. Luckily I was able to trade my Jeep in for a Chevy and get out of my loan. Never again will I purchase a Jeep. Such a disappointment .",2

1947, on 03/23/18 11:25 AM (PDT),Dbal72 ,2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Overland 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Great Overall Vehicle!," I waited two years to write this review.  Purchased my 2014 Overland 4x4 off-lease in 2016.  I now have 76,000 miles on it.  I have had zero issues with this jeep.  No repairs outside of normal maintenance. (oil changes, air filter, fluids, etc.)  I know a lot of people had issues with the 14's early on with recalls so I am thinking the early bugs are gone with the many uconnect updates and trans updates.  My transmission is silky smooth and shifts great.  I acutally prefer the ""T"" electronic shifter that was in the 14' and 15's, but understand why it was changed with people leaving it in gear.  Had FCA simply had the ""fix"" in place at the start, there would not have been issues as you can't leave it in gear and open a door.  It will automatically shift into park for safety.  My wife drives a 14' dodge Durango Citadel AWD with the same 3.6 so it is interesting to compare the two.  I loved hers so much, but didn't need the third row and wanted something a tad shorter.  This fits the bill.  Interesting though the two vehicles drive quite differently.  The Durango drives a tad tighter and sportier than the Jeep.  The Jeep is a little more relaxed and absorbs the bigger bumps better.  I have the Quadra-lift suspension which to me, is a mixed bag.  No issues with it and I love being able to lower it backing up to hitches or washing it.  I have also raised it going over very high snow banks.  Mostly I like it when I load it.  I often put many heavy items from home improvement stores in it and the air suspension auto corrects and levels.  Also great when towing.  The only thing I don't like on the quadralift is I feel it actually picks up the tiny imperfections more than the Durango.   Odd as the bigger bumps it is the opposite.  Sport mode in the Jeep keeps it in aero mode (Lower) and tightens the steering slightly while making shift points a lot more aggressive.  I wish you could have the aero setting, but normal shift points.  Make it customizable.  You can't though so I rarely use Sport Mode.  The Jeep is plenty roomy and comfortable in not only front, but rear bench as it reclines as well.  Overland has the leather stitched dash, LED puddle lights and interior ambient lightning that is nice.  The interior is very nice for its class minus a few cost-cutting areas such as the bottom half of doors which is hard plastic.  Still no rattles or squeaks in the Jeep.  Solid as can be.  I really like the Uconnect and user-friendliness of it.  Have had no issues with it either.  17' models on added apple car play.  The acceleration from the 3.6 is adequate.  Around town is fine, on the highway would be nice to have some extra upper end torque and horsepower.  I think they should bump this 3.6 up to 305-310 horse like in the Challenger.  Not sure why they don't in Jeep.  I avg. about 22mpg in mixed 50/50 driving which I think is fine based on a 5,000 lb suv.  In the next version of the GC I hope it sheds some weight as it is a heavy pig for the size.  Most alternatives to this same size are in the 4500lb range.  Overall I am very happy with the vehicle as it is the swiss army knife of vehicles.  Nice enough to pull up to a fine restaurant, enough cargo room to carry gear and five people yet rugged enough to go off-road with no issues.  I have taken mine off-road often through mud and rutted roads as I have a cabin up north.  It also is a tank in the snow using the snow mode which locks the differentials and changes shift patterns and ETC.  As a used purchase I highly recommend one and let someone else take the depreciation hit.",5

I look forward to getting behind the wheel every day. Lots of towing power, and passes with ease on the highway. So glad I bought the Summit model with its Hemi powerplant, luxury appointments and expanded technology. I bought it used in April '15 with 35k miles, and it now has 67,000 miles on it.  It's still tight as a drum and drives like new. Gas mileage has been 16-17 in the city, and routinely 20+ on the highway.

This has been my worst experience by far, and everyone I know that owns one says the same. I have never purchased an extended warranty on a vehicle, but thank goodness I did on this one or I may have spent as much in repairs as I did on the vehicle itself! Chrysler HAS to get their issues together. I cant imagine how many loyal Jeep fans have felt the same as me, and left for other brands. First of all, I had this vehicle for just 2 years. In 2 years, it was in the repair facility for 3 recalls, (including the famous gear shifter one) and also 2 more major issues. One of the issues kept my vehicle in the shop for 3 weeks, because the repair wasnt able to be performed without cutting into the body of the vehicle, (yes you heard that right- unbelievable!) and the last one put me in a dangerous situation when all of my electronics failed at once and my Jeep shut down in the middle of traffic. I immediately traded it in as soon as it was fixed. I have read countless other reviews regarding these issues. It is very sad because I LOVED my jeeps- they are sporty, well designed aesthetically, comfortable to drive, and very reasonable in price. However, the reliability and repairs were enough for me to leave the brand completely. I would not recommend this product for at least the next 5-6 years until they can figure out the issues and correct them.",2

Our old 99 grand Cherokee was on life support.  The 99 had served its purpose, hauling, towing, winter driving, but had been troublesome from day one.  Reads lots of reviews and it appears things have improved.  Got a 2014 with 28k miles, v6, 4wd.  Drives nice, quiet, plenty of power and tows our boat very well.  Loads of nice features.  The car has a heavy, solid feel.  But the damn shift lever!  What is that about?  It's a ridiculous design and it takes total concentration to get the thing in D or R.  Maybe we'll get used to it in time.Update Have put about 10 k miles on this car.  Still hate the shift level and the fussy dash screen for climate, radio controls.  The screen died and dealer had to reprogram the thing.Great car for traveling, hauling and towing.  Base v6 and 8 speed trans are excellent match.  Very solid car, no squeaks or rattles, very quiet cabin.  At 70 mph the car is quiet as a tomb.  We have the base model, didn't want all the confusing and troublesome digital stuff but memory seat adjustments would be nice as wife and I are so different in size.  Otherwise the car is very nicely equipped for a bottom line model.I would recommend this car.  Interested to see how it holds up long term.  Pretty good so far.Update About 30 k miles now.  No problems.  Car is still solid, no problems, squeaks or rattles.  Still impressed with base power train, V6 with 8 speed TRANS works flawlessly.  Still do not like fussy shift lever and touch screen for climate and sound system, but would highly recommend this car.  Great for towing and traveling.Update:About 42 K miles now.  Just got a recall,for cruise control fix, reprogram the module.  No other problems.  Still really dislike the shifter.  This is a great car for towing, hauling, traveling but it does feel big and heavy.  For around town driving I prefer our Chevy equinox.",4

I purchased my GC less than two years ago, and have already had it in the shop multiple times, where the service experience was abysmal. It took over a month for the dealer to get a replacement shock into the shop after the OEM version started leaking at 25K. After that shock was finally replaced, the replacement shock then started leaking again a month later. On another occassion the service shop couldn't perform a simple oil change and I had oil leak all over the engine compartment. No compensation offered from the dealer. Now the air conditioner smells musty, which through a little research appears to be a design flaw that allows water to collect deep in the AC system, and the brakes started sqeaking.",2

LOVE IT," We bought a Cadillac SRX and drove it for two years before trading it on the Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit 4x4 with the 8 cylinder Hemi in it.  I've had my 2014 for 13 months now and I am still in love with it.  We hated the way the Cadillac drove - and the JGCS is so much better.  The technology works better and is more receptive (everything from the touch screen to the outside touch door locks/unlocks).  The interior is beautiful, I love the look of the dashboard and the leather seats.  The only thing I would change is the seats could be a little more comfy.  They aren't bad, but could be better.  I've heard people who have had trouble with the transmission and other things, but so far so good with mine.  No issues at all. I LOVE that jeep offers a lifetime warranty on the vehicle which I purchased.  It's comforting to have it, because I know even if I have issues Jeep will take care of them.  The cost of warranty on my brand new Jeep was less than an extended warranty on a used car.  I plan on driving this vehicle until it literally won't drive anymore.   There are only three things I would change - comfier seats, maybe better gas mileage and I would love it if it read the iPhone text messages like Ford and Chevy vehicles do.  I was coming back from an activity on a school bus (I'm a teacher) and this gorgeous car in the parking lot caught mine - about a split second later, I realized it was MY CAR!",5
1977, on 01/07/16 17:13 PM (PST),Tony ,2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Wasted dough!," I purchased my 2014 Grand Cherokee AWD with the 3.0 Eco Diesel option.  Everything about the car was awesome especially since I also had the trail rated package and air suspension option.  The problem with this car was the electronics.  Constant issues with the entire control dash lighting up with error messages, poor attention to detail in wiring harness (under fenders exposed wiring for headlights!) just a nightmare with multiple electronic computer flash upgrades.  Then, while driving, at 65 mph and up, the steering would vibrate from left to right and the dealer was never able to fix it!  The dealer service and customer support was equivalent to a third world nation; insufficient mechanics, no service availability on day of arrival, and no completed service repair on the front suspension shaking above 65 mph. The engine is fantastic.  This diesel is incredible and economy was around 27-28 m.p.g.  Not bad at all.  Almost to the year, I was so fed up with all issues, I drove it to the Honda dealer and traded for a 2015 Honda CRV, AWD.  No issues at all!  What kills me most is the drop in value.  I lost an easy $25,000 on this vehicle that the manufacturer claim is the most luxurious vehicle, and the Jeep name brand which is supposed to represent quality and durability, was a total disappointment.  I should have listened to my friends that owned these cars pre iously. I should have used the Lemon Law!   Get an Audi, VW, or Porsche Cayman with the same engine.",1
1978, on 12/28/15 20:05 PM (PST),Curtis Smith ,2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Diesel Disappointment," I vowed never to part with my Toyota 4Runner until I saw the Super Bowl commercial for the diesel Grand Cherokee.  By March I was test driving an overland model and immediately impressed with the torque and gas mileage. How can you beat 30 mpg on the highway with the ability to yank my boat down the road at 65+ mph with minimal downshifts?Fast forward 15 months and I'm desperately trying to negotiate the trade value as I look to replace the recall and service bulletin ridden vehicle. First, the jeep would overheat pulling a small 17.5 ft speed boat that was half the rated towing weight. No kidding had to pull off the road on multiple trips to let the engine back off the red. The dealer kept advising it needed computer updates and then would send me on my way. Which leads me to the next issues - the dealers had no clue how to service or repair this vehicle. The first to oil changes they did not reset the oil life in the computer and when asked just proceeded to mash my accelerator into the floor and push buttons. It took me googling the procedures to show them how to reset. At 18k miles, I began to notice a rough idle. I reported to the dealership and told that's normal. At 19k I began to get check engine lights. Each time, I get the ""computer updates"" line.Note, the thing is also going in every other month or so for some sort of recall. After taking the vehicle in twice in one week for the check engine light with repeated reports of rough idle and now acceleration, I'm told a recent (two months old) service bulletin was out for the issue. After googling the service bulletin I was shocked at the level of ""repair"" necessary. A week, then a month go by before the dealer can get the parts. They even have me drop the vehicle and then return because they realize they don't have all the parts- like I said, significant repair. Finally they get the parts and I drop the vehicle.  A week goes by and they haven't even touched the vehicle.  I'm told the tech had other vehicles ahead of mine. Why the heck did I drop it off then?  It takes almost another month before the car is finally repaired. The most significant engine repair I have had on any vehicle. Let alone one with less than 20k miles and just over a year old. All said I traded the jeep.  If you are flirting with the idea of the diesel, first Google the service bulletin and take a look at the repair you may need and whether you are comfortable paying that kind of money for something that will likely need a significant overhaul.",3

After driving 4-Runners for years, I made the switch to Jeep and love the luxury and smooth ride.  I live in upstate New York where 4WD is really only needed a dozen or so days a year.  However, it’s on these days with  heavy snow that I miss the clearance of the 4 Runner, and actually got my Jeep stuck twice last winter, but it probably had more to do with the low profile tires than the 4WD.  Luckily, after digging myself out I was able to sit on heated seats and grab a warm steering wheel, which are my two favorite features.   My main complaint is the Navigation System – I would recommend skipping this option and buying a GPS since the Chrysler navigation system WILL get you lost. I’ve even been directed to turn up one way streets in the wrong direction!   Plus, if you are driving you cannot enter addresses into the system and the voice recognition is completely useless.  The first time it understands an address I give it will be the first time in over a year it’s ever understood an address.  It’s no Siri!!  If Jeep can fix the navigation & voice recognition system I would buy another Grand Cherokee.The last recall to fix the car from not being in park when shut off, was a set back to how the transmission handles.  1st to 2nd gear is terrible now.",4
1980, on 10/26/15 16:37 PM (PDT),Lululovesherjeep ,2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),LOVE MY NEW JEEP SUMMIT," First, let me say that I would never have paid sticker for these vehicles even though the vehicle is awesome so far.  I bought a 2014 with 11,300 miles so it feels like brand new and I saved about $15K over sticker.  I love this jeep but have only owned it a month now.  I am averaging 24.9 to 25.9 with mixed driving about 50/50 city/hwy.  It has so many features that I did not have on my 2002 Jeep grand Cherokee Limited model.  It drives great, very quiet and minimal road noise.  Stereo is awesome and I feel like I have more space in the cargo than my older jeep.  It is a V6 2wd vs. my 4.7L v8 2wd that averaged 18.5 mpg.  I think it has just as good pickup and power as the other and love the added gas mileage.   I feel like this car practically drives itself!  It's loaded with all kinds of safety features and tech settings that make it a joy to drive.  I love the interior with the exception of the suede on the front sides of inside windshield, just not my taste and believe it may fade overtime.  I keep it garaged but sure over time outdoors the sun would fade such a dark brown fabric.  The seats are nice leather although they could be a bit more comfy, they are a little firmer than my other jeep.  I have experienced some fogging of the headlights when humid or wet outside, this I am told jeep will fix under warranty.  The only additional improvements I could offer thus far is that Jeep should put a little more luxury leather seats in the front of the Summit model.  Like the quality Infinity puts in their SUVs.  For the sticker price of the Summit model, they should be a bit more plush and with awesome cushioning.  They are fine, the ride is nice, but they are just a bit flatter with a firm feel.  I recommend doing away with the suede next to the windshield as this will probably look pretty bad once the sun fades the fabric.  I can imagine them looking pink once the sun gets too them.  Last Jeep should consider doing a little lighter wood trim on the dash to break up all the dark brown.  At least they could give the option for different wood trim colors.  The lighter medium brown and lighter brown wood grains would give it a bit more sophisticated look.  Some may like the all one color look, but it does need a little something to break up the very dark interior.   Last, the lower console has a bit of a plastic look that I believe may show scratches easy over time or color wear off the plastic.  Maybe consider something a little more durable like stainless steel material or a hard rubberized plastic such as what is used for the interior door material.  I must say that anyone considering a mid size or larger SUV without the need for a third row seat, should check out the Jeep line.  They have really come a long way since my 2002 model.  I loved my 2002 and drove it from early 2004 till Oct 2015, so I guess you can say I loved my jeep.  I tried to find something other than another jeep only because I had driven mine for so long, but when I kept comparing all SUVs the jeep kept coming out on top in terms of size, comfort,  fuel efficiency, power, cargo space, regular unleaded gas, and overall maintenance and cost of ownership.  I find that I have everything I could imagine and then some in this vehicle.  When I compared several vehicles like Acura MDX, Lincoln MKC, Audi Q5, Toyota Highlander, etc., I found that the Jeep seemed to offer much more in value, comfort, and cost efficiency.   While I loved the Audi Q5, it was a bit smaller, higher maintenance costs, and premium unleaded gas.  I loved the feel of the Q5 and it's driving experience but figured I would be paying dearly in my cost to own and read too many horrors in costly reliability issues.   I don't want to go to the dealer for every maintenance issue and closest dealer is a 40 minute drive.  Not all parts but many parts and services are as much if not more than 3 times the maintenance on the Jeep.   The Lincoln MKC felt cheap in comparison and had much less room.  The cargo area is much shorter than other SUVs and didn't even think I could fit a tall pet carrier in it due to it's height.  Many door seals, interior trim, and even many door panels seemed not to be aligned very well.  The interior felt a bit cheap and the very light interior models I drove already showed scuffs and dirt from test drives.  I felt they were over valued.   The Acura MDX was nice and drove nice, but didn't need the third row and the premium fuel.  The Toyota Highlander, while roomy was more vehicle than I needed and the drive was not anything spectacular.  These are just a few I actually compared probably 15 models and came back to the jeep, but a lot had to do with the price I was able to get it for.  Overall I am very pleased with my Summit model and look forward to another 10 plus years of enjoyable Jeep driving.  Recommend SUV buyers look at the jeep line.",5

1984, on 09/07/15 20:09 PM (PDT),Edward Kauffman ,2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),This diesel is not enjoyable," I love the sound of a diesel engine, and I appreciate the great fuel economy for a vehicle of its size.  This VMI V-6 motor is totally adequate in power output. Highway cruising and passing are effortless.  There are some glaring negatives, however, that limit my enjoyment of this motor.  Foremost is the profound turbo lag that, on leaving a stop, causes very little response from the motor for about one second, then suddenly a rush of acceleration.  It so substantial that it makes one look like a beginning driver abusing a clutch.  One can avoid this behavior by loafing away from a stop to a speed of about 10 MPH before accelerating more vigorously; this requires changing driving habits specifically for this vehicle.  This turbo lag is also seen at higher speeds when the motor is loafing and at low RPM, when suddenly asked for more power.  The motor requires very expensive ($8-10 per quart) low ash diesel qualified oil, and expensive oil filters.  After my first oil change at the Jeep dealer the check engine light came on because the ash filter in the exhaust system had become totally loaded.  By contrast, the ZF eight speed automatic is  wonderful; one is minimally aware of it working.     The vehicle is a real highway cruiser.  It is very quiet and pleasant for roadwork.  I have had limited exposure to off-pavement travel.  What experience I have makes me question the value of its ""Trail Rated"" status.  The front bumper airdam is so low that it easily scrapes on small boulders here on our Arizona dirt trails.  The ground clearance (without the extra cost air suspension) is about the same as my wife's Subaru Forester XT.  My online reading leads me to believe that one can not easily remove this low airdam for off-road use and then drive at highway speeds with it off.  So in reality this Jeep is a crossover vehicle with super-nice all wheel  drive capability, but inadequate ground clearance to challenge moderately rough trail use.  I suspect that Jeep gave this vehicle its ""Trail Rated"" status after testing with the airdam removed.",2

First off I loved this vehicle(for 10000 miles).  Everything about it was great.  The gas mileage is great but after 10k miles it began!!  Fiat Chrysler should never have released this vehicle with all the recalls and emissions problems specifically in the eco-diesel.  Read up on this in Jeep blogs.  I have been in the dealership(double digits) more with this one vehicle then my last 6 vehicles combined.  It's been a year now and this vehicle's check engine(MIL) light has not been off more than a week in the last 8 months.   Dealership nor Chrysler techs seem to be able to fix these issues.  Unbelievable what close to $50k buys you nowadays.  Obviously not everyone runs into these issues and it may not happen to you..that's what I originally thought and it happened to me.  Just beware.  I'll never buy another Chrysler product again due to them not backing their product nor caring about their consumers.Update - Arbitration forced Chrysler to buy back my vehicle after spending over 60days in the shop.  Throughout the process Chrysler stood by their claim that the vehicle performed normally and as warranted. I am sure they will resell it.  Good luck next owner.,2

It's like they don't really care at all about their product or satisfaction of the customer. I am looking into a legal means to get my problem resolved. I hope there is a class action lawsuit against these guys to teach them better responsibility.,1

While none of my Jeeps have been models of reliability, my 2014 Overland is by far the least reliable.  Problems with the electronics started literally the day after I got it off the lot.  Issues escalated to highway stalling, not starting, blank screens, etc.  would leave it with the dealer for multiple days only to have the software updated and nothing repaired.  As I write this it is in the shop for its fifth time, at least this time they did some real work.  Replaced the water pump, crank shaft positioning sensor, blind spot sensor, etc.  the car only has 25k miles!   For a 50k vehicle the issues and dealer service are way below expectations.  It's a great car to look at inside and out, but at only 25k miles I plan to take a huge loss and trade it in for a subaru outback today.  Bye Jeep.",2

So goes my story with my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited Ecodiesel with Luxury Group.  The vehicle was a great looking package with a rugged appearance and nicely trimmed interior. The diesel engine, while slightly noisy, pulled like a mule and got great mileage.  That is, when it was working.  Fortunately, my Jeep dealer was about a quarter of a mile off of my daily commute to work.  That was a good thing as I saw the dealer often.The vehicle information system was very informative.  Here are some of the messages it would send me:- ""Engine Will Not Start in 130 mi See Dealer"" ""Incorrect DEF Detected.  See Dealer."" - Kind of interesting as the dealer is the only one to service this vehicle. - ""Engine Will Not Start in 195 mi Service DEF See Dealer"".....and that frequent Check Engine symbol was kind of nifty.I was in the shop over 6 times within a year with multi-day layovers common.  At least I got a loaner with the dealer's promotional messages pasted to the outside. The last service, based upon forum recommendations, I had them change out the catalytic converter under warranty.  Only then did I feel the vehicle stood a chance of being reliable enough to pass the potential problems off to someone else.I really loved that Jeep when it worked.  I really hated that Jeep and the dealership experience when it did not work.  It is likely I won't be back to any Chrysler product for quite some time.",3

I drove a Mercedes SUV, a Land Rover, the Audi Q5 and Q7 and the Volvo X90. I liked the Limited GC better than all of them and relative to cost, I LOVED the Limited GC. The others are so overpriced relative to the Limited GC. For all the reviews complaining about the diesel engine, I ask this: Why in the Hades did you buy the diesel? It cost an extra $4200 + tax and it is no savings over a gasoline engine given that diesel fuel is 20% or so more expensive than 87 octane. Diesel = not a smart buyUpdate 6.19.17: Has been a great experience owning and driving this vehicle. Have not had any issues with anything thus far. Awesome gas mileage both city and hwy. Very comfortable. Handles well. Plenty of cargo space for most any needs. The only marks against the Grand Cherokee at this point are the navigation system and the bluetooth phone connection. The navigation system is not easy to use and the map does not work as well as it should. The phone system does not have good sound quality for the person you are calling (where is the mic?) and it talks too much.

It got great gas mileage, could tow more than some trucks (we have horses), it can do off-road (at farms) and still fit in a parking garage in DC.  This vehicle WOULD have been the perfect vehicle however it has been in the shop at least once in 8 of the last 12 months I have owned it.  It qualifies for VA lemon law on two accounts and Jeep still will not assist me.  Its really too bad because the vehicle could have been a real home run - if it worked.

The last few times have been related to the diesel engine (catalytic converter was changed, engine light turned on a few times, and now a pipe in the diesel engine cracked.

I had the fabric seats changed to leather and it is brilliant and only 6 months old.I am blown away by the power when you hit the accelerator even compared to my Dodge Nitro (petrol). The Laredo can throw you back in your seat. Love it! The paddle shifts that I thought were just a gimmick are great when towing which it also a winner in my book.All the electronics are impressive compared to my previous Dodge.It looks good and for an SUV is reasonably quiet. The only 2 x things that annoy me actually embarrass me and Jeep could have avoided which is the foot brake alarms and warnings and the door hinges able to overextend. It has a weird intermittent noise in the transmission when slowing down below 40km/hr. It sounds like a hydraulic valve releasing under load but the workshop has fitted shims to the drive line, replaced the driveshaft and put a new transfer box in and it still makes the noise although not as often. Performance still great. I have managed to bust the inside of the consul tray which is annoying but probably my fault.",4

A $150 tire flat fix.No more Chrysler products for me.Update: three pressure sensors leaked with two of them having been replaced before.

I love the look, comfort and drivability.  I truly can afford any SUV I want, but I'm frugal.  When you take the discounts into account this is one of the most affordable SUVs on the market today.  I literally purchased the 4 WD Laredo with the W option package for under $25K (sticker was over $36K).  Couple the price with the outstanding service department which is only 2 miles from my house and you have a pretty good combination.  Many folks are put off by the high sticker price and may not even consider the GC.  The base model competes well with the smaller cars and is a much nicer SUV.",5

The build material is decent for an American car, but not as good as other cars we considered (BMW X3, Audi Q5).

The transmission tries to predict how you want it work, but what ends up happening is shifting from 0 gear to 1st (roughly 0-10 mph) there is a pretty hard shift. The transmission ends up struggling, and I'm sure it will go out much faster than it should because of the terrible transmission technology they created. I took my Jeep in for this issue 3 times and was told that that's just what is does and the best they can do is hope if my transmission does go out it happens before the warranty is up. Seriously! The Limited 75th edition also has 20 inch wheels when the wheel well is made for 18 inches. That means that the tires have to be low profile to fit. So, make sure not to use the Jeep for long car trips or take it off road (you know the main reasons to buy a Jeep)! The 20 inch rims and performance tires ruin the usability of the Jeep. I've had my Jeep 11 months and I've had 3 tires blow out. I've never had a tire blow out on any other vehicle I've had, and I've had more than 10 vehicles. I would never recommend this vehicle and I'm working on trading mine in now.

It was a toss up between a Jeep and a Subaru.  These were the choices based on where I live and the harsh road conditions that exist in the winter.  Well, I drove the JGC 75th and my wife and I fell in love.  *My Jeep Grand Cherokee has the 5.7L V8 Hemi.  It has all the tech and safety features that any high end vehicle and its a Jeep.  The problems started in March of 2017.  First the radio would cut out.  It wouldn't lose power, the sound would cut out.  Doesn't matter if it was BT, Radio, USB, the sound would cut out.  Then the instrument panel would short out.  At night you could see the voltage irregularity in the map lights and the brake/reverse lights.  Since March, the Jeep has been in the shop 8 times with a total of 4 months at the service center.  They have changed the alternator twice, the PCM, the battery, multiple radio updates and now its a voltage issue they are trying to correct.  They have given us a rental, but it is not the truck I am paying for.  FCA refuses to buy it back or make it right in anyway.  At this point, I will not recommend any of their products due to their corporate policies on Lemons.  The brand is great and the vehicles (other than mine) perform above average.",3
2047, on 07/21/17 22:14 PM (PDT),jimlebo ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Jeep Grand Cherokee Diesel Review 2016," The Jeep Grand Cherokee is well....GRAND.   This automobile has tremendous off road capabilities,  and interior luxury that beats many more expensive vehicles in use today.  As far as the interior,  I'm constantly amazed at the sound quality of the Harman stereo system on the Summit (did the upgrade and I'm so glad I did).  The touch screen is intuitive and elegant by design with no glitches or lockups.   The interior is of high quality and frankly the best I have seen in most vehicles of this price range.  The seats are supportive and comfortable and adjustable.  All safety mechanisms work as designed (stopped me from hitting a pillar in a parking lot at Target).  I've driven trucks and other SUV's in the market and the driving character of most trucks or SUV's is well ...like driving a pick-up truck (unresponsive, floaty feeling ).  This vehicle is responsive, road hugging and actually kinda sporty in feel.  The ride is controlled and not float y like so many American SUV'S and trucks in the market allowing for a greater sense of control while going down the road.  !!! Diesel alert,  the technology for diesels can be well...not great in regards to ""Regeneration"" and city driving only.  This is my worst complaint (not bad overall and works as designed).  The regenerative issue applies to cleaning the exhaust system which at times requires you to ""keep driving""  to ""burn"" out the products of diesel exhaust from the elaborate diesel exhaust cleaning system.  I believe this is to comply with EPA legislation ( thank god I do want to breath the best air).  This notification comes with a ""ding"" and a message while driving in the driver ""pod"" (mileage, speed and other notifications customization by user ).   While this ""regeneration"" is not a major issue, is something to consider when purchasing a diesel engine with the main usage of vehicle limited  to city driving with short distances (wouldn't recommend purchase of diesel vehicle if you rarely use vehicle and travel less than 10 miles in any day with low speed low mileage).   You would get frequently a message to ""keep driving regenerative process"" occurring while driving to the grocery store.  That would be annoying.  However,  if you commute to work involves a moderate to long distance and you can travel at speeds > 30 miles per hour  during your daily or not so daily commute, this vehicle might be perfect for you.  The gas mileage for these commutes in a vehicle of this size will astound you and be much more advantageous and reduce the current price you pay at the pump for a vehicle of this size and abilities.  ""Regeneration"" warnings and ""need to regenerate alerts"" should not affect the moderate to long commute commuters. These alerts will easily be handled if encountered in your normal commute.  Also,  the addition  a DES (Diesel Emission fluid) will need to be added to the vehicle around 10,000 miles or so to aid the elaborate diesel system to contain its noxious emissions. The DE fluid can be bought at Walmart for around 24 dollars for half the needed amount or just topped off when you get your oil change .  This is something that electric vehicles do not have to contend with.   I think my Diesel engine will definitely last longer than batteries however electric engines are very reliable and will outlast my diesel.   I have no range anxiety however.   The engine is Italian and has been a smooth and reliable engine to date.  The transmission is I believe German and smooth.  The transmission has shift changes that are almost undetectable and sometimes undetectable (8 speed).   Diesel advantages:  oil changes and servicing is minimized in regard to the Gas based brethren.  The Oil changes are 10,000 miles which is the recommended Oil change.  I don't know of any car I have driven that would recommend that frequency.  The engine is more ""rough"" when initially started...although this isn't that rough and feels like a 5 cyl when cold started.  When heated and running the Jeep seems to run as good as any advanced 6 cyl engine and as good as some 8 cyl engines.  The torque is phenomenal allowing you to leave the others at the stop light.  This engine blows away most SUV's in acceleration due to it's natural diesel torque advantage (feels like a V8, if you are into that sort of thing ).  Overall,  I feel this vehicle is a great luxury SUV that's not too big or too small with advanced off road capabilities that are sure to impress with great gas mileage.",5

The air suspension is smooth, and handles great regardless of what the road throws at it. Sport mode drops it a little over an inch, and tightens everything up nicely. Fuel economy while on the highway w/cruise on averages about 25mpg after Corsa exhaust was installed (23 before).  Acceleration is very good, braking even better.  Fit and finish of the interior is on par with the Audi and Mercedes I was considering.  This is what a GC should have been all along.  Handles winter perfectly, both snow and ice, on factory tires.  Edmunds rates all GC's as 3.6 as the only option.  This is the 5.7 Hemi V-8 w/the 8 spd auto w/sport shift.",5

2052, on 02/19/17 08:32 AM (PST),John Baumanis ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV High Altitude 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Versatile Commuter," Bought it after driving a Ford Edge for 5 years.  I did not have any issues with the Edge, but with a 30 mile commute each way want to have more options when facing not so optimal driving conditions and options for other ""routes"" less busy with traffic.  I am not in the habit to always venture in negotiating obstacles or drive thru ""unusual"" road and surface conditions to avoid traffic, but once in a while is good to know you have that capability.  The ride is comfortable, the navigation system is very up to date and the 6 cylinder is perfect in regards to a fuel economy, terrain adaptability and speed/power combination.  Once you get the hang of the entertainment system controls, is like paying an instrument.  You do not need to look at the road and selecting media, radio, or hone is very safe since you will not need to look at the distracting displays.  I have the adaptive cruise control and collision warning which is a welcomed feature when driving in fog, rain, dusk and dawn on my daily commute.  Thought about the SRT, but decided against it since overall, the 4WD 3.6-engine of the high altitude balances all of these features (power, speed, economy and price) in a smart way.  I had an issue with the passenger door alignment, but this was addressed timely and in a way that did not inconvenience me as a customer.  The dealer was responsive and diligent.  After this issue, I have nothing but praise for the car.  I would have liked to have more legroom for rear passengers and the rear seats designed for 4+ hours trips i.e. more comfortable.     The only major observation is the lack of roof racks.  For a car that promotes an active lifestyle, having to buy roof racks that latch on to the door opening is sub-optimal.  I advise to negotiate the chrome package with the purchase of the car since this will enhance the looks while protecting your investment.",4

First I started having issues with my shifter upon start up, the lights on the shifter would not turn on so the communication between that and the dash would not allow me to shift and then after a short amount of time they would pop on and service shifter would pop up in my instrument cluster along with the check engine light. Took it to the dealer and of course they could not replicate so hey just give it back to me and wait for it to happen again. Well it did so I took it back and yet again they would not do anything so they gave it back happened the next day so I recorded what happened so they couldn't give me grief. They finally replaced my shifter after initially wanting to tear apart my transmission for something else even though there was an open recall for other cars but of course mine was not included even though it did the same thing. Hadn't even hit 10k on the odometer at this point. After 5k miles what a shock it happened again and again the shopnwanted to tear apart my transmission and Jeep said no put a flight recorder in. So after a month it still hadn't happened now the dealer kept calling and harassing me to get the recorder back and I can just come back again after it happens again. During this time I had to have a taillight replaced because it cracked from the inside, dealer told me to call Jeep because they weren't going to risk a charge back. Also have had a plastic molding on the door start to fall of since it's smart to hold pieces of a car together with double sided tape and also a panel in the cargo area was warped. I have also had my auto windshield wipers malfunction twice and also my esc light has come on twice now along with another check engine light for I can't even remember what.

2055, on 02/06/17 10:05 AM (PST),Homer ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV High Altitude 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),High Altitude *Eco Diesel*," Been looking at this car since 2014 model and pulled the trigger on the 2016 because of replaced shifter and fixed bugs from previous model years.  Fit and finish is fantastic so far. Chrysler took the Mercedes refinement and stuck it into JGC interior. Very nice. Seats are very comfortable (keeping an eye on Leather durability). Uconnect is intuitive. Italian EcoDiesel gets great highway mileage and tows like a champ . Astonishing actually. Pulls my 5500lb boat like its not even there. Transmission (german I believe) works well. My only trepidation is all the electronics/computer components-- which is true for most cars these days. The Advanced Technology Group is very slick. I also like the fact that it can be turned off. Regardlesss, for the price I paid -- this Diesel is hard to beat.  Pay no attention to the EPA accusations about the 3.0 Eco Diesel. Compared to my  old Duramax-- the JGC emissions are non existent. IMHO My guess is FCA will be exonerated from EPA shakedown. The only Vehicle that could top this  (for the money) would be a Diesel version of the Durango (which shares most components and has a third row)...... Stay tuned , I will update in 6 months.",5

In Texas you have to have a strong AC.  Instead of the coldest output air being 36-39 degrees, the best you get by factory definition is 44 degrees. I have a white exterior, tan interior, no sun roof. If it was all black with moon roof and five passengers, it would be unbearable at 100 degrees. There is no way a consumer knows unless you take along a thermometer when test driving. No cars reviews are ever given for climate controls. I just received a recall notice that due to a potential mfg defect, this model may be subject to an engine fire. Update 01/06/18. Inspected for engine fire recall and no issue. Still not happy with the AC performance. Forgot to mention another annoyance. You can't turn the radio off. There is no off button. When you turn the car off and then start it up again. The volume comes on where you left it. It has a mute button, but that only works when the radio is on. You can't mute and then turn the car off, it just comes back on to the volume setting last seen. I called Jeep and complained but they said it was a technological advancement. Duh! Other than the AC and no radio off button, it's a great SUV. Footnote: being 6'5"" I could use more legroom.",3

Have the white High Altitude Diesel 4WD with every option available(including a CD player). Gas mileage is amazing, I drove from LA to Vegas and back on 1 tank. The Jeep with this package is beautiful, it is always catching attention. I was skeptical about getting a Diesel because of the loud sound, but honestly inside is pretty quiet. Standing outside by the hood of course you will hear the loud engine. The Diesel engine is a turbo so taking off from a stand still is pretty amazing, I've shocked a few people. Once you are driving though, it seems the Jeep takes a little bit of time to gain some speed. Safety and Fuel Economy were my top reasons for purchasing this vehicle. The forward collision warning with automatic braking, has saved my life many times. CD player I have never used, but the Uconnect system is very user friendly. The Adaptive Cruise Control allows for me to breeze through traffic allowing the Jeep to do all the braking and gas. The 19 speaker Harmon Kardon system is a serious beast! The air suspension allows for easy exit and entry for those who don't like to feel like they are climbing a tree to get in and jumping off a small cliff to get out.... This is my 2nd Jeep Grand Cherokee and first diesel and I am definitely happy with my decision to stick with the ""Jeep cult.""",5

I'm a young-ish guy, hit my early thirties and decided that I wanted to finally trade in the Murano SL I'd been driving for 7 years and upgrade to a moderate ""luxury"" vehicle as a reward to myself for hard work.  I started with looking at the usual... BMW, Mercedes, Land Rover, etc.  Then I decided to broaden my search to include the $35,000 - $45,000 range for new and used.  That's when I came across the Jeep GC Overland and Summit models.  As I looked over the features, every one of the features that I found so appealing of luxury vehicles was built into this thing.  I'm a tech-person, so the touch screen, digital display in the drivers hub, adaptive cruise control, front and rear parking sensors, blind-spot warnings, reverse cross traffic warnings, ventilated / heated seats, powered lift gate... Seriously the list goes on... When I discovered all of these in a vehicle for at least $10,000 to $15000 less than the other brands I had looked at, I could no longer justify spending >$60,000 for the base model of stereotypical ""luxury"" brands.  The test drive is what sealed the deal.  Smooth with just the right amount of power.  Love it.  The only issue I've had in 2 months is a small rattle that was coming from a loose engine cradle mount of some sort.  Took it back and they fixed it in a couple hours. I haven't joined the cult yet, but I can see why so many people stick with Jeep.  I hope it holds up.",5
2075, on 09/12/16 15:58 PM (PDT),old Bob ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Laredo 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Red Velvet Beauty," We bought the least expensive 2WD model with the V-6. GREAT quiet solid ride. Handles great. Can't tell when this 8 speed shifts; it's so smooth. Can't comment on dealer service or reliability as we only have 800 miles on it. I really hope it stands up as well as our 2007. Fuel economy is 24 mpg with 50-50 driving. Took a 50 mile trip doing 60-65 and got 30 mpg with the air on! I don't know why reviewers rate fuel economy bad-this is a heavy(4,500 pounds) beautiful riding safe vehicle, not some tuna fish can dwarfmobile with a 4 cylinder that seats 4 people and has little storage area and couldn't tow a rowboat or go through 4 inches of water. Disappointed it didn't come with a CD player(we're old and still use THEM). Don't like that the radio comes on whenever you start the vehicle. Big negative that twice it has shifted into low gear. NEW REVIEW-Yesterday we returned from a trip north where we drove 2,000 miles including stop and go driving and hwy. driving @ 70-75 mph. Incredibly we got 27 mpg both ways running with air at least 70% of the time.  We sat in traffic on the Belt pkwy. through Brooklyn and Queens which was a nightmare for 20 miles, going nowhere, and still averaged spectacular mileage with a full load-3 people weighing 525 pounds and packed with luggage and other stuff!LOVE this SUV! EXCELLENT value. Also, the 293 HP Penta engine is a beauty. I can add the dealer service is Excellent.March update. Now have 3,500 miles on it and my American car still hasn't disintergrated.

The dealer gave us another new Grand Cherokee with the same options. Chrysler gave us an extended warranty on the replacement car. We are happy with the new Jeep.

2079, on 06/25/16 23:29 PM (PDT),Edmund K. ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 75th Anniversary 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Very disappointed," I had a Dodge Durango for a few years and since it was almost out of its extended warranty I figured get a new Jeep.  What a mistake that was.  After owning for only two weeks the car spent 11 days at a dealer for the following problems:  Faulty paint on the spoiler, Extreme wind noise, clunk noise when going over speed bumps, clothing hanger loose & rattling.   They repainted the spoiler, replaced the two front door rubber seals, a front & rear shocks were leaking so they replaced the front shock (rear shock is on extreme backorder, whatever that means because no one knows), replaced clothes hanger.  Well, after 11 days at the dealer, the wind noise issue is not resolved as once I hit 50+ miles per hour, I can't hear anything inside the car and the clunk noise when going speed bumps is still there.  I even made sure that the technician had driven over a bump to ensure the problem was actually the leaking shock.  I'm not sure how he couldn't hear the clunk as it's as loud as it can be.  So, now I have to go back to the dealer and leave my car for God knows how many more days there.  Now the headrests on both seats have started rattling every time going over rough road.  I haven't even made my first payment yet and I'm already disgusted with the car.Update:  took the vehicle back to the dealer.  It sat there for another 5 days (now total of 16 days at dealer).  Apparently it were the two front shocks leaking & not the rear, bad communication from the service adviser.  They replaced the second front shock.  Clunk noise is still there.  Technician couldn't replicate the wind noise, so we took a ride and then he heard how loud it was and agreed it wasn't normal.  Next step is to wait for a Chrysler representative to come out, test drive the car and do a cabin pressurizing test to see where the air is leaking from (I'm not sure how you can pressurize a cabin when there are so many vents located all over).  This keeps getting better and better.2nd Update:  Vehicle back at the dealer.  The clunk noise is still there.  Took a ride with the technician and went over small bumps at about 5 miles per hour and you could hear the noise.  His suggestion: driver over them slower!!!!!!!!!! I suggested maybe I should get out of the car & push it over the speed bump.  After all aren't Jeeps suppose to be off-road vehicles and yet they can't handle a small shopping center speed bump.  The wind noise still there, apparently the technician made the whole thing up about a Chrysler representative coming out and doing the whole pressurizing the cabin thing, because according to the service manger that never happens and Chrysler reps never come out.  So, now I'm back in my cheap piece of junk, dirty loaner car for the 3rd time this month, crossing my fingers that they will actually fix these problems on a car that I paid well over $40k for.",2
2080, on 06/21/16 18:10 PM (PDT),MDRRI ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),One month and 1100 miles into my '16 JGC," Can't comment on reliability because it's still new. However, the driving experience is fantastic. I traded a 2013 200 convertible with the 3.6-litre Pentastar. It's a sweet engine, and it's even better with the 8-speed transmission behind it. I'm averaging 20-21 MPG with short freeway runs and some around-town puttering. That's much better than I expected, and not much worse than the 200. I bought it from an out-of-state dealership and drove it 450 miles home from the showroom (averaged 25 MPG on that run with speeds between 65 and 70 MPH - great for a brand new engine). It's a fantastic road-trip car. Comfortable, nearly silent on the highway, firm and supportive front seats with plenty of leg room, and an overall feeling of confidence and stability.  This thing has all the hallmarks of a luxury car. The 8.4 uConnect with Nav is easy to operate and the big screen makes changing settings easy. The voice recognition works well, too. Minor quibbles: I wish the wiper control was on a stalk on the right side of the steering column - a quick flick of the finger for a mist wipe is easier than a twist of the turn signal lever; I would like the steering wheel to telescope out further as I like to sit way back (I can still be comfortable, but I would be more comfortable with the steering wheel a bit closer). The base audio system is not bad, though I have ordered Focals from Crutchfield to upgrade the speakers. All said and done, this is a great vehicle - comfortable, solid-feeling, and reasonably economical considering its capabilities. I believe it holds its own as far as features, comfort, and roadability when compared to high-end SUVs costing thousands more, which makes it a bargain. What remains to be seen is how it holds up over time. So far, so good, but it's still brand new. If it turns out to be reliable I will keep it until the wheels fall off. I have owned Chrylser vehicles for many years and they've all been great, so I have hope for this one.Update at two months and 3300 miles. MPG is up to 27 on road trips with the cruise control set at 75 and the AC cranking. Still averaging 21-22 puttering around suburbia. It seems the AC could be a little more powerful - my only complaint. Still loving my JGC!",5

2082, on 06/08/16 09:43 AM (PDT),Randy G. ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Compares nicely to more expensive competition," I did a lot of research and reviewed Mercedes, BMW, Volvo, Land Rover and Lexus online before narrowing things down to the Mercedes GLC and Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit due to number of factors including price, proximity to dealer, reviews, etc. My estimated budget was $50k. I test drove both cars and gave them both high marks. However, Jeep blew me away. It is a solid, quiet, well put together car with fit and finish as good as the Germans. While the Merc may have a slight edge on technology, ease of use goes to the Jeep. It is intuitive and requires little training to understand where all the controls are located. The Jeep is also a larger, more capable SUV than the Merc GLC which gives more flexibility. Value-wise, the Grand Cherokee Summit was several thousand less than the comparably equipped GLC and the dealer was willing to give me quite a bit more in trade than the Mercedes dealer.After a few weeks of owning the Jeep, I continue to be a happy owner. The car runs great and the 6 cylinder engine provides even more power and response than my previous Lincoln MKX 8 cylinder while getting around 22 mpg combined. I am also greatly enjoying the Harmon Kardon sound system that comes in the Summit version. One of the best factory installed car stereos I've heard.Update 6/9/17 - Still enjoying the Jeep very much. I have about 15k miles on it now and car has mostly been solid with one exception. Last fall and winter when the weather turned cold, my check engine light came on and my remote starter would not operate. Since that indicator light is multi-function, it was important to bring in the vehicle asap as I didn't want to void my warranty if it was something serious. It turned out that the problem occurred with several other Grand Cherokees that the dealer had sold as well and they were having difficulty diagnosing it. The diagnostics indicated a problem with a cam shaft timing sensor. They replaced a solenoid and reset the engine check light but the problem reoccurred several weeks later when the weather got cold again. Eventually after a couple of trips to the dealer they worked with Chrysler and after several more weeks, Chrysler was able to solve the problem. It took three, time consuming trips to the dealer to finally sort it out which was frustrating. However, the dealer was good about providing loaners and treated me well and eventually were able to fix the car. The problem did not reoccur for the rest of the winter. I remain quite happy with the vehicle.",5

I've put a lot of miles on a 2014 Grand Cherokee and the 2016 is much improved. The power steering doesn't make that whirring noise (yet!), the shifter is SO much better than the previous electronic version, it's buttery smooth now. My only criticisms of the Grand Cherokee so far:The auto start/stop is not for everyone, there should be a way to disable it by default and not have to press the button on each start up. It's actually kind of safety hazard, I find myself making more rolling ""California"" stops so that I can avoid it from turning the engine off. No Apple CarPlay support, would love to see this supported on all Uconnect versions. They got rid of the dual exhaust, not a big deal but might be for some. They moved the backseat hand handles from the top roof to the front sides, not sure this was a great move seeing as the Grand Cherokee is more of a luxury SUV than off-road where you might need the forward handles.",4

I had leather seats placed in both which are much more comfortable than the cloth seats. Both the 2015 and 2016 are identical with the exception of the gear shift and the stop/start functionality, and back up camera on the 2016 model.  I previously owned at 2000 Grand Cherokee and was pleased to see that these models are larger,  steadier and roomier than the one I had before.  The ride is very smooth. Can't say enough about how happy I am with this vehicle. I am likely to buy this out at the end of the lease if I remain this satisfied.  I gave teh Grand Cherokee an overall score of 4 based on the start/stop function. I really hate this function, especially in the stop and go traffic here in Florida. It starts as soon as I take my foot off of the brake but with that, it still takes a second for it to start and take off.  Overall when running, the V6 engine has sufficient pickup for me.  I also felt that the led lights should be standard on all models of Grand Cherokee at this price base.",4

I prefer the motor not stop at every traffic light. so I have to push a defeat button every time I go out in the car. I can see where start/stop tech. will cause the battery to drain down especially at night with the headlights on and the air running etc. In florida especially with the temps high in the summer. I think that this feature is on most new cars, my sister was complaining about it on her new Jaguar also.  I am going to find out if this feature can be permanently defeated. The only other complaint is the motor has plenty of power normally, except when you add a trailer. this engine would be better if they added a turbocharger as the torque is low especially when towing. Im sorry that I did not get the hemi engine. My mistake,",5
2091, on 04/15/16 17:47 PM (PDT),Dave ,2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV Summit 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),I hate the start stop, I love every thing about this except the start stop function and that is my reasoning for the lower rating.   It just is not working for me. It hesitates on start stop  when you want to accelerate fast from  the  (A mode  /Start /Stop Mode) into heavy traffic. The engine just can not start fast enough to react.  The button to turn if off is deactivated on each start which is a problem.  If I could turn it off forever I would have the perfect SUV.  I was told everyone wanted this to save gas that is why they installed it.  Well I like good gas mileage but lets be honest.  Are you really buying this for gas mileage? Buy something else if you are if you are!  It is a JEEP!,3

The only other candidate I really liked was the Explorer and it really could have gone either way. The color combination of the Summit as well as the overall reputation of the Jeep brand was really what pushed it over the top. This one was the premium white with the sienna brown interior. I only wish that this vehicle came with the V8 option at less than extortionate pricing. The V6 pulls and runs really well but there is nothing like the grunt of the Hemi. That being said it wasn't worth another $5,500.00 being added to an already fairly significant sticker price. So far I absolutely love the vehicle and don't yet have one thousand miles on it.

It is the straight 4.0 ltr 6. I now have 187,000 plus and it runs as great as the day I bought it. The most expensive part I had replaced was believe it or not the oil pan $600 as the old one piece that lets the drain plug screw into the weld broke loose and fell in the pan. I have replaced the starter also, but did that myself for just the part costing $145. I still use this truck everyday 25 miles each way back and forth to work. It is very easy to work on. I change the oil every 3000 miles and to be honest, I have never replaced the transmission fluid, but will do so soon. But this truck is like clockwork. starts up every day, drives smooth, it is a little noise, but I think if I had different tires it would be quieter. The heater still works great. The air cond just started to taper off and I will recharge. This truck is absolutely awesome in the snow and rain. I love the flexibility of the 4 wheel part and full time. I have never used the low, and do not take off road, but living new phila, we do get some extreme weather. I know a person that has over 500,000 on the same 4.0 engine. This is definitely a keeper. I did have a issue with the temp control that helps to regulate the eng temp. I was replacing ever year for 2 years and then I decided to replace myself. It is located on the passenger side wheel well behind the front Light. I replaced and found that they were not adding great under the module that prevents moisture from damaging the unit.

I've read the same thing on other reviews and it doesn't really seem to give anyone problems. Besides that, it's the easiest vehicle to park out there.

Several thousand dollars of attempted repairs wasted.

If I don't lean on it too much I can get 18-19 MPG but the temptation is too great most of the time. It can smoke almost anything else out there from a dead stop.

This being my third ever car and coming from Toyotas, 91 Mr2 and '04 matrix xrs, I see and feel the lack of quality of this Chrysler Product. I have put 26,000 MI on this.First, alignment has been off since day one.  After the first winter, i noticed rust on the door hinges, all of them. It causes the doors to kind of catch, or creak, like 90's and early millenial GMs. At the same time it developed a nice squeak or creek sound in the rear suspension when going over the tiniest bumps. It first wasn't very noticeable but now is quite audible. Just rock the car when it's parked.  It currently is at the dealer for rhis problem and has been there all weekend. I hope they can fix it.After after winter 2013 I noticed a lot of water pooled behind the driver seat. Took into the dealer. Turns out the windshield cowl got blocked up and water started entering through the flooboard. 1st gear has popped out on me a few times. Reverse has done it too, I understand it's not synchronized, but still annoying. What else? The tires wail and scream when turning small radii in parking lots at very low speeds. Cruise control is pointless, as 5th gear has no torque below 2700rpm so if you want to cruise anywhere above 70 you need to be wasting gas in 4th to still be able to use the cruise buttons for acceleration. The painted steelies are rusting and it hasn't been three years. The things I actually like are that it's manual and 4x4. It returns decent mpgs, no different from my previous car. Acceleration is adequate in city only. I am happy with the fact that it is very basic, power windows doors, a/c. Single disc basic stereo, creature comforts, that's it.All in all, I have more hate than love for this jeep, and if it weren't for the fact that it's paid off and I enjoy no car note.     Whether I will keep this long term or not depends on how this suspension creak pans out. Otherwise I will just get my money's worth out of it and move on before it will need new tires...",3

2277, on 08/06/17 20:28 PM (PDT),Caylee ,2008 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 5M),It's a love/hate relationship," My parents bought this Jeep in 2008. It was a fun, sporty car-something that was a bit different. I started driving it primarily when it was handed down to me in 2011. Since I have had it, the transmission has needed to be replaced, air conditioning and one of the speakers that had blown. Now, being honest, I am also one who likes to drive more pedal to the metal. Brakes have needed to be replaced a bit more than usual. It does not do well speeding up. Sure, once you get going it hits 85-90 mph just fine, but it makes a lot of noise to get there. I've also had a couple of moments where I've gone and the pedal would literally be hitting the bottom and the car for some reason would stall and only go about 15-20 mph until it kicked in. It also does not do very well in the winter. I live in the midwest, so we get to see all seasons and the weather that comes with it. It does horrible in the snow and sometimes even after a heavy rain. It does have nice climate control inside. The AC does wonders, and defrost works pretty quickly in the winter as well. It is nice to park in tight spaces and makes tight turns pretty nicely also. It is more of a smaller SUV size, but still packs a lot into it. The rear bench seat folds completely down and can haul a lot. The gas tank doesn't really hold a lot, maybe 11 gallons? I usually have to fill up about every 270 miles (and that's pushing it). All in all, its a nice little jeep. Hauls a lot and can be fun to drive, but not great for bad weather conditions and has some bad blinds spots as well. From what I have heard, 2008 was a bad year for the Jeep Patriot also, so hopefully they have made some improvements since then.",3
2278, on 08/02/17 18:00 PM (PDT),Ignatz ,2008 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Amazing!," I'm still impressed with it after 250,000 miles.  CVT was replaced under warranty -- dealer gave me a Chrysler to use while it was being repaired and the whole incident didn't cost me anything.  Had a wiring problem at 190,000 miles and realized I'd hardly spent anything on repairs up till then so I went ahead and put out $1000 for a new engine harness.  That was two years ago and I've had no significant problems since.  Patriot is easy on gas and I'm an easy driver so my fuel economy is consistently in the high 20s MPG and it gets into the 30s on a long trip if I stay under 60MPH.  Mine is FWD which helps the fuel economy.  FWD is great in the snow and we get plenty here in NH.  I don't do any serious off-roading but my Patriot handles marginal dirt roads and trails with no problems.  Not only would I buy another, I did:  we got a 2014 for my Wife -- also a great vehicle.Update:  I'm now at 268,000 miles and still running well.  Only major repair since my last review is that I replaced my shocks and struts all around.  Those were my originals and I'm very impressed they lasted that long.  We get a lot of frost heaves and potholes in this area.Another update:  I've since sold my beloved Patriot to a friend.  As of last week he's still driving it and reports no problems.  It must be getting close to 300,000 miles now.  I miss it, but with that many miles I felt it was time for something newer because I do a lot of driving in the winter months and in the mountains.  If I didn't go so far from home I'd still own my Patriot.  It was a darn good and reliable machine.",5

I also purchased an extended lifetime warranty to cover the non powertrain components. 1st brake job at 95,000 miles. 2nd brake job at 179,000 miles. Runs great nd is a little work horse. 80 foot tree fell on house and this little jeep pulled it off the roof and down the driveway to be cut up. Gas mileage has been as high as 30 mpg in summer months on the highway but always in the 25 mpg combined unless towing. Right now the issue is who's lifetime is going to be the longest the Jeep or mine. The only complaint that I have ever had is the noise during acceleration. As far a being sluggish, I think being able to hit 90 + mph on a freeway entrance is more than acceptable. The real problem is the driver's that think you should enter at 45mph. At this writing I have185,000 + miles and does not use any between oil changes. I have used synthetic since the 1st 1000 miles.",5
2285, on 08/28/15 08:46 AM (PDT),Brian C ,2008 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 5M),130k and going strong!," Reading some other reviews on here I felt inclined to share my story.I bought my 08 Patriot Limited through a friend who worked at Chrysler.  It was an employee lessee vehicle and had just under 20k miles on it.  It was my first vehicle and I wanted something 4WD as I lived in MI at the time and wanted something that could handle the snow.  I feel this SUV delivers on points that a small SUV should, it handles well and gets good gas mileage(I average 22 on any day).  It is not the prettiest Jeep ever made when it comes to in interior, its cheap plastic dash and instrument panels leave something to be desired, but as for the drive train it has not disappointed.  Other than keeping up with the Breaks and Oil changes not much has been needed as far as maintenance on my Jeep.  I did front breaks at 60k and then did all 4 breaks and rotors at 105k.  At around 90k I heard some clunking in the front end and my neighbor was a mechanic at a dealer who said that the Lower control Arm/Ball Joints tend to wear in the Patriot and I should have it looked at.  I did, and he was correct, they were wearing and needed to be replaced, my mechanic (not a dealer) quoted me ~$750 to do it, I decided to give it a shot myself and finished both sides in a few hours after getting the parts at Advanced.  Other than the listed items above my Jeep Patriot has been everything I wanted from a first Jeep.  The old adage is true, you get what you pay for, this is a lower cost Jeep when it comes to the Jeep family so they kept costs low on some luxury feature, but kept the money in the critical components.  It handles GREAT in the snow and I recently moved from Michigan to Texas and had to pull 5x8 trailer for the first time, and other than killing the gas mileage it got the job done without any issues (and she was at 120K at the time).  I would buy this car again if I needed another good running, affordable, 4wd, small SUV for my daily life.  My next one will most likely be a Grand Cherokee (unless Ford brings back the Bronco...)",4

She wanted AWD and decent gas milage and liked that the Jeep Patriot came with a lifetime power-train warranty.

Both front lower control arms had to be replaced at 65K miles.  Now with 113,000 miles on it the front struts are shot.  Also we have had trouble with the sunroof leaking occasionally and now there is a leak letting in a little bit of water near the top of the rear hatch.

I was sure the cop would come after me for driving unsafe vehicle. Did I mention those mirrors? Just do n't trust them they are not there for you. It looks safe, objects truly are not were they really are in this case. I always wondered what it meant on mirrors. Object are closer then.... yes they are.Now I know.One plus is the a/c. The vents are great they spin all directions. So avoid this car unless you want  to throw away your money,better to buy a scooter.",1

But if you own one or have driven one for a while you will know this is one of the best little suv's you will ever get. I have a 2010 which I used for my business that just turned over 290,000 miles and is still running fine with no major repairs! Matter fact it has served me so well that last year I bought a new 2017 Patriot High Altitude 4 x 4 and it has proven to be just as reliable. Bye 2017 came with a factory tow package and I have toad 2000 pounds with it back and forth through the mountains of Western North Carolina several times with no problem. I owned one of just about every vehicle made, trucks, vans and sport cars but I've never had a vehicle for this money that has given me as much pleasure to drive and that has been as dependable. If you have a patriot you know what I'm talking about, if you don't, you should get one and find out for yourself. They stop making the Patriot which is another ridiculous decision on the part of FCA like building their vehicles in Mexico , What a mistake. So 2017 is the last Model but if you shop around you might get lucky and find one. So don't pay any attention to reviews that are by publishers who can be biased for money. Instead, stop someone on the street that owns one and ask them what they think of the car. From all the reviews I read before I bought my second one I have found it to be the highest rated vehicle in the United States. And that's for a reason, because it is one of the most dependable and for the money you can't possibly go wrong.",5

It may not be as sophisticated, but it is a solid 4WD SUV with room for your stuff and sufficient power for normal driving with the 2.4 liter  engine and the 6 speed transmission.  I did drive the 2 liter model some months ago and found it to be inadequate.   Visibility is very good.  The seats are comfortable enough and the controls are conveniently located.  The fit and finish is good, but the materials could be a better grade, but acceptable for the price point.   The ride is a little stiff and breaking is good.  It handles well in wet conditions and snow. It seems to be well balanced.  The gas mileage is not the best and the gas tank capacity is only 13.6 gallons.  The UCONNECT SYSTEM is adequate, but the instructions for set-up are no so good.   I have owned the vehicle for eight months and have not needed to take it back to the dealer for any warranty issues.  I have taken the Patriot on 2 road trips from Maryland to Florida and to upstate New York.  It may not have the ""snob"" appeal of other SUVs, but it has proven to be a solid work horse.",4

All have had a complete low range gearing.  My previous jeep was a Cherokee bought in 1984.  As I consulted to the minerals exploration industry and mining it got heavy use and the low range came in handy as it did in the previous models.  I have drive manual vehicles since 1964 and was dismayed with the Jeep choices.  I wanted a full Jeep transmission like the Cherokee had, but my choice there was a glitzy model or a Wrangler.  At my age the Patriot was the best fit and all I could get was 4x4 Sport model as I like crank windows and no central lock,  The 4x4 drive lack a true low range, but when you lock the four wheel in it seems to drop to a lower range as describe by the technicians at the Jeep dealer.  The anti sway feature is remarkable on muddy wash board roads and where hydroplaning is occurring,  I live in western Colorado and the afore mentioned features combined with the 2.4L engine is remarkable.  Also, I bought the Patriot for its plane jeep look.  I like to scramble old mining roads etc and the glitzy just would not fit as I would not want to scratch and dent such a fancy vehicle. I am a large, very large man, and this vehicle is roomy front and rear for me. On the freeway gas mileage is about 30-31mpg using cruise control at 65mph.  Lots of power to spare and shifting is smooth and easy, and the stick is well positioned.",5

I can definitely say the 6spd unit is an improvement in every way. Worth every penny getting a 4x4 over a FWD. Gas mileage is only slightly less, but I drive mostly highway so I barely notice a diff at all. It may not be the quietest on the hwy, but I don't think it is all that much louder than my Acura trade-in was. Rides very well on city streets with the Goodyear Wranglers, especially given the ohio road conditions. Uconnect is pretty basic, but gets the job done. There is something to be said for no distracting screens in a car these days. I test drove this back to back with the new renegade expecting the renegade to crush it, but I actually much preferred the look and feel of the Pat. Looking forward to many more years of enjoyment. The Sport SE package has every thing I wanted, and nothing I didn't - perfect bang for your buck. Out the door for under 20k on a brand new Jeep 4x4 is too good to pass up.**6 month update**Still loving my Pat. I have put over 12k on it since June and have had zero issues. Decent highway cruiser, and averaging about 26 mpg with my mostly highway commute. Has survived a couple big ikea trips and can haul most anything in the back. Forgot how comfortable the front seats were, and the storage nooks are great for phone/wallet etc. Definitely recommend upgrading the headlight bulbs and speakers, but both of those take about 15 minutes to do, super simple.

I had everything from a Buick LeSabre to Geo Metros and everything in between (lots of Taurus's) and never returned a car early.  My car was totaled last week (not my fault) so I needed to rent a car.  I had a Camry for almost a week but it sounded like something was going to fall out of the front end so I swapped it last night for this Jeep.  I went back first thing this morning and swapped that out for a Hyundai.  I have never felt ""not safe"" driving a car until this Jeep.  Forget the interior that seems more cheaply built than the aforementioned Geo Metro, the stereo that can't cost FCA more than $15 including all the speakers, or the rear mirror that you have to be a monkey to reach, but I have never driven a car with worse torque steer in my life.  I drive like a little old lady and I kept finding myself heading toward a parked car every time I touched the gas.  This Jeep would be an embarassment in 1980.  How can a 2017 be this horrid?",1

If you don't like the more old-school boxy Jeep look and you prefer something that looks like a high top gym shoe, then get the Renegade ;-) . Otherwise, I love the straight-forward basic look, function, and feel.  As much as I love having all the fancy bells and whistles on a SUV, I just see as more stuff to break further down the road. I haven't had the vehicle for that long so I can't comment on it's reliability just yet. I do recommend the 2.4L engine over the 2.0L for a that little extra oomph. Patriots/Compasses don't have the greatest acceleration. Not bad but not great. This is supposed to be the last year for the Patriot.

Having last owned a Grand Cherokee, the Patriot does not ride as smooth or quiet, but it is satisfactory. Handling and braking are superb. The 2.4 liter has plenty of power for passing. Mileage is consistently around 26 mpg. Being FWD/4X4 makes for great traction on snow and ice in the mountains where live (elevation 3,000').  Our big dogs fit comfortably in the back. We are about to endeavor in full-time motor home travel with the Patriot as a ""toad"". At 3,600# it is just right for towing on a dolly and should give us great service for all climates and terrain. The six speed/manual transmission allows for downshifting on mountain roads without excessive braking as the ""flat-landers"" tend to do. So far, no issues to complain about. For the money, the Patriot is a good buy.",4

I got the manual transmission for the better fuel economy and it got 25 mpg on the first tank with half highway and half small town driving.  Not bad for AWD - beats the old Subaru that died after only 160k miles hands down.  Here in the Northwest everyone drives Subarus, I call this the Subaru alternative.  Fit and finish both inside and out are excellent.  Very solid feeling on the highway - feels like a much larger vehicle, yet very maneuverable in the city.  Wind noise is minimal, you do hear the 4 cylinder a little when you put it through its paces, stock tires are terribly noisy.  These Goodyear tires rate near the bottom in every category at TireRack, Jeep must have gotten them for free!  I got a car that listed at $24,500 for $19,100.  It has all the features you need and expect in these times - plus a few - and was $5000-$10,000 less than  a similarly equipped Toyota or Honda.  A good value in my book!  Professional reviewers say they are not reliable, but when I looked at the details for the 2015 it was below average or way below average for repairs in every category.  My 6 foot teenager is amazed by the room in the rear seat, says its more than our Dakota crew cab! Not new and not sexy, but solid.After 7200 miles I have not had a single problem or item needing attention from the dealer.  We have taken this AWD/4WD vehicle on the worst Idaho forest roads (5 mph) and it performed and handled beautifully!  It does not have low range, but is geared low enough already with the manual transmission to have no problems with very low speed rough rocky roads.After one year and 13,000 miles, still not a single problem, and not been back to the dealer.  It was totally awesome in the snow this last winter with studless snow tires.  25-26 mpg city or highway.

Bought during a winter where we regularly received 6 inches overnight and plow trucks were leaving my former car stuck in my driveway every morning. The Jeep has handled these conditions admirably; under the worst conditions the 4 wheel drive ads an element of grip and helps get up and down steep, poorly cleared streets. I've always driven 'practical' vs. plush vehicles, so from my point of view, this is a comfortable vehicle to drive. My first with heated, leather seats and honestly - I love them. So why not a 5 star rating? The driver's door often creaks on opening and I do have some concerns about how this will hold up long term. My need to get over rough roads and living with extreme winters though, made the clearance and 4 wheel capacity of the Jeep more important. Sure, if I was going to spend at least another ten to twenty thousand, I could buy a vehicle that was equally good on rough roads and more likely to hold up better over time. I'd rather spend a lot less up front, and re-evaluate my needs in four or five years, by which time car technology will have taken a few more steps.",4

It currently has 45,000 miles on it and is a daily driver for me. I have had zero warranty issues and my only repair costs have been routine maintenance. My favorite thing about the vehicle is it's  simplicity of interior layout and controls. It certainly is not a touring vehicle you'd want to jump in and drive across the county, but with the 6 speed automatic it feels zippy on city streets and is a great little bomber to boogie across town in. As an avid outdoorsman this little buggy gets me where I need to go and can haul all of my gear even for multiple day excursions. You're not going to tackle the slick rock of Moab but I have been impressed by the capability to access my favorite camping spots as well as it's ability to blast through the soft sands of the East and West coasts of Florida.

I do think that a 3 year/ 36,000 mile warranty is a bit lame though, come on FCA... when Hyundai can offer a 100,000 mile warranty, it seems pretty crappy to only offer 3/36K on your cars.  *UPDATE*  It's just about three years old now and has almost 70,000 miles on it. It's been very reliable with no needed repairs. We just replaced the original tires at 65,000 miles, it still has the original brake pads and rotors that feel like new.

I live in northern California and dive on dirt roads and in the snow. The jeep has excellent road feel for off road not the feel of a car made for the road with awd. I see the pro reviewers give the patriot low to average score but compare it to a cars that cost 10k more.  I give the patriot 5 stars because it just gives the most bang for the buck, sure an awd car that cost 5K more has extra comfort on the road but the Patriot has adequate road comfort and is far superior off road. I have had no problems with the Patriot and my only complaint is the gas tank could be larger. I average about 21mpg and get 26mpg on long trips.

The car performed well and the all wheel drive was really nice as we drove through a Kansas snow storm on the way home.  I was concerned about trading in a 10 year old Subaru Forester with 187,000 miles that I loved, but after a test drive I felt the Jeep performed at least as well and the deal my dealer offered was really great.  My experience with the Subaru service department was terrible (the only local dealer) so I was looking for a new service experience anyway.  As it turns out I can't report on the Jeep service department as I have not needed to have the Jeep into the dealership for repair of any kind (I do my own oil changes and minor service).  We just got back from our second winter trip to Port Aransas and averaged 23.5 mpg over 3100 miles.  We now have 20,000 miles on the car and everything is working great.

The only things I would change are to make the fuel tank larger for greater cruising range and mark the speedometer in 10 mph increments instead of 20 mph for easier reading at a glance.  We are looking forward to many more years with this bargain SUV.  The car has been to Texas and back again and now has 35,000 miles on it a little over a year later.  It still has not required a trip to the dealer for repair of any kind and continues to operate as we expected.  By now the original equipment Firestone tires are about half worn out and are getting pretty noisy, but we will probably replace them with new Michelins before next winter.  So far we are pleased with the car.  The car now has 44,000 miles on it and we did replace the tires.  There was plenty of tread left on the OE tires but they became so noisy we couldn't stand it.  New Michelin Defenders and the car is quiet and rides and drives better than ever.  No other repairs have been required.  The car is now just over 3 years old and has 53,000 miles.  We drove to the Texas gulf coast again this past February (fourth trip down in this car) and the car worked great.  We still have had no mechanical issues to report.  Everything works as it should.",5

Have only 3700 and already has a recall on the vehicle. After seeing other reviews on here I think we will be trading it in and it  won't be on any Chrysler product.

First off I will say I traded in a 4 door Wrangler Sahara with WAY more options and I am still satisfied.  I have a 50 mile commute (one way) to work and the Patriot really is just a great value.  I get decent gas mileage for the size of the car, the front seats are comfy, the AC/heat works great.  It is a noisy rough ride, but it is also a budget car.  The biggest complaint I have would be the sound quality from the base stereo, absolutely horrible ad the plasticy feeling of the interior panels.  I popped some aftermarket speakers in and it is like a different car.  The best thing about this car is the storage and how easy it is to drive, especially around the city.  The seating position is great and it is very very easy to know the dimensions of this car, it is one of the only small suvs that still has a hood in sight when sitting in the drivers seat.  I think the critics reviews of this car are very harsh but when you start to compare it to other cars in its price range, it really is the best you can buy.",4

2393, on 09/15/15 11:07 AM (PDT),Nathan ,2015 Jeep Patriot SUV Altitude Edition 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Love the look and feel of this quirky vehicle!," I have to say that I've been warned many times to stay away from Dodge/Chrysler/Jeep products due to quality concerns.  You can find on many consumer websites that this concern is well founded, as this automaker appears at or near the bottom of a lot of reliability lists.  I took a shot on the Jeep, since I found that the Patriot is Jeep's most reliable vehicle (about average relative to all other cars), I love the exterior styling and interior function, and the dealer gave me a great deal on the Altitude version that I wanted.  Obviously you can see where this review is going... I have just made my second service appointment for the Jeep and I've had it less than two months.  500 miles into my ownership of this vehicle, the malfunction indicator lamp lit on my way home.  I took it to the dealership and they cleared the code, stating that the code came up as a minor emissions leak, but they suspected a false positive.  Another 500 miles or so later, and the light is back on.  Now, this does appear to be a very minor issue, as the Patriot is driving great so far.  However, no one wants to be subjected to multiple visits to the dealer immediately after purchase of a new car.  Now that that unpleasantness is out of the way, I have to say that I do love the car.  There is something analog and old school about it that is very enjoyable, now that it is basically the only choice for those who don't love the new, swoopy styling of almost all crossovers these days.  The front seats are very comfortable and the UConnect radio works very well.  The high seating position, boxy shape and square windows, as well as large side mirrors all lend to visibility being very good.  As for power and the CVT, I don't drive aggressively, so I have had no problems so far.  It's a very smooth ride.  I can see where some drivers might want for some extra power, but for me, the trade-off for extra gas mileage is worth it.  Speaking of which, I'm already averaging 26 to 27 MPG, which I think is very solid considering the boxy shape.  It's nice to find a window sticker that displays mileage that is actually beatable, and not a pipe dream.  So, overall, I guess the grade on the Patriot has to be an incomplete for now.  I have it at 4 stars, but that review could change in either direction depending on overall reliability over the next few years.  I do love it, but if I can't keep it out of the garage, I'll be forced to trade it in down the line.  Which would be a shame, because there is a lot to love!",5

Love it.," As many a reviews say, this car is about value and about being Jeep. I moved from  Subaru legacy sedan that served me exceptionally well and with ZERO trouble for 7 years (car's age 10 years). I am an outdoors guy and love my camping trip and a bit of sofy-roading. I was split between Forester and Patriot. Few factors that swayed me to the Jeep - latest Forester has become just like all other cute-utes. Jeep stands out with is retro look. Secondly the value, features and dealer discounts. Lastly the ride height and SUV like suspension. I would have bought and XT but couldnt justify the cost. About 1000 kms on it. So far no issues. Mileage has been improving and currently at about 10L/100kms in mixed hwy and city. Great sound (and it is not the Boston Accoustics upgrade); remote start; leather trimmed seats; smooth shifting though slower to start from stop; ride comfort. Will watch for repair issues and resale. Hope it beats the Subaru I loved.----Just over two years and 22k kms on the Patriot now. No issues whatsoever. Followed the maintenance schedule. Feels comfortable and safe esp in winter snow. Not the best acceleration from stop, but that is not what i bought the Jeep for. This Jeep is a keeper.",4
2398, on 07/29/15 08:44 AM (PDT),Lee Gordon Jones ,2015 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Exceeded My Expectations," My Patriot Sport actually has the 2.4L 6-speed automatic FWD option, which was not one of the offerings in the review drop-down box. I previously owned a P/T Cruiser, which I loved and managed to keep for 13 years and my son is now driving. I play music as an avocation, which means needing enough cargo space to hold a band's worth of gear (except the drums). I live in a congested area, so I must have an automatic, and I live in a hot humid area, so I must have A/C. Everything else is extra. Knowing that someday I would need to replace the P/T Cruiser, I began researching affordable wagons several years ago. Most of the reviews on the Patriot at the time were that it was underpowered and too Spartan for most of the reviewers, but those were the same demerits the P/T Cruiser earned when it came out, so I was prepared to (a) dismiss those critiques and (b) settle for something less than sterling for the price the Patriot was asking.When I finally did a test-drive of the Patriot Sport with the optional 2.4L engine and 6-speed transmission, I was immediately pleasantly surprised with just about every aspect of the vehicle. Pickup and shifting are just fine for getting on and off the highway. The interior has no extras - manual door locks, manual/crank up windows, hand-adjusted mirrors - which is fine by me; I actually prefer not having more things to break and fix as the car ages. The seats a very comfortable; the materials used seem pretty standard - there was nothing glaringly cheap about any of it; and on the whole it seems well thought out and executed. The standard sound system needed a little tweaking to deliver a sound that pleases me, but I managed to dial it in within a few minutes. My Patriot came with a single CD player with satellite radio (free for one year), AM, FM, and a 1/8"" jack to plug in an MP3 or other outboard music device. I have been driving the new Patriot for a month now. I have no complaints about its performance. The only change I would make if I were on the engineering team was to make the windows a little taller for better viewing (I must duck slightly to see the traffic light if I'm directly under it). I have not had it long enough to need service, so I cannot comment on that. But I've put on almost 1,000 miles, and have enjoyed a combined city/highway mileage of j27 mpg on regular gas.I couldn't be more pleased. I was prepared to settle for less.*** Update 30 Jan 2017 ***I have been driving my Jeep Patriot for 20 months now. I love it as much as the day I bought it. Still very comfortable, decent mileage, plenty of power, quiet, no complaints whatsoever.",5
2399, on 07/26/15 02:53 AM (PDT),Mr. Naselroad ,2015 Jeep Patriot SUV High Altitude Edition 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),They Got It Wrong Again!," First off, forget everything you just read!! The reviewers get their kick backs from the auto industry anyway. Was looking for a compact SUV/Crossover for the wife. Found this little gem and 7 months later, we couldn't be happier. We purchased the 2015 High Altitude Edition with 2.4 and 4 wheel drive (actually just transfers to AWD but jeep calls it 4X4). Main reason for purchase was price, but so much more to this vehicle. In FWD mode, we are getting 23/24 mpg in town and 28/30 highway mpg. I can't really tell you mpg in AWD because we rarely use it, even during the last Indiana winter. The FWD pulls the nibble, light weight body through almost anything on the road. While it is a compact SUV, the interior is very roomy. We have friends and family who own both the Ford Escape and the Honda CRV and they feel cramped in comparison to the Patriot. The heated leather seats are extremely comfortable and fit both our larger frames without feeling ""wedged in"". The cargo area is large. While it's Cubic volume may be smaller than some of it's competitors, due to it's shape, it  will hold a lot of items and appears larger. As a matter of fact, my brother purchased the Cherokee and the Patriot cargo area is more useful and appears larger than it's big brother's. Let's talk about ride comfort. The Patriot is no Cadillac by any means, but we feel it has a smoother ride than any SUV/crossover we have owned/driven (GMC Jimmy, Toyota 4-runner, Ford Explorer, Dodge Journey)! While the interior is sparse, it is well thought out and very ergonomic to the driver. All controls are easily reached and simple to operate without distracting the drivers attention from the road. The handling is very responsive and doesn't have that sluggish feel as in some other vehicles in it's class. The 2.4 4 cylinder is not going to throw you back in your seat, but has more than enough power for interstate driving, actually you will surprised how easily and effortlessly the engine gets up to speed. As for the tranny, unlike the article states, the 2015 Patriot comes standard with a 6 speed transmission not the CVT. The CVT is an option, but you would be hard pressed to find one on the dealer's lot!  For $21,000.00, out the door, we have a vehicle that has all the bells and whistles that would have cost us 10K more in any other vehicle. Do yourself a favor and go drive this vehicle before you buy into the crap written in this article! Options included for 21K purchase price, heated seats, leather seats, power sunroof, remote start, custom 17"" rims, 2.4 liter with 6 speed automatic, 4 wheel drive (AWD transfer lock), leather wrapped steering wheel, and heated outside mirrors! Find that in a Ford or Honda and you'll pay upwards to 30K! Most of all, my wife loves it!",5
2400, on 07/17/15 09:57 AM (PDT),Brian West ,2015 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),From hater to lover," First all the ""expert reviews"" are way off base. Had to look at the Patriot because of all the incentives expecting to be underwhelmed. We feel we hit the jackpot. Engine power is strong. Transmission is smooth. The so called outdated interior is a breath of fresh air in simplicity. Was never that interested in the Patriot but a $28000 loaded 4x4 for under $23000 was too good to pass up. You should give it serious consideration.",5
2401, on 05/25/15 08:24 AM (PDT),d0nman ,2015 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 5M),"was a good value... until 17,000 miles"," TL;DR: If you must purchase a Patriot, avoid the later model years of this vehicle, and get one with an automatic transmission. Regardless of service department quality, it's clear that the cost-cutting Chrysler imposed as they moved on to the Renegade platform had an effect both on the vehicle and the inevitable service required.I'll start off by saying I was intending to buy a Subaru Crosstrek or Forester this time around, after owning one of the FDII trail-rated Patriots previously. I've always been a big fan of Japanese vehicles for the mix of compactly packaged capability and good fuel efficiency. I thought this vehicle would mostly fulfill that idea, for a lower price. I replaced the stock tires with Toyo all-terrains right off the bat. I don't intentionally go off-roading and probably don't need them, but I did occasionally get plowed in by the maintenance guys and I've barreled through snow piles up to the front grill without a problem. Visibility is not a strong point. The A-pillars are pretty large and I've been surprised more than a few times when making a left turn by cars that were completely blocked from my view.  Windows are pretty small all around.I had one strange issue with the ignition system, with no warning. One cold and dry winter evening it simply would not even attempt to start. After about 10 minutes of research I found that over the years people have had trouble with static electricity locking up the anti-theft electronics in the ignition, especially in dry weather. I pulled the appropriate fuse for about 30 seconds and it started right up after that. Currently having an issue with concerning vibration noise somewhere in the transfer case (according to local shop); will update once I get it dealt with by the dealer.*UPDATE*: So, about that vibration noise... turned out to require a full transmission rebuild. Yes, at 17,000 miles (owned since new for about 2.5 years). I couldn't get too much information out of the horrible service rep but it sounded like bad bearings among other things. Some scouring of online forums suggests that this isn't an isolated occurrence, but it seems like many people just were told that it was ""normal"" and didn't pursue further until things really went south at 50k+. This wouldn't even have totally spoiled my opinion of this vehicle (my 2011 CVT didn't have any issues while I had it) and Chrysler, but then it took them 3 MONTHS to repair it. I called once every 1-2 weeks to get updates and was constantly led on about how it would just be a few more days. I got a loaner after a couple of weeks, but it was a Chrysler 200 with worn tires that I had to drive from January through March in a northeast winter, the exact conditions I bought a Patriot for in the first place. Afterward, responding to my inevitable complaints, the manager said that it took so long because they were waiting for back-ordered parts. He never explained why they couldn't tell me that over the phone during the previous three months. And it gets even better; once I did finally get it back and pulled out of the dealership, I immediately heard and felt something rubbing/scraping in the steering. Took it to a different dealership, and they said it needed a new steering rack and incidentally a new lower control arm because a bushing was torn. At least this time it only took about a week to fix. I can't imagine how or prove that the first dealership caused that damage while doing the transmission, but I had no problems with it beforehand. Never had an experience like this with any other car, new or used, in my 20+ years of driving.",4

2404, on 03/24/15 22:35 PM (PDT),rollpoly ,2015 Jeep Patriot SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Pro review wildly inaccurate.," To start, the ""pro"" review is shockingly inaccurate.  The vast majority of 2015 patriots are have Auto transmissions as Jeep has tossed the CVT.  The 4x4 comes with a competitive 2.5L engine. 5yrs ago Jeep interiors may have been cheap, but the 2015 interior is great! As an architect I love the way things are designed simply and functionally, no rediculous curves and swoopes, no air ducts that you can't aim in certain directions, spacious cabin, efficent cargo bed unlike the Nissan Juke.  Back seats fold flat unlike the Honda CR-V. I love the illuminated cupholders. Great features at a great price, the latitude has heated seats, reclining rear seats, audio controls, 115V outlet, remote start, ht. adjustable seat and much more.  I got 30mpg driving from Denver to WY and back. That's a 4000ft elevation gain.  With 4WD you have the benefit of being in 2WD 95% of the time and getting better gas mileage than AWD cars (while in 2WD) and better 4wd performance while in 4wd.  16 months in, I have only gone in for 2 oil changes, no other repairs/maintenance.  Driving in Colorado and skiing every weekend, I have yet to encounter snow I can't get through.  My coworkers subaru has been challenged several times due to low clearance and a wide wheelbase.  I've taken this on two road trips and it's super comfortable.  The back is large enough that I can fold the seats down, blow up an inflatable mattress and camp in my car in comfort (so many pillows!)",5

Best part is for what I paid I am not hesitant to take it off the road. Taking a $30k Subaru or Rav4 offroad? NO way. Another thing I like was availability of the manual trans. The others don't offer that. Every other sensible suv out there has gone up-market the Patriot stays true. Manual everything if you want it that way. It's lighter and faster.

For an SUV that's important... Cons: Slow from the start to accelerate, so if you need speed in a hurry you won't have it, not in a 2.4.  Also, this vehicle is not equipped with A/C turns out NONE of the basic patriots are, it's a dealer option! So if you add it,. expect $4000 or more.  The maintenance costs outdo a Camaro, $1500 for brakes, struts and shocks.. another $700 for tires! You can goto tire rack and get the cheaper ones if so desired at $70.00 a tire, the Chevy Camaro outdoes this by $60.00 a tire.  If I had to buy it all over again, I never would without the A/C.  This vehicle has a USB port, but inside the glove box and at an odd angle...! If you drive with just the front windows down you get an annoying ""helicopter"" sound that is relieved when you crack the back windows a hair.  Overall this was poorly designed, for what otherwise would seem to be a great economical vehicle.

My wife totaled my 2003 Tacoma 4x4 after hitting some black ice and losing control.  Thank the Lord my wife was fine other than some bruises and a concussion.  We decided we needed something better on gas and with a closed back end to haul things out of the weather.  4 wheel drive is a must since we live on a farm and do get snow in our part of Kentucky often enough.  We've put nearly 20k on it in the year we've had it and love it.  Has had no issues and like every owner says, don't listen to the magazine and professional reviews. This thing is a great vehicle and value for the money.After nearly four years of having the Patriot, it's still been an overall great vehicle. Have had to make a few repairs buts it's been mostly wear items, brakes, wheel bearings and one CV shaft. Normal maintenance costs are low. Did have a relay go out that I wasn't able to diagnose myself and had to have it towed in to the shop for repair. No other big issues besides that.

I wanted a car with lots of cargo space and decent mileage, so I looked at some smaller cars like the Fit, Impreza, and XV Crosstrek.

2426, on 06/29/17 19:24 PM (PDT),MtnRoad ,2011 Jeep Patriot SUV Latitude X 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 5M),"Patriot looks retro, so I bought one"," I was attracted to the 2011 Patriot because it looked like my old 1998 XJ model. Some people online have said the Patriot is too car-like but so was my 1998 XJ. My XJ was a rear wheel drive 2WD model and I powered through winters in upstate New York no problem. Once I heard the new Patriot had front wheel drive I knew it would be more than I needed. My 2011 Patriot is more comfortable than my 1998 XJ, and IMHO it handles better. I used to get a lot of shimmy when going over railroad tracks and stuff in my XJ, but this newer model Patriot handles like a dream. It is so smooth, and takes rough roads very well giving a smooth ride. I got a 5 speed to avoid all the problems with CVT / auto trans. My 5 speed gets pretty good gas mileage, much better than my 98 model XJ that had a 4.0L. I miss having the 4.0L but I like the better gas mileage of the 2.4L and just drive easy, nothing aggressive. The 2.4L uses a timing chain too so I am really happy about that. I think Jeep hit a home run with the Patriot because many of us old school Jeep guys were quite confused when they got rid of the XJ model, one of the better selling Jeeps. The Patriot is nothing like the XJ in regards to powertrain or anything, but it sure does have a nice retro updated look and handles awesome. I have 76,000 miles on mine and hope to get 200k out of mine. I am seeing used Patriots online for sale with 180,000+ on the clock so I'm feeling pretty confident mine will last a long time. The only complaint I have is I wish I had the tan interior and not the black. The black is just too dark. Other than that, Jeep did a good job with this Patriot and I've owned many Jeeps so I knew ahead of time to just keep it simple with a 5 speed, and not get any upgrades, no power windows, etc. Just a basic Jeep to last me 10+ years.

Inclines, extra weight, longer distances and higher ambient temperatures WILL cause your Jeep Patriot's CVT to overheat, forcing you to stop the car at some point and let it cool down (otherwise you will just lose torque and the car will enter limp home mode).  This transmission was build by Nissan for the Rogue and some other cars, and Nissan effectively doubled their warranty to accommodate this known design debacle.  Go online and fool around with ideas to mitigate the problem, but it is a design flaw that cannot be fixed/replace/refurbished.

Here's how to get the best 4x4 value," The enthusiastic reviews here aren't shills, I can assure you. While the venerable Patriot doesn't much impress the car writers who throw around jargon like ""daily driver""-- as if 95 percent of us had anything but  -- dollar for dollar, there's still not a better value in a roomy, reliable, adequately powered 4x4 crossover. Here's the total maintenance I've had done in three and a half years: oil changes and fluid top-offs. That's it.I  nervously bought mine in 2012, after Chrysler had already announced the model's demise in 2013.  But guess what, they had a problem -- the (2011) re-styled Patriot kept selling far more units each successive year, so I did not end up with an orphan after all. Here are the U.S. sales figures:2011 - 54,6472012 - 62,0102013 - 75,7972014 - 93,4622015 - 107,258It looks as though Fiat may finally replace the Patriot/Compass models next year, but you can still get one now. And with over a million Patriot/Compass/Caliber models -- all essentially the same CUV -- still on the road, parts and maintenance shouldn't be a problem anytime soon. I wanted the 5-speed manual transmission 4x4 with the nice wheels and manual windows. (Do you REALLY want to skid into an icy body of water with electric windows shorting out, or ride around in the summer ten years from now with malfunctioning seat warmers coming on? Hmmmm? Yeah, the fob-operated locks would be nice but they're only available with the package.) But that configuration was on NO car lot in North America--I looked.So, here's what I did. Through my credit union's dealer, I ordered the base Sport model--the ONLY one with the 5-speed stick--with the 4x4 option, A/C, and the winter package, which provides the wheel upgrade, engine warmer, rubber floor mats (hey--it's a JEEP!), fog lamps, and tow hooks. Cagey, huh, but don't forget the tow hitch like I somehow did. (I see Latitude model owners all the time who paid for the pricey standard stuff that comes with that model and then saved a few bucks by getting the ugly, small wheels! WTF!?) I paid just under $22,000 to drive it away.Couple of miscellaneous notes: If you're over 5-10 you may feel cramped--it's a bit narrower than most CUVs and has less head room. And, if you don't need quite as much cargo space (50.8 vs 63.4 cu ft with back seats down), the new Jeep Renegade looks like a sweet buy. I average only about 23mpg, but the thousands I saved over the next lowest-priced 4x4 buys lotsa gasoline.",5

If you want a vehicle to transport you in a reliable fashion from A to B, without hassle and irrespective of the road conditions, this is the utility car for you and me. Little fancy stuff, although I do like the boom box in the lift gate (optional). The interior provides a great feel for space as the windscreen is steep and distant from the front seats.

Got the Limited at a clerance price with no miles. Comfort, stero & dash are great. It drives more like a car then anything and handles great. You don't have the feeling of being top heavy as the liberty did. Gas mileage is great but could use a bigger tank. The fold flat seats come in handy. I highly reccomend this Jeep.

The car runs very smoothly. I came to the Patriot from a Grand Cherokee so I was prepared for a letdown that never ocurred. Gas mileage is near 23mpg. With this fuel economy the small capacity (13.5) tank is no issue. The amenities are good, and the VIC is better than on my Grand Cherokee.

I have been thoroughly pleased with this vehicle and would recommend it to anyone looking to buy a compact SUV. The CVT (transmission) takes some getting used to, but once you get used to it, you'll find it's a nice transmission. The gas mileage is really good, which is nice in this age of high priced gas. I would recommend to anyone who travels or camps a lot, to get the complete roof rack and tow package since cargo space inside is limited. My only major complaint is the head rests on the front seats... not very comfortable. I'm going to replace mine. ",4.375

In addition to the poor transmission the under body and suspension parts have had rust issues.  Every year we owned the Patriot if would fail the safety inspection due to rust and suspension issues.  This should not happen with a 5 year old car.  Overall the Patriot is comfortable to drive but it will leave you stranded.  Jeep should be ashamed to put their name on this vehicle.,2

I put a lot of miles on a car so it doesn't have much resale value when I'm done with it. After wearing out my fourth Audi, I decided to buy an inexpensive commuter car instead. I didn't want the look of an economy car. Had to have 4WD, and I've always preferred a car with a manual transmission. A cute ute seemed like a good fit, but only Jeep had the combo of a manly disguise, stick shift and reasonable price. Being the most American of all cars you can buy hit me right as well.  My Patriot has 200,000 miles on it today. In that time I've spent less than $500 on repairs, and can burn regular gas at 28 MPG. It cost just under $25,000 with the upgrades I ordered, and retains 30% of the original value.  love the way an Audi goes down the road, but numbers like this are sure a relief from what I was accustomed to.

Continous problems ever since.Major electrical issues with lights windows. Had to have brain replaced twice. Possibly  looking at a 3rd time. Will drive fine one minute next time won't start up. All warning lights go crazy. Sometimes it takes it 3-4 hrs before it will start.  Weird humming sounds on occasion. At stops when you push gas it will go to floor but vehicle won't move there is a 1-2 minute delay before it slowly starts to go. This is all intermittent therefore not dependable.  Dealership mechanics seem clueless. They drove it several times without a problem before it acted up for them. They still aren't sure. We've replaced all sensors. Some multiple times. Now they are saying it's probably the brain again. Interior is cheap plastic easily.  Stay away from this vehicle. It's the worst one I've owned.,1

There are no other vehicles which can manage deep sand, snow like a Jeep. You want cheeper 4x4, get a different make. I have owned this vehicle for more than 7 years. I consistently get 21.2 miles around town. Hmmm, does that exist with any other 4x4? The gas tank is small, meaning more frequent fill ups. I hope they make it with a larger gas tank. With seats down, I can fit my 125 lb. shepherd and 75 lb. boxer in this thing along with an American Pitbull weighing about 90 lb. True Jeep enthusiasts say it is only a brand it is not really a Jeep. However, this thing handles like no other vehicle out there.  The front control arms needed to be replaced. I hope Jeep improves this in the newer models. The transmission well CVT has its problems, however I still have the original. It is now 2017, my Jeep has over 100,000 miles and still going strong.

End 04/10 (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY a Jeep Patriot," I usually buy cars/SUVs/pickups and drive them into until the wheels fall off.  I like having at least 2 years without a car payment to really get my money's worth.  I bought my Jeep Patriot with 15,000 miles on it and ran well for a year.  From then on it has been mechanically unreliable.  When I began having trouble with it, I looked up problems and found many other owners of Jeep Patriots with the same issues I was having.  We live out away from any large city, so we drive a lot of highway miles.  Very little stop and go traffic.COMMON MECHANICAL ISSUES: 1) Alternator will break down at 90K to 95K2) Transmission will start to overheat (that's right, I said Transmission) at around 45K.  Talking to the Jeep/Chrysler mechanics, the recommended transmission service for the Jeep Patriot is every 30k.  To service a Jeep Patriot transmission, the mechanic has to drop the transmission. There are no drain plugs and no transmission dip sticks.  INSANE!3) Even if you do your transmission service every 30K, it makes a whining sound when it gets over 45K.  Fortunately I was under warranty when my transmission went out and got a new one. The new one still whines.  By the way, the transmission went out while I was away on work and my wife and two kids were driving.4) To change any of the front lights, you have to remove the wheels on the front. Then remove the wheel well covers. Even then, it is a tight fit for medium hands.5) To get to any moving part in the engine you have to have a lift and have professional tools to work on it.Pros1) Cost of the vehicle2) The sound system is very good.  You can listen to great music quality while you are broke down on the side of the road waiting for a wrecker.UPDATE ***********Still have Jeep. And it has 146k on it know. Transmission (the replaced one) is still holding up. I still don’t recommend this vehicle.",1

It has best fuel economy in its class. Depending on the trim you choose, you can get 30+ mpg hwy. Great vehicle for any outdoor adventures!

I test drove the Subaru Forrester because it was so highly rated.  It was an Ok ride, but it just felt like I was driving a nice car not an SUV. As soon as I got behind the wheel of this Patriot I knew it was the vehicle for me.  That is one solid vehicle!  Holds the rode well and stops on a dime.  I wanted a vehicle that was tough, durable and will get me around in the snow.  I found it.  I did not get a lot of fancy options because they are not important to me.  This is basic model, no frills. It's a Jeep for goodness sake!   I got mine for about $21K after rebate.  Not a bad price for a 4 wheel drive vehicle IMO.",4.625

I have been surprised by its reliability in all weather and road conditions.  The 4WD has allowed to me to traverse pretty steep snowy rutted dirt roads (I lived in a rural area) without issue.   I wouldn't say you could use it for off-roading, but the vehicle got me home during snowy weather.  The traction control has come into play a few times.

I still love this Jeep. This is my fourth Jeep and it does good in bad weather and city driving. Long trips are ok. Mpg is better than my old Jeep. I got this one for just under 12k and it has the power group and all other add-ons just like a Lattitude except for heated seats and navigation group. I don't  need those anyway. I compaired this to the used Toyota Rav4 and found I would have to compromise a higher cost and more mileage for the same year. The newer ones were too expensive. The differences between the two are brand name only. The Patriot does good on every aspect so far after driving it for over eight hours on a trip this week. Mpg is 10 mpg better city driving than my old JGCH I traded in. Highway driving is aroung 28 to 30 mpg on the freeway. The steering is great and I can make long trips and not get tired trying to fight the wind or weather. Did some hydroplaning during a heavy rain storm at freeway speed and it did not lose traction. Big hills are no problem for the 2.4L A6. Cargo room is no problem.,5

I traded from a 1999 JGCH. I needed better mpg for long trips to visit family. My old Jeep just got most everything fixed on it, but I felt stressed on a recent long trip down south. I picked the 2014 Jeep Patriot due to mpg and trade in value for my old jeep as well as features I needed on a newer Jeep. My old Jeep Grand Cherokee got 18 mpg on a good day. It was in very good condition. The Patriot so far is what I expected since this is my fourth Jeep. The engine and transmission do great in the North Woods and on the highway at higher speeds. I have yet to see how it performs in bad weather or during the winter. I expect the all time four wheel drive to be just as good as any other type from my previous jeeps. Interior is like new and this one has low miles. Road noise and wind noise seem quiet. I expect to get around maybe 22 or better in city driving, and 28 or so highway. Listed as 11900 but ended up at 20k with financing and extra gap and coverages. Final cost on paper only drawback, but it should help save on mpg and any big repairs to worry about with old jeep.",5

I have two relatives that own Patriots, so I knew exactly what I was getting. Didn't think I would ever part with my GMC Yukon, but I'm single, and an empty nester so I really don't need to roar around in a big V8 SUV anymore. The Patriot is more modern and practical, and meets all my needs perfectly.  The cabin is laid out very logically.  Stereo, lighting, and temp controls work great. The moonroof helps give it a more spacious feeling. I don't care about backseat comfort but it doesn't look too bad. Runs and drives wonderfully around town and there's plenty of pep for the highway. A couple of taps over to manual mode, and hills are no problem.

2577, on 09/16/16 18:31 PM (PDT),Steve Flanigan ,2014 Jeep Patriot SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),"Reliability, style, handling"," 2014 Jeep Patriot High Altitude fwd, CVT Automatic w/ Auto-stick (No option for this car on review form) ... Vehicle had one previous owner, with 19,000 miles.  Having driven it for 16 months - I recommend this to anyone who wants practicality, good looks and a bit of sophistication .. whether you take road trips with it or not.  The worst part of the car, first: the CVT Transmission. This has been replaced on many Chrysler vehicles with a 6-speed auto, because people like to have their car SHIFT - cleanly and with no fuss, to the next gear. The CVT, in normal mode, doesn't really do that ... It has a 'gradual rubber-band' concept .. it slowly expands with acceleration, and contracts ... and does leave a sort of unsatisfying feeling. It's like as you go past 10mph it's gripping the engine too tightly, and doesn't let the power unwind. ... But that's in REGULAR mode -- Chrysler had done a not great job of advertising the Auto-stick feature, and how to use it. - Using the auto-stick, this 2.0 liter engine comes to life! It's good at merging onto the highway -- As you take the brake off and go to turn, onto the entrance ramp, you put the shifter to the right and a gear will appear on the dash (1) ... Then you pop the shifter to the right, repeatedly, as revs signal ... and it gives you all the power you need to get on the freeway!  When you hit 6th gear ... then you put to the right and hold it, for 'Drive' - give it some gas and put the cruise control where you want it. It's easy ... and fun! It does mimic a stick-shift ... You basically got 6-speeds built in to the shifter .. but some people don't know it. Even these professional car places, like __, or _&_ apparently just drove it in 'auto' mode, and claimed 0-60 mph in freakin' 10.7 seconds or something. I assure you the High Altitude can get to 60 mph quicker than that. Normal leisurely driving around town, doing errands, with the trans in normal auto mode you go just fine. The trans is a bit loud, and so is the whole powertrain, but the "" professional "" reviewers don't understand a lot of people don't care about that. ... This car has the upgraded stereo - with the sun and sound package (including awesome moonroof) .. Uconnect center, to hook up your smart phone and have hands-free communication ... and Sirius Satellite Radio! Bad-a__. ... It's got leather seats, 17inch tires and awesome Mineral Grey rims. As well as the beautiful gun-metal Maximum Steel exterior paint, the sheer amount of stuff in this car really surprised me. My wife loves it.  On the highway heavy wind doesn't really bother it - The suspension takes curves with aplomb, and the Patriot never feels tippy. Brakes feel solid, and safe. Cruising between 70-75 mph (Jeep has excellent Overdrive) I've gotten a decent 28mpg highway. The inside really is flat-out luxury - Really cold a/c, with 360-degree vent control ... cool lighted cup-holders ... and heated leather seats, for cold winter days. The 2.0 liter multi-valve motor isn't a torque monster, but if you rev it it will go, on the highway ... And (using the Auto-stick, and 89 Octane gas) it will keep up with any four, and many V6s, off the stoplight to about 50 mph.  I don't understand other people's reviews different places saying this vehicle with the 2.0 is slow ... They're not.  Maybe they don't know how to use the Auto-stick.  You've got 158 horsepower .. And they're ALL THERE. (unlike many import small SUVs' hp rating) .... The thing I like best is the ride - It's a good combination of taut but comfortable.  After many thousand miles the High Altitude is a great experience, for my wife {and occasionally me} ... All in all a satisfying purchase :-)",5
2578, on 08/07/16 13:59 PM (PDT),julie ,2014 Jeep Patriot SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Great car until.....," In November 2014, we leased a brand new Patriot 4x4 with the CVT transmission for our 16 year old daughter.  It's  been a great vehicle around town but not on the freeway for an extended drive.  We live in San Francisco and drove it to Los Angeles, 7/2016 on Interstate 5.  We had to pull over 4x on the way due to the transmission overheating.  When this happens the engine power is automatically reduced and you can't go over 40, you have to pull over and leave the car running until the transmission cools down.  This is a huge safety hazard when you are in the fast lane and have to navigate to the right shoulder where the average speed on I5 is 75-80mph.  On our return trip it overheated again.  We took it to our local dealer upon our return and ""they don't know what the problem could be, there are no error codes and the transmission fluid is not burnt."" This vehicle only had 22,000miles on it.   If you search ""Jeep Patriot CVT transmission problems"" you will find this is not an isolated occurrence.  Fortunately for us, this is a lease vehicle and we are not stuck with it or trying to sell it.  We will replace it in November 2016 with another brand which is more reliable on the highway, as we are greatly concerned with out daughters highway safety when she is driving from LA to SF from college.  It's too bad because the Patriot was the perfect fit for her.",3

I am able to easily get in and out of the car without issues.  The seats to me our comfortable and the rear storage is plenty of room for my needs.  The only issue I see so far as I am still adjusting to my new car is to put my dogs in the back with their doggie seats is difficult as one side is way too wide to hook the safety straps, yes my dogs have their own car seats.  I use to have a RAV4 and the storage in the car was more hidden, but overall the Jeep does have plenty of storage too.  Can't truly give a better overall rating as the car is only a week old and so far I am liking it and time will tell how everything else is for maintenance and repairs.",4
2581, on 04/03/16 13:09 PM (PDT),George ,2014 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),It's a Jeep!," First of all, it's a Jeep.  Do you want plush comfort when driving?  I don't think so!  It's a Jeep!  You really feel the road.  You really have to shift gears.  The steering is pretty easy though.  The worse thing about the Patriot is the front visibility at about 45 degrees on both sides.  This is really a problem unless you're very careful when approaching crosswalks.I wish the gas mileage were a little better, but I shouldn't expect it on a car this size.  I get 23 mpg in the city.  It could be a little better.  The fold-down rear seats are really neat - they fold down all the way, and the passenger-side front seat also folds down.I like the engine noise - I know what the engine is doing.  It's not very loud, but you can hear it revving.  1st gear is powerful - I haven't had any problem going up steep hills on dirt.  The other gears are fun because you can go fast in them without the engine over-revving, and you can hear the gas injectors doing their job.  I drive in 4th gear under 40 mph, and can downshift to gears that would over-rev the engine in other cars (all other cars I've owned).  Once you catch on to how the gears work it's a rush to use them, especially downshifting and revving up to 3 or 4000 to upshift.The brakes are super nice.  I don't know they're there, and I've had to brake sharply on a couple of occasions - no problem, but then I've never had ABS brakes. (my brakes squeak when cold or wet at very low speeds).The agency where I bought the Patriot honors the warranty, no questions asked.  And they wash the car when you service it!What I'm saying is, it's a little rough for the driving.  The front seats are very comfortable.  I like a little rough.  It's a Jeep!!Plus, you can fold the front passenger seat all the way down flat.  Great for camping.",4

It is AWESOME for camping, I can put the rear seats down, slide the front seats up, and a twin inflatable mattress fits perfectly inside!  I just leave my mattress and a pump in the back at all times, it's pretty sweet.  Also has a built in flashlight in the roof, which is very handy when I am using the car as a tent, I know I have a flashlight in an arms reach above me.  I have also used the car quite a bit off road.  Taken it to a lot of dirt trails, and the car handles great when I lock the differential and turn the true 4x4 on.  It doesn't slide at all coming up hills, actually has surprisingly good traction and I have crappy highway tires on my jeep.  Very impressive.   I also recently took my jeep to Mammoth Mountain (I'm a Southern Californian), so I was curious to see how it does in snow/ice as I never see those kind of conditions in SoCal.  Ran in to some VERY icey roads in Mammoth, slapped on the locking differential, and never thought twice.  Once again, more than impressed.  Overall I love the car.  I basically got the bare bones version, so it is VERY simple.  Radio is a little dated, I plan to replace that with a more modern stereo system/display.  All in all, I am getting what I want out of the car.  Good gas mileage, fits all my camping stuff, perfect for skiing/snowboarding, fits all my long ocean fishing rods, and I can sleep in the thing.

At almost 100k it was more reliable than my Subaru Outback XT. When sold she was all original. She was starting to loosen up a bit, was still strong. The main reason I sold her was the driver's seat started wearing out. I'm a big guy 235lb. The Mexican upholstery shop wanted $300 to refurbish the seat. Then the check engine light came on and I needed to have the O2 sensors replaced ($225). No biggie but I traded her in for a 2018 Cherokee Trailhawk. OMG, that thing is a huge upgrade. If you are reading this and thinking about getting a used Patriot, go for it. It's one of those Jeep classics that you'll see in 20 years still going. Simple and reliable. 03/2016 After almost 40k miles the engine is still strong. Of course I have the manual transmission. Power is still decent. When pushed this whip can scoot. It pulls to redline but timing the shifts is difficult. The shifter is a mush box, while the engine is strong and the vehicle light, you have to ask yourself if it's worth racing the guy in the RAV4 or Escape? There is so much disconnect in the shifter that you won't be able to take advantage of the free-revving and torquey little motor. It'll pull like crazy in 2nd (keeps up with a 3-series BMW) when you go to grab 3rd it hangs up and won't engage until the R's fall way off. Try rushing it and you'll likely grenade the engine. It's a known fact Jeep puts cold plugs in to get better mileage. This comes at the expense of acceleration, gas mileage and refinement. Install a set of new platinum plugs http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BPITKQG. This will be the best $12 you ever spent. Long story short I changed the plugs and it went from a snarling beast to a pussy cat. It takes about 30mins max for a competent DIYer to accomplish. Much much smoother under acceleration. The engine just works better. Installed GoodYear Assurance TripleTred tires. The unidirectional low profile tire. With the 17"" alloy wheels ala' Ebay. The car just handles better and feels more assured in snow and with the new tires hasn't hydroplaned once..  I am pleased with this little SUV. It's low maintenance both in appearance and operation. The roof racks got ripped off but that was my fault for not strapping the sailboards down properly and driving in 100+ mph winds. The interior has remained rattle free, the seats are losing their firmness and could probably be replaced. The windshield is bulletproof. A metal bolt came flying into it at freeway speeds, I watched it's trajectory from the back of a semi straight into my window. It made a huge CRACK sound alas but for a chip the glass is intact. Installed a new radio and 6x9 speakers and a sub. This little SUV is an installers dream with plenty of room for subs and amps. Installed a trailer hitch and that's it.  The so called experts love to bagg on it. Sedan like ergonomics mean this little SUV is easy to climb into and out of.  Not only that but the cargo area/ deck height is low so even my mom can get stuff loaded. It's a what I call an Obama-ride. With the economy uncertain and reemployment prospects slim am I going to go out and spend 30k+ on Subaru? This jeep fits the bill, $16,895 and I don't cry over door dings and bird dropping.

A week after this started the vehicle started to make that sound and when on the highway, the car's overheating signal came on and the car decelerated from 70 to 30 MPH.  When stepping on the accelerator, the car continued to make that winding sound and decelerated until it came to a stop.  I pulled the car over to the side of the highway, shut if off and waited in the heat for about 45 minutes until the car started and the problem went away.  The car has repeated to do this from July 2014 to July 2015 six more times.  One time, the vehicle did that when driving with my family on I-80 and there was no shoulder.  We were almost hit by a large truck due to our slow speed on those winding roads.  On one occasion, the car did this going down a steep hill and the brakes locked up and we swerved into traffic.  The car has been in the shop in both Bayside and East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania 5 times and they cannot find the issue.  The dealership in Pennsylvania where the car was towed to twice recommended that the car only go to Bayside Jeep from now on.  My last visit to Bayside Jeep was July 29, 2015.  They could not find the issue and released this death trap to me even after the representatives at Jeep Hotline, who let me tell you are awful as well, recommended that I not drive this vehicle due to it being unsafe.  Now, Bayside Jeep wants me to go into the vehicle with one of their employees and drive for hours until the problem occurs.  Not only are they putting my life in danger but they are also doing this to one of their own.  I am so disappointed about the way this has been handled from Jeep's end, Bayside Jeep and Gray's Jeep in Pennsylvania.  As the owner of three Jeep Grand Cherokee's, I am disappointed that I even entered the doors of Jeep of Bayside.  Not to mention that the business manager of the dealership told me that the car was a death trap and told me he would help me by declaring this a lemon.  He has never returned my calls and I am placing these messages publicly in the event that I face an accident or worse in this 2014 Jeep Patriot.  Yes, I have gone to all Agencies including Better Business, Attorney General's Office and now an attorney.  Be aware and do research before you buy a car from this dealership.  I know that people rant and rave on these and many websites but I am being truthful in this review and I warn you to do your research!  I am a NYC School Principal with a doctorate degree and I feel that I did not do the right thing by dealing with Bayside Jeep. I have to add this piece to the review....so I have I case number with Jeep and the case manager, Jeanette, I call about 3-5 times per day.  She almost never returns calls and has done zero.  Her job is to tell me what I need to do and lie to me and tell me that she can never get through to the dealer or service at Bayside Jeep.  Imagine corporate not being able to get through to Jeep.  So today, after calling her four times she returns my call at 6:00pm and asks me whats up.  I say....were you not going to call dealer and find out what next steps need to be taken.  She has the audacity to say to me to be honest I forgot to call....I tell her I can't believe that the  lives of my family members and I are not so important....she back tracks and says well I did call but did not get through....she got caught in a lie.  We left off that she would call me in the morning-first call-after reaching the dealer.  This whole situation is very frustrating and I do not trust this dealer, Jeep nor my car.",1

All the pros write negative reviews about the Patriot. They bash the interior, the acceleration, and lack of gimmicky gagetes. So having read what they did not like and what they saw as better, I ran right out and bought one!!This is a true small Jeep!!Acceleration: great for a 4 cylinder that is also geared for light towing and off road.Interior: I think they are really stretching and looking for something to say negative. I have the sport model so it is the base model. I have no complaints at all except the standard Jeep complaint about the straight up and down rear seat. There is an optional seat that will tilt back some.  I feel that should be standard on all models.As far as the pros comments. Will they should stick to reviewing automobiles that have been transformed into SUV,s. They have quite plush rides and snazzy interiors and lots of dodads to entertain you as you sit in city traffic. They are all wheel drive that will enhance it's ability in the snow and rain. They are not meant for off road or use beyond that of an automobile.",5

We took it to a shop who again replaced the part and they could not get the new code to clear for them either.  They diagnosed it as a fault in the computer and recommended a new one.

The cargo area is good sized, as long as you are only hauling groceries or light cargo, like camping equipment. You can fit 2 lawnmowers in it and still close the hatch. The engine is responsive and economical, as long as you leave the CVT in Auto mode. The ESP program allows you to ignore the 4-Lock option and concentrate on driving in foul weather.",4.5

Drives much better than my previous vehicle with was a Forester. The new interior design on the 09 really makes you feel like your driving a luxury crossover. Once you learn how to drive the CVT is becomes very smooth and a joy to drive.  I did have the dreaded front dome light leak in April, i brought it in, they replaced a seal and after a record breaking amount of rainfall over the summer I have not had any other problems with it.  Once the CVT gets broken in a little, gas mileage improves. I now average about 25.5 on the highway (on long trips) and 22+ city. Pretty good for a 4x4. ",5

The Honda element and CRV have weak 4x4 system and the RAV4 is too narrow inside for my big stature. So it came down to the Outlander and the Jeep. Well it turn out that the Outlander and the Patriot have the same CVT transmission and motor (2.4l)called the ""World Motor"" design by Chrysler/Mitsubishi and Hyundai.

Traded the old Wrangler for the second Patriot because we liked the first Patriot so much we were fighting over who got to drive it. Both have sunroofs, a great sound system, and 17inch Wrangler tires with alloy wheels. The bells and whistles are well worth it. The autoshift works fine for fast acceleration, but it takes a little to get used to. Put it into 6th for flat highway driving and get better gas mileage. We especially like the lower road clearance - better stability and plenty high enough if you don't go off- road, and it's still higher than a car",4.875

It is not trail rated and my first 1000 miles has seen 5% on dirt roads in the hills.  Does the ESP eat up gas mileage? Since it is a Sport D I had to install skid plates, hitch package, roof rack for kayaks/bikes.  Planing next year for lift kit, 17"" wheels and AT tires, front bumper with winch.

This little engine packs 158 horses and Chrysler has slapped a lifetime warranty on the power train. Yes, you heard me right, a life time warranty! The body looks and feels solid and has the traditional Jeep line, although not as sexy looking as the Compass. My only complaint is not having the back hatch window open separately in order to load my lumber from the home improvement stores.

For anyone who dislikes the cvt when braking, simply leave your foot barely on the gas and it won't bog down like that.

2682, on 12/29/17 16:00 PM (PST),peter. ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport SE 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Learned about ignition & transmission the hard way," Overall the patriot does the job nicely. It can crawl across the desert with no real issue.  In fact ice and snow it runs like a dream and goes up hills, down hills and stuff that the large and lifted 4x4's cant do.   So why the poor review?   1: The CVTY Automatic transmission is highly variable and works like a charm, BUT it CANNOT BE FLAT TOWED (Dinghy Towed). This is towing the vehicle behind another vehicle. Why? Because the transmission is lubricated by the engine running and if the engine is not running the transmission fluid isn't covering parts. As a result, flat towing or dolly towing will destroy the transmission. This means that if rock crawling, desert hopping or snow driving the jeep fails for any reason, it has to be flat bed towed to a dealer.  The ignition WCM module is a huge problem and a Google search will reveal page after page of complaints going all the way back to the 2006 model year. The module will fail at any time (usually around 45-50K miles) and is an expensive repair that the DEALER ALONE can do. Why? because the module has to be programmed to the VIN number of the vehicle and the keys have to be programmed to the module. Otherwise the thing wont start.  There are other issues with the Uconnect system and the 2017 revelation of the Apple iphone issue also translated to poor or constant disconnect from the radio. This is an apple problem, but because the Uconnect is also very slow on connecting, a turnoff of the vehicle switches the radio back to a radio station and the Bluetooth system disconnects.  Overall Jeep put out a relatively decent product with the patriot and would give better reviews if it slved the WCM problem and gave the CVT system a neutral-flat tow capeablitlty.",2

Unfortunately this car has been nothing but trouble. Transmission started overheating at 20,000 miles, electric system goes in and out, sometimes my windshield wipers work, sometimes they don't.

Take it to the dealer to get fixed you say! I have multiple times now, and end up leaving with nothing fixed and them telling me there is nothing wrong with it. Look online though and you can see multiple reviews of people having the same issues. These are the problems I have had so far, then this morning my TMPS started beeping at me and wont go off. However, none of my tires are low or flat. They weren't when it started going off.  To top it all of, my seat belt does not consistently lock. it pops out at random, leaving me unprotected in my death trap that was disguised as a new car.",1
2684, on 10/16/17 19:41 PM (PDT),Rob ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV 75th Anniversary 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),"Good concept, poor followthrough"," If engineering is to automotive as pitching is to baseball, Chrysler has no bullpen... still. I've owned more than 30 automobiles in my life and only 2 other Chrysler's before this, now I remember why. As a lifelong mechanic I have a very strong love of good engineering. It makes working on things much easier, less frequent, and should make the usefulness/usability much more enjoyable. It is in this area that my Jeep falls way short. First I'll start with what I actually appreciate about my little Patriot. The leather seats are visually appealing and hold up quite well to standard use. Steering is tight, feels good with less body roll than I anticipated. Braking is smooth, provided by all wheel disks, and doesn't have any quirks to it, something I love since I live in an area that frequently gets snow. I appreciate the storage spaces seemingly stuffed into nearly every place they can put one (more on one of these particularly later), especially the large cubby above the glove box. Steering wheel audio controls are well located and easy to utilize. The 6sp automatic transmission shift well, not great, but well; perhaps a reprogram of the TCM would keep it from shifting too soon and bogging, this is better than many of these types of transmissions but since it is sourced from Hyundai I suppose it makes sense. The manual shift mode and location of that is far superior in my mind than the thumb button my wife's Focus had, and for this type of vehicle, better in my mind than even paddle shifters. Cargo room is plenty for the size and easily accessible and the back seat is plenty for my kids. Sadly, this is where the good ends and the limp arm of the pentagon's pitching team starts throwing wild balls. First, the little 4 squirrel engine is under-powered, noisy at anything above an idle, and considering the lackadaisical acceleration, falls short even in the economy range. I would have happily exchanged some MPG for enough power to get out of its own way without having to rap 5K on the tach. My 2008 V6 Mustang has much more acceleration, far better performance, far less engine noise, weighs more and nearly matches the Jeep at the pump. Considering the Jeep has almost 10 years of ""innovation"" on the mustang, and even more when you consider how old the for 4.0l V6 design is, I guess I expected more. I know what you're all saying, comparing a mustang to a Jeep is unfair, but it's what I've got. The automatic transmission seems to shift a little early for my taste, causing some bogging and slippage, but not a major deal breaker. And this is where the mediocrity ends and the downright poor comes in, the day to day usefulness. Driving the Jeep is downright one of the most uncomfortable and unusable space I've ever had the displeasure of occupying. The side bolstered seats are too narrow and dig into my outer thighs and glutes. I know I need a diet, but c'mon here, it hurts. As mentioned before, the little storage spots are great, except the phone/cigarette pack one below the park brake handle, making it not only useless but a lesson in ignorance of design.  The cup holders... ugh the cup holders. The front cup holders are both impeded by something. You can't pull a cup of coffee out of the front without hitting the shifter that is located directly above it, and the rear is covered by the center arm rest. Every car I've driven and used the sun visors pull to detach from the hook, these you push which is oddly clumsy feeling. The visors don't cover enough of anything to be useful, when moved to the side don't extend nearly far enough out, and are clumsy putting back. The A-pillar is seeming enormous and the B-pillar is right next to my head if I don't want my knees in my chest making this one of the most view obstructed vehicles I've been in. Lack of some very basic features like a telescopic steering wheel even when equipped with tilt, blind spot door mirrors, a fuel calculator on even a mid-level equipped package make this seem overly stripped down. There are enough of these little things adding up to the point that there is no indication that the cruise control has been set just get's me irritated. My Jeep has the jack-off drivers seat height adjustment and I'm just going to say it ""TO THE ENGINEERING WORLD, THIS IS TRASH, QUIT PRODUCING THEM."" But, if they will continue, at least leave enough room for a mans arm to access it since I have to open my door to adjust mine.",1

I understand that one may sacrifice performance for better mileage or vice-versa, but this car delivers neither.   It was constantly hunting for the right gear ... just awful.   As others have already said, the mileage is crap, especially when considering what a wheezebox the thing is.   Toss in the small tank and I was shocked at how quickly the fuel gauge dropped.  Seats were not very comfortable, either.     Thankfully, we only had it for a day, as it was a replacement for another rental, which died near the end of our vacation.   That first car (Chevy Malibu)  was consistently giving us 34 MPG in mixed driving.   The Patriot didn't come close, even though it was 100% highway driving.  Had this been our vehicle for the whole trip, it would've been miserable.   I cannot believe rental companies consider this at the same level as the ""full size"" cars.  I know never to make the mistake of renting a ""compact SUV"", as I might get stuck with one of these again.   Who knows?  Maybe other compact SUVs are just as bad.

I'm 6 ft tall and have plenty of headroom, even with the sunroof.  The one touch sunroof is great.  Most, if not all the complaints I've read about this vehicle are really unfounded .  There are so many different versions that you can get one that suits you.  What other vehicle has a choice of hand crank or power windows, manual, CVT, or 6 speed transmission, 2 different versions of 4WD or 2WD?  The 2.4 has plenty of get up and go, and gets good gas mileage.  Rides so smooth and has plenty of zip for the freeway.  Leather wrapped steering wheel feels good.  Leather and mesh seats are comfortable and look great.  Basic stereo sounds great.  I really like the layout of the dash and all the controls.  So many vehicles have buttons placed almost randomly, not the Patriot.  It has a very intuitive layout.  And how bout the name Patriot?  I think it's patriotic to buy a vehicle that is made in America, with such a rich American heritage.  I have the 6 speed auto with fd1 4x4.  Shifts great.  Nothing wrong with the CVT either, I've driven one extensively.   The only other features I would have like to have are the EVIC and a telescoping wheel. The EVIC doesn't come on the 75th Anniversary Edition, and telescoping steering wheel is not available at all.  So it may take a little more time to dial in your position.  Comfortable ride.  I also have an 01 Grand Cherokee.  It has more power and off-road ability but pretty poor mileage. Independent suspension on the Patriot does great at sucking up the bumps.  Basically the whole vehicle is like taking the old Cherokee and refining it for the driving that most people do.  If you want a true off-road machine get a Wrangler, they're awesome!  If you drive mostly on the road but want very good bad weather and mild to moderate off-road abilities with decent mileage, the Patriot may be for you.  I'm glad I got one before they stopped making them.  Wish they kept making them but I guess 11 years is a pretty good run.  I bought the Maxcare Lifetime Warranty.  I plan on driving this for many years to come.  It's just a great all-around Jeep!",5

I readily admit that my credit is a bit challenged and so I was basically forced into this car.  It is cute and comfortable and I'm a single mom who needed more reliable transportation for my family. Also, while attending work meetings, I needed a vehicle that would not be embarrassing to be seen getting into afterwards! So, into the Patriot I went.  Cute and comfortable is about all the good I have to say about this rattletrap.  There is absolutely no power, the engine is better suited to a Geo Metro or something.  It cannot pull the weight of the Patriot at all.  This also contributes to the utter lack of acceleration and low gas mileage.  The Bluetooth barely works - I have ended up literally screaming at my dash, trying to get it to understand the number I am asking it to dial.  Note - that doesn't work either...  First world problems, I know, but if it exists within the vehicle I am paying for, it would be nice if it worked.  The tires slip in the rain - I'm in Washington, so you can imagine how fun that is - and the snow is impossible.  I can drive in it, but the vehicle cannot.  My brakes began squealing about a month after I purchased the car.  And now, after owning the vehicle for about 14 months, my alternator just went out.  I drive quite a bit between my work commute and weekend adventures and I am so incredibly disappointed in this purchase.  In short, run, don't walk from this awful vehicle.

We just love our 2017 Patriot Sport w/5 speed manual. Love the shifter position and the short throw. Easy to drive through  the mountain twisties. Were in 8 inches of snow right now and the 4x4 work like a charm.  Seats could be softer,yet they do give great support . could use better/bigger speedo. Don't like the rear view mirror. Everything else is great. Can't beat it for the price in the 4x4 class. UPDATE... At 10,000 miles everything is holding up perfectly. No complaints, fit and finish is perfect.   Had left rear tire go flat. It went really fast, any faster and it would of been a blowout (big construction fastener pierced sidewall). Low tire pressure light came on, no handling indication. Went around a hard rt turn and felt stability system activate. Traffic heavy and took a little to pull over. Changing tire was a breeze. Jack fit well and was very secure, it turned extremely easily and that was appreciated. NOTE: you need to use the plastic hub cover under the tire bolts or they can't tighten down.  One complaint......Goodyears seem to be wearing down to fast. OEM tires usually are inferior.",5

But the consumer reviews were all good. I had a liberty before this put 203000 miles on it and still loved it. She still looked good ran well but was starting to have tranny problems. So I took a patriot for a test drive and fell in love. The dealer was great and wanted to really sell it to me. But I wanted to test drive some of the competition. The competition were all beautiful SUVs if you want to call them that they drove like cars. A Jeep is made for a special person once that ride gets in your system there is nothing else that can satisfy. They are great vehicles and probably will be the only vehicles I own.  This is an update I have now owned the car for 1 yr and puy 26,000 miles on it. I drive a lot. The jeep has been great. Plenty of room for all my stuff. Great in rain super in snow. I feel it has plenty of power. Just really happy with it.",5

It handles great, feels comfortable. I can't say enough about it. The fuel economy says its 24-26, but I'm getting 27-29 in the High Rocky Mountains of CO, and live at 9000 ft elevation. The steering is a little tight at first until you get used to it's touchiness. After 3 weeks, I have adjusted or it's gotten better. The only problem I have with it so far is the sunroof leaks when I'm in the high pressure car wash. Water splashes me in the head and face. I took it in for service and they are fixing this soon. I also opted for the lifetime warranty, because I intend to keep this Jeep for life. It's my 3rd Jeep, and I couldn't be happier. I thought I'd be sacrificing power and durability for better gas mileage over the Jeep Rubicon, but I was completely wrong. I have not sacrificed anything but the removable top and I have benefitted way beyond my expectations. The ride is smooth and quiet. They had me at heated seats and sunroof.",5
2704, on 11/07/16 11:02 AM (PST),RS ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV High Altitude Edition 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Can't understand the negative reviews!!," As a rental car, I had a Jeep Patriot Sport with power windows and AC  while my other car was in the shop and I fell in LOVE with it.  Warm and comfortable with a solid feel and GREAT visibility.  When I got my car back I drove to a jeep dealership and looked into owning one.  I ended up with a 2016 Jeep Patriot High Altitude with leather seats, AC, 4WD, 2.4L 6 speed automatic,  Navigation, Uconnect system, Sirius satellite radio, back-up camera, seat heaters and cargo cover in a beautiful deep cherry red with dark gray interior.  Mine actually has 2 USB ports.  One is in the glove box as another reviewer pointed out, but the other is right on the front of the radio itself.  It also has an outlet in the center console that is easily accessible.  It is a beautiful car with a much higher end feel than you would think for an SUV.  The sound system in mine is great also.  I have been paying attention to gas mileage and it is actually doing better than my 1.4L w/Turbo that I traded in.  Maybe it has a larger tank, but my fuel costs have not increased with this car.  It has everything I need/want and skips the overwhelming extras.  I am not the person who needs to download the latest Android apps onto my car.  This car does speak to a certain personality type I think.  It is stylish and well equipped and no-nonsense.  It doesn't have the Turbo feature or blind spot detection, but you don't feel like you need it because the visibility is excellent all around.  I personally love the look of it - reminiscent of the older Jeeps.  I hear that the Compass is essentially the same car with a different exterior - I preferred the Patriot myself.  I also heard this will be that last year of production (2017) for the Patriot.  Will be sad to see it go.  I look forward to getting behind the wheel everyday, which is so important when most of us live our lives depending on our cars.Update:  One year later, still loving my Jeep Patriot.  Great little car.  May have saved our lives this summer when someone with an unsecured load dropped a propane tank on the freeway.  There was pretty significant damage to the under carriage after going over it at about 70 mph, but  we did not roll over and there was NO damage to the body/paint.  Everyone inside was safe and sound.  I had to leave it in Montana for about 3 months to fix, but they did a great job.  Drove several other cars during that time and I was happy to get my Patriot back.",5
2705, on 11/05/16 07:04 AM (PDT),Charles A. ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport SE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),I don't get the Jeep thing," I got this 2016 Jeep patriot as an unwanted upgrade at enterprise. I wanted something that got good gas mileage and they had no cars. I was told this this would but it consistently got only 21 MPG. Soooo where to start, the engine sounds like an angry sewing machine, and it doesn't do much to the motivate the CVT that has trouble changing gear. It idled rough... It had 5341 miles it should run great I would think. It rides like a truck, rough and bouncy, and there is tons of oversteer. The front seats lack lumbar support, they are manual with minimal adjustability. The radio made a terrible high pitched noise when I plugged in my phone into aux and it was plugged into the outlet. The door sills are high and I smack my feet on it getting in and out. There is no visibility out of the back windows unless you lay the rear seat down, the roof line gives poor visibility out of the rest. I've driven jeeps I like and lots of other SUVs that were great, but this has to be the worst. There was nothing that stood out as good beyond the braking performance.",2
2706, on 11/01/16 21:46 PM (PDT),justin ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),"I've only put 200 miles on it, but I love it so fa"," I bought mine (Altitude) with 3,500 miles on it for $18.9k.  I'm very pleased thus far.  It's a pretty basic suv.  It reminds me of the old Cherokee Sport versions pre- 2002 - right before they started making the Liberty.  Auto dimming mirrors (actually performs very well, maybe the best dimming mirror I have ever driven with); Cruise Control; AC; Fog Lights; Auto Headlights; remote start; bluetooth (can sync my music pretty decent sound); touch free phone (works really well, and I usually never use touch free phone system because I usually hate it, but this works very well, no yelling needed); steering-wheel buttons; voice command; sirius; power windows/mirrors; heated seats; heated mirrors.  Also, I'm not sure what this feature is called, but I'm pretty sure its a variable transmission - meaning that I can drive it in automatic, or I can flick the shifter and it then turns to a manual 6speed transmission.  I think thats very cool and enjoy it.  Scared me the first time as I had no idea I had transferred it to manual and couldn't make it up a hill.  I thought I bought a lemon before I realized I had engaged the manual transmission, lol.  I mention this also because i have read several reviews where people say that sometimes their Patriot won't go over 40mph because of ""overheating.""  They probably engaged the manual transmission without realizing it and don't realize they're driving their car in 1st gear.  It's only a 4 cylinder engine, but it gets up to 80mph in a hurry.  It's fine.  I've read some reviews that criticize the weak pickup of the engine, I'm not sure these people understand its a 4 cylinder carrying an SUV body, it's not an V8  engine, lol.  Nonetheless, the engine is fine (though I haven't had it packed full of stuff, nor have i towed anything with it).  The ride is smooth, quiet, and comfortable.  I'm 6'3'' 200lbs.  Plenty of leg room.  Also, It is the only car, other Jeeps included, that my head or hair does not touch the roof.  I do not have to slouch.  That's awesome if you're a tall person.  Gas milage is fine.  I drove 160 miles (all highway) on a half a tank, so that's over 300 miles on a full tank.  I believe it holds 13 gallons and costs somewhere around $30 to fill.  The windshield is gigantic.  You have a lot of windshield vision as well as passenger front and back window vision.  Driver side rear window vision is spotty.  Just be careful switching lanes. I love this Jeep.  It's basic, yet it also has enough features to make it a very enjoyable experience.",5
2707, on 10/21/16 15:38 PM (PDT),Tony Jimenez ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV High Altitude Edition 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Love JEEP! I have owned 3 JEEP SUV s in 12 years.," Despite of what some people say negatively about JEEPS...  in my opinion (JEEP) It is one of the best built vehicles that is made America today.   I have owned Ford, Chevy, Mazda and Pontiac, (all American made vehicles) ALL BAD EXPERIENCES.  (JEEP) in the other hand, without a doubt has being the best  SUV s  vehicles I have ever owned 'till today.    My first brand new JEEP i bought, is a ""2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo"" still own it, still running strong and like a charm.  With very little mechanical issues, ""if any?""  My second brand new SUV I bought, is a ""2006 Jeep Commander"" still own it, and has no relative major issues to complain about.  Both Jeeps I have bought in 10-16 years, have out performed any other American made vehicles that I owned in the past. Every non Jeep vehicle I have ever owned,  gave me lots of trouble after reaching the 50,000k mile range. The two Jeeps I own, both have over 170K miles on them, and they are still running very strong.  My newest addition to my JEEP collection is the 2016 Jeep Patriot High Altitude Edition SUV. I have just acquired it from Gray Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram of the Poconos in Stroudsburg, PA. And so far; I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS VEHICLE.  It has all the bells and whistles I ever wanted, and more.     ((And Sure! When Compared  to my '04 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo, or my '06 Jeep Commander, it is in another lesser power category. It is not in the same league ""I do admit"".  But. It is by far the best vehicle, when compared to any other brand new vehicle of its class and price range.   I personally will continue to stand behind JEEP; as long the vehicles I come to own from Jeep ""continue to perform as my good as my first two have done so far.   My honest advice to anyone considering in purchasing a new vehicle...  Try Jeep first before considering any other vehicles.  Jeep is a good brand, they continue to make, and have made some of America's toughest and most reliable vehicles for decades.",5

It's all relative," I was looking for a no nonsense, good economy, versatile vehicle with a lower repair cost down the road and less ""systems"" to break.  I got just what I was shopping for.  For the money, this vehicle is a great bargain!  I traded in my 2006 Cadillac and I could not be more pleased.  I prepared myself for a huge sacrifice in comfort and I just have not experienced it.  It is lighter of course, but I am getting almost 15 miles to the gallon more with the jeep.  Surprisingly enough, the jeep is as quite at high speeds as the caddy was, that shocked me.   Another thing I really like about the patriot is the large front windshield.  It is forward and extremely large for the size of the vehicle.  Great visibility all around.  I read reviews and heard that there was a problem in the past with some kind of water leak.  I have not experienced that with my vehicle.   I am happy with my purchase and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to my friends and family.",5
2709, on 10/09/16 08:21 AM (PDT),J A Frith ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport SE 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Sweet little Jeep," I own a 2002 Grand Cherokee with 200K miles. We thought it time to upgrade due to to the high miles. The Patriot caught my eye. After a strenuous mountain test drive I found it drove and handled great. I love the paddle-shift 6-speed for coming down mountains. Handling, traction and control are great. We live deep in the Appalachians and going anywhere is ""over the mountain"".  So far, we haven't driven on snow but I expect it will do very well with the front-wheel, four-wheel combination. My old Crown Vic got better highway mileage, but for a mid-size SUV it isn't bad. The 13-gal tank could be bigger for longer road trips.  This car has no power seats but we are now used to it. Visibility is excellent. The 2.4 L engine has plenty of power and good acceleration. And the down-shifting when you let off the gas is excellent saving the brakes.  For that matter, people ride their brakes excessively, anyway, and are annoying to follow up and down the hills and around tight curves. Though I have reservations about its durability it is, so far, an excellent 4X4 SUV. With winter just around the corner I will update you all on its snow and ice performance. As an auto and aircraft mechanic I find the Patriot well-engineered and solid. The reviews compare it to Japanese and European cars which are built for soft city folk who are tech-obsessed.  If you want a practical, American 4X4, test drive the Patriot where there are steep terrain and sharp curves.",4
2710, on 09/29/16 12:58 PM (PDT),KRogers ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Just not good- CHEAP," I had this car as a rental and pulled over just to write this review. The whole car feels cheap. The center console is dated and the cup holder is far too low. No USB charging in a car made in 2016 tells me Jeep just doesn't care about keeping up with the times. However, by far the worst feature is the engine. The car is brutally slow and doesn't get anywhere near the claimed highway gas mileage. PASS ON THIS CAR.",1

It's amazingly unremarkable in every aspect, but yet it's remarkable in how many aspects are good enough, especially for the price. It's exactly the right size, has decent gas mileage for it's cargo and off-road capacity, and it's comfortable and easy to get in and out of. There's about as much room for those riding in back as there is up front. It's not particularly fun to drive (like the first-generation Liberty was), but it doesn't feel too slow either. My Jeep came with A/C but no nav screen, no sunroof (not recommended due to leaks), no power windows/locks, or remote start. This is deliberate as in every car I or anyone else has ever owned the gizmos are the first thing to break and the last thing to get fixed. Overall I think the layout of the controls and gauges is excellent although I would have liked to see a little bit larger numbers on the speedometer. I love the chunky steering wheel and it's as good or better than any in any other car I've ever driven. The only knob or button that felt cheap to me was the window crank, but even that's not bad. Overall build quality is decent; the hood and fenders are solid but the doors feel a little cheap. Everything inside the car seems fine as can be expected in this price range. I would have liked for it to have had the tow hitch receiver and tow hooks, I would have liked it to have been dark blue (dealers in this area are clearly colorblind as they only order black or grey). The only real bummer about this vehicle is that for a Jeep it has very little aftermarket even though I think it has some good potential.",4

I have received several compliments from others about the appearance of my new SUV and have been very impressed with its performance thus far.  I was able to get a fair price from a dealer that is willing to go the ""extra mile"" for customer satisfaction.   I am a satisfied customer!  I have been driving it daily since I bought it in mid-July and have not encountered any of the problems I read about on the web.  I also like the extra space in the vehicle by its intentional design.  I am very appreciative there is a manufacturer still willing to make an affordable 5 speed manual transmission for an SUV.

I have owned a lot of new cars,  I buy them for myself , my wife and my son.  If you read the reviews you would think it is a terrible vehicle.  But I test drive cars myself and I don't listen to what car snobs have to say.  If you option it properly it is an unbelievable value.    First,  I bought a Sport with Freedom Dive 1 and the 2.4L motor with the 6 speed auto.  This trim is not included in the drop down list for some reason.  So my final cost was under 17K with discounts and rebates  ( before  taxes and license)- for a 4WD SUV.  The interior is pretty basic but the seats are comfortable and the appearance is nice overall, I love the dash and the gauges.  The visibility is great and I feel comfortable maneuvering in traffic.  It has Blue tooth,  AC , and a year of free satellite radio.  Cargo capacity is really good.  Steering  in well connected and ride is pleasant.  The motor is quiet but does transmit some vibration at idle,  I don't really mind it as it is a minor issue.  My last three cars were a BMW128 convertible, a Chevrolet Volt, and  Jetta TDI.  I have to say I like this one as much as the others.  Apparently I am not alone as they sell a lot of them.  As a last note my wife, who leases a new Range Rover Evoque.

Don't rely solely on professional reviews, drive one yourself. What you get: 4WD, air conditioning, satellite radio,roof rack,  auto dimming rear view mirror and Bluetooth for $17,000. For that price it comes with steel wheels, manual locks, windows, side view mirrors and a manual 5-spd transmission.  I chose Jeep because it let me pay for features I value instead of having to pay for automatic conveniences that  I don't need. The seats are comfortable, the heat and A/C work great, the transmission shifts just fine for a non-performance application and highway mileage tops 30 mpg.  The sound system is more than adequate (for a middle aged man). Seriously , how much volume does one need for Fox Business?   Jeep lowered its powertrain warranty to 3 years/36,000 miles. Resale value is soft for the manual trans models. Crash test scores aren't impressive.  I like driving the 5-spd manual and appreciate the hill assist feature. A decent vehicle for the money.",4

I love the manual transmission, brings back memories from my younger years.  My wife loves the ride and seating so much that we often leave the 300 at home when we go out together.  The machine is fun to drive, surprisingly quiet for a jeep, and reasonable on gas.  My reason for a four star rating is not because of any disappointment or fault found in the vehicle... other than the lack of telescoping steering... I was rating it according to looks, style, and appearance of similarly priced SUV's on the market today.  For me, I love the older look, the manual crank windows and manual locks, and all the other stuff that I wanted to have when I was a youngling but couldn't afford to buy a jeep then.

The base model has some of the worst seats I've ever experienced in any vehicle.  If your waist is anything over 28"" you'll be squirming to get out in two hours.  There are two metal bars on the outer-side of the seat cushion that can be felt under about 1/2"" of foam... very uncomfortable.  The wind noise is incredible; turn the radio off and that's all you'll hear.  And the smallish tank means you'll be hitting the gas station in around 300 miles... our low-fuel light went on at 271 miles from a full tank, averaging 70 MPH on the highway.

It's great within the city and for bad weather and snow (it's a snow king). However, it lacks refinement and at higher speeds it's noisy and bouncy (especially when it's windy). I lacked any parking assist and even though it had bluetooth, the screen was old school and not touch. Also, this car depreciates a lot, so make sure you're willing to keep for some time it if you're gonna buy it.",2

2723, on 06/15/16 08:56 AM (PDT),Bill C. ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport SE 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Value for your $$," I bought the Jeep Patriot sport se 4x4 model. I traded in my 2011 Grand Cherokee that had 140,000 miles on it. The fact that I can drive a 4x4 suv worry free from repair costs, is quite comforting. As I was still making payments on Grand Cherokee and repairs would come out of my pocket.  Now as for the patriot, it ain't no Cherokee, but its not intended to be! Overall I'm impressed with this package on the patriot, the extra attention to details, heated seats, trim accents, etc. Ride quality is good, tolerable road noise, front seats excellent, easy to park, perfect vehicle to zip around town in. A few nit picks I do have is, the lower entrance height, and the lower height of roof area when back hatch is lifted up. I tend to smack my head on these as I'm 6ft tall. Just need to get used to it and be careful. The only real problem I have so far is the absurd location of the usb port. It's not on the radio, not even in center console area, its in the GLOVEBOX! Really?!Its almost impossible to find, even in there. The dealer couldn't even locate it. It is above the opening of the glovebox, up into the dash area. You need to blindly reach up and feel around for it. I have no clue how this is a useful spot to mount this. To use it, you need to drive around with glovebox open and place phone either in glovebox or above on small shelf built into dash. Horrible design on this! This will be my 3rd Jeep and I hope to get years and years of use from it.",4

But the Patriot blows it away in comfort, space, and quality of interior. The top of doors are padded, the dosh controls are easiest to navigate of ANY vehicle I ever had. The dash board is flat and hold a cell phone holder easily without blocking vision. There is an actual SHELF in it as well ...for a GPS, tablet, kleenex, sunglasses, etc.This is my first Jeep also. There is alot of head and leg-room, even for my 6"" husband. I have the High Altitude Pkg...I love the leather seats and interior . I have a Mastiff and the hair doesn't stick at all. He has PLENTY of room in the back seat.  There are 3 ports for charging things, there is an actual PLUG..like in your house, for shaver, coffee warmer, night-light or whatever! It is NOT the fastest thing ..nothing like my Camaro. But it isn't that kind of car. Its for kids, dogs, baggage, toys and activities. Who wants a race car for that? It handles the road , water, ice and snow GREAT...it has front drive. The 430 Sirius radio is excellent too.The gear shifter itself could be smoother...but who cares? It has a VERY smooth ride....turns, stears and breaks fabulously. It has more storage space and little cubbies for stuff all over the place.  NO OTHER suv I tried had any. That is very important when your a woman...lots of things you need at hand.As far as the engine reviews, I dont know much about that. The gas mileage is good. The comfort of the seats cant be beat. The driver seat raises...I sit about 4-5"" higher than the passenger seat...so I have great vision as well. Just thought I would mention these things...The patriot seems to get an undeseved bas wrap!  If you want a COMFORTABL versital vehicle ...and you spend alot of time driving...you will love the Patriot!Update..I have had my Patriot for a year now. I love it even more! Not one complaint.",5

The steering wheel seemed like it wasn't on or working. The car then completely dies.  The car had no indication lights of a possible issue. The car was not over heated. I ended up blocking two lanes because I was in mid turn of getting into the far left lane.  I was shaken by this and had to call the police for help. The key would not allow me to turn it in the off position. I was literally stuck.  After waiting five minutes I tried to turn the car on and it came on luckily! I am a new driver, this is my first car and I have never been so scared in my life hat someone was going to hit me from the side or behind.  I took the car into the dealership to get looked at. I am without a car while they look at it. I since saw many reviews saying their heels in various models and years have done this too.  I hope the issue is fixed by the end of the weekend but it was scary.  Overall I love my car but wow that was horrible.",3

I upgraded a little, going with the automatic 6-speed transmission, but other than that and the fact that the 2016 clearly has more ground clearance than did the 2010 (which I thought had poor ground clearance) It feels about the same driving and comfort wise. The bottom line with me though is that is that I was able to get BOTH the 2010, and the 2016 for under 20k dollars. And these days, a 4WD vehicle at that price is pretty rare. If the new one is anything like the old one - which only had one minor warranty-covered repair in six years of ownership - I may wind up writing another review someday when I buy what will then be my third Patriot",5

2730, on 02/14/16 18:01 PM (PST),Nick ,2016 Jeep Patriot SUV Sport SE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Great Buy!!!," The Jeep Patriot is a great purchase - a great combination of all factors we needed to take into account. Mileage is okay; room is quite spacious. The big key for us was to have a second vehicle that handles the snow pretty well. We had a Jeep Wrangler for years. We live in the hills in Kentucky and when it snows heavily the roads are not well kept so we need something that can handle deep snow, slippery conditions, and can handle peaks/valleys/curves in heavy snow. The Patriot FDII WIth Low Gear is just like owning a manual transmission in the snow in the hills. The low gear reduces speed (you can shift from D to L as you go down a hill) and never go higher than 3-4 mph without touching the brakes. And when going up hills in the snow, it doesnt even slip. And now we have a vehicle that can pull our trailer, get decent gas mileage and have a vehicle that is easy to drive in all conditions. It's been a great purchase! The expert reviews are not high on the Patriot (doesnt have a lot of fancy bells/whistles - technology) but the owner reviews are usually pretty positive. Very reliable/dependable and good purchase for its price.",4

At first didn't think I would like it but the 2.4L engine is really a great performer.  The car has  a solid ride and we like the window configuration that gives you an all around view. The interesting thing is that people who own the car give it a great review, but the professionals who review it give it a thumb down.  The traction control really gives it a hugging the road drive,  this is a great car for the money, I bought it because I didn't want car payments and bought it in cash.

Our Jeep Cherokee is a freaking mountain goat so we decided to look at the Jeep product line again.  We chose the Patriot.

They have color rating from red to green and the Patriot had expected above average reliability . Every part of the Patriot except one area had an above average green rating. One part of the car got an average rating . So why all the internet bashing ? I see top 10 worst cars to buy lists and lemon lists , The Patriot is on all the lists I see. Why is it a lemon ??????Go to the book store or supermarket and read the Consumer reports review. Crazy !Critics  say it's underpowered : The Patriot can go from 0-60 in 9.5 seconds and it's in the class average. It can tow up to 2000 pounds with an engine oil cooler . I tow a 1000 pounds and a fully loaded car with a 260 pound driver up a giant mountain road in upstate NY ( The famous Wurtsboro hill that's several miles up hill ) and the Patriot does fine towing the weight at 55 mph uphill. How can it be underpowered ? I got my 2016 Jeep Patriot Sport with 2.4 liter, 4wd , 5 spd. manual and with the all weather capability group/ AC and paid $18,400 with free oil changes and state inspections for life. Got a 5 year 0.9 percent loan at a credit union. I have 13,000 miles on the car and everything is fine. Not one problem so far. The interior is very nice. Critics call it cheap looking. My father paid $35,000 for a Kia Sedona and it's not much better than my interior. The cd/radio comes with a free 1 year subscription to Sirius radio and it's very good quality. Nice and loud and easy to use. Speakers are very good. I wouldn't buy the Back up camera Jeep sells for almost a $1000. You can buy a real nice aftermarket GPS /radio that fits perfectly like a factory radio and have Best Buy install it for $125. They install the back up camera also. If the aftermarket radio goes dead, it's a lot cheaper to replace and all the wiring will plug ( plug and play )into the next radio very easily. I have a cheap on top of the dash rear view camera that cost $40 on ebay and I had Best Buy install it. It works nice but I have to flip it open to use and I might buy another in dash GPS radio and just plug it into the wires I have now. The GPS radio has a backup camera. Cost like $250 on Ebay.Comes with Larado tires .Get the all weather capability group when you buy it because it comes with tow hooks,mats, an engine block heater and daytime running lights. Insurance companies will give you a $40 discount for the daytime lights . It's $700 extra for the all weather group. Pays for itself. The tow hooks look really Jeep. See the Sam Haymart Jeep Patriot review on You Tube. I think it's The Test Driven TV review website            . He reviewed it and said the Patriot was a very nice car. He said it averaged 20 MPG in the review, but the car he tested only had 1000 miles and wasn't broken in. A year earlier he reviewed a Red Patriot and said that Patriot averaged 24.5 MPG. Most people get around 24 MPG combined. That's class average.The 4 wheel drive system is nice. It normally works only front wheel drive most of the time and will automatically switch to 4 wheel drive when car sensors sense changing road conditions/traction problems . It's the Freedom 1 4wd system . You can switch to 4 wheel drive with the 4wd button on the center console whenever you like. Just so you know , I read it's not a good idea to use 4 wd on hard pavement when its not required. Puts a lot of strain on the system and wears out quickly. Just use it for getting out of snow or mud etc.The AC is very cool in the summer and the defroster is fantastic. The seats are very comfortable and roomy. I'm 6-6 and weigh 260, seats are very comfortable for me and the Patriot has huge headroom, there's 3 inch's above my head. I can  sit in the back with the front seat  fully extended back. I'll fit if I put my knees on each side of the seat. 6 foot people will fit fine. Plenty of room for kids and women. Complaints so far , the numbers on the speedometer are hard to read at night if you have poor eyesight. I wish they were bigger and easier to read. Chrysler changed the powertrain warranty from 5 years/100,000 to 5 years/60,000 after the 2015 model. I ordered a 2015 model and they couldn't find one. They gave me a 2016 model and learned about the warranty change after I took delivery. Very sneaky of the dealer. I wish Jeep put in weathertech plastic mats throughout the car. How much would it cost for a mat that covered the whole floor ? Jeep could make their own mats for 2 bucks. Don't believe the negative stuff you read about on the internet. This Jeep is very nice. I love the Jeep Patriot look. It looks so Jeep. The Liberty looks ridiculous in front, the Wrangler is very odd looking with those big side fenders and such an uncomfortable ride . The Jeep Patriot looks Jeepy, has enough off road capability for most people and is much more comfortable  than a Wrangler and cost $10,000 less.",5

It's a Latitude 6 speed manual 1.4 liter turbo. It replaces a Subaru Outback 2.5 liter 5 speed. Thus far I am totally enjoying this SUV. I just past the 5,000 mile mark with no issues with the vehicle whatsoever. I am most impressed with it's performance. It has lots of acceleration when in the correct gear. There is an extremely minor turbo delay, almost unnoticeable. I don't care about fuel economy. Having said that my average is 28 mpg. I am using premium fuel, as recommended by the owners manual. It is a very solid, tight feeling vehicle, with extremely comfortable seats in the front. The handling is crisp and very nimble. The turning radius is narrow. The shifting is smooth. The brakes are quick and perfect. The cabin is quiet with an excellent heater and a/c system. The visibility is very good. I didn't expect electric operated mirrors, which I really like. The high front hood gives one the impression of driving a pickup and not a compact SUV.  I chose the Latitude for the back up camera and the roof racks. The aluminum wheels are also a plus. It was almost impossible to find a 6 speed manual 4x4 Renegade. I had to travel 450 miles to buy it. The price was very cheap for such a well equipped 4x4.

The Jeep Renegade is by far, no question, hands down, the absolute worst vehicle. From mpg to comfort to transmission to clicky oil sounds when all gauges and dip stick say it’s full. It’s under powered which explains part of the mpg fiasco (I got better mileage in an F250). But the worst, pull your hair out it’s so frustrating, is the Radio/Nav. The console does this weird press the up arrow to go down in the menu - thought that was quirky during the test drive - but the Radio/Nav....If its not getting you lost, it’s playing music from some random station you didn’t pick. And it has this Love/hate relationship with my smart phone: it loves to place random calls when you plug in and hates when you would rather listen to radio while plugged in. Just stay away from this poorly designed, from top to bottom, inside and out, 2017 Trail Rated Jeep Renegade. This is the worst (add expletives) automobile in the universe",1

PROS, I like the skid plates for starters and on my recent road trip from the Colorado Rockies to Ocean Shores Washington I ran over a truckers short  wood 4x4 for there truck beds on the freeway at 70 mph. And I could not do anything except hit it and the plates stopped any damage to my jeep, but a few miles down the road I seen at least 3 cars disabled from this large debris. Now I wanted the plates for off road but they had a bonus for everyday driving.  The controls and well placed and it is easy to use. On my trip I drove over 12 hours each day and I was very comfortable. CONS, my large copilot dog that did knock my automatic transmission into manual  mode many times before she understood that was not good, so it is a bit tight in the front seats if you have a large dog that hog's the front seat keep a eye on the tachometer! Oh and fishing poles that are 6 foot or larger must be centered and ran over the armrest. OTHER THOUGHTS, I bought this for its gas mileage and it is good for a very capable four wheel drive and for its size I feel there is no comparison, because it is a Jeep not a wannabee all wheel drive! There is a difference when you pull off that comfortable road.",5

2757, on 07/17/17 14:01 PM (PDT),John ,2017 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),The Renegade Trailhawk is fantastic.," I got a free loaner from my Jeep dealership because my 2016 Jeep Patriot manual transmission wasn't working right. Had 17,000 miles on the car when it went down. The air bag sensor had to be replaced as well. Patriot was fine before these issues. The dealer lent me a 2017 Renegade Trailhawk and I loved it. Anybody who'd buy the Patriot with freedom drive 2 is crazy because you could buy the Renegade Trailhawk for the same money and get much better fuel economy.  and a thoroughly modern vehicle with blind spot detectors, back up cameras etc. Let me compare the 2 vehicles. HP : Renegade has 180hp, the Patriot has 172 HP. The seating in the Renegade is way more comfortable than the Patriot. It contours your body nicely and big tall people feel great in the bucket seats. Huge headroom like the Patriot. Back seats have the same legroom as the patriot. Cargo space is a little less than in the Patriot. You get a full size spare in the Renegade Trailhawk, Patriot has a smaller spare . Instrument panel is 10 x better in the Renegade and looks really really rugged looking . The radio has a nice rugged look , The Patriot radio is very ordinary. I liked the look of the Renegade radio, but the small screen made the backup camera picture hard to see .I wish Jeep incorporated all the new Renegade stuff into the Patriot . The Patriot looks like a real Jeep, the Renegade looks KIA Soul like. Acceleration is fantastic in the Trailhawk version , but I wish it came with manual transmission. It's higher off the ground than the Patriot and has a better ride. The Patriot had more storage space. I'd probably buy the Trailhawk if I had to decide again. I own land in upstate NY and visit during the winter. The Trailhawk would be great with it's superior off roading and excellent gas mileage . I thought about buying the Patriot with the freedom drive 2 , but the gas mileage was horrendous . The Renegade is the Patriot with freedom drive 2 and it gets much better gas mileage. It all has the blindspot detector. If a car comes into your blindspot, the mirror will light up with a yellow dot telling you a car is in your blindspot. I love that feature. The AC and climate control are excellent and it was freezing in the car on a hot 90 degree day. I wish my Patriot had all this new stuff. But I don't really like the look of the car. It's not bad. I paid $18500 for my 4x 4 Patriot, the Trailhawk is $24000 on True Car. Very reasonable for a fuel efficient vehicle that's 10 x better off roading than anything Toyota, Honda , Hyundai has.",5

I am happy with the ride, comfort, visibility through the windows, gas mileage, love the storage and hatchback style access (no need to bend down and get my groceries out of a trunk), and enjoying the modern technology.

Had not been 5,000 since purchasing and was going to do an oil change when I checked the dipstick and there was barely a drop of oil on it. I thought the dealership did not add enough oil when they serviced car before sale. The second time my wife was telling me the Jeep was stalling every morning on her way to work which is a left hand turn on a downhill and then at intersections when she made a sharp turn. Being still under warranty, and only 3,000 miles since I personally changed the oil after the last incident, I took it to the dealership. They said it was stalling because I let the oil level get too low. HOW CAN JEEP KEEP IGNORING SUCH A SAFETY ISSUE. It isn't just a matter of extra expense of continuously adding oil, WHO WANTS TO STALL IN FRONT OF AN ONCOMING TRACTOR TRAILER. <span id=""docs-internal-guid-ff522754-4303-9425-dadf-5c2e4fc8484e""><span style=""font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;""> [non-permissible content removed].</span></span>",3

A great headroom, me being 5'9""; it is fast on the highway and can surprise sportier bigger cars; maneuvers easy and grips the road great (my drifting skills met its match) with a purchase of better set of tires.  Awesome in the snow!  But!!!  Things to watch for outnumber the things that are great about it thought.  Each car is different regardless being from the same year and style. My little car scared the hell out of me when tried to bolt out of the control from waiting at the red light and letting go of the brake; it jumped forward like a little goat. This happened numerous times in the length of three years.  The gears shift with an annoying jerking, takeoff is slow as a turtle when trying to enter the highway from the service road.  This etchings can be scary for a younger or inexperienced driver.  I had it towed twice due to the dead battery; they had no clue what was wrong with it. I found out later from other people with the same issue, that car has a problem with relation between USB chargers and computer; apparently if you use the USB chargers, it would reset the computer and will stop charging the battery, but prior to that it will malfunction to lock or unlock the car, and two days later battery would be dead. I did complain to the dealership, and to my dismay they brushed it off and told me to wait till my lease is over or call the Jeep headquarters and complain.  I am a weekend mechanic and I am in my fifties, cars are somewhat my thing, so I decided to deal with it for a few months by not using USB ports; and the last time it happened I simply disconnected/reconnected the battery in order to reset the computer which worked fine. If you live in the state where winters are reaching below freezing point, do not get this car, takes forever to warm up, its sluggish .and due to poor insulation around the the radio/navigation box, it will cause your radio stations to go crazy, and navigation system will be unreliable.",4

I did a ton of research on the car and since I purchased it from a Honda dealership they didn't know much about it. They didn't know how the my sky panels worked or that it even had remote start. I ended up being able to purchase it for the trade in value which (at the time) was over 6K less than purchasing the same one new. I was super excited with my find. Fast forward 8 months (ish) I smelled something burning and smoke was coming from under the hood. I was able to get it to the dealership as it is 2 blocks from my apartment and they said it would take several days to look into the issue. Meanwhile, I had to argue with them to get a rental paid for. The dealership didn't offer loaners but rather a discount on a rental... that seemed like poor service to me since my car was still under the warranty. When I got my jeep back about a week later, I started having issues with the Uconnect system. These have been ongoing since. When it works it's great, but sometimes the screen shuts off by itself or the radio won't change stations or volume. I didn't bother taking it in for these minor issues since the last time was such a headache. The car ran fine for about a year after this, however, I have had it towed 2 times since December! Once because it wouldn't turn over at all (even after trying to jump it) and another time because there is no spare (only a patch kit) and the tire went flat due to misalignment that no one mentioned when I had it in the shop the first go around. I asked them to check everything while it was at the dealership the first time because we were taking it on a 3500 mile road trip over the Christmas break. They told me everything looked great and the car should do just fine on the trip. I also purchased 4 brand new all weather tires right before it was towed to the shop the first time. Because no one bothered to check the alignment (I paid for them to check everything btw...) both rear tires went bald on our trip and the day we got back the rear driver tire blew. I had to get another tow back to the tire place. They told me there must be something wrong with my jeep because the tires I purchased should last me at least 50,000 miles. So, after having the back tires replaced again, I took it to my parents mechanic since I no longer trusted the dealership. By the end of the day, they found the problems. The alignment was WAY off, there were break issues, I need all new struts, and a number of smaller issues. I don't know a ton about vehicles, so this was all explained through my dad who does know quite a bit. It's a long story to explain that my car has just over 45,000 miles and has already had more issues than my 200,000 mile Honda that I traded in for it. I should have kept the Honda.",2

At first they told me it was the computer and that I had to wait for the replacement. That wasn't the issue so next it was the radio. They had to reprogram both keys for the new radio. That didn't work so they had to get corporate involved and fly someone in from another state. Then they tell me it's the harness. They got that fix and then it's now my air bags. Now it's been over a month since my car has been in the shop. Not to mention, I was the one who had to call for updates on my car and not the service department. So I decided to call FCA North America LLC for Jeeps and the only thing they can do is refund 1 month of my car payment.

NOTHING BUT A HEADACHE!!!," I purchased the vehicle 8/1/15, I was super excited because the test drive was awesome. Forward 6 months later to the car shutting off while driving. I had the car towed to dealer and was told after looking car over could not find anything wrong. Another 6 months car shuts off again and towed to dealer. Dealership informs me it needs oil. I am confused since this is newer vehicle. Around same time I have a crack in my windshield. I call my insurance company whom put me in touch with a dealer for repair. I am told I need to be put on a wait list because there is an issue in the making of the windshields. At this point I call Chrysler and am told there is no back order on these and if change my claim to the car dealership they will send one right away. I immediately call my call dealer where I purchased the vehicle and am told the same thing about a wait list. They also informed they had someone that has been waiting almost 60 days already!!! I call Chrysler back and informed them what the dealership has told me and they repeat almost word for word what I was previously told, ""there is no wait"". Needless to say I waited the 60 days for my windshield. My next trip to the service department was for a terrible noise in the rear of the vehicle. I received a call letting me know the strut is bad and needs to be replaced, but this cannot be done since they need to order the part. A week later I am back to have the awful noise fixed. I call the dealer to inquire if the vehicle is ready and told at this point they replaced strut but it still makes noise. They will be keeping the vehicle and have a call into tech support at Chrysler. A full week later the car is ready to be picked up finally! I am told the noise was due to the rivets in the back of the vehicle coming ""loose""?! Really!  On to my latest adventure of the car shutting off while driving. This week was the 3rd tow to dealer for vehicle shutting of while driving. This time I am told I am 2 quarts of oil low and I quote"" allowable oil consumption is 1 quart every 1000 miles. I should check oil every 500- 1000 miles. SO BUYER BEWARE BECAUSE I WAS NOT WARNED THAT THIS IS ACCEPTABLE PER MY DEALERSHIP...KEEP A CASE OF OIL IN YOUR RENEGADE BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED IT.",3

Was in the shop 8 times in 2 months.  I finally just quit taking it.  Opened a case with the manufacturer which was a joke.  They blamed the issues on my usb port and told me not to use it.  I told them it was a feature I paid for, I should be able to use everything and the lady kept saying you have Bluetooth, don't use the port this case is closed.  The first problem that started at about 3000 miles was issues with the electronics.  I would start the renegade and the screen would have an error message and not work.  No Bluetooth, no radio nothing.  Dealership did an upgrade, worked for 2 days and did it again.  Then the doors would randomly lock and unlock while I was driving down the road.  Took to dealership and they said I needed an oil change and that would fix the problem.  Ummm no that makes no sense.  I had to argue with them so they said well we cant duplicate the problem so we can't find anything.  So I go to lunch, get in it and the screen is down with the error again, I drive to the dealership so they can see it.  They schedule me to come back in a week and tell me they replaced some module.  Next day, same crap again.  Drive it a couple of weeks and the windshield wipers now start to come on randomly and I can't get them to stop.  I drive it for a few more months and then the blinkers and dash screen just go blank, I'm trying to turn and I have no working signals!  After owning the renegade for 18 months we went to another dealership and traded it and took a big loss on it.  I only had 18000 miles on this vehicle and never in my life have had so many issues from a NEW vehicle.  I loved my little jeep and cried when getting rid of it, but for my safety and the safety of grandchildren we felt it was best to just take the loss and get out from under it.  Needless to say I lost $6000 on this vehicle that I had to put on top of the vehicle I just purchased.  So disappointed in Jeep.",1

That was my first mistake, but it was a Trailhawk and the only one in my area, so I moved quickly. From the test drive I was sold; it was more responsive than the Patriot I had owned at one time and had impressive interior room and sat up pretty high for a small SUV. The salesman pointed out the wind noise coming from the passenger side and said that would be addressed immediately. Well, I bought it and the wind noise was just the start of the issues. After waiting for a few weeks after I purchased the Jeep, I called the service department to inquire on the repair. Well after about six months and half a dozen trips to the dealership, the issue never was resolved. The wait for imported parts and poor communication between the dealership and corporate meant serious waits for parts, which I stated, never corrected the issue. Early on there were other issues that did get corrected; the remote locks didn't work, which was a safety issue as there is no way to manually lock the hatch. There have been several transmission and 4x4 warnings that were all cleared at the dealership. I still have an issue with the UConnect where my device plugged into the USB port frequently cuts out for a few seconds at a time. Just recently, at less than 60K miles, the cooling fan failed and I waited six weeks for the part, which was on international backorder. Despite several inquiries to Jeep/FCA I was told that I was 1000K miles over the Basic Warranty ""grace period"". So I had to pay nearly $600 for a part that was widely known to fail. My argument that if Jeep wasn't going to stand behind their vehicles based on principle, it should have been covered by the Powertrain Warranty, as I was unable to use 4X4 the entire time I was waiting for the part to arrive, as 4x4 doesn't operate when the ""service engine"" light is on and it was the entire time. I bought my THIRD Jeep because of 4x4! This was the worst experience I have ever had involving a vehicle and I will not buy another Jeep, or any vehicle under the Dodge/Chrysler/Fiat brand. That is unfortunate because out of the three Jeeps I have owned, this is far and away my favorite. The Trailhawk is built to go off road and it has been more than capable in snow, sand hills and muddy two-tracks. On top of that great off-road capability, it gets around 25 MPG combined, with a high average in the summer of 26+. I plan to keep this Jeep for a long time now that I've bought it, I just hope that nothing major happens with the powertrain once I exceed the warranty. If you buy one, you'll love it....just hope like heck you have issues immediately, or plan on getting no support from Jeep.***Updated Review*** I am now over 90K, so the powertrain warranty will completely expire soon. Since dealing with the cooling fan issue, I had a run of transmission issues. It started when the Service Transmission and Service Engine lights came on and the Jeep seemed to have no power. I was less than a mile from home, so I pushed on and made it home. Having dealt with numerous electrical/computer issues, including the Check Trans. light, I decided I would let it sit for a bit and restart it to see if it cleared itself. Well, the Trans light went of, but the Engine light remained(remember, no 4x4 when that occurs). So I drove it to the dealership the next day and they got it in and checked/cleared some code errors and sent me on my way. It wasn't a few days later and it happened again, only this time I was maybe ten minutes from home and on the expressway, so I tried the auto-stick and discovered it was locked in 7th gear(this is a 9 speed trans.). So I knew that the lack of power I experienced the first time was a result of it occurring as I came to a stop and the RPM's were too low for 7th gear. I called the dealership and they said I would have to leave it with them so they could work with FCA on the cause. After a few days and before the appointment, the lights cleared. This issue occurred once more and after a day or so, it cleared itself. That was probably around 75k miles. So other than a noise that resembled a brake wear indicator, which went away soon after and the brakes have not shown any sign of wear, this has been a pretty reliable vehicle. Tires and wipers are the only thing I have had to replace. You won't find a vehicle that will go almost anywhere, all while getting 25+ MPG. There is plenty of cabin room and with the back seats folded down, there is a good amount of cargo space. In theory, this has been a great vehicle, aside from the annoying computer issues and terrible support from Jeep/FCA. I know other people who have gotten newer models and the issues common with the first model year have been resolved. Sadly, I still resent the treatment I received from the company and believe this will be my last Jeep.",4

We really like the Renegade (2015, 30k) over-all, but it's not perfect.  We have had absolutely zero issues with the car.  The stellar features are the 4wd works great in snow/ice.  Had a huge blow out at about 70mph and the auto system made a very controlled stop in the rain.  Car felt very competent as the system shifted control to the other tires.  We are talking about a 4'"" square hole and bent the rim with immediate deflation.  No swerving.  I felt safe in it.  Gas mileage isn't great, but it is a heavy vehicle.  24.1 mpg in 30K.  Wish for a different for crisper shifting, although it is fine for everyday driving.  I have heard that the computer ""learns"" your style of driving and adapts to it.  Strange as it seems, this seems to be the case.  Shifting has improved over time.  It IS different, so decide what you expect from a vehicle and how you are going to use it.  Most Renegades never see off the road.  A very capable suv.  Note:  differences in models!  TH is considerable heavier (skid plates etc) and gets less mpg.  Plan to keep for many years.",5

I had a Liberty that I absolutely loved. I hoped that the Renegade would be a wonderful replacement for the Liberty. Pretty much the only good things I can say about it are the size (it has a great turn radius!) and the gas mileage. Unfortunately, I've already had to have the ignition completely replaced, they've adjusted the transmission more times than I can count and they dealership said they're just waiting for it to be recalled, it rattles as it goes down the road and I just had a tiny fender bender at less than ten miles an hour that completely destroyed the impact bar under the bumper. It didn't crack the bumper, but cracked a tiny grill in the bumper, which I took in to be replaced. When they took off the bumper, the impact bar was barely hanging on by a thread. They thought that I had been in a major accident and couldn't believe that the airbags didn't go off based on how the impact bar looked; I don't think I was even going ten miles an hour. Needless to say, I'm selling this car while it's still under warranty.",2

Tight back seat, plenty of minor issues with the key/starter, parking break etc.  But one thing that stands out with it is the durability on impact.  We were rear ended, we were stopped and a full size Chevy Silverado hit us at 45 mph, no breaking, no swerving.  The driver of the truck admitted being distracted by his phone.  We had our grandsons in the backseat, one of them was in a rear facing carseat.  Long story short, all 5 passengers of the Renegade we're fine, no shattered glass injuries, the Jeep stood up to the test.  The Jeep is totaled but the Chevy Silverado is too.  The back hatch was crushed in all the way to the backseat, but none of the passengers were affected.  Praise God!  We could have been much worse off than a totaled vehicle.",5

While at stop signs or lights, the vehicle will at times lung forward while the breaks are applied.   The RPM's stick all the time.  The tow package was installed by Chrysler, and it's unable to tow 700lbs, (it's rated at 2000lbs) without the RPM's constantly over at least 3200.  Very unsafe vehicle.  You do not know if it'll break down or if it'll cause an accident while stopped at a light/stop sign.   Chrysler refuses there's any issues and told us that it acts as it's designed.  At the arbitration, we were able to get video of the dash shutting down while driving a few days before the meeting and since we couldn't submit it before, they refused to view it.  They do not care about any customers as you're able to see that not only with this review, but with the 100's that are online.    These issues presented themselves about 2 weeks after getting this vehicle.  It was leased brand new and have been having issues for 8 months now.  Three dealership this vehicle has gone to and they've all said the same thing, these are junk, these are known issues that Chrysler is unable to fix.   DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE!!!!",1

I love the dual sun panels and seamlessly remove these most days in the summer. the tech that comes with the nav system is quite savvy and the usb port is so useful. i've got factory all weather mats and cross bars which come in handy all the time. back up camera works very well and is a huge help. mpg's i get is actually higher than what it was listed for (usually getting 25-26 mpgs). Uconnect system is also very cool and seems top of line for the tech options out there for similar vecihles. overall, well done jeep/chrysler.",5

Ok...Driving it 150miles a day has been great. Smooth ride, Great Mileage...32.5 average daily.  The worst part is the drivers seat.  I'm 5'6"" and the bottom of the drivers seat rubs under my knees. Never had that problem before. Had to buy a back cushion to nudge me forward a bit. Other than that, the power is good if you rev it up and don't shift too fast. If you're driving fairly calmly, then it's fine as well, just not a quick starter off the line. The turbo takes a bit to kick in, but lets be honest, I bought this for the extra room in the back over a sedan, and the decent mpg.   The Bluetooth for the phone audio is HORRID!  No one can hear me when I speak through the car's system, so I have to still use the speaker phone or a headset. When listening to music and Audiobooks, the bluetooth works well, and I like that it reads me a text message through the system as well.  I think the 6 speed manual is the smoothest shifting transmission  I've ever had. It's like butter in every gear. I read some ladies review and she ripped the shifting on the 6 speed. I can't imagine what the heck she is doing to have those problems. I drove 3 different Renegade's and they all shifted great!  I like the Auto Parking Break feature. I think it should be on by default. I found it by accident a few weeks after buying the car. Much safer than finding myself squished by the car while getting my mail!  (udate: sometimes the auto parking break resets itself to off---Dangerous) Visibility is good. You can't see out of the rear little windows, but the car still has excellent visibility. The price was $17020 + Tax $20,000 with everything and a full reimbursment accident policy. I normally don't get anything like that, but it wasn't expensive and will get me new car someday if the worst happens.  Great experience with the car a few months in and 17000mi.",4

Neither was the service from the Company (Jeep/Chrysler) nor the dealer (Atlantic Auto, Egg Harbor Township, NJ).  Yesterday I spent 4 1/2 hours on the beach as I watched the tide get closer and closer to my Jeep.  I was finally pulled out of the sand.

I have a 2015 Latitude 4x4 with the 1.4 turbo 6-speed manual. I have about 10,500 miles on it so far, have had it since February 2016. I've had it to the dealer two times so far, but only for oil changes ( I choose to change the oil every 5k miles by choice...but that's me). These reviews that people are putting out here are terrible, it's like they didn't test drive the vehicle. How could you not notice that the vehicle doesn't fit you well, or ""blind spots""? To me this Jeep is a fishbowl, with big windows all around, so I don't know what blind spot they are referring to. I love this little Jeep, I'm getting 31+ MPG combined and have had 0 problems so far. Also as far as fitting in the vehicle, I'm 6'4"" and I don't have a problem.

I thought the Jeep Renegade fell into that category.  I bought my car in October 2015.  I'm usually one to give things some time before making up my mind, so although I noticed some issues with the car right away I decided to give myself time to adjust to driving a different car than I'd been used to.  I've had 4-cylinder cars in the past and liked them just fine, but this one is downright dangerous!  The engine has such trouble shifting between gears that it hesitates between them, causing the car to almost come to a step when doing so. It also has very lethargic acceleration.  On top of that, I've noticed that the steering wheel pulls to one side when trying to accelerate quickly to get into traffic, making it feel like I'm losing control of the car.  This car has scared the daylights out of me many times for these reasons.  I feel like I'm going to get into an accident every time I drive it.  To make matters worse, the remote lock and security system is apparently very easy to exploit.  Twice now the car has been broken into in front of my house, only yards from where I sleep, without the alarm going off.  The car window isn't broken, so clearly someone has figured out how to override the security system and get in easily.  I don't feel safe parking it in front of my house and I certainly can't leave anything in it.  What a huge disappointment this car has turned out to be!",1
2795, on 09/30/16 19:55 PM (PDT),A.C. ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),MAJOR MECHANICAL ENGINE FAILURE," What should other consumers know?  They should know to turn the other direction and don't walk, but RUN AWAY from any 9 Speed Transmission vehicle that FCA has produced, especially the 2015 Jeep Renegade and forget getting any customer support from FCA. Mine has 12 miles on it when I purchased it, brand new, from the dealership in July 2015.  Only 8,000 some miles later did I start having issues. The vehicle shut down on me while in motion, on the road. This is a serious safety issue not only for a driver, but for other drivers on the road. There was no warning. The vehicle still had electrical power, but the engine would not turn over after it completely shut down. I called Chrysler 24 hour towing and they towed it to the nearest dealership; I had no choice in the matter, otherwise it would have gone to the dealership I purchased it from.  This particular dealership had it for 3 days, only to tell me that there was nothing wrong with it, except that ""Engines need oil and there was no oil in it.  You need to put oil in it.""  DUH.  I was treated as if I were an idiot. So I paid out of pocket for the oil change they did on it...and the rental car they were supposed to provide.  I had the oil changed about 1000 miles previously, so it did not need an oil ""change"". The vehicle at this point started running rough and when starting would rev itself, with the RPMs shooting up, until I put it in reverse - neutral did nothing. I was checking the oil each time I drove it at this point and noticed that the oil was ""disappearing"". There was no leak or oil in the driveway, nor was it burning oil, but the pan would be bone dry. I called FCA and reported it immediately, and was told that I needed to put oil in it. I informed them that if this problem persisted that the engine would seize. I was told there were no problems like this with the Renegade, no recalls, and to keep putting oil in it. I called the dealership I purchased it from and my sales guy spoke to the Master Tech who had not heard of this issue. I was instructed to try and replicate the problem and have it towed to them when that happened.  On August 29 2016, it started shuddering, shaking, rumbling and running hard while I was on the road. Luckily I was able to get home.  I checked the oil and there was oil in it, but forget driving it! The engine light was on and that was it - seized engine. I called Chrysler 24h towing and had them come get it to take it to my original dealer...and they charged me $101.00 for the towing. I got a call later in the week telling me that it was the cylinder head and that my spark plug sockets were full of oil. This could have caused a fire. After a week of waiting for the part to come in, I got another call from them. The engine would have to be completely replaced because it was seized. That is what ruined the cylinder head. A new engine to be put in a new vehicle, at only 9288 miles and just over a year of owning it. I immediately called FCA  and requested to start the Buy Back process. I was told I would have a rental the following day...A month later and I still do not have a rental. I have paid out $400 out of pocket to rent a vehicle myself twice now, plus the first time it was in the shop! FCA has been giving me the runaround.  THIS IS A DANGEROUS VEHICLE. I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO HAS HAD A SIMILAR ISSUE.  Supposedly my Renegade will be ready for pick up tomorrow; how I am getting over there I have no clue. I have not heard from the FCA Buy Back case manager in two weeks now and she will not return my phone calls. I don't hear back from them soon, I will be filing under the Lemon Law in my state, which thankfully I qualify for. Don't put yourself or others at risk by buying one of these potential death traps that FCA now knows about. (I do not blame the original dealership that sold me the vehicle or the sales person. They've been fantastic at trying to help me out as much as they possibly can.)",1

This resulted in an $800 repair that was not covered under warranty.  I still find it hard to believe that a rock was able to get into this location, especially with enough force to puncture a hole in the A/C unit.  I had never even taken this vehicle off road.  I believe the part was either defective or damaged when I purchased it.•	April 2016 – The Jeep began making a terrible squealing noise and brought it in for service.  I captured an audio file and provided it to the service department.  They believed they corrected the issue but the squealing noise continued.  I returned the Jeep to the service department yet again.  This time, they ended up finding a rock in the rotor area that was causing the issue.  •	August 2016 – The Jeep’s power locks failed so it was returned to the service department.  The power locks were not working from the key fob or from the door panel and had to be manually locked and unlocked.  This is a safety hazard!  I made yet another appointment with the service department.  They downloaded software upgrades and found that a part for the power locks was bad and needed replacement.  I was informed a new part would arrive within 3-5 days. (Note: As of 9/21/16, 36 days later, the part still has not arrived!)•	August 2016 – While I was calling the service department for a status on the ordered part to fix the Jeep’s power locks, I also reported additional issues, as noted below:(1) The parking brake now automatically sets every time the Jeep is placed into Park.  This was not happening prior to the 8/16/16 service and I was not informed about it.(2) The hood will no longer open.  Again, this was not happening prior to the 8/16/16 service.  (Note: During the 8/16/16 service, an oil change was also performed.)(3) The key gets stuck in the ignition after the car is placed into Park and will not release.

I have noticed a lot of complaints about transmission, which I am hoping to avoid with the manual trans. Speaking of, the shifting is very smooth, but the acceleration to me is a little sluggish. But it's not a sports car, it is a Jeep. I have owned several Wranglers in the past and have had no major issues with any of them. I would've purchased another Wrangler, but the prices are a little too steep for me at this time. But, I am a Jeep fan and I have been looking forward to the Renegade since it was announced.

Only issue so far has been a loose wire to a running light--intermittent (3x) dash warning over 6 months of driving.  Took it to the dealer yesterday, and they say it's fixed--no warnings driving home.   The Renegade has been my daily driver, and mpg has exceeded the manufacturer's estimate and mine!  In mixed driving it reliably gets about 33 mpg, and recently averaged 43mpg on a strictly highway trip.  On the return trip, we crawled home in bumper to bumper Los Angeles traffic--trip should have taken an hour and 10 minutes but took 2.5 hours--we still averaged 39 mpg for the round trip!  My concern was that I would be spending more on gas driving the Renegade instead of the VW Beetle it replaced--not so.  My husband likes it too; he likes that it can ""get out of its own way"", and is pleased with the handling, convenience, comfort--so much so that he agreed to sell his aging but sound VW GTI and drive the Renegade as his primary car when I got the opportunity to purchase an E-Golf to use for my short work commute and save even more on costs.   So far, so good with the Renegade!  ______________________________________________________________________________________The Renegade's size and exterior styling caught my eye when visiting the dealer to have a Ram truck serviced over a year ago.  I walked over to look, and--it was quite upscale and European looking inside!  I then walked around to look at the window sticker--it was MADE IN EUROPE--Italy to be precise.  Was it possible that this confirmed European car driver could actually purchase an American car as a daily driver?  (The Ram truck only pulls a horse trailer and goes to the hardware store).  I was not in need of a new vehicle, but I kept thinking about the Renegade.  Fast forward about 18 months, I looked the Renegade up online just out of curiosity to check reviews, and found huge manufacturer and dealer incentives on the remaining 2015s in stock--I thought, oh my,  I can get a brand new Jeep (actually a Fiat) for about the same price  paid for a new 2001 VW Beetle years ago!  Another big plus for me was the availability of a manual transmission.   I was sorely tempted at his point despite the VW's reliability, and headed for the Jeep dealer.  Let m assure you that going to an American car dealer was quite a step for me!  The first dealer did not have what I was looking for, but the second dealer did--I'd been doing all the shopping and research, and was quite sure we were going home with the Renegade, so I asked my husband to come along to look at the Renegade and drive the VW home.  He was amazed at the good value and quality of the Renegade!  The Renegade continues to please--30+mpg in combined driving, and the car is very willing to move--engine and manual trans are smooth!   It is very quiet and roomy inside--good sized adults will fit in the back seat, and simply easy to deal with--it actually is a utility vehicle.   It does not rattle or have wind noise.   It has some nice touches inside like soft lighting, the seats are comfortable, and I'm really enjoying the SiriusXM radio trial.   I am thrilled to not have to drive a 50 mile round trip for service since I have two Jeep dealers close by.   I have not owned the vehicle long enough to comment on durability, but I believe the build quality is good.  A family member who worked at a high level job for another car manufacturer looked at it and was impressed by the quality.  At this point I am very satisfied with the Renegade.  I keep my vehicles for a long time, drive them carefully, and have them maintained on schedule.  I expect that this vehicle will last.",5

Poor acceleration and automatic transmission horrible in traffic, wish they had a stick in the Trailhawk.  Range is not good either about 300 miles per tank max.",4
2804, on 06/04/16 22:49 PM (PDT),Rey ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Try something else," Engine died on busy freeway with 4k miles.  Car has been at dealership for repair for over 40 days, and still no diagnosis of the problem.  One big headache!  Price and features seemed great, but now I know it was too good to be true.  I liked certain design aspects of the car, but reliability is horrendous, and I see now that I'm not alone in my frustration and disappointment.",1
2805, on 05/29/16 23:00 PM (PDT),Jeeper ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Good little Jeep," Good little jeep with lots of little extras. So far it has been impressive, lots of people down the car because of the transmission. Truth be told it's just different than most others out there. I have owned around 100 cars all make and this one shifts totally different. If you don't have an open mind to a different vehicle how it shifts and operates then don't buy this one. If you do you will be one of the people whom don't like this jeep. I have been happy with my jeep and it runs like a champ. I like the crawl control and the optional terrain modes. For the price it is hard to beat!",4
2806, on 05/29/16 10:42 AM (PDT),raul t herrera ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Limited 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),problems with my new 2015 jeep renegade limited, The ignition system will not release vehicle ignition key. Jeep renegade was bought in Nov. 2015. Between Nov. 2015 and May 2016 removing the ignition key was a slow progression until May 28 2016 the ignition key stayed stuck in the ignition system. Another problem is  the acceleration. Once the transmission shifts through all the forward gears and you step on the gas pedal to accelerate the motor will hesitate (choke). I suggest;  drive the vehicle and if it hesitate when you accelerate drive the jeep back to the dealership lot. I was informed by Chrysler dealership there is no fix for that problem.,3
2807, on 05/23/16 13:52 PM (PDT),E.C.M. ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Worst Decision of my life!!," I bought a 2015 Jeep Renegade Latitude 01/01/2016 and it has already been in the shop for issues.  The first issue I have had is using a DriveSense device to save money on car insurance allegedly cause the computer to malfunction.  I had 304 miles and in the first month of ownership it was in the shop more than it was able to be driven.  Multiple cars to Chrylser complaint line and threats of wanting the car replaced caused Chrylser/Fiat to reimburse for the first month payment as it was only drivable for about 1 week out of the entire month.  Removed the computer reading device no issues.  It would be thought that this information would be shared from Jeep(Chrylser/Fiat) with Esurance to advise that the DriveSense is not compatible with the computer within this vehicle. Fast forward a month or 2, I had an issue with the shifting from Park to Reverse/Drive--it felt like I was driving an old manual car doing the ""bunny hop"" when driving--I thought it was due to not being ""broken in.""   After going down the interstate attempting to merge with traffic, the RPMs increased and the MPH decreased--felt like it was going to stall out.  Also this happened when making corners, the car felt like it was going to stall out completely.  Trip into the dealer revealed that there was a pump that needed to be replaced.  Come to find out the Transmission pump and valves needed to be replaced.  Thankfully this was a warranty repair.  Fear of this happening when there is no longer a warranty and the repairs are going to be extremely costly.  Wishing I would have done more research on this vehicle and read more reviews.  First Jeep purchase and more than likely the last one.",1
2808, on 05/23/16 09:17 AM (PDT),ersatzpnk ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),It's like a Jeep...car....hybrid.," We already have a '11 Jeep Liberty so I am evaluating this Jeep with that in mind. The first thing we noticed is that we FIT in the car! The outside definitely makes you think that a 6'0"" person would have their head at the ceiling - not so! Jeep really made this vehicle appeal to all demographics including those blessed with height. The power on button takes some getting used to (remember that you have to press it again with the brake in to start the car if you use the remote start! great security feature but I definitely was lost for a minute when I first used it). The turn radius is FANTASTIC for a Jeep. Or a car really! The feel is that of a car - you don't realize you are going as fast as you are until you look at the dash. That could be the reason my husband set up a warning when I hit 80mph...oops. I love being able to customize the dash with what I want to see. The gauges are switched from the usual (MPH on the right and RPM on the left rather than the reverse) so that does take some getting used to. Also, being taller, the dash is not the most visible line of sight when your hands are on the steering wheel. Therefore, we have the MPH showing as the main portion of the customized dash.  Love love love the Bluetooth feature. We did not get the navigation option in the car so we just sync our phones and the speakers (loud and full sound!) let you know what is coming up. I also use the crap out of the backup camera because I am the worst person with backing up. My husband is fantastic at driving and backs into our driveway every time he comes home so he only uses it to see how close he can get to our other Jeep...ugh. The only downfall of this would be the rear seating - it's cramped for an adult person especially with the cup holder seat down. Think airplane seats. But, when we have kids, it will be perfect for them. I'm a happy camper with this one!",4
2809, on 05/14/16 05:41 AM (PDT),mandy ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),kept us safe and was very fun to drive, I had own my first Renegade trailhawk for almost 7 months and loved her! The renegade was amazing in snowdrifts and bad snowy roads I always felt like I had control. She was totaled one morning a few weeks ago when a young lady turn left crossing two lanes into mine. I was not able to stop in time Tboning the other car around 40/45 miles a hour. My insurance agency said he has not seen one in a accident yet however this jeep got 5 stars in his eyes. My 9 year old nephew who was in the back seat and myself walked away. I did have a bruised knee from the lower leg airbag but we walked away the jeep did its job and kept us safe. I did have a few problems with her the locks would not lock or unlock however this was a quick fix and the dealership. I now am having issues with my new jeep same as the first one. This may be a once in a lifetime problem however the cap to the battery cables came off getting caught in the fan burning the fan motor. this is being replaced as we speak. Also I have notice when I back up the brakes squeak they are also looking into this on my new jeep I have had less than two weeks. My dealership has been amazing and have quickly fixed any problems I have come across which is not many. Needless to say I loved my Renegade trailhawk so much that when I had a clean start to get any other car I choose to have another renegade. She kept me safe and was fun to play with in the snow.,4

Jan. '16 Test drive went great. So while financing, Find out the payments will be $50 more than I agreed to pay. Walked out, Only to find I have no plates on my then Buick. Found salesman, Not so politely requested to ""put my plates back on my car I'm leaving!"" Suddenly my payment went down $50 mo. By day three, I e-mailed salesman to return vehicle. Basically told me they don't do that.  Had to wait 2 mos. for owners manual. Still never received disc part. Transmission sucked. Until the latest software upgrade. Gained 20-30 miles per tank of gas with that also. Rattles are MANY, And difficult to pinpoint the source. Terrible wind noise from drivers door. Have had adjusted once, But didn't help much.  Aside from the noises, Highway ride is really close to the Buick Verano I traded. City not so much. BUT I avg. 2 mpg more than the Buick, With 4WD.  But Jeep is 200 lbs. lighter. All said, I cannot wait to trade this thing off. Never should have been dumb enough to buy anyway. **UPDATE** Traded Rengade for 2016 Cherokee Sport , In September.",3
2811, on 05/08/16 13:52 PM (PDT),John Ciardi ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Unique Jeep," Comfort is what would be expected in a small Jeep. Ride is good. Mileage is great. Storage is almost non existent. Despite other reviews, acceleration, transmission, engine performance is acceptable. Good vehicle for everyday local and highway travel. This little Jeep actually feels ""solid"" as compared to the soft loose feel of so many other vehicles. Would buy this Jeep again without hesitation.",4
2812, on 05/08/16 12:57 PM (PDT),Andrea ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Beware the 2015 Renegade," I'd thoroughly enjoyed my new Renegade for 6 weeks and the power door locks went out. I took the car into the dealership and it's been there almost 3 weeks. Apparently the 2016's don't have the electrical problems that the 2015's do. The dealership said I could now pick up the car - but the anti-theft alarm doesn't work. They did updates, replaced body control module, replaced tire pressure monitors, have talked to Chrysler multiple times (28 calls to STAR), are stumped. I've asked that they fix the car completely - it worked great for 6 weeks - or repurchase the car. I'm so disappointed. Gas mileage was great, around 30 mpg.UPDATE: The dealership took back the 2015, I purchased a 2016 with less miles, more options, and a lower monthly payment. 12K miles in, still loving it.UPDATE: 25K miles and 2 years later, still good. Average about 28 mpg.",3

I has been in the shop for 3 or more months that we have owned it due to problems. There is a noise coming from the steering column that the dealership has yet to figure out the last 5 times its been in the shop. There is a knocking noise coming from the front end. We have had the gas cap replaced three times. The traction control light comes on and it wont accelerate. The brakes squeak when in reverse. The hill assist light has came on to be services along with three other lights. The lumbar support wont work. I would not buy this vehicle or recommend anyone to even look into it. We have had nothing but issues and are now having to go through Chrysler to get anything done and possibly have them buy back our vehicle.

I travel often and get to drive all sorts of vehicles on different continents. This was about the second worst experience of all... (the first being an under powered Hyundai i30) I'm 6ft tall and had to wheel the seat all the way back to fit in. Not a good start. The car is full of blind spots and the mirrors do not give you a good view around the car. Then driving: acceleration is great for such a dinky toy, breaking on the other hand is a vomit-inducing event: First time I actually thought it was going to do a head roll...  Somehow the suspension is way to soft. Body roll is scary when taking corners. It's also very noisy as others have said: wind and tyre noise is annoying. I've no idea how this thing would hold off road, but at this size, I'd much rather drive a VW Golf... Seats are comfy though...",1
2818, on 04/22/16 17:38 PM (PDT),Brett West ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Renegade is Cute but Loaded with Problems," We have just over 13k miles now on our 2015 Renegade Sport 4x4 with the 2.4 liter engine and the 9 speed auto tranny. It had quality issues from the start and we simply do not have much faith in it. We also own a 2008 Jeep Commander that has been an excellent vehicle both on and off road. Our Renegade has suffered from wind noise at the driver's door since new. The transmission is sluggish. It has randomly died in traffic for no reason (guessing electronic issues). The door locks work most of the time but not always. The brakes squeal when moving at slow speeds or in reverse. Since it is built by Fiat in Italy, parts take forever to get if they are available at all. It is a cute little car but not one I would really recommend to someone who hasn't bought yet. The Renegade is more Fiat than it is Jeep in my opinion. I would be very hesitant to take it out into the mountains of Colorado (where we go in our Commander) for fear that it might not get us back out. If you want a Jeep, go with a Wrangler or maybe a Cherokee. I would recommend passing on the Renegade...I would if I had it to do over again.Update: Now at 19.5k miles, our Renegade is in the shop for the 4th time with continuing wind noise and window/door trim issues. The dealer appears to finally be taking it seriously now that we have opened a case with FCA and are discussing our options with a lemon law attorney. If they fail to repair it this time, we may file it as a lemon and see if we can force FCA to buy it back. We would trade out of the Renegade into a Wrangler in a heartbeat if the dealer would give us what is owed on it. Unfortunately that is likely going to require legal action. If you are considering the Renegade, I would encourage you to seriously reconsider and go with an actual Jeep and not what is in reality a Fiat. The Renegade is cute to look at but it is poor quality and riddled with problems.Update: Now at 27.5k miles. After last update, and a total of 7 times in service, the dealer finally figured out that the driver's side window was malformed/warped and that was causing all the wind noise/trim issues in the driver's side front door. They replaced the window and the wind noise was solved. No other major issues to report. Upgrading our star rating to a 3. Wish we had a Jeep dealer within 50 miles that knew the definition of customer service. Our local GMC/Chevy dealer (which is absolutely outstanding) takes care of most of our maintenance needs now.Update: 40k miles now and we are out of warranty. Fingers crossed. Not much new to report other than the radio has issues periodically. To reset it we have to disconnect a battery cable. Just one more quirky thing on the 2015 Renegade.",3

Not more than 2 months later we had to take it back for the back brakes to be totally replace with only 500 additional miles on the car.  Now, three months later, we are getting ready to take it back because the electric locks will not work.

2822, on 03/29/16 12:40 PM (PDT),Paul ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Trailhawk Trail rated...sort of," Let me get this out of the way first: if you want a Wrangler for the specific purpose of off roading...buy one.  If you want a car with more comfort at the cost of some off roading ability...save your pennies and buy a Cherokee Trailhawk instead.  My wife has one, and it is superior in every way to my Renegade with the exception of the price. Now,  will the Renegade do very light off roading/two tracking?  Yes.  Is it really comparable to one of the bigger Jeeps?  Not in my experience.  With that being said, it's the best thing out there that is a daily driver that can leave the pavement for under 30 grand.  The car is pretty nimble on the turns, but it's not particularly fast, nor is it particularly good on gas mileage.  However, through inclement weather conditions (including Michigan snow) it handles quite nice, so I consider those an acceptable trade off.  The front seats are roomy enough for two big guys, but don't plan on putting anyone in the backseat.Overall, this little Jeep is definitely worth a look, and frankly any negative about it can be said for every other mini crossover in the segment (small back seat, lack of cargo space, small engine etc).  If you are an outdoors type on a budget the Renegade just might be your next car.",4

When driving the car at 27-32 mph and on 5th gear the gas pedal is vibrating horribly and the car keeps shifting badly.

2829, on 02/27/16 08:09 AM (PST),Shannon ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Sport 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Love my Jeep Renegade!," I have owned my Renegade since August 2015 and still love it! It's cute, has a little zip when you need it and is good on gas. My husband is 6ft and he has plenty of room in the front, and he has had to sit in the back once or twice and was fine. I have two boys 9 and 5 and they are plenty comfortable in the back. The overall look of it is what caught my eye and I love that it's a little rugged and cute at the same time. The only downside that I could say is it not coming with a spare tire kit. I had a flat a few months ago and was shocked that there was no spare, jack, wrench or anything! I had to have it towed from my driveway to a local tire shop. The woman there was surprised it didn't come with anything and told me if I would have tried to use the kit that blows it back up it would have messed up the tire pressure sensor and that would have cost $100 or so to fix. I hear that a lot of new cars are not coming equipped with spares anyways. I have not had any problems that everyone else seems to be having. No key fab problems, no transmission problems etc. I have noticed when I reverse out of my driveway in the morning and brake it squeaks once and that's it. Nothing else throughout the day. I have about 6300 miles on it now and overall am very happy with it!!!*Update 8/31/17*I still enjoy my Renegade. I have started running into key getting stuck. All you have to do is turn car back on, put foot on brake, reverse (or move forward) just a bit, put it in park, wait a few seconds and then take foot of brake pedal. Turn car off and key should come out. At least that is what has worked for us in the past. I am at about 31,000 miles and have noticed some rough shifting. Also I live in Northern GA and going up and down the hills/mountains sometimes it doesn't know what to do and will rev like crazy and I will have to put it over to manual.",4

WE WILL SEE!!," I just got the OMAHA ORANGE Trailhawk,  so far , so good, only about 300 miles on it. this is my first jeep, and hopefully it will not be a mistake, i have read many review, and it seems the TRAILHAWK owners are the most happy, except 1 person, i think.I have owned Mitsubhishi's for the last 25 years,and they are so reliable, never a problem, Hopefully this JEEP, can compare to them.  As i had not other options on the Mitsubishi , as i have an Outlander, and they do not sell the Pajero, or Pajero sport here. i love the interior and the funky style of the Renegade, it is different from your grandmas jeep.hope it last for a long time,  i voiced my concerns to the dealership, abou the reviews, battery, brakes, fob and engien, they gave me a 100,000 mile warranty, 5 year free oil change and mainteance, and 5 year road side, and other things.  so  i hope i am covered, but who knows.But i am happy for now,",3
2832, on 02/12/16 09:20 AM (PST),Kyle G. ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Regrettable purchase," Let me start this review by stating that I just traded in my 2015 Trailhawk after 10 months of ownership and 11,485 miles, and I couldn't be happier!  I entered my purchase back in April 2015 thinking this was going to be the answer to my many vehicle needs: 4x4/offroad capability, adequate cargo space for trips to the beach with the dog, great gas mileage for my weekly commutes to sales calls, and a reliable vehicle that held it's value for years to come, due to the Jeep name pedigree.  Boy was I wrong.  My problems started the evening I brought it home.  I noticed the next morning after purchase that there was a puddle of clear liquid under the front of the car.  I thought it was residual dripping from being washed the day before, but the dripping hadn't stopped after 24 hours.  A quick smell of the liquid revealed it was alcohol based and not water.  I discovered that the washer fluid pump was leaking.  After a quick and unsatisfying call to the dealership, where they wanted me to make an appointing for 2 weeks out, I removed the pump myself and sealed with black RTV silicone to solve for the problem. Flash forward a few months an a couple thousand miles, and I started getting an awful screeching sound when starting the vehicle from cold.  It would intermittently happen at first, but became increasingly more frequent over the next month, and eventually screeched constantly.  My first trip to the dealership yielded the response of ""we cannot recreate the sound, therefore cannot resolve for it"".  Funny that the next morning after returning home, it made the same terrible sound.  A second trip to the dealership, and request of a different technician, revealed that the serpentine belt was cracked.  It was replaced an the screeching went away.  During this visit, they also serviced the front brakes, which made a terrible squeal under moderate to light braking once they had warmed up.  Very annoying and embarrassing.I haven't event gotten to the worst part about the Jeep Renegade in my opining, which is really a two-part issue.  First is the terribly small fuel tank.  At only 12.7 gallons, I had to fill up twice as often as a companion vehicle during a trip from Florida to Tennessee.  Really made for a slow trip needing to stop every 300 miles.  The range of the vehicle left a lot to be desired.  Second, and what I feel is the absolute biggest issue with the Renegade (in Trailhawk trim at least), is the drivetrain combination of the 2.4L, 4 cyl. engine and the 9 speed transmission.  Accelerating at speed, passing on the highway, and overall highway drivability is the worst that I've ever experienced.  You literally have to floor the accelerator to achieve any passing capability, and passing vehicles on a 2 lane, dotted line road is beyond terrifying.  I can't begin to describe how terrible this motor and transmission combination is.  The computer constantly tries to put the car in the highest gear possible to save on fuel, which causes CONSTANT downshifts.  I can't imagine the durability or longevity of the transmission internals due to the accelerated levels of wear and tear that this causes.I could spend hours nitpicking this vehicle, but I'll spare the readers and my fingers.  All told, I'm beyond thrilled that I was able to trade out of this vehicle.  Unfortunately, the Renegade dropped 1/3 of it's value (as mentioned in other reviews) in less than 10 months.  Be weary/cautious of this, as it does not carry the Jeep pedigree/name into it's resale value.Buyer beware and best of luck with your decision!",2
2833, on 02/11/16 05:08 AM (PST),Dre ,2015 Jeep Renegade SUV Limited 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Great Purchase for price," Purchased this vehicle Sep 2015. No issues so far. It's actually a Latitude with the 2.4L engine, Cold Weather 2 package, upgraded 9-speaker system, passive entry, 2WD. I've had no issues so far. Road noise is higher than I am accustomed to. It's adequate on the highway with a little lag sometimes. I have to keep that in mind if I  want to change lanes quickly. Idle's a little rough. Brakes squealed occasionally for about the first 2000 miles then went away. Average mileage has been around 23 mpg. The Uconnect system works well, voice recognition and blue tooth,  etc.  I've had no electrical, engine or suspension issues thus far (knock on wood). One minor issue is the guidelines in the backup camera disappear sometimes. It's now February 2017 with 28000 miles. Only scheduled maintenance. All good so far",4
2834, on 08/13/18 11:26 AM (PDT),Ramon Serna ,2018 Jeep Renegade SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),like my jeepers, When shopping for a jeep renegade make sure that you test drive it over many different types of road surfaces so that you know how it's going to ride and sound cause it is different. I first purchased a 2015 latitude 4x4 auto and could not be more pleased with the decision I made. I traded it in for a 2018 limited with many new safety features and improved ride and noise reduction. The tires that came with I traded in for a new set of Michelin X-Ice Xi3 which I like cause of the lack of road noise as well as great winter traction on all surfaces which is a plus because where I live we get over 180 inches average in the last 6 years of snow in the winter.  I have had no issues or repairs in over 16000 miles of ownership on both models.,5

We loved the look of this Jeep. It wasn't your traditional looking Jeep but we aren't into the normal traditional looking vehicles.  This is definitely something different. NOW THE ISSUES: This Jeep has been an electrical nightmare! It's been back to the shop at least 7 times for a tire pressure sensor to have repaired. It runs about 50 miles after the repair then the service light for the sensor comes back on. The service people at Jeep can't seem to resolve the issue. The problem still exists without any resolution. It's also been in for repair because the brain in the radio went out. They fixed that issue to have to return it back to the shop  a few weeks later because the 4×4 electrical switch failed. You could not switch into four wheel drive. Lastly the fan motor on the radiator went out and also fried the fan sensor. When I tell you that I miss my Kia' s that I had for over four years and that they have never been in the shop, you know it's serious, especially coming from a family of a Chrysler workers. PLEASE STOP WITH THE CHEAP MEXICO AND CHINESE PARTS! THAT IS THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM, I'M SURE! ALONG WITH QUANTITY OVER QUALITY!",3
2839, on 05/07/18 15:01 PM (PDT),Jolene ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Flashy but lacking jeep," Although I upgraded for the Trailhawk edition, this jeep is everything you'd expect from a semi-rugged jeep - loud, slow, and basic. Although the technology that comes in the Renegades are great and fun with the beat by dre speakers and the detailing in the electronics - its hard to enjoy because the car rattles - even the dealerships I bought it from says the rattling and overall loudness of the car in idle and in motion is to be ""expected when you own a jeep"". If you do any traveling in which you need to get on and off the freeway or need to pass on the freeway - this is not your car. It is sluggish and sounds like it is going to explode when you are going over any hill/pass and need to go over 65mph. I have driven this car off-road and it handled good. Not as much clearance in dips and rocks... but it was enjoyable and fun off-roading. I have had this car 2 seasons in the snow and it handles really well. My biggest complaint is that in the 2 years I have owned this vehicle I have taken it in several times for service warnings... not routine maintenance. And every time it isn't just a day to find and fix the problem. Because I just have the basic warranty I will be trading this car in before my warranty is up. I do think it is important to point out that my husband is a jeep guy and we have owned several jeeps - this is the first jeep we have bought and been unsatisfied with. In addition this is the first jeep in which my husband can't change the oil at home because of all the undercarraige and scrape plate removal you have to take off to be able to just do the simple job. (FIAT changes?!)",3

Often times, consumer reports looks at things that are irrelevant in the general sense of owning a car. While studies they take show poor performance, the average user will find it to be very soothing and smooth. I have the manual transmission and it is absolutely wonderful. It shifts amazingly and is fun to drive. The interior is stylish and practical and the seats have nice bolsters and support. While you can get the Bose speaker sound system, the 6 speaker optional system has great sound quality. The software is simple and easy to use and quick. My overall verdict is that it is a great car for snow, comfort, and overall driving.",4

Peck ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),A great big LEMON," Bought the 2016 new and had nothing but problems with the computer system beginning with the first oil change.  Every time I  had the oil changed all of the sensors would malfunction.  I would have to go back to the dealer get a loaner and they would keep the car for a few days and then tell me it needed some type of an update to the computer system.  When the vehicle reached 15000 miles I asked the dealer to explain what would happen after the warranty expired and they suggested that I trade it in before that happened.     It was their professional opinion that there was not a problem with the vehicle as long as they could fix it regardless of the number of times is occurred and if it happened after the warranty expired I would be completely responsible for the cost.   I was a little confused as to how changing the oil created an issue with the computer system on the vehicle but since it happened every single time it must be some internal control Jeep has to require updates every 5000 miles.  No so bad while it is under warranty but they advised me the updates were quite costly outside of the warranty.   They would, however,  make me a great deal on a new Jeep if I was interested.   Well I took their advice but would never buy another Jeep product.  Traded it in the next day on a Nissan Rogue.",3

First, repairs are costly and take FOREVER. Parts have to come from Italy because of Fiat, and the car was so new that when I got into a fender bender on the freeway, it took MONTHS to fix my vehicle because parts weren't available. Why would you put a car on the market when you don't have the resources to fix it? Since then, I've had a total collapse in the technology and security system, and I'm currently waiting for a new transmission to be put in because mine is completely shot. Word at the dealership is that I'm not the only one having this issue. I had to call around to multiple Jeep/Chrysler dealerships just to find one that had capacity to look at my car, which had been refusing to start, or REFUSING TO SHUT OFF when I was able to get it to start. This many issues and this much maintenance on a brand new car is just heartbreaking...I wouldn't recommend this purchase.",2
2845, on 11/09/17 21:36 PM (PST),Jen Greene ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Limited 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Looks great but miss my Honda CRV bigtime," When I bought this car, I was previously driving a 2004 Honda CRV.  I bought this car because it wasn't your typical looking SUV.  It had such character and was just a good looking smaller SUV, which is what I wanted.  However, After purchasing my 2016 Jeep Renegade Limited, I quickly became irritated.  The gas mileage wasn't so great and this particular model has no pick up whatsoever.  Little things began to bother me such as no place to put your sunglasses, not much storage compartments or cup holders.  The blue tooth didn't work that great and I was constantly getting electrical warnings about the tires and the transmission.  When I took the car in to the dealers, they were nice and basically said they ""needed to reset the computer"". This helped for about a month and then started happening again.  Also, sometimes, the key fob would not work properly and I had issues starting the car!!  The car also rides a bit rough and I have trouble with the visibility when I look out to my blind spots.  Again, I love the looks and the value of this car but I wished I had spent more and just got my loved Honda.  They are reliable and I owned Honda's since 1990 and have never been disappointed.",3

When selling dealer delivered the Jeep we noticed a heavy vibration during idle.  We were told that was normal, it was a Jeep, they do that.  We didn't know any better.  It kept getting worse to the point that the sound inside the Jeep was deafening.  First time in for repairs - one week in the shop - software updates, nothing else, can't reproduce the problem (it happened every time the vehicle was running).  Problem still existed.  Second time in the shop, motor mounts are bad and need replaced - dealer never orders parts, we take our vehicle back after five more days.  We are told if we want to return to that dealer we need to agree to pay for $400 in maintenance.   Third time in the shop, a different dealer, four more days - motor mounts replaced, intake hose replaced intake housing replaced, won't know until this weekend if that resolves it.  New dealer says other dealer was quoting for 32k mile maintenance, we're 10k away from that, no reason for them to require that (beware of shady Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep service shops).  Other issues - brakes squeaking loudly after 15k miles (dealer - that's normal, no action taken).  Cruise control is off by 1-11 MPH regardless of road/incline (dealer - can't reproduce, no action taken - we provided pictures to show the issue, they still denied it's happening (both dealers)).  Excessive rattling of every plastic part inside the Jeep (dealer - blank stare).  Transmission - don't get me started.  Worst transmission I've ever dealt with (dealer - that's normal, we'll apply a software fix).  No change no matter how many times they've tried to update the software. Strange sounds, hard shifting, weird mid shift pauses that almost cause us to be rear-ended....   Loud whistling in cabin while driving (dealer - bad door seals - replaced).  Loud rattling from MySky panel (dealer - can't reproduce, no action taken).  Gas Mileage - we took a 2600 mile trip with 90% highways and flat terrain never driving more than 5MPH over the speed limit.  Our MPG at the end of the trip was 20.5.  It's rated at 27 for the highway.  With it's 12 gallon tank and 20MPH - if you enjoy stopping every 200 miles this is the vehicle for you (dealer - that's normal, no action taken).  If we could go back in time we'd run away from this vehicle and we suggest others do the same.  Not only is our local Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep service shop full of a bunch of arrogant jerks but none of the service shops we've come across seem to know how to fix these things.  Both shops have said there is no way the motor mounts should be bad this soon (given the vibration they've been bad since the beginning).  Chryster corp is involved but refusing to do anything so we're stuck with the lemon that falls apart if we go over a pebble in the road.  Don't waste your time with these.",2

2853, on 07/21/17 03:40 AM (PDT),Shaun ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Trailhawk 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Very Disappointed," I bought the 2016 Renegade looking for a decent size, but small, SUV that could be driven if it snowed. The first week or so was ok, even though the power was horrible. I have never been in a car that has an engine that vibrates as much as this one. You could literally cut a whole in the hood and put a intruding air intake and they would think it had a mini hemi in it. The 2nd week I had it the entertainment center would reset my stations and setting every time I turned off the car, then it would reset the backup camera settings and remove the guide lines. After a few weeks going back and forth to the dealer, they resolved it. The traction control is horrible. Just hope you never pull out in traffic and have any wheel slip or your going to be toast, because the engine practically shuts down and no matter how hard you press that gas peddle, it does NOTHING. Not a good thing when something is coming at you fast and waiting for you to get out of the way. I also do not like how the car will get stuck in certain revving levels and rev up real high for no reason and then eventually go back down without any intervention from you. I DO NOT recommend this car for ANYONE. And the resell value is DESPICABLE. You pay 30k for a fully loaded trailhawk and less that one year and 20k miles it is work about 20k. A very good sign that after someone owns one, they are not wanting another. Dropping 10k or more in 1 year tells me this car really sucks and now I am stuck with it, unless I am willing to throw 10k down the drain.",1

I purchased a top of the line Traiulhawk.  Before the first oil change, It started stalling, and not shifting correctly, and would not go into 9th gear on freeway.  I took it in for service and they reprogrammed computer and gave it back.  The next time (a few months later) I had to bring it back in because it was still stalling, not shifting which made it have bad gas mileage, and sunroof was making horrible noise when opening and closing.  They did another computer adjustment.  The 3rd time, the transmission failed.  I was at a red light  and went to go and light on dash started blinking and car would not move.   I turned it off and back on and it went.  I took it to the dealership and they said it threw a bunch of codes, transmission fault, abs failure etc.  ANOTHER software update and they gave it back.  It still would not shift into 9th gear and sunroof still made noise but we decided just to wait until next oil change to address this.  Now on Sat. June 3rd, 2017 the check engine light came on, on a 2 mile trip to the grocery store.  I took it straight home and parked it.  The owners manual said if this happens to drive again as you would normally and see if it happens again.  The next day I took it  maybe 2 1/2 miles, the check engine light was still on, the a/c began to surge hot and cold, and then the temperature light came on.  By the time I could pull over into the next parking lot, The car overheated.  I sat in the parking lot for an hour until the car cooled down and then limped home.  The next morning, Monday June 5,2017,  I took it directly to the dealership NW Dodge in Houston, TX.  The codes were transmission failure, brake failure, steering failure, etc. and the cooling fan motor went out.  It is now July 11, 2017 and my Renegade is STILL at the dealership waiting on parts.  I have been without my vehicle for 5 weeks now.  They did give me a stripped down renegade rental which I kept for 2 weeks until it started having some of the same issues.  I gave it back, not wanting the responsibility of another unsafe car.  I inquired about a buyback and the dealership referred me to Stericycle, a contract company to resove this problem.   They offered a replacement purchase at sticker price and I lose my year's worth of payments.  I told them I did not feel safe in another Renegade and really did not have confidence in any other Mopar vehicles.  I am disabled and can not get in and out of most standard size cars, which is one of the reasons I picked the Renegade SUV.  I then told them I would consider a Ram P/U. I picked out a 2016 DEMO for $29,000 (The same price as the Renegade).  They said I could not buy that.  I had to be NEW and pay sticker price of $41,000, when anyone else could walk in off the street and but it for $29k.  Sorry this review is so long winded but I wanted the readers to get the whole picture.  The Renegade is UNSAFE, UNRELIABLE, and you get no customer support from Chrysler-Jeep.

First time was for the driver seat belt making a clicking noise. To find out the bolt holding the seat belt to the B pillar wasn't tight enough and I could hear the crush washer clicking. The next issue was the airbag and traction control lights came on and didn't clear tell the dealer ship. The PMC was updated and thats all Jeep knew about to do. The third time the window regulator cable went out on the passenger window and the window wouldn't close. A month later there was a rattling noise in the same door to find out that the door bracket busted. And finally a stress crack in the windshield with only 8500 miles on the jeep. I wouldn't recommend this Jeep to anyone. Too many little things happening in less than 10,000 miles. Traded this in got a different car. Cant imagine what would happen in the long term specially reading the engine blew out and transmission failed reviews.",1

Freezing cold winter, and humid summers. My Renegade handles it all. There is body tilt, typical of a jeep. The transmission does shift frequently,  but it was designed to. I have no problems with expressway on and off ramps, nor lack of confidence in passing. I have a Dodge Durango R/T, it's big and fast. I didn't buy a big and fast Jeep. I bought a fully capable Renegade, it has exceeded all of my expectations of a dependable safe Wisconsin driver.

2860, on 05/12/17 14:01 PM (PDT),Cathy M. ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Limited 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Brand new 2016 already in shop for repairs!," Bought the car brand new and within 2 weeks it's already in the shop (Russell Westbrook in Van Nuys, CA).  I noticed the steering wheel and driver's seat were vibrating more than I thought they should when I test drove.  Within 2 weeks of ownership I started the car and it was shaking so badly as though it wasn't getting any gas.  It's now been in the shop 8 days.  I'm told it needs a new PCM (the ""brains"" of the car).  Nice!  No known reason why it failed according to Tech.  So if there is an diagnosed underlying issue (rather than a PCM having been damaged when installed or manufactured), it can repeat and stall/cut off on me ANYWHERE ANYTIME...including at night, miles away from home, on a highway at high speed, etc.  Took several days for the part to come in.  Finally did and car still sitting another 1 1/2 days so far.  Additionally, I noticed immediately when I was driving along a long sweeping curved highway, the steering wheel lost ALL tension feeling 100% loose.  This reoccurred several times.  I called the service dept at the dealership (West Valley Chrysler Jeep) and inquired of Tech Casey, who responded he never heard of this and told me next time I came in they'd check it out.  Obviously, unconcerned.  Well, that would sound concerning to me!  I then asked if it might be the lane assist feature?  He responded that could be.  Now I'm reading otherwise on the forums.  You'd think a tech should know.   So...once the PCM issue is resolved, they'll move onto the steering wheel issue, plus other issues I've already had 2 weeks owning this NEW car, including very poor gas mileage, car speaker issue of low volume in hearing a caller, driver's passive door lock not working, and leather seat on the side of the driver's car seat already having creases in it, likely the result of sitting outside on dealer's lot with windows rolled up in hot CA sun for weeks.  Re: gas mileage: I previously rented a Renegade Latitude for 2 days and drove to the South Bay and back to the San Fernando Valley 8 times (4 round trips) before needing gas.  With this new Limited, additional gas needed after much fewer miles.  Issues during the purchase process:  Very rude and incompetent staff, no follow through.  Nick Ellis was my main sales rep at West Valley CJ .  After giving me the dealership's ""final"" price, I left to consider it.  When I told Nick I was leaving to think about it he didn't even bother raising his head to acknowledge me, though he was certainly VERY friendly when I arrived, including a handshake.  Tip to dealership:   A customer should always be treated as graciously and kindly as they were initially greeted when they exit the dealership, regardless of why they are leaving.  The main issue with the deal causing me hesitation (which I explained ad nauseam to each dealership rep who approached me) was the car came  preloaded with options I would not have selected, driving the price up.  Other issues: Dealership won't let you test drive on freeway (the steering wheel issue may have been discovered at such time) and prefer you only take 1 lap around the block on a test drive - I got attitude when I requested more, which I did; a sales rep told me I wasn't being ""honest"" with him because I wasn't giving him a time frame by which I would make my decision AND he said his manager was mad at him and he could not help any other customers until I had made a decision - seriously?  Lastly, another sales rep (Kevin) saw my fiance and I leaving and asked what it would take to make the deal happen, the price was reduced a little bit more, I then asked Nick for a new Financial Disclosure sheet and he literally YELLED at me and accused me of going behind his back (I did not, Kevin approached us as we were getting into my car), grinding them down, and told me flat out he'd rather hold onto the car and sell it to someone else rather than let it go at that price.  (And let's keep in mind, the car broke down 2 weeks after purchase...I wish he had sold it to someone else!)  Finance Manager Jorge doesn't return calls or e-mails.  Couldn't get confirmation he received the mandatory proof of insurance on a new car, despite multiple calls/e-mails.  He also printed out a DMV form with incorrect sales price, which I caught.  Took multiple calls and involvement of GM for a copy of the hand corrected form, plus almost 1 month later he still hasn't sent over paperwork to Theftpatrol so I can register.  FCA and Russell Westbrook can't seem to coordinate on my rental with Enterprise, etc., etc., etc.  I'm sure I can think of more crap if I keep thinking (or review all my massive notes at this point).  Nightmare purchase, dealership follow through non-existent, sold a car that malfunction from the start, GM Eric never bothered to check back with me knowing the car malfunctioned just after purchase and was towed into Russell Westbrook, repair service slow - car sits for days.  Look at Yelp reviews...",1

2862, on 04/25/17 14:31 PM (PDT),A.S. ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Latitude 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),From monster Dodge to baby Jeep," I have driven large SUVs since 1998. All of my children are out of school except for a 15yr old. I really had no need for large anymore but I love driving an SUV. I blew the engine in my Dodge and I was looking for a replacement. The dealership gave me this Renegade to drive until I decided on something and I fell in love with it. The size of it (the visual) kind of threw me off for awhile but the performance won me over. It has just the right amount of gadgets, comfort, gas mileage and maneuverability that I wanted. I just went through winter with it and it did awesome in the snow. I have the cold start package on mine and LOVE it! The warm steering wheel...oh my heaven! One thing that bothered me is that it has a hard shift to 1st but it doesn't bother me much now that I know it is a normal trait. It is not a 4x4. I am a big outdoors person so I took it to where we off road with our lifted Jeep and I was quite impressed with the way it climbs and handles, absolutely fun on gravel roads. It is low so I have to watch for the deep ruts. If I were to buy again, I would go with a lift on it just because of my lifestyle. It hugs the road and just drives really well. All in all, it is fantastic. If I had to pick something out that I didn't like it would be that on long drives the arm rest and door arm rest are too far away from steering to provide any rest to the arms. My daughter plays multiple travel sports, softball being one of them and even though the cargo area is small, it still fits all of our tournament gear, chairs, tent, wagon, cooler and all.",5

2867, on 03/23/17 11:26 AM (PDT),John Cuson ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),A blast," --Update to reflect winter driving, April 2018--I live in NW Indiana, in the lake effect zone from Lake Michigan.  We did not have the snow that Erie had, but it still set a record for this area.  The Renegade handled it very competently.  There are a few tricks one has to learn, the extra resistance created by the snow and the small piles left by snow plows require more gas to spin up the turbocharger a bit, but that's just part of learning the car.  The ability to lock the 4x4 into snow mode was especially useful in town in this regard, the extra bit of predictability is useful.  I made a number of trips along a road that is subject to drifting for a considerable distance.  Those used to snow country will be familiar with having moderate drifts along one side pull the car into the drifts.  The snow mode negated that concern, I could run with the right side in moderate drifts  with the left side on the road with no noticeable pull, and this with the very average stock 16"" all-season tires that came with my relatively bare-bones Latitude.  It's not a Trail Hawk, but I didn't want that.  The winter did decrease gas mileage somewhat between running locked into 4x4 and the general increased resistance, but not by that great an amount.  It's a light car, and so different that driving a 4x4 F-250, but still effective.--August 2017--Over six months in now, and still very much enjoying the car.  Driving has been heavily oriented toward country roads, and the mileage reported by the on-board system has been steadily climbing, even with steady use of the air conditioning.  The torgue-heavy 1.4 allows a wide range for gears above first, which is probably much of the reason for that.  My original review has a minor error, saying that I could accelerate up a moderate hill in 6th at 40mph, in reality it was 5th, and it would be more accurate to say that I could feel the engine pulling the car up rather than bogging down.  No real problems with the fit and finish, the car is still a blast, can be driven economically but has the power to merge easily.  My one complaint is that the window tint for the front part of the cabin is very slight.  I have found myself running the air conditioner on a 66 degree F sunny day when I wanted to leave the windows up.--ORIGINAL REVIEW--First, recognize that I've had the car for 6 weeks, so longer-term aspects of ownership are not covered here.  My review will be largely experiential.  I'm 65, and  I wanted a car that was fun to drive and practical, and I don't know that I could have done a better job.  The 6-speed is easily managed, and the little engine growls, with an impressive amount of torgue.  I experimented at 40 mph going up a moderate hill in the snow in 6th, and the car was able to accelerate.   Gets into the illegal territory quickly.    I've had the opportunity to drive the car on dry roads and snow/slush, and it handles both well.  I like the ability to lock the car in 4wd, having had a scary experience several years ago with a CR-V that decided to kick in the rear wheels when I was not expected it.  The car will run find on regular, but really shines with premium.  Mileage with premium is sufficiently better that if it were still at a 20 cent premium it would actually be more cost-effective.  The current 50 cent premium makes driving a little more expensive, but I manage to talk myself into it.   As the car is relatively short and a 4 door, the door opening is on the small side, but navigable.  If you're having the urge to have fun but can't afford to commit money for a summer car, this is a good bet.",5

The Renegade seemed to fit that mold pretty well. Having tried it out a few times I will say the 4x4 works pretty well. Yet the daily driving is mediocre at best. The acceleration is very lackluster until you get pretty high in the revs and when you do hit the throttle you get everything or nothing. There is no linear power, just on or off, which is probably why the gas mileage is pretty bad. I have made a few road trips with this vehicle and on highway it is fine but for my daily city driving, I seem to be getting 20 mpg tops which is WORSE THAN THE TRUCK I USED TO OWN...

I would not spend the money again for Beats audio upgrade.  Two features that there are no excuses for the lack of availability are power lift gate and Homelink. The sunroof needs a glass roof option but the MYSKY removable panels are nice. gas mileage is not what I hoped for considering the lack of real power in 2.4L engine.

We had a Subaru Cross-Trek but it was a dog, no uumph whatsoever, even with the 5 speed. We test drove our Renegade with 1.4l Turbo engine and 6-speed standard transmission and were blown away, bought the vehicle on the spot. It has plenty of get up and go...up hills, passing on windy two-lane roads (we drive in the mountains quite a bit) and accelerating well in 4th or 5th gear (e.g. no need for down-shifting to pass most of the time) We've had it off-road, it's rugged  but comfortable. It has great ground clearance and we can launch our sailboat much more easily than with our Subie or, earlier, Compass and RAV4. Sound system is great, navigation, sun roof, storage...all more than satisfactory. This is truly the best SUV we've owned out of about 5 dating to 1987. We see the Renegade as a marvelous hybrid of Fiat/European sophistication in engine and drive-train coupled with Jeep utility and fun.",4
2881, on 11/01/16 10:30 AM (PDT),June Conway ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),"great value, fun to drive, a few minor faults"," I have driven my Renegade 500 miles at this point and find I am loving it more than I expected.  I had eliminated most models and was down to the Renegade or a Subaru.  I am short (5'2"") and found that with the Subaru's in order to put the clutch to the floor with my short legs it required me to be right on top of the steering wheel.  With Renegade I can put the clutch to the floor without being right on top of the steering - maybe that is due to the excellent design of the telescoping and adjusting steering wheel.  With the manual transmission the Renegade is plenty peppy. I have seen lots of reviews stating they have not been able to replicate the sticker EPA.   My sticker said 24 city, 31 highway, average 27.  I am exactly 27.5 at the moment.  The Renegade looks like a cute little toy in my mind (probably because I am used to my crossover which seems to be twice the size) and the design features are fun - my teenagers especially like them.  The heat/air conditioning controls are intuitive and easy to use without taking your eyes off the road.  The dashboard is visually easy to follow. The radio entertainment system is likewise easy to use and my Latitude comes with a free year of Sirius XM radio for added fun.  There are both USB and Bluetooth connections.  I have chosen to dedicate an MP3 player with all my favorite music connected via USB permanently and have had a few glitches trying to work this out.  I think it is finally working but it has been a little frustrating at first.  The bluetooth with my Windows phone works fine for calls but I also use my phone with Cortana for hands free texting and so far this has an odd glitch.  It can totally understand my voice when dictating the text, but it can't seem to understand my command to send the message.  Likewise it can't understand my voice when I command it to read a message.  Their hands free texting requires a subscription to UConnect.  I am used to attaching my phone to a car vent holder in the center panel and attaching a charger, but the center vents in the Renegade are recessed in such a way that the charger doesn't fit.  I'll have to look at finding a new phone holder that extends out farther than my current one.  The backseat doesn't have cupholders so this was actually almost a deal breaker for us since I have kids and we are often eating on the run.  However I did find some ""Faguan"" cupholders that attach to the headrests and are able to holder even the giant drinks from McDonald's, so I am hopeful this will solve the problem.  I had also expected many more USB/charging ports.  Again, with kids in the back seat, they are always fighting to charge their technology - especially on road trips.  I had to buy a few extra long chords and splitters to solve this problem.  Speaking of road trips - that might be difficult with the size of the trunk.  Every day grocery shopping will be fine.  And if I am hauling something without passengers in the back there is plenty of room if the seats are down.  But otherwise I find the trunk small and wish it were another foot deeper.  I may end up fudging a shelf as I've seen some people do online because there is plenty of height storage - just not floor storage.  The trunk claims to already be ""two level"" where first there is a pump/sealant system rather than spare tire in a styrofoam holder, then a top carpet, then maybe 4-5"" or so (I didn't measure so that's a guess) and then the floorboard.  You can pull the floorboard out and place it down right on the carpet and eliminate that smaller 4'5"" storage space if you wish.  I personally did not feel comfortable with not having a spare tire so paid the extra $360 for a spare tire, jack, and tools which, when I receive it, will end up replacing the space where the pump and styrofoam holder are.  The dealer told me  they aren't sure when it finally comes in if it will fit completely within the same space as the styrofoam holder or if, in addition, it will eat up that 4'5"" storage area.   Speaking of small, the gas tank is small 12.7 gallons so more stops at the gas station.  Steering is tight and shifting is easy.  In fact almost too easy - there is an electronic emergency brake (strange) which doesn't work to do hill starts on extreme hills.  Instead, they built in a ""hill assist"" so you don't roll.  Kind of takes some of the skill out of it for me.  Nonetheless it is so fun to drive I have forgiven them.  Paradoxically the vision is both excellent and horrible.  The view out the front windshield is awesome (at least for my height - taller people may be blocked by the mirror) but the front side has horrible blind spots.  The back sides are the worst blind spots - overcome when backing up by using the camera BUT in New England we have intersections where roads can join at less than 45 degrees and if you are looking over your right shoulder to see oncoming traffic you cannot see at all.  Seats are comfy.  Cute style.  Overall high fun factor.",4

I have had it into the dealer repeatedly and the issues are still not resolved. I have a rattle in the drive shaft that vibrates my whole car. It literally bogs down and vibrates until it decides to shift. But this is apparently normal for a new Jeep Renegade. Moving onto the safety issue. While making a roll stop, when I go to push my gas pedal down to go, it simply does nothing but roll onto the road I am trying to turn on. Thank goodness I did not pull out in front of anyone because I would have been smashed. This has happened more than once and also to my husband that thought is was just my driving. But he had to eat his words when it happened to him. The dealer says its nothing but it should be a major concern since this could cause an accident. Time will tell. I highly recommend NOT purchasing a Jeep Renegade.  There are better made cars out there with WAY less problems. Oh yeah, my heated front seat has gone out as well but that is just a minor issue compared to others. But it is still NEW and should NOT have any issues. I bought a new Nissan Juke in 2012 and did NOT have one problem with it. Very, very disappointed.",1
2885, on 10/02/16 16:03 PM (PDT),DCoutdoorsGirl ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Latitude 4dr SUV 4WD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),I LOVE THIS CAR!!!!," I did what most of my family and friends would describe as an insane amount of research before I purchased this car.  I had a 2009 Ford Escape, which I absolutely LOVED and bought when I first moved down here to DC 5 years ago.  A co-worker offered a good price, and I wanted 4WD so enough said, I needed a new car.  I opted for the Renegade after I saw about 7 hours of reviews on YouTube and took into consideration the size for living in the city, and the capabilities for when I won't live here anymore.  It looks terrific at off-roading and is a nice, boxy shape, even a bit smaller than my Escape.  I don't like the swoopy new SUV's that really aren't adventure-capable.  The Latitude 4x4 was in the price point I needed, including all the features I wanted (power sunroof, heated seats (and steering wheel!), temp spare tire).  The slightly smaller size is better for street parking for the time being, and the back-up cam is a pretty sweet feature.  Although I only bought the car yesterday, I wanted it enough to fly up to Boston to get it (from DC) and I drove it down here last night and spent all day in it today.  All 8 hours yesterday were comfortable, and the windshield rain sensors are incredible.  It was super safe driving in the dark on the highway in the rain.  An avid camper, hiker, and adventurer, I know this car will handle everything I need: Assateague over-sand days at the beach, and winter camping in Pennsylvania snow-covered forests.  I will update this review after I've done a few of those activities.  DISCLAIMER:::  In my ""insane"" research and in chatting with a few people I saw on the street with a Renegade, I gathered that the automatic transmission lacks mojo on the pickup.  That's why I opted for the manual / stick shift.  I have had ZERO problems with that getting from Boston to DC and dealing with ridiculous DC drivers.  It's quite zippy.  The fuel economy is about the same as my 4cyl. 2wd Escape, which is really nice because I do commute to my job every day, and it's nice to know that for my weekend adventures I won't be blowing through cash on gas.  Overall the Latitude 4x4 is packed with what I'd call Varsity features for a pretty good deal.  If anyone else is ditching an old Escape looking for a new adventure vehicle and doesn't have a $50K budget for a Grand Cherokee, the Renegade is seriously worth considering.  I did consider buying a used Grand Cherokee and still opted for the new Renegade.  The features and the newness for the same cost are totally worth it.",5
2886, on 09/30/16 21:18 PM (PDT),Cerito ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Limited 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 9A),My First SUV," I always bought a 6 cyl sedan and once a turbo 4.  The performance of this engine took some getting used to but I have learned how to drive it to my liking. One thing is floor it, and when it drops into passing gear I let off the gas pedal 1/2 the way.  The car seems to perform best that way when I want a burst of speed. It's fun to drive around town.  Has good take off, and good breaks. Road trips are not as enjoyable (driving) as the sedan's I've had due to lack of power. My cars are always above 250 hp. But I'm only on the freeway about 4 times a year for trips over 2 hrs. Steering is pretty good, definitely not the worse I've had.  Gas millage is not as good as I expected but, as I said, I've had 6 cylinders and around town Jeep is better than the sixes. On the road maybe same or possibly worse. My Accord with a 6 cyl could do as well as 38 mpg if I milked it but it had cylinder deactivation.  I miss Android Auto and feel the UConnect Nav is slow at start up.  My FWD Jeep has all the tech bells and whistles (lane sense plus, fwd collision plus, rain sensing wipers (I love those), park assist Beats Audio and climate control.  Beets needed a dealer software update before it sounded worth the money. Now it sounds great. I've had no other problems. Everything works though I may decide to turn some off now that I've experienced it for a month.   I am definitely not unhappy with my Jeep.  One other thing, This car has written power train break in instructions.  I followed the break in directions to the letter and I don't experience the tranny or engine problems others claim.  I had to be neutral in a lot of my ratings since I've only owned for one month.  04/2018 Car has faithfully started. Never had a problem. It's a subcompact, so the ride is a little bouncy or nimble.  It's a fun car to run around the city in.  It's easy to park.  As I get older, I will exchange it for something that rides the road smoother, a cushy cruiser.  But it's a fun car to own.  City acceleration is good.  I would buy it again.  Ohhhh - It has a high content of Made in America like the engine and transmission as well as parts.  I looked at a GM car and 80% was made in China!!! It has American amenities like lighted window buttons.  A Toyota I once had didn't.  I missed them a lot in that Toyota.  I've owned two Asian cars, Kia and Toyota.  Never again!!!",4

Getting on highways and trying to pass on highways.  This excellent car should have a little more power. I finally could not live with it.  Traded it in for a Jeep Cherokee Overland with V6 engine and every safety feature.  I love Jeeps but the Renegade engine is lacking in any pickup and even hesitates to downshift when you need it.  European versions have six different engines to choose from, Diesel, turbo etc.  Why not America?   Goodbye My Sand Baby.Update 3/20/17.  So far not one problem with the Renegade.  Getting a little over 25 miles per gallon.  Very happy with this purchase.Mojave Sand exterior with Bark, Ski Grey and Tangerine interior.  Wow!  I fell in love with this Jeep at first glance.  The 2015's had a lot of bad reviews and problems.  So I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they have worked them out of the 2016 model.  So far the only negative is the smaller gas tank, I guess to save weight.  This summer with the air conditioning on all the time in Tucson area, I'm consistently getting 24 MPG.  Not too bad, not great.  However, the fun factor of this car makes up for that in spades.  This is the first smart car that understands my voice, makes tele calls, changes channels, etc. with no problem.  The navigation system map is so much better than my former 2015 Nissan Rogue (which never understood a word I said).  I love sitting up high, lots of headroom, plus big windows.  I have always loved Jeep seats and these are no exception.  The Nissan seats were very short in depth leaving no support for your legs.  The Renegade in long enough it supports my legs to the knees and I'm almost 6 feet tall.  The transmission needs a little getting used to but once you get the hang of controlling it, it's fine.  So far I'm very happy with this Renegade.",5

Engine is peppy enough to get me where I'm going and I haven't experienced any of the transmission shifting issues some other have said are annoying.

There is a lot of attention to detail and driving down the road it is more unique than the average ride. The tail lights are bright and stick out so it is good reassurance on feeling I will not be rear ended. The Latitude is a lot more quiet than I thought it would be. It handles very well and I look forward to driving it this winter. If I had to point out any downfalls it would be that the transmission takes a few seconds too long to go into first. The head rest is also a bit far forward for my liking.,5
2891, on 09/13/16 23:50 PM (PDT),Andrew Egan ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Justice Edition 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Love my Dawn of Justice," First new car I have bought in over 23 yrs. After making ur deal, be prepared for dealer add ons that can cost as much as $9300.00.  The warranty on Jeep is really bad. For the price u pay, u dont get much quality assurance from jeep. The cheaper cars have much better warranties. The jeep rides great, and very comfortable with all the options they have to offer. I still have not used all the options, nor have I learned to use all of them, just one at a time. Even though I am enjoying the ride of the new Jeep, I really was not satisfied with the dealer, and I only had the jeep for 2 weeks, I have no idea if any thing the dealer told me will be backed up, as in 4 free oil changes, and if the warranty is any good, bc I had trouble with warranties before.  BTW, there are only 2 features of this jeep I dont like, small but aggravating. Fuel tank panel does not lock, and inside, no room to easily hook up the seat belt. Really, 2 bad designs, but not a  major factor. Update: I hate the security system. Sometimes I like to lock up without using the security to save on battery, but to do this, it is a pain. I would like just to lock from one door and all is locked, like other cars. Also, lights r always on (when engine is running). Headlights or running lights, dont matter, something is always on draining the battery. If the battery charging system gets weak due to time, looks like I will be needing a tow. Now, I am not crazy abt the warranty repairs. They cant find a problem with the jeep, in the electronics part, and if the ydo find the problem, they will NOT give me a loaner car, if I need to leave it over night, on the factory warranty",3

I had this WITH ALL THREE of the new Jeep Compasses that I owned BUT ONLY WHEN ONLY THE REAR WINDOWS WERE OPEN(only the rear windows open at one time).   The driver's manual even noted this; that you could adjust the window level of openness to ''try'' to correct this problem.   It is a MAJOR PROBLEM when it is happening with the front driver's window ONLY OPEN.   The fan/air conditioner/heat cluster is DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE PASSENGERS ''LEFT KNEE''.   I did not notice this until I had a passenger in the Jeep with me.  The passenger seat bottom is ''half'' directly IN FRONT OF THE fan/air conditioner/heat control cluster.  My 2016 Jeep Latitude has NO CUP HOLDERS IN THE BACK SEAT.  The 60/40 split back seat has no cup holder when one side is folded down.  The ONLY STORAGE foe maybe a ''small''water bottle is in the rear door pocket and that is on an angle tilted. The vehicle HAS NO SPARE TIRE but a ''fix kit'' that won't do any good on a ''blow out'' tire.   In the hatch there is a top level storage and under that a Styrofoam storage tray that is ''worthless'' when you get a flat tire. The seat fabric reminds me of BURLAP; COARSE,SCRATHY, STIFF and hard. The drivers seat is SOFT AND SPRINGY AND BOUNCY.  When you make ''LEFT'' turns the seat bottom ''gives'' too much and colapes.  I parked in a parking lot to unload some papers for recycling and there was a storm sewer drain. The  Renegade was on a downward slop and the hatch would not open; after sever attempts the hatch finally opened with a piece of plastic breaking off on the hatch AND a screw falling out from somewhere.   I am Not Happy with my purchase.  I miss my Compass Latitudes EXCEPT FOR THE M.P.G'S. I NEED a vehicle with BETTER M.P.G'S",3

Drove her home about 100 miles after picking her up and used a quarter tank and averaged 30MPG, but still breaking in. Ride was very quite and comfortable. The steering is tight, but very nimble. The MySky sunroof is really cool as well, power sunroof, but you can remove the panels as well to open up the whole top, really ahead of its time. Remember this is Fiat , so it is Italian made. So far there is really nothing that has me really disappointed  , very happy with it so far.",5
2898, on 08/12/16 14:19 PM (PDT),Matt ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Sport 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Could have been better," I enjoy my Renegade, but it just seems to be lacking a little bit in nearly every area besides the infotainment system. First off I got a great deal on mine, well below MSRP with an extended warranty, my payments are right where I want them, and its overall affordable. Comfortable ride overall, front seats are comfy, nice support, and feel nice and of good quality in general. Headroom is in abundance. Back seat isn't too bad if you are not as big as I am(5'10, 220lbs), HOWEVER, if you have a rear facing car seat, the fit is EXTREMELY tight. I have a Graco click connect that just clicks into a base that doesn't leave the car, since I am as big as I am I have the front seat pushed all the way back, this causes the car seat to just barely get in. Rear seats however do fold down nicely and easily for extra cargo space if needed. Trunk cargo is meh, I can fit groceries in it no problem if I am not picking up my usual 35lb bag of dog food that day. The mileage is horrendous. I purchased the 6 speed manual due to the complaints I read about the auto on numerous sites, est. 24/31 MPG with the 1.4 Turbo 6spd. yeah, 24/31 if you push it 1/4 of the way there. If I drive cautiously and slow I can get 21.8mpg according to the dash readout, however when I do the math myself it is more like 20.2 MPG, freeway MAYBE 28, MAYBE! I reset my MPG and mileage counter on the freeway going 65 in a 65MPH zone so it was fresh, no shifting, no accelerating or braking, I was getting 28MPG on the dot, not 31. I watched my current MPG and it was around 28, if I went 55 in a 65, I would get the quoted 31. So whoever did the testing for the sticker mileage is in my opinion a jackass. First to second gear feels extremely sloppy, to make sure it wasn't mine I went to another dealer and test drove 3 more, all same issue, 1st to 2nd sloppier than a soup sandwich, 2-3, 3-4, and so forth nice and smooth, on all of them that I drove. For a 1.4L turbo, it just seems way lacking in performance for the mileage I get, It isn't bad, but I am sure there are quite a few better options out there. So you might be asking why did I buy this damned thing? Well, its ride is smooth, it was in my price range, insurance was cheap, it does every job I need it to do, all the stuff I wanted and none of the stuff I didn't. Like navigation, heated seats, leather(in AZ, yuck!), 4x4, none of this I didn't want and it was hard finding one that had bluetooth, BU camera, USB, cloth, white with non black interior, and a manual without those things. What would I improve on this car? Extra 2-4"" legroom in front AND back seats, extra few inches in trunk, a smoother 1-2 gear shift, honest mileage ratings. Best part about this vehicle? Interior is AMAZING! Infotainment system is extremely easy to use, easy to set up, easy to adjust things on the fly, steering wheel controls only make it 10 times easier.   UPDATE 8/13/2018: The mileage has increased to about 26.4 where half is freeway half is city driving. The vehicle so far seems to be pretty durable and reliable. The shift from 1-2 is still sloppier than a $2 whore. Still believe that a couple extra inches of legroom is needed.",4
2899, on 07/25/16 12:41 PM (PDT),Blane ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Justice Edition 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl 9A),It's good enough for Bruce Wayne...and me.," Most of the reviews I've seen have been completely unhelpful to anyone. It seems as if many people were expecting diesel gas mileage and a powerhouse engine. It's a 2.4L 4-cylinder engine. The sticker clearly stated 21-29 mpg. So far it looks to be on the mid to high side of that range. I bought this for myself at the same type as buying my wife a 2016 Cherokee 75th Anniversary. She wanted the luxury, I wanted fun and sporty. This Batman-themed Jeep came fully loaded with a Power/Manual SkyView moon roof, 6.5"" UConnect system equipped with Navigation, Rear Backup Camera and all the bells and whistles (wi-fi as well). Multiple USB ports were a welcome sight. The design of the windows makes for fewer blind spots than I had expected (also included window tinting). The rear legroom is not nearly as poor as people make it out to be and the seats are extremely comfortable. The steering wheel is tilting and telescoping and has a great feel to it. This Jeep handles smoothly and hugs the road very well. A couple of nice added bonuses that I didn't expect but will likely get some use are the inclusion of the towing package as well as the Jeep being 4&4 (snow, sand, mud).

NOT SO FAST, as i gained confidence with the Car and the gravel Road, i started enjoying the daily commute on the Gravel and so the Car started Drifting around some curves... it was really fun to do so, but then, one day, with surprise, even with the ESC OFF, as i was drifting and controlling a slide, all of a sudden the ESC self activated and steered the Car in the direction where i was Counter Steering, thus sending me in the opposite direction of the turn i was taking: THAT WAS SCARY! /The Rental place stated it could have been a side effect of the Vibrations from the Gravel Road, which may have confused the 'G sensor', so they suggested me to try one of the other driving modes and see if this bad behavior continues. /Unfortunately changing Mode didn't solve it, it only changed how quickly the system self activates and how it acts despite the fact the Display says that the ESC is OFF: one time as i was testing other driving modes, the Car almost threw me into a Ditch. I got furious with it. WHY CAN'T I TURN OFF THIS FEATURE, and why does the Display lie and say it is OFF when it is still ON??? - - - I AM NOT BUYING THIS GAS DRINKING DEATH TRAP!!!",3

I liked the way it looked and it was very comfortable. Lots of interior room for the front seats. I did not sit in the back. Cargo area was small, but after all it is a small vehicle so i didn't expect it to be huge. Transmission was weak. It had these dead areas and hesitations when you accelerated. It did shitf smoothly during normal driving and when you didn't punch it.  We had the larger of the 2 engines which wasn't enough. It accelerated okay but it was whimpy sounding. It zipped instead of roared. I like a big beefy motor with lots of power. My other 2 vehicles are v8's. If this had some muscle behind it or a stick shift it would be better. Gas mileage was good averaging in the mid 20's per gallon. That's good for me because my Chevy truck and Jeep WJ both get in the low teens. Ha ha. But this thing has a 10 gallon tank! Which means it seems like you go through more gas than you do, because you can't store much. Overall styling was great. We took it on the sand for a short trip and the 4x4 worked quite well. If i had air downed the tires , it would be very good. I like a lot about this vehicle but not enough to buy one at what they are selling for. Drop in a much larger 6 or small 8, clean up the shifting and lower the price. One could purchase a stripped down Wrangler for the price and do much better.",3
2905, on 07/01/16 10:56 AM (PDT),Laura W. ,2016 Jeep Renegade SUV Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Very disappointed," We bought my Renegade in August 2015, brand new off the lot. I have had it in the service dock 6 times since then. The last time it was there, I didn't get it back for 3 weeks. The customer service at the dealership was horrible. The brakes squealed horribly the first 2 months I owned it. Got that fixed and then I had a terrible ""Clicking, rattling, ticking"" noise coming from somewhere in the front end/steering column area when I would turn the wheel in any direction. I understand this is a first year model and they don't know what issues it will have, but the dealership would pull it in the dock, replace something and say ""It's fixed"". I would drive it home and have the same issues. So I would have to drive it back again and have them listen and look. That happened 4 times, with each time replacing something different. So my now ""brand new"" car has had parts replaced that didn't even need replacing. I am now currently looking into the Lemon Law to see what can be done. I am glad we purchased all the extra warranties, $33,000 and I haven't even been able to enjoy it. We own a 2009 Jeep Wrangler and also had a 1990 Jeep Wrangler and love(d) them. We consider ourselves to be a jeep family, but I will tell you this: I am not a Renegade fan one bit! Additional info more then a year and a half later: This car rattles like a tin can now! Still so unhappy with purchasing this car. Resale/Trade in value is HORRIBLE. But the good thing is I have detoured many people from purchasing a Renegade.",2

I fell in love with the Renegade when I saw it, it suited me and so I bought it. Less than a month later the steering wheel was off to the right when the vehicle was driving straight and when I tried to straightness the steering the vehicle went to the extreme left. Had to take it back for test drive and alignment. Less than two seeks later the air conditioner was not working had to take it back yet again, this time I had to leave it but it was repaired the same day. Now during this time I still had problems with the vehicle pulling to the left, the acceleration is horrible, at 55mph the vehicle dances for lack of a better word just have to hold on to steering really tight. Other drivers pulled up to me on two different occasions to tell me the vehicle was driving sideways. Now mind you everytime I took it to the dealership they said the problem was fixed. Only the A/C was really fixed nothing else. Took it back and the right back tie rod was bent, they were convinced that I backed into to something and caused the damage. I DID NOT. After a few hours of back and forth with the dealership and jeep I ended up paying over 400.00 for parts and repairs. The vehicle still runs crappie,  still pulls to the left, steering making noise while turning, steering locking while driving and at other times, acceleration is horrible ( while merging on to the thru way I almostill got rear ended because the vehicle would not move), it jerks when the gear changes which is randomly at times. In all I am fed up with this vehicle and am getting no where with jeep. They got my money, my business and my trust and now I am stuck with a bad product which may cost me my life or that of my child. Situation is bad and for a big organization jeep needs to do the right thing. Trust me they won't go bankrupt. 1/7/2017: Been to the dealership 9 times now, nobody really cares, the vehicle had ac fixed 3x, the acceleration problem still there,",2

I tried one out and loved it.  But when they didn't have the color I wanted they got it from another dealer.  When you turn it on it vibrates.  It vibrates in cruise and i am so unhappy at this point. a new vehicle should not vibrate at all.  it is a 2.4l engine not sure if that is part of the issue. I am so disappointed is anyone else haveing his problem? WORKING WITH THE DEALER BUT NO SUCCESS -6-24-18  I have now had this jeep for 2 yrs and the air conditioning unit has to be replaced.  It still Vibrates at times like it will shake apart - very disappointed.  The shifting of the engine is very poorly designed and too small for the Jeep.

It was handed down to me during senior year of HS in 2014 and has taken me from California to my current home in Chicago. Its been there through the good and bad of my life. The lack of traction control, ABS and 4WD means that it's fun to drive, especially in rain and snow.  We were pretty consistent with the maintenance and as a result, it has been as reliable, if not more than Japanese cars. The only things I can remember going bad were the A/C condenser (in the desert on the way to Vegas, ugh) the radiator, the rear window regulators (which are notoriously prone to failure in Libertys), and worn valve cover gaskets. Other than that, the engine and transmission is still running strong. The suspension is also holding up okay. A few interior bits are broken, worn or torn but thats expected in an American car of this vintage. If you can find a sub-200,000 or even a sub-150,000 mile example with a pretty decent maintenance history, then buy one. This car can last well above 200,000 or even 300,000 if taken care of.

I've heard many other Liberty owners complain of the same lousy mileage. Using 4x4 mode is even worse. Full size V8 pick ups get better mileage.  The four speed auto is reliable but needs more gears.

The A/C required a total replacement at 80,000 miles. Now at 90,000 miles the Check Engine Light indicates an electrical failure that causes the engine to rough idle. It is no fun to drive in the rain, even with all season tires the vehicle is unstable. The plastic wheel moldings are coming loose and separating from the body. We are constantly replacing screws and pins to keep the mud flaps on. Windshield washer has ceased to function.  Top fuel mileage is 18 MPG Highway. It guzzles fuel in the City. We have maintained this vehicle just as Jeep recommends since new.   We anticipated keeping this Jeep for at least 150,000 miles.

(7) Grand Cherokees that were all 4.0 Straight 6 Cylinder Engines, and all were Fantastic.   A 1993 went over 425,000 miles, a 1997 went 395,000 miles, and a 1998 went 385,000 miles.   The (2) Liberty's that I have owned have been Junk by comparison.  The 2002 was the better of the two.  But, I began experiencing various Electrical Problems relatively early on, by my mileage standards, which admittedly, might be higher than most.   The primary source of the Electrical Problems in both the 2002 and the 2008 Jeep Liberty is the ""TIPM"", (Totally Integrated Power Module), most would refer to this as the (Engine Compartment Fuse Box or a Power Distribution Center).  This is located right by the Battery on both models.   It is clearly a Manufacturing Defect.   It is the primary source of almost all Electrical Problems with the Jeep Liberty.   If you are having unusual electrical problems with this Jeep, take it directly to the dealer and demand that they check out the ""TIPM"".   Be Firm, as they will do everything in their power to deny the problem, and make any form of accommodation to you.   Chrysler is a Automaker that I will never deal with again.  I gave them every opportunity to address this problem, and they refused.   Some of the symptoms that I experienced, that were All Part Of The ""TIPM"" Malfunction were, Door Lock Malfunctions, Tailgate wouldn't Lock, Windshield Washer Motor wouldn't work, Vehicle wouldn't start when hot.  What I mean by Hot is not overheating, but rather driving normally and making a stop for gas, shutting off the engine, and trying to restart it, with no success.   The ""TIPM"" Malfunction will not allow current to flow to the starter, making it appear as if there was no available current at all.   And that's just part of the Electrical Problems with the 2008 Jeep Liberty.  There are other Problems too Numerous to Mention.  NEVER, NEVER AGAIN WILL I BUY A JEEP.  I could have not been a more Loyal Jeep Customer, and told everybody about my Excellent Jeeps of the Past, but Jeep/Chrysler has shown that they really aren't interest in retaining Long-Time Loyal Customers, but would rather find New Customers Instead........",2

There are too many quality cars available today to waste your time and money on this piece of garbage.  The engine and 6 speed manual transmission are pretty reliable, although poorly suited to the car.  The engine is not powerful enough, has a microscopic power band, and the ratios are just too long.  Below 3000 rpm there's no acceration, and above 4000 rpm it's only good for turning gas into noise.While the powertrain has been reliable, literally every other thing jeep attached to it has not been.  4wd has failed twice for electronics, wiper switches, window switches, door lock switches, airbag sensor, door sensors, gas tank won't fill (replaced twice), shift boot falls apart, seat trim falls apart, spare tire doesn't stay tight and knocks around, wheels seem designed to deliver pebbles to the brake pads, brake pads cannot be secured and rattle constantly, car won't restart when warm, exhaust flex joint cannot be secured and periodically disconnects, entire interior vent system had to be replaced when an internal seal melted and jammed the actuators, multiple hvac fans have failed (noisily), and the list goes on.  And on...I bought this car new with the lifetime powertrain warranty and lifetime maxcare.  Even at $50 per work order and paying $35-$50/day for rental cars while the jeep is in service, it cost me $2000 this year to maintain this POS.  I just dumped the thing yesterday...  I'd kept it for so long because I knew the warranty would protect me when something major failed...  but eventually it bacame clear that the major expenses were not likely to fail, and the car was milking me dry, a few hundred dollars at a times.  At one point this year, I had the car in for repair for three different unrelated issues in one week.  Each time I picked it up, I couldn't even make it back to the house before something else crapped out.  Another time it was in for service for two consecutive weeks, brought it home, and had something else fail the very next day.To wrap this up - do yourself a favor and don't buy this car.",1

The interior of the Liberty is chintzy at best. They are not built for comfort. If you read other reviews that complain about water leakage from the rear cargo area, they are absolutely right. The wiring harness at the top of the cargo door and the luggage rack both allow water to infiltrate and soak the carpet floor.  The brake assist is cool on slopes but not when you wish to accelerate in emergency situations. The tow package is great. Be careful not to engage the 4WD by accident. MPG is aweful!

When the semis pass you on snowing roads, keeping the windshield clear is essential.

That has helped the noise a ton but it is still pretty undesirable on the highway. No matter the weather, it seems like roof is just not well designed at all.

Before this I had driven a Rodeo. It feels a little more stable than the Rodeo, but the Rodeo had a lot more leg room for both the front and back seats. When you sit in the Liberty, your legs go straight down--you have little room to stretch out your legs, which could be frustrating during a long drive.  One of the first things I noticed was that it hardly has a dashboard. I also test-drove the Jeep Patriot, but that was a 4-cylinder and the steering wheel was disturbingly small.

Cheap plastic that scratches easily. The MPG sticker says 20 mpg on the hwy. True if you reset the gauge doing 55 mph on a flat low wind hwy. 16-17 mpg combined city/hwy is realistic. The drive train should have been updated with the rest of the Jeep. Same drivetrain as in the previous version/yrs.

I absolutely love the Sky Slider roof and always drive with it open, but when the roof is closed it does create pretty significant wind noise on the highway when driving 70-75 mph.

Its offroad capabilities are quite impressive too. Unfortunately, my particular vehicle is very unreliable. Its seems something always goes wrong no matter how much care goes into it.

3050, on 12/06/16 12:55 PM (PST),BritInPhilly ,2003 Jeep Liberty SUV Limited 4WD 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 4A),Good value if well looked after by previous owners," I have a 2003 Liberty with around 125k miles. It's been a good car for the last 18 months of ownership. It copes well with poor road conditions and has been really great in the snow. It's comfortable and the trunk space is pretty good too. My only gripes would be that the gas mileage is poor and the build quality is lacking in certain areas. The engine in these really needs regular oil changes to keep it in good shape and be wary of a Jeep that's been driven hard as it could end up being expensive. I've driven 15k miles over the 18 months and so far had to replace 2 window regulators (more on this later), as well as rotors all round and transmission solenoids. The window regulators are a pain and a common problem on these cars. They are badly designed and manufactured with cheap materials, so you're likely to be replacing at least one a year and finding yourself with a window jammed open at the most inconvenient times. The part is around $65 and it's a fairly simple job taking around 30 minutes to replace. Otherwise, expect to pay a garage $600+ for the replacement. The paintwork on these seems to suffer with peeling clear coat, particularly with darker colored cars and mainly on the roof. Mine's peeling but doesn't bother me so I'll leave it. Overall it's a good car and always feel solid and safe.*Update at 135,000 miles: Another window regulator at 130k miles, the O2 sensor went around the same time (which halved the average gas mileage down to around 9mpg)  and wheel bearings starting to rumble recently. I took the car in for an oil change and tune up and to get an estimate for wheel bearing replacement and a new AC compressor. The repair shop seem to want to dissuade me from pouring money into the car every time, which makes me nervous. The AC compressor was damaged when another car backed into the Jeep in a parking lot, so not a build quality issue. I figured out that I'm spending maybe around $1800 annually in repairs and maintenance over the last 2 years and, assuming I'm into the same over the next 3 years then I'd still say the car hasn't been bad value at all.",3

Should have been my first clue that someone got rid of a vehicle in great shape with only 65K - I spoke with the previous owner and they bought a new Escape.  Do not fill with gas unless you want a quart down the side of the car - EVERY FREAKING TIME - known issue - no recall.  Transmission works but shifting just isn't it's thing.  Research shows it was a FWD design used in the k-car and Neon modified for RWD - very light duty - DO NOT TOW with it even with the tow package.  The transmission and suspension are just to light - even with the tow package.  Suspension - wears out at 30-40 thousand miles.  Even on Jeep worshipper web sights they admit this and consider it ""normal"" maintenance to replace the struts  (front and rear) every couple of years.  Handling suffers (and this thing handles very poorly to begin with) and the ride height lowers as the springs age and wear - causing excessive wear on the insides of the front tires - ask me how I know.  Even with constant rotation 80K rated tires are shot in less than 30K miles.  The engine is a POS.  Metal in the oil at 70K that grew worse with every oil change.  Finally brought it to the shop (80K) hoping it was the timing chains (yes another usual problem).  Instead the rod bearings were wiped out-rest of the engine was fine - the shop was surprised at how clean it was (synthetic oil every 3000 miles praying it would last).  Replaced the Dodge engine with another used engine - sludge ruined it.  Replaced with a reman engine, manufacturing defects ruined it, now with 90K on the clock its on its FOURTH engine.   Even without the replacement issues its noisy, gutless and fuel hungry.   If you see a nice 2005 Liberty on CL with less than 100K don't buy it.",1

It's pretty small, but it is a compact suv. And it rides a little rough. But I like that, it feels tough to me. Gas mileage isn't great, but again, that's to be expected.

The first year, the engine had to be removed twice to replace valves, then had problems with transfer case.  Then, the rear-end differentials had to be replaced...not once, not twice, not three times, but ""four"" times.  The first three times it was covered by warranty, but not the fourth time.  I approached Chrysler for a replacement vehicle, but to no avail.  Chrysler is ignoring these problems, indicating they can do nothing.  I am definitely stuck with a lemon.

I bought it a year old with 29,000 miles. I too was skeptical because of the expert reviews, however the customer reviews were very positive and I was impressed on my test drives. Now that I have owned it for several years, this is by far the best vehicle I have ever owned. I have towed extremely heavy trailers and put it in places that I should not have been able to drive away from. It has literally saved my life a time or two.I have never had one thing go wrong with it. The 4 speed auto is ancient, but it is reliable. The 3.7 engine is the same way. Fuel mileage sucks, but you are paying for a capable SPORT UTILITY, not an SUV body on a Honda Fit. This was made to be a sport utility from the ground up. Only complaints I have: The backseat leg room is somewhat cramped, the front foot leg room is cramped, and the trip button on the steering wheel oddly only works half the time, however i just use the other trip button on the dash. Also, the fuel mileage but as stated earlier, it is expected.

We are 2nd owners and we bought it with about 35k on it. We just drove it with our kids from Boise to San Diego (and all over San Diego for a week) and are now 3/4 of the way home. This thing is built solid. Drives smooth and has done decent on gas. Below 80mph increases the mpg's. Best we have calculated was just under 22mpg. The transmission in this thing is incredibly smooth. Edmunds says the engine is sluggish, but I think it just isn't as jerky as some other motor/tranny combos. We love the exterior design and the way it drives. The full sunroof is really cool and a neat feature. I will say this; I am 6' tall and weigh about 250 and the driver's compartment does feel 'snug', so if you are much bigger than me, ya might want something a bit bigger. Overall, we are thrilled with it. I'm 47 and my wife is 6 years younger. We have 2 kids (9 & 4) and all of us love this car, so far.

They don't live in Colorado. The Liberty has adequate power to get you on I-25 on long on ramps. It is good in city traffic on acceleration. The 4 speed transmission may be outdated, but the newer 7 + speed transmissions on newer Jeeps like the Renegade or Cherokee (not the Grand) designed by Fiat have problems, beware. The 4 speed transmission on the 2012 Liberty is very reliable. Sure it is not a luxury vehicle, but you don't live in it. It is good overall despite it's fuel economy, but most 6-8 bangers don't get that well of gas mileage, especially the Toyota 4-runners, which the Jeep Liberties are supposed to be matched to, not like the Rav-4 or other wimpy crossovers that use 4 bangers. Car critics don't know what they are talking about because they don't own the vehicles they test. It is just their opinion. Talk to ones who own the Liberties and uses them. You will not find very many Jeep liberties on the used car lot. Many are keeping their jeeps.",4

We wanted something that did 3 things. Could go off-road on some fairly tough trails, could tow a camping trailer, and can still be used as comfortable daily driver. The Liberty does all three very well. We have had it a month now, and find it to be very comfortable to drive, quiet on the highway, maneuverable, great in the snow, and though early perfectly reliable. The Limited has a nice leather interior and other nice to have features like power seats, bluetooth, etc. We strongly considered Xterra, FJ Cruiser, Wrangler, and 4-Runner.

It's an 07' model and in three months of ownership I've had my jeep into the dealership four times for repair to the power windows...specifically the Drivers side window but I've had problems with the passenger window as well. It appears that the issue is not with the dealership making the repairs, but with Chrysler supplying inadequate window regulators and plastic parts that don't hold up. I've written Chrysler with my concerns and have not yet received a response. I'm wondering if others that have experienced these window issues have been able to get corrective action from Chrysler?

3294, on 04/11/09 23:39 PM (PDT),Jeep fan ,2007 Jeep Liberty SUV Limited 4dr SUV 4WD (3.7L 6cyl 4A),"Fun vehicle, needs improvement", Obviously the Jeep is geared for power not for mileage so any aftermarket improvements you can make will help the mileage.  Never use Goodyear tires as their rolling resistance is horrible.  20% of the Jeeps energy is wasted just on tire rolling resistance.  We use Michelin tires and that helps greatly.  A friend uses synthetic lubes throughout and a cold air intake by K&N.   The new Liberties are way to boxy and just don't seem to have the heart of the earlier Liberties... Others may disagree but that is my take.  With some aftermarket improved parts you will have a better performing vehicle with better gas mileage.,3.5

After 3 years the transmission started skipping.  At the 5 year mark,at about 75k miles, the pinion and bearing went bad, resulting in the entire rear end needing to be rebuilt.  The widshield washer system broke, and then the rear hatch door latch went bad.  Then the license plate lights started blinking on and off.  All in all in 6 years I spent about $5k in repairs, and things just keep breaking.  It is a total piece of junk.  I will never ever buy another Jeep.

3382, on 07/08/15 18:29 PM (PDT),Cindy ,2002 Jeep Liberty SUV Limited 4dr 4WD SUV (3.7L 6cyl 4A),Was a good vehicle until ...," ...the engine blew at 130,000 miles.  I really enjoyed driving my jeep and loved the room that it had. I took good care of it and had expected it to last a lot longer than what it did. Like I have read from so many others, my jeep  engine blew up at just 130,000 miles. There was no sign of an oil leak and I didn't notice anything out of sorts until one day it started to knock and the engine blew a rod. I had regular oil changes and maintenance at the jeep dealer here in my town. For all of you saying that those of us that had engine failure with our jeeps that we didn't take care of them, that is not true. The jeep engine has a flaw and the manufacturer should comp us for this. Having a vehicle fail at only 130,000 miles put me into major disarray as I have no family where I live or close and had to get to work daily which required bumming a ride and borrowing a friends car for a week until I could get a day (1 day) to find another vehicle to purchase.  I had to rent a car to go look at vehicles even. Hence now I have car payments again.  For as much as vehicles cost there is NO WAY that they should have engine failure at 130,000 miles.  Needless to say I went from an EXTREMELY proud and happy Jeep owner to an EXTREMELY upset and disgruntled undrivable jeep owner. I also had other issues that, as I have done research, find are very common and expected on my model of jeep. My power window motor stopped working and I ended up having to Duct tape it up so it wouldn't rain in my jeep. It was a back window that didn't get frequent use as I rarely had anyone sit in the back. I had bearing problems with some front end bearings, my leather front seats did not wear well at all, and now the recall for the gas tank , which I can't get my jeep fixed because I would have to pay a tow truck to take it to the shop. So now when I go to sell it for parts, or if someone wants to fix it up, the recall of the gas tank could be a major issue with selling it.  Such a shame to trust a ""respected"" brand and find out that lots of others have had the same issue and that the manufacturer will not make this right with us.  I will NEVER own another Jeep and have since changed completely from US made vehicles to foreign made.  My ratings are based on how the vehicle performed Before the motor blew up.  I would recommend anyone that wants to purchase a Jeep to reconsider7-13-2016I was asked to update my review,  the Jeep Liberty still sucks. Jeep should issue a recall for this issue of the motor blowing up at 130000 miles. Not signs of issues at all, just blew. DO NOT BUY A JEEP1-14-17- I was asked to update, jeep was sold for a measly  $800 . If it was dependable I would still be driving it today. Jeep should still cover faulty engines! !

We changed the oil and I had her check it every two weeks since the vehicle was new to her. She did as I said for a couple weeks and said it used none. She is very diligent at watching her mileage to plan oil changes ever 3000 miles. She went to work and the engine started to knock. She checked the oil and found it 3 quarts low and got no low oil warning. We took it to a shop and it needs a new engine. We found out no reputable salvage yard wants to sell the engine due to a known oil gear issue, so they will not even warranty one with low miles. A rebuilt motor with the oil gear issue fixed costs $3200.00. With labor my daughter is looking at $4500.00 to replace an engine with only 119000 miles. I searched the internet on 2002 Jeep Liberty 3.7 engine. I found many complaints regarding the blown motor. The average seems to be 96000 miles.

I replaced the A/C ($1,900) at around 180,000 miles and am just now retiring her after some larger issues with the ECM and oil leaks at 11 years old and 251,000 miles (I can't justify $1,500 in repairs on a car worth KBB of $3,000).  The vehicle is easy to drive and comfortable if you're not expecting a luxury car ride out of an SUV.  It has successfully crossed flooded areas over a foot deep and rough national park four wheel drive roads that other SUVs high centered on (and that's with 2WD, not 4WD).

I can understand the speed sensors but TWO (2) Head Cylinders is hard to justify!

Solution: i purchased $100 auxilary fule pump from napa and installed this.2) chrysler routed the crankcask venilation back into the tubo instake... Problem:  all oil vapers are condense in the intercooler and cause blockage of intercooler and cause engine to starve of air and smoke like hell due to wrong air/fuel mixture.  Solution: cost me $500 to have intercooler replaced. then install a hose to vent crankcase vapers to atmosphere.3) the fule filter is only 10 micron rating...not fine enough for the CRD injectors...Problem: fine particles pass right through the fuel filer and destroy the injector(s) Solution:  i had to purchase all 4 new idiesle injectors at $800 each ..YES!!!  $3200 for new injectors before tax and labor!!  AND ..chrysler is the only provider of these injectors because nobody else in america sells these parts!4) the engine threw a rod and punched hole in motor block and seized up at 151,000 miles.

As an off-road vehicle its great but the poor interior design, annoying squeaks from the dash and caveman engine, it's really not an overall good experience. I purchase the vehicle for the wrong reasons which at the time was off-road capability and looks.

This jeep is loaded everything you can get on it. Remote starter works but then can not shut off ac unless you turn car off and restart. dealer says hmmm never heard of that event though there are bulletins describing issues with remote start. second will not turn starter over unless it wants to and now won't turn at all after a week. have been told it is the tipm module failure 1200 dollars of course a bulletin stating it is a big problem. now guess what again tipm and they won't warrant it after 30 days only been 3 months. jeep less than 36000 miles on it.  I will never buy chrysler again. had a 2001 jeep wrangler was great. the new ones to much electrical problems. so now i have a 2013 jeep in driveway won't start. and the jeep place i brought it too is now fighting my credit card dispute. hmm wonder if they will when. already have yellow curved sticker on it saying Lemmon. and it will be sitting on trailer across street from jeep dealer for all to see.,1

I love this one too!  I can't believe how comfortable this Jeep is.  I traded in a fully-loaded Lincoln Navigator for this Jeep, and I honestly think this Jeep is more comfortable.  Of course I do not like leather seats, so that might be the whole reason I like this more!  It's comfortable, it drives great, it rides great, everything is right there where you need it (once you get used to the location of stuff).  I have three complaints:  1) I wish it came with a standard hood lock.  2) I wish it came with standard grab bars to haul your butt into the seat.  3) I wish the wind noise wasn't so loud.

I've wanted one forever( and considering I'm on S.S., it is) and glad I bought a 2013  Unlimited Sport in 2012.It has given me 25,000 trouble free miles. Not a single rattle ! Maybe because it's stock or because I don't beat on it like a juvenile - this is a very liveable day in and day out vehicle. Have driven it 400 miles in one day without fatigue and it handles just fine. The only times things get a bit rough are when the road traveled has frost heaves ,dips, etc. My 1991 Jimmy 4x4 road worse .I could use a bit more room( gave up a 12 year Odyssey for this), but no regrets. And,  along with the  great resale value , I'm driving a vehicle that always looks current ( with other Wranglers). When I decide to drop the top, it requires several minutes, but no biggie. Cool. Many friendly waves from other Wrangler drivers. The last time that happened is when I drove a Vette  back in the 70s.The only improvement I'd like to see on the restyled 2018 is a hatch glass for the softtop . The aftermarket has already done this, but my top is like new .",4

Take it to dealership get the light issue fixed, I thought... Then something in steer wheel goes wrong, meanwhile engine light is back on. When all is said and done, I'm up to 40,000. Miles now with same issues. Seems this model jeep has electrical problems. I know about 5 different people with jeeps that are having same issues. Mine ended costing 2000.00. Because right hand drive does not get bumper to bumper warranty.I just want to say to jeep reps, you need to have a recall on this electrical problem. Been to many complaints on that alone.

I bought this Wrangler used in 2002 with 27K and have loved every minute with it. It is rough to ride in, unrefined in almost every way and squirrely above 70 mph, but it's a Jeep and wonderful to take off road and on a Summer day with the top down and the doors off there's nothing like it. It's been fairly reliable, but I do take it off road, so it does get a work out. Some repair work, but it's not a money pit.",3.5

No major mechanical problems, just the normal wear of driving it over 200,000 miles.  It's not for the person who is looking for a quiet, smooth ride - it's a Jeep, it's built for fun and believe me it is.  I have tested it off road only a handful of time over the years and that is where a Jeep is at it's best.  Saw a couple of Hummers struggling through the same trails that I had no issues with.  Great in winter and fun in the summer.

Now I own my Jeep and I still keep turning my head over to see the different Wranglers passing by. But now I noticed that my Wrangler is looked at by every single driver and that makes me smile.

My mom has a Jeep Renegade Sport Trailhawk 2015 and ton of issues with the electronics; she also claims its a tougher ride then mineand her sound system sucks. She is getting a Wrangler after her lease is over. For the capability: In one of the biggest blizzards that hit the NYC area in Jan/ 2018,  I plowed through it like nothing, leaving behind big SUV's stuck in the snowbanks (lol SORRY!  You shoud have bought the Jeep fellas!). I am tiny 5'2""  young female so the only issue is me climbing into it. Everyone who is complaining about the comfort should stop complaining. Everyone who knew anything about the Jeeps knew it was not built for the city dwellers. My Jeep goes from snow to sand terrains; hauls 4-5 ppl and a big dog; snowboards, skees, and surfboards. And biggest thing of all is the safety! On two different ocassions two mature drivers decided to rear-ended my Jeep, and both had their cars totaled; mine had minor scratches on the rear bumper. This should be anyone's priority over the comfort and speed. Did I mention its cool? You can turn it into anything you want with custom parts, and Police will smile and thumb-up at you instead of chase you down for looking street-illegal. Best present my mom could have given me! Go get one!",5

My wife was completely against it since she loved the other SUV but I talked her into it and it's good that I did. Her Honda Civic seemed to have developed a crack in the engine block the week I bought this and she had to drive the Jeep while her car was getting a free engine from Honda. During the two weeks it had dumped about 2 feet of snow and she hadn't driven a manual that much in her life so for the first couple of days she really, really didn't like this Jeep and was very vocal about it. After that she started to like it and after her car was done I had to bribe her and pry the keys from her hands (she literally has a grip of a ninja!). The Jeep was used but in incredible shape with only 60K on it. The previous owner had put on a 2k winch front bumper,lights, side bars, 33 inch tires, 4 inch lift, nice winch and many many other custom parts. He also Rino coated the whole under carriage. I asked the dealer if it was possible for me to talk to him and they made it happen. Apparently him and his new wife were having a baby and she put her foot down and demanded a more responsible SUV for the family than the Jeep. He never took it off road and basically just liked to customize it. He said he put about 6k worth of stuff on it and was surprised I got it so cheap from the dealership. He looked sad to see it again actually. We've had it for about a year now and I've spent about 3k more on customized parts for it. I've had it off road for hunting and whatnot but not anything serious because I learned it takes all day to clean the thing after taking it mudding. After the 16 vehicles I've had in my life this is my favorite. It gets good mileage for what it is in town going to work, has plenty of room for the trips to Sam's Club and Home Depot, turns heads where ever it goes and is fun in the summer with the top off. It's very comfortable to drive for a 6'2 guy but also my wife who is 5'5. The only problem so far is fighting over who gets to drive it now. I would buy one again but to be honest I don't see us getting rid of this one unless some meat head wreaks into it or it get's stolen.",5

Since I live in Michigan we get alot of snow where I am. I heard a jeep is the way to go.  I test drove unlimted and rubicons 4 dr brands cuz that's the style I liked narrowed it down to a sahara unlimited since the rubicon felt like it bounced around way too much. I seen one at a dealership test drove it quickly because they were closing in an hr. I bought it that night drove it next morning to work it shook so bad end up needing a right caliper, brakes and rotors. They fixed for free but I don't trust it at all still feels like it bounces all over the place god forbid if i hit a small bump in the road and i get scared if i go faster then 60 in it so no highway driving for me.

Also, I learned a great deal about working on cars while living with this piece of crap.  At 30k the clutch went out.  I have had manual for 30 years and this is my first clutch repair.  Gas tank spews out gas if you try to fill it. Death wobble at 35k due to a ""broken"" steering stabilizer.  Front hood latches allow hood to shake whenever trucks go by.  Rear gate latches went at 60k.  Coolant leak water pump replacement at 50k.  Tow package was defective and replaced because of a recall.  Acceleration is on par with my 1981 VW Vanagon.  Headlights are really poor and the brights don't blind anyone. Torx bits are a bit problematic.  Dash rattles and squeaks constantly.  The antenna whips the windshield when trucks go by or if there is a big wind or brush.  The tires that came with the jeep, were done by 35k and were crap when new.  Burns plenty of oil.

I see a lot of complaints here about comfort, noise, ride and acceleration. All I can say is that maybe they thought they were buying an Escalade. You don't buy a Wrangler for luxury, zero-road-noise, or racing from the light. You buy it to take on any off-road terrain you throw at it and crawl through the ick that would sink an Escalade to its axles. You also buy it to pull out the idiots who buy the other ""SUVs"" and try to drive them like a Jeep.

I traded in my trusty old 88 Toyota Pickup for this, and I'm not looking back. The build quality is perfect, the ride is actually smoother then my truck was, and it's a lot quieter. The A/C works great, even in 110 degree weather! The 4.0 6cyl. is a torque monster, and loves to move this Jeep up to speed quickly! Off-road it's THE best vehicle, unbeatable! After 160k miles, the only thing I've replaced is the water pump. My only gripes about it are the 3 speed auto, which can bog it down going up hills, and a weak sound system. ",4.75

Driven all over the Ocala National Forest, stuck mostly to the marked roads.  We made one trip on a Sunday after it rained for two days, I was amazed at all the others that were out driving around in the mud, a few roads were washed out and under water, but not impassible even with the stock tires, a little nervous a few times but didn't stick it.

I have replaced a starter (warranty) and paid for a new muffler, wiper motor, and various wear items (brakes, serpertine belt).  I tend to leave the top down in the summer.  One year the steering column filled with water during a rain storm resulting in almost $1K in repairs needed - in the warranty period, but not covered.

Our first baby is due in April and I could have traded it in and bought a new F150 or fancy car, but I just couldn't part with this JEEP.

It needed all of its basic service done for the mileage as it had been neglected in a salt water environment for four years.  After new tires, brakes, tune up and fluid change, I used it for a daily driver.  First the bad:  It is a soft top and is very noisy at anything above 50mph.  It has a harsh ride and has very little storage room inside of the interior.  It also gets terrible fuel mileage. Next, the good:  The vehicle has had rock solid reliability with very few unscheduled repairs, all of which were minor.  The vehicle is also pretty much unstoppable in harsh weather and I have had the opportunity to use it in deep snow, flooding, and hurricane conditions during the time I have owned it.  It is also very good in a crash as I was hit hard on the side at highway speeds and walked away with only a bruised shoulder.  The vehicle was still operable after the crash and I drove it to the body shop for repairs.  It is a niche vehicle and you will either love them or hate them.  If you buy one for comfort or mileage, you will be sorely disappointed,  If you buy them for tough as nails off roading or for the ultimate in bad weather mobility, you will love it. Update... I installed a factory hard top which has improved the comfort of the vehicle substantially as the highway noise level has been significantly reduced and the climate control now has no issue keeping up in extreme weather. I also installed the stock sized tires and rims which improved drivability and slightly increased fuel mileage.  Repairs are starting to. Evonne more frequent, but the old girl now has 120,000 hard miles on the clock.",4

That said if you have time to actually use your jeep for offroading and trail running the jeep wrangler is excellent. I cant imagine trying to take a scion up some of the places I have gone in this jeep, and the soft top and removeable doors are always off.

Aside from the later Unlimited body extension option and the Rubicon off road package that became available in 2004 (and together in 2005), there is no better Wrangler to consider than a 2003 (Unless you want a fat/wide 2007+, which can't get though some desert canyons I wheel in!)",4

It is also great in poor weather conditions.  The ride is not super comfortable, but that is expected for the type of vehicle.  The hard-top is difficult to negotiate, and it becomes an ordeal to remove each season.  The exterior metal is thin and dents easily, and the car burns gas at an alarming rate.

Even young girls love it (not as much as my old mustang, but hey)... and I'm glad it's slow because fast cars are def not a good idea for me (i.e. 3 clutches)",4.875

This truck makes you feel like your driving a tank and is a great 2nd vehicle but could easily be a primary vehicle.  WARNING: I heard that the hood vent gets clogged and lets water in, it didnt happen to me, but my new soft top window seals let water in 2 days after I bought it. I did some research and It happens a lot! To all years! That ok cause there are drain plugs and I use it for trailing so its no biggie for me, but I would have been mad if this was my primary vehicle.  PS its not that hard to fix so dont worry...",4.875

The 4.0 may not be fast, but it will pull trees out of the ground and get you out of the stickiest situations. There are very few vehicles out there that generate such a since of pride, excitement, and comradery as a Jeep.  Hands down the best vehicle I've ever owned.

Since I got my jeep 2 years ago I put new wheels, tires, stabilizer, shocks, radio system, side fenders, and some minor things. Jeep made this car for strict off roading.

Then i drove it though the river when it was high from a month of rain the water came up over the hood and halfway up the door it scared the heck out of me i i thought i was for sure going to take in water but still i am never doing that again i like it to much to trash it.

I gave it a 10 in performance not for fast because is not really but because of offroad, flooding and winter capabilities, the thing is extremely slow, the half doors suck, but a set of full doors can cure that, the a/c is amazingly cold and heat is extremely hot, gas mileage isn't good at all due to the boxy shape of the car, so don't buy this truck counting you will get good mpg.

I was a little nervous to get one with all the problems I had heard about with the Cherokees, but, now that I have a Wrangler, I will never go back to another vehicle. I live in Alaska and the Jeep works great on and off the road. Heat is great even at - 40F, fuel economy is alright, very fun to drive.  No problems so far even after I got in an accident.  The only damage I had was a dented bumper. Other vehicle could not say the same. The only things I could complain about would be a better stereo package (hard to hear with the top down) and the amount of rust on the underside. Overall, an awesome reliable vehicle",4.25

It now has 95000K and still runs like the day I got it. Even the suspension has held up the same. My only complaint is the paint quality and rust problems.  I live in Canada and snow and salt really are not it's friends. Have to undercoat it every year or it will rust.

This was in 1989 and it caused no problems. The shocks were still good last summer when I installed adjustable ones. I find the way I drive, the stiffer the better. I also added quick release sway bar joints, a high end winch, bumper and mount, remote starter and soft top. Then I saw the RUBICON and gave up before I bought lockers. I will find a RUBICON soon I hope with the features I want.  I have ABS, it has saved me from crashing at least 6 times, pulling an overloaded trailer on two occasions.

Excellent capability in the snow, never stuck once.  The 6 cylinder is a must, despite poor gas mileage.  Comfort isn't too bad, but the ride is that of a Jeep, it's supposed to be a little rough.  Right?  The only minor problems I've had is replacing the sway bar brackets and bushings.  Also the universal joints on the drive shaft seem to wear out quick.

The 2017 JKU rubicon is white, purchased new on Dec 31, 2016, so it's almost a year old.  To date I've had the  oil changed twice and tires rotated twice.  Zero mechanical problem or electrical issues.    The present odometer reading is 7515.   As with both of the other Jeeps, cabin noise is louder than a sedan.  The noise is no louder than my previous two jeeps.  On my 2015 I did buy the insulation panels which mount  to the interior of the hard top.  It does  help to cool the interior during the summer.  The heat doesn't transfer through the  plastic hard top like it  did without them.    The 2017 is  totally stock except for seat covers & insulation panels .    I learned on my 2010 when I added after market front & rear bumpers, a Warn wench, and skid plates for the underside that my mileage really took a dive with all the extra weight; then, I installed a 4"" lift kit and 35 inch tires and miles went further south.

I can take the t-tops off for sunny days, leave them on for snow. It has a short wheelbase with very little overhangs so it handles great in tight spaces. It is very comfortable to drive around town or on the freeway. It gets crappy gas mileage. I love it. Most of the criticisms of the Wrangler boil down to, ""it's not a modern sedan.""

Just purchased it 2 weeks ago  and have about 400 miles on it. We love the simplicity with a dose of modern amenities. This Rubicon is my third  jeep and I just love it. I sold my Unlimited Sahara a few years ago and missed the vehicle since. I wanted to replace it before the 2018's were  on sale. Had a hard time finding the Hard Rock edition but well worth it. Remember that it is a truck  and not a little SUV. This vehicle is tough and secure in the Northeast winters.,5

Interior is great, everything you could want except a back up camera(sure they will include that in the 2018 version). Engine is strong , seats are comfortable, and remember this is a truck.

It came with defects in the paint on the fenders that look like scratches.  ""Chrysler Care"" offered no help, advising me to work with the dealer under the warranty. The dealer didn't build or paint the Jeep.  Chrysler Care just closed the customer complaint number and moved on to their next  complaint not resolving anything for their customer. So far the dealer has offered (through the warranty) to repaint the fenders on my brand new Jeep. Not happy. This is my 4th Jeep.",4
3997, on 02/04/17 18:08 PM (PST),Granite Hard Rock ,2017 Jeep Wrangler SUV Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),2017 Hard Rock Unlimited is a Beast.," I own a 2012 Rubicon Unlimited (90K miles) and just recently purchased a 2017 Rubicon Hard Rock.  Love the modular bumper and recently installed 10K Smittybuilt winch and Terraflex 2"" leveling coil spacers.  Same as what I did on my 2012.  My wife has a 2015 Grand Cherokee diesel and the entertainment / nav system on hers is intuitive and well thought out.  The entertainment / nav on my 2017, not so much.  As far as off road capabilities, NOTHING comes close to a Rubicon.  The electronic sway bar disconnect and lockers make off roading a breeze.  I installed offset rims and 33 inch MTS Mickey Thompson's on my 2012 and it improves body roll and off roading capabilities, wish Jeep would do this on the Rubicon.  The BF Goodrich KM's don't cut it.   The 3 piece hard top is still tight and quiet on my 2012, great design.  The LED headlights on the 2017 are a huge upgrade.  The seats are very comfortable and the Alpine sound system is great.  The beefer rock rails on the Hard Rock are a nice upgrade from the Rubicon, as I have leaned on the stock rails on my 2012 and they are not near as robust as on the Hard Rock.  I love the design and performance of the  2017 albeit not alot of miles on it yet.  Saw the new design and although would love a diesel, don't like the 2018 design.  Taking it to Jeep Jamboree in Palo Duro to put it through the paces in May...Update to my review above.  Put the Rubicon to task at Palo Duro.   Aside from a few areas that were heavily rutted coming to a sharp peak causing us to high center, this vehicle can go anywhere.  The trails in Palo Duro are technical, exceptionally steep blind approaches and exits that you don't believe the vehicle could manage.  Auto sway bar release and auto lockers are a huge help with managing changing conditions on the fly.  Since last review, put on Bushwacker flat fenders and 33"" Ridge Grapplers.  No reliability issues with the vehicle since my first review.  If you are serious about off roading nothing comes close to the capabilities of a Rubicon off the dealer floor.  Heading to next Jeep Jamboree in Sept 2017 at Ozark Arkansas.  The more I see of the redesigned 2018, the less I like it except for power plant choices.",4
3998, on 11/15/16 17:15 PM (PST),Mercdoc ,2017 Jeep Wrangler SUV Unlimited 75th Anniversary 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),2017 75th Anniversary Wrangler Unlimited," This is our 2nd Jeep with our first being a 2015 2dr Willys. Now I know this is to be for 2016 models but, really there isn't much different and really you can say ours could be a 2016.5 LOL. But... really what do we think of our Jeep? First, new for the 75th edition and a huge improvement are the LED head lamps. I think Jeep finally got this one right and they are standard on the Sahara and Rubicon, but don't worry they are an upgrade for 495.00 on the Sport versions. They are a bright white(daylight) type which are bright on the roads. We have not had a chance to make a night run offroad to see how they light up the woods but I am sure they will be far better than what we had on our Willys. The overall look of the 75th Anniversary we really love. The Power dome hood and front/rear bronzed bumpers from the Hard Rock really set it apart. The tire size is ok but I think the 255-75r-17s that came on our Willys would have given a much better off road ready look than the Wrangler Armor Tracks that came on it. Don't get me wrong, the Armor Track tires are quiet and do have an off road look to them but it is just a personal preference. The ride is the same as any Sahara with the provided Jeep ""heavy duty"" suspension. I must admit that I like the ride of the Jeep ""Performance suspension"" that came on our Willys or standard for the Rubicons. The Sahara suspension like the Sport(s) suspension just seems too soft for what I expect a Jeep to ride, again it's just a personal preference. For most folks that spend much of their time ""Mall Crawling"" the ride would be perfect and most likely their preferred. Now moving to the inside and our impressions. First look inside there is a bit of EWWW and AHHH from the upgraded interior of the Sahara/75th Anniversary edition over the Willys. But that feeling is short lived as you get in and get comfy in your seat. The leather trimmed seats do feel nice but the lack of lumbar is a minus for me. When traveling the added lumbar support is a nice feeling on the lower back. The dash appears to be very close to what we had in our Willys but with some extra little touches. The speedo and tach lettering are nicer to look at with what appear to be larger letters and a cleaner look. Not really sure how to explain this other than for you to go look at a Sport then look at the 75th edition to know what I mean. Now I will admit that I did not look at any other trim level for 2017 so I am comparing it to our 2015 Willys, which also had the premium dash/cluster in it. The steering controls are the same for 17 as they were for 15 and I am sure the same for 16s. They do take a bit to get use to all the functions that they can do. The My-Gig 430 is a nice upgrade over the 130 standard radio that we had in our Willys. The touch screen for me is a novelty and the upgrade to navigation with travel link is a plus for the interstate traveler. It is not as refined as other systems from the other manufacturers but it does get the job done. We have not had a chance to explore all of the features of the 430N but I did find it to be easy to use without reading the manual. Finding some of the feature items could be easier to find with a dedicated button over searching thought the ""Menu"" button. Our Jeep also came with the Alpine speaker upgrade and it is a great improvement over the stock radio. Yes it is a pricey upgrade and many will say you can that they can build a nicer one for less but many will never do it and be disappointed with the stock system. The Alpine upgrade provides a much need bass response that is not in the stock system. You do lose your hide away in the back as the sub is mounted there. In the JKU it is not a big deal but if you have a JK you will miss that bit of storage. No matter what radio you have the Alpine system is available for an upgrade, my only issue is the lack of being able to tune it. You get Bass or Treble in one radio or you get Bass, Mids, or Treble with the touch screens. Not much there and maybe something that Jeep will touch on for the JL release. I love listening to music both in the Jeep and in my home and the Alpine has a very pleasant sound. The bass is firm but doesn't rattle your ear drums, now you can turn the bass up all the way and it will shake the mirrors and vibrate your back but it is by no means a 15-inch subwoofer. I did notice that the AM/FM tuner picks up stations better than the U130 that we had in the Willys. The ability to copy my CDs to the hard drive is a nice feature, it is a little slow but the playback is great. The U-Connect works great wth both my Android phone and my wife's iPhone and music playback is great with each. Our iPod touch that we use from time to time works well with Bluetooth or the data/charge cable. While using the cable the radio controls the iPod but Bluetooth you keep control on the device. Seating is great up front and spacious in the back but the seats are too up-right in the back. Wish i had more room.",5

It's cool to drive, the ladies like them, they can go anywhere if outfitted right, the 4.0L engine is bullet proof and the transmission is stiff but durable. The resale value is incredible.

4069, on 10/26/15 09:14 AM (PDT),GuyFromTMA ,1998 Jeep Wrangler SUV Sport 2dr SUV 4WD,Best Vehicle I've ever owned," I was given a 98' Sport with a 5 speed, 6 cylinder and a 3"" body lift riding on (initially) 32X11.5 tires as my first car.   The ""Bigfoot Edition"" package had been put on by a dealership when new. It had 140,000 miles on it but was very clean.  I kept it for the next 9 1/2 years and (for personal/financial reasons that weren't connected to the Jeep) sold it with 262,000 on the clock.  With a set of All terrain or good mud tires, it was a beach machine.  Dunes, mud, none of it stopped it...even with a trailer in tow in areas known to swallow much more powerful 4X4s.  I used it to pull stumps, tow other vehicles, drive long distances and cruise through town.  The torque of the 4.0 combined with a good 1st gear and 4Lo is very handy. My only complaint was that the A/C wasn't strong enough to cool the back seat terribly well in super hot weather.  The heater, however, was astonishing.  I could drop the top in 50 degree weather, wear shorts and have to turn the heater DOWN because it was scalding my feet.  Everybody will ask if it is top heavy.  Honestly, I've driven a stock height Grand Cherokee and felt much more likely to roll it. The following things failed and had to be replaced:Exhaust Manifold-Apparently every Wrangler will have this happen at some point.  A shop in the next town replaced it but put a small ""flex"" joint after the header.  Never had a problem with it after that.Power Steering Pump-150,000.  Easy replacementAlternator-188,000 Not unexpected nor difficult to replace.Rear Axle-Mine had a Dana 35 rear in the beginning, bigger tires and was regularly used to tow boats, pull stumps and recover other vehicles.  This failed at the 210,000 mark.  I replaced it with a Dana 44 that was easy to acquire used and never had a problem after that.Seats-The support gave out somewhere around the 230,000 mark.  I replaced the fronts with relative ease.Transmission - Synchros on 1st and 5th gear started to fail around 220,000 miles.  I replaced it with a crate transmission for cheap at about 245,000. Soft Top-I replaced this twice actually.  They just don't last much longer than five years it seems.  Cheap to replace though.I misjudged the depth of a mud hole and killed the engine at the 232,000 mark.  A dealership replaced the engine with a $400 donor from a same year Cherokee.  This illustrates the final point I want to make:  It is ridiculously easy to get parts for these Jeeps.  Everything can be replaced in short order.  There is no waiting on a part and it is relatively easy to work on the 4X4 yourself.  The straight six isn't a powerhouse, but (unless it inhales a bunch of muddy water) it won't die.",5

""Can I borrow your rig?""he asked. He needed to do an emergency insulin run for a friend and none of their big expensive ranch trucks could get through the snow. It got through when nobody else could and spent the day rescuing stranded people in what turned out to be a deadly storm. Since then I have driven it across the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific.We have lived in rural Colorado, New Mexico and now on the Plains.Hauled feed to horses, pulled a boat, loaded goats in the back and transported them.Hauled railroad ties and used it as an anchor to stretch fence.My two Irish Wolfhounds curled up in the back and slept for long trips between New Mexico and Kansas.

Other than that it has been the best car I have ever owned. I would recommend this to people without children because of the lack of room in the back. Off-roading is where it does great. It climbs great and it goes through some serious mud/water. I have had many a truck that could not off-road as good as this. It looks great also. Top speed is LOW. Mine tops out at a whopping 84mph.

There are reasons to love and hate this vehicle so it really depends on your personality and what you will use it for. Yes it will bounce you around and does not have the best acceleration, braking, steering, safety but it is awesome to be able to take it on the beach/snow/off roading and take the doors and top off. The willys trim looks great with the upgraded tires and rims. Also has awesome interior upgrades for a Jeep like upgraded sound system, power windows, power locks, etc.. If your looking for a vehicle with Jeep capabilities to have a great time with the Willys trim is perfect since it has nice upgrades compared to the Sport but does not cost as much as the Rubicon which you do not really need unless you are going rock climbing. Hindsight being 20/20 I would have considered going for the Unlimited as the 2dr with limited Cargo is a little challenging at times but saving that money was nice too. Again, if all you will be doing is commuting back and forth to work then this vehicle might not be the best pick for you but if you are looking for a fun vehicle, especially in nice weather with being able to take the top and doors off, and have some off roading capabilities, this vehicle is perfect.",5

No other vehicle gives you the combination of top down/doors off driving and a feeling of total freedom. I purchased a brand new 2015 Jeep 4DR in May of 2015. Since then, I've put on more than 20k miles. I can say that I have not had any mechanical or electrical issues, or any unexpected dealer visits. I have the 6 Sp manual which is a blast to drive. I've averaging 17.5 MPG around town. I opted for the premium soft top (I live in Minnesota) and it is perfectly suited for year round driving even in the cold. The soft top is easy to use and makes it much more convenient to take advantage of nice weather than lugging and stowing the hard top each time you want the top down. Everything you've heard about the loud cabin, etc is true. This isn't a good choice if you are after a smooth and creamy ride and a hushed interior. I drove my Jeep from MN to CO to SD and back to MN pulling a 10 FT pop-up camper. The Wrangler pulled it just fine, but in 6th gear, it's impossible to hold your speed without downshifting. This was a pain when driving through hilly country. But I was also able to hit a few off-road trails (the Jeep is totally stock except for side-steps), and the experience was just amazing. Love my Wrangler. I plan to keep it forever!UPDATE - June-2016. I still love my jeep and I still have not had any issues with it. I've now added a TerraFlex 2.5 inch lift and 35 inch NItto Ridge Grappler tires, along with LED headlight and taillights. I get lots of compliments when I drive around. I have just over 25k miles on it now. Planning to pull the pop-up out to Montana and Wyoming next summer.",5

If you want to be able to drive in any condition and go anywhere it is.  If you are thinking about a Jeep Wrangler, the first step is to not be stupid about it.  If you have the money to go out and buy the higher versions of it then by all means go ahead and do so. For the rest of us here is my best advice for you, buy the Sport model.  Jeeps are the most modified vehicle on the road.  Save 3-5K dollars at purchase and buy what you want for it aftermarket.  Buy the Jeep with a hardtop, then search craigslist or ebay for a used soft top for it, you should be able to find one for around $500, and that will be around 2K less than the dealer will want for it.  The rear seats in an Unlimited have a terrible angle on them, buy a set of spacers for under them for $50, best money spent.  You'll love driving it, but its a taller vehicle, it can be a handle when the wind is really blowing especially on the highway and the soft top makes it a little worse.  All jeeps are kind of noisier than a regular car, but that is because of the fun factor you will have when it is warmer and you have the top off.   It's a unique vehicle that isn't for everyone but if you are adventurous and fun loving the Jeep is perfect.",4

That made it easier for me to transition from my California, motorcycle-only driving to the East Coast where they have seasons and I need 4 wheels to travel.Pros:  it's not just a car, it's a way of lifeEndless accessories are available, depending upon what you want to doBest resale value of any car.  Look online at a 5 year old Wrangler with 100,000 miles...it can still command a 20k dollar price, depending on options & condition.  Mine is worth more now than when I bought it!Cons: endless accessories mean your build won't ever end while you own your rigAlong with the high resale value comes the high cost.  My nice young salesman literally laughed in my face when I told him the MSRP for a 2015 JKU as its called, that is the Wrangler Unlimited Sport, the lowest 4-door model.  Any other words, Sahara, Rubicon, Willys model cost more.  You can't get one less than 30,000, anywhere on earth.  I see people pay 50,000.  So I got the 30,000 after I found out MSRP is meaningless--it must not have an engine for the MSRP price, and that pisses me off badly.  But it's like every car-buying experience except Saturn (we bought 2 before they killed Saturn for being customer-friendly by actually TELLING YOU THE PRICE.  So I spent 2,000 on tires, wheels, and a 2"" (minimum) lift kit and mine looked better than the Rubicon now (it's over 40k).  Then I spent 1300 more and got a front bumper with a big ""trail stinger"" bar and a Superwinch 9500 synthetic, because if synthetic line ever breaks, it falls to the ground rather than cutting off a head, and the Dyneema cord is as strong as steel.

Great SUV!  Once mine was paid off we agreed that we'd get him a new vehicle.  He wanted the Jeep Wrangler.  Since he was kid; this has been a dream.  In December 2014 we bought the 2015 Jeep Wrangler Sport.  It had 300 miles on it; they drove it up from Los Angeles to the Central Valley.  We had gone to the dealership twice to take a look at their selection.  My Husband is 6'3"" and a big guy; this vehicle fits him comfortably. When we drove it off the lot we were shocked that we actually had done it.  The following weekend we took it up to the snow; the 4-wheel drive was great and we had an awesome experience.  The fact that you can go from Manual to Standard was so cool!  We upgraded the bumpers and side rails, did some custom paint work in the interior and bought a bikini top (that's for me).  The freedom we feel driving it has made the monthly payment worth it.  This Summer we took it up to an annual Jeep run in the Sierra Mountains; with only our new fancy bumpers and side rails we took our Jeep up.  We were completely shocked at what the Wrangler did.  Trails and Mountains the Jeep climbed were shocking!  This machine went right on up some scary mountains; we had great spotters but it still just amazed us on how awesome this vehicle is.  They say; You're never done building a Jeep. Which is completely true!  I like how the holes are pre-drilled for adding such things as bumpers, side rails, winches and such.  It's truly is a Lego set.  Cons: the backset is not made for tall people, anyone over 5'8"" has trouble getting in and out.  Inside of the vehicle is nosey with the hard top on.  The braking does take a bit longer to stop the SUV.  Comparing to my Jeep Liberty.  The speakers between the front and back seat, up in the roof, don't give much head room for the people riding in the back.  Almost a year into this SUV and we're happy.  The performance and enjoy of owning a Jeep Wrangler has made the last year an adventurous one.Updated Review: 2.5 yrs with the Wrangler and we’re still enjoying!  Just took the dogs to the coast, topless.  Still in love and happy with our purchase.",5

Comparing it to my older Jeep (1990 model by the way), was like comparing to a night and day experience.  Inside has come a long way.  The amount of aftermarket options are insane.  Driving with the top off on nice sunny days (even to the gym) is a nice experience.Of course, there are still a few issues.  Hardtop that I bought is a bit awkward to get off even with 2 folks (especially if the 1 is shorter than you).  When on the highway, it is a little noisy but nothing unbearable.

4148, on 09/13/15 14:01 PM (PDT),Marlena ,2015 Jeep Wrangler SUV Unlimited Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),Never buying another Chrysler!," I bought my 2015 Jeep Wrangler at the end of May.  The day after receiving the car the engine light came on.  I brought it to the dealer that weekend.  The code was for a knock sensor but they only cleared the code and sent me home.  Within a few days the light was back on.   This time they replaced the PCM.  I returned with the light on again a week or so later and they finally replaced both knock sensors since this was always the code that was being thrown.  I was able to use the car this time for almost two weeks and I was finally thinking it had bee fixed, when the  light came on again.  (still the knock sensor).  The dealership called STAR and was told to replace the electrical harness, which they did, but that too did not fix the problem.  I have taken the car in a total of 8 times in 3 and a half months.  It probably would have been more, but for a period of time I was not bringing it in when the light went on, but instead trying to work with Chrysler myself. This too was a waste of time.   I have filled out the paperwork for the lemon law and have now begun arbitration.  For this process I am expected to bring it in to the dealership for a final chance at fixing the problem.  If they could not do it on the first 8 times, what makes them think they will do it on the 9th?  What happens after this?  I don't know.  Although, I do like the Jeep, I am really over all of this and at this point I feel that I would never purchase another Chrysler Vehicle.  I can only hope that they will change my mind about their company by standing behind their product and pledge to a satisfied customer, and make things right!",2

Hardtops are a pain in the butt without a lift in garage. 97 and 12 were favorites until this 15. It's awesome. If you're not a priss, you need to experience a Wrangler.

Ride and handling are decent. I don't plan to do much off road driving but it's nice to have the capability. Performance with the Pentastar V6 is decent. The Alpine stereo is much improved for 2015.

Pay special attention to the track bar bracket welds, rear sway bar welds, and other welds for body mount points and others. Many owners are finding out the hard way that their welds have a high amount of porosity (pinholes), weld slag, and welds that are not properly aligned with the weld joints they are intended to join. The steering in many of these Jeeps is also very loose, leaving a ""dead zone"" of several inches of play in the wheel. This makes the vehicle feel dangerous while at highway speeds or on more narrow roads because of the over-correcting of the wheel. Many owners have received new steering boxes to fix the issue. But it is a persistent issue affecting thousands of owners from all of my research over the past few weeks.",2

It has spent most of July in the shop and was first towed on the 4th of July. The Jeep first started with a warning that I needed to pull over and find a safe place to stop. Luckily the first time it happened was in my neighborhood and I limped it home. The Jeep lost power to the wheels, the 4x4 system started throwing error mesages, the screens went blank, the radio went to maximum volume, the swaybars disengaged, and would no longer start. Also the autopark system stayed engaged.  The second time this happened I was driving on the road at 45 mph and everything happened and I almost lost control and was stuck for a few minutes. Luckily I was able to restart the vehicle and things reset and I drove it to the dealer.  All of the same things happened with loss of power, crazy electronics, 4x4 system going crazy.   Multiple engine codes as well but I dont know if its fixed all I got was could not recreate and very little to no troubleshooting.  The frame of the Jeep has separate issues as there are areas missing paint around most of the welds. Also due to the bad welds there is rust and oxidation on the vehicle at the weld points. 2 of those points are rusting. There are multiple reports of this from other Jeep owners as well.  I would recommend NOT buying a wrangler JL>",2

The Jeep handles well, brakes well, accelerates fairly well for a V6 of this weight, and the ride is smoother than expected.  Cabin noise is more noticeable in the Rubicon  (than the Sahara trim level) due to the tires and additional height, but it is not bad.  The interior is attractive, comfortable, and the laid out well.  Too early to comment on the gas mileage, but the Jeep is approximating the posted values by the manufacturer thus far.

Or - a Fiat version of a Jeep," So, let me say this - the new JL Wrangler has improved a lot over the outgoing (but still offered for sale, for some reason) JK Wrangler. My biggest complaint is the build quality. Our Wrangler Unlimited Sahara showed up with one Freedom top panel a different color. No biggie, probably a Friday job car. But the battle to get it fixed with the local Jeep dealer in Medford OR was epic. Initially the dealer was confused as to why we would want all the top panels to match... Then when tasked with fixing it, they said ""drop it off and we will send it to the body shop to get it painted"" So we'd get a loaner for ""3-4 weeks"" Um, no... After several calls to FCA corporate, the dealer agreed to get a new panel and have it painted, and swap it out. After owning the Wrangler for a few weeks, we noticed little things wrong. Like the sunvisor was split open with the plastic guts sticking out. Not what you'd expect from a $50k car. The new 8-speed transmission flat out sucks. It is shifting constantly, even on flat ground. When towing it really never stops shifting. After calling the dealer service department, their response is pretty much ""if it moves, and no warning lights are on, there's nothing we can do about it""  - -  Be warned, FCA will do ""over the air"" updates on the car. Gone are the days of the dealer forcing software updates on the vehicle when you drop it off for an oil change. After leaving the dealer, the (very expensive) 8.4"" Uconnect screen had ""Off Road"" pages to show fun things like approach angle, oil temp, etc... The next day after getting the Wrangler home, POOF! They were gone, like they were never even there. FCA says it will be a feature on the 2019 Wrangler... LOL ; so how did they appear on a 2018 Wrangler then disappear? I will always wonder what Jeep might have evolved into had Daimler Mercedes retained ownership (a G-class equivalent !?) rather than Fiat taking over and doing what Fiat does best... Make no mistake, the Wrangler JL Unlimited is a fun car, and it is still a Jeep. And there are so many improvements over the JK. It just feels you should get something that ""feels"" more quality for $50 grand, rather than something that feels slapped together with a lousy transmission and the same boring old Pentastar V6 that FCA has put in just about every vehicle built for the last 10 years (who needs direct injection or turbochargers when a gas guzzler V6 still sells?)",3

The highway ride is fine.   I switched from M&S tires to A/T and noted an improvement in both ride and mileage, with no noticeable loss of Off-road capability in the mountains.  After the initial transmission cooler line problems were fixed under warranty, no futher repairs were necessary.  I did wait a tad too long to replace the rear brake pads (70,000 miles) and had to also replace the disks.  The Brake Lock Differential system apparently causes the rear pads to wear out before the front pads.    I have been happy keeping my JKU pretty much stock, and it has had no problem handling the forest service and 4WD roads in the Colorado mountains.I am awaiting the 2018 JKU to see what improvements have been made.  The rear-view camera and other safety features, along with the 8-speed automatic promised, will be looked at closely.  Also, the front suspension, to see if improvements have been made to reduce the occasional ""death wobble.""  Finally, I hope they will be improving the GPS system.  The current one does not even tell you how fast you are going, let alone what the speed limit is.  Given the wide variance in tire sizes used on the Jeep, it would be very helpful to know how fast you are really going.",4

I'm a VW guy, but my GTI's handling in the snow isn't great, so I was looking for a secondary car with 4wd capabilities to battle the harsh northeast winters we have in NJ. My Wrangler came with a bunch of aftermarket modifications, including a lift kit and big 33' tires, which drastically changes the ride quality and control of the jeep. So I'm not going to comment too much on that. The Wrangler itself is super reliable for a 16 year old car, I've only had minor parts that needed to be replaced, such as the starter and solenoid bearing(even then the parts were relatively cheap and I was able to do a lot of repairs myself right in my driveway with ease). The jeep itself is so much fun to drive, I've also taken it off-roading and it handles the abuse like a pro. The I6 4.0L engine is super reliable and bullet-proof if you keep up with proper maintenance, and the auto transmission is responsive and shifts smoothly. Only cons I have are if you have a hard top, it's damn near impossible to take it off on your own to enjoy the convertible aspect of the Wrangler, and the gas milage, well, don't expect to get a thing better than 18 Mpgs highway. Regardless, it's a reliable, fun, do anything, go anywhere truck! I drive it more than my GTI now!",5

Furniture, TVs, Cell Phones & Computers, and clothing are few examples of items that we'd rather part with after a long run. Most of the time vehicles fall into this category as well. From time to time though a few slip through the cracks and become timeless friends that make us smile when we turn the key. Such is the case with the Jeep Wrangler. Part truck, part convertible, fully modifiable is is this little machine that started life on paper as a mode of transport for soldiers is now a part of the land scape in modern cities and suburbans. My particular Jeep is a 01 SE base model example. It's previous owner graced this Jeep with optional AC, rear sound bar, 31 inch tires, 1 inch body lift and color matching fenders. A feature only found on Safari models that year. Fitted with half doors and a soft top has made winter morning and evenings a bit nippy, but in typical fashion the Chrysler equipped heater and blower are far more the adequate of keeping it's occupants warm. The AC too blows cool enough to fend of summer heat waves. Rust, a word often associated with Jeeps seems to have missed my unit as its frame and underbody are free from such assaults. Careful and methodical attention to salt and mud will assure the next 16 years are equally rust free. Finally, the expensive bits, engine, wiring, transmission and transfer case all operate well. Despite having only a three speed transmission with overdrive, my Jeep with the 2.5 litter inline 4 returns a whooping 30MPG on the highway and a respectable 18MPG in the city with stop and go driving. A four speed automatic would have been a preferred feature to even out shifts in traffic and getting up to speed. If sourcing a Jeep for yourself, attempting to snag a five speed manual would be ideal if more time will be spent in urban trekking than rock crawling. Other items that leave me longing are squishy breaks that do get the job done, but have you a bit more concern then confidant and a lack of cruise control on all but the Safari edition. Still, if removing the chances of ever getting stuck in light to medium snow while being able to enjoy convertible driving in the summer checks your boxes, then the Jeep Wrangler may just be the vehicle for you.",4

I also owned a Maita and now a BMW Z4 and Chev Truck and Yamaha FJR 1300 as well, but the Jeep is just more lovable and will go anywhere. I have owned Honda's, Toyota's (Tundra--bad truck)and many others and the Jeep is more reliable. What it does need is a better radio as the one that come with it is poor at best.

It has been awesome with respect to things that I care about, but it's hard to rate against other vehicles because I treat it much differently.  Pros:  Great off-road, Sport S is better for towing/climbing, hard to beat in snowy months with the right tires, tons of space to haul people and cargo, generally a fun vehicle with the Freedom Top and quick-release everything.  Cons:  Engine knocks, manual is tough in urban commute, bad gas mileage, fairly frequent need of axle seal repair, some minor electrical stuff with windows and locks (since doors are removable).  The reason I still rate it relatively high is that I don't need the usual ""comfort"" that some other SUVs provide.  There is still plastic and metal on the doors and the floor upholstery is removable.  The seats are rigid and I can feel every bump in the road, but that's what makes it great for off-road driving.  There is road noise even with the hard top, but that's the kind of vehicle I expect it to be.  I didn't buy it for luxury, I bought it for sport.

I find the seats very comfortable even though I am tall and the legroom in the front is plenty for me. Ride quality is good and yes it is rough but not jarring. All switchgear is easy to use and straightforward...in fact the whole vehicle is that way...no gimmicks or extras you don't need.  We own other cars with the gimmicks so the Jeep certainly doesn't need them. Even though I have the cloth top the interior is fairly quiet although you do notice the wind etc. a little more then with a hardtop. Would definitely buy another one and recommend highly. ,4.625

4449, on 04/07/16 15:25 PM (PDT),Conrad ,2014 Jeep Wrangler SUV Unlimited Rubicon 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),2 Years and 55k miles of Dream Ownership," I drove my 2014 Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon (automatic transmission, 3.73 gearing) for 2 years until a car crash (another driver's fault) took her from me. I loved the car so much I've ordered a 2016 Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock as a replacement.This was two years and 55k miles of hard, varied, challenging driving. The Jeep took me on two long, 3000 mile roadtrips to national parks; it also served as my commute vehicle from Boulder to Denver and around Boulder (city driving) for that time. First, a disclaimer: this review is about a loaded Rubicon. Some of the positives I mention will not relate to a base Sport or even a Sahara or a limited edition, but at the core (engine, transmission, basic off-road capability), all Wranglers have a lot in common.Now, the positives (there are too many to list, but I'll cover my favorites). (1 - Off-road ability) My Jeep saw two trips to Moab and countless trips to the Colorado trails. The mud-terrain tires, heavy Dana 44 axles with lockers, the sway bar electronic disconnect, and trip computer with navigation and tire pressure monitoring and etc. proved invaluable. Not only was I able to climb terrain my friends in Nissan XTerra Pro4Xs and Toyota FJ Cruisers could only dream of, I was able to do it EASILY and often quite slowly. Sometimes momentum is your friend in challenging or slippery conditions. While some cars had to floor it in 4-LOW to ascend a hill, I could do it at a leisurely crawl. Furthermore, when I bought the Jeep I was an offroad novice. This vehicle endured countless crunches (and I mean crunches) onto the skid plates and rock rails while I made rookie mistakes. And at the end of the day, I drove back out onto the two lane highway, shifted into 2WD, and drove away without a hitch. Most cars would have been rendered immobile by what I often subjected the Jeep to.(2 - Luxury) Yes, luxury. A Wrangler is not, and hopefully will never be, a Mercedes-quality vehicle. But the Rubicon surrounds you with heated leather seats with ""Rubicon"" embroidery and contrast baseball stitching, illuminated footwells and cupholders, leather wrapped (yes, real leather) steering wheel and shift knobs (both the transmission and the 4WD knobs). My Rubicon also had a very good 7-speaker Alpine sound system with a subwoofer. New Rubicons have a 9 speaker, 500 watt Alpine system. The UConnect system has Garmin navigation and voice-controlled sound system (iPod, radio, etc.) and voice-controlled Bluetooth calling. Mine also had a TravelLink subscription which allowed you to check weather, ski conditions, movie times, etc. from the touch screen. Another qualification: my Rubi cost almost $50,000. With that kind of money, you could buy a much more luxurious Ford Explorer Limited or Honda Pilot Touring. The Wrangler is not plush. But it IS comfortable, and sitting in it makes you feel special, and isn't that all you can ask of a vehicle? To scope out the interior more, simply build the edition of your choice on CarGurus and look at pics of the interior - it speaks for itself.(3 - a feeling of command and safety) The Wrangler's upright driving position, planted stance, and almost entirely vertical glass make the road easy to see, the vehicle easy to place on the road, and you confident that you're driving less of a passenger car and more of a tank. Especially with the hard top, you really do feel in command of the road and ready to meet anything the world or other drivers want to throw at you. That confidence simply isn't felt in a reclined, car-like CUV like a Honda CR-V or Toyota Rav4. (4 - SAFETY!) As stated, I was involved in a car crash. I was going about 40 mph through a green light and another driver made a left turn into me going the opposite direction (she was going about 20 mph). It was a fast crash (60 mph) but not awful. Even still, head-on collisions are always scary and you want a car that can protect you. Both front airbags deployed and I got out of the vehicle without a scratch and feeling relatively fine. The other driver was stuck in her car and distressed. Speaking of the other car - it was totaled, the hood crushed and the front end pretty compacted. The Jeep looked almost fine aside from the bumper being dented in dramatically and damage to the grille. Ultmately, it was totaled anyway - it needed a new frame apparently (which I blame on a combination of the crash and aforementioned rock crunching, which I'm sure weakened the frame). Feel free to argue amongst yourselves what this means about crash durability of the Wrangler - I simply care that it protected me so well and had very little visible damage.(5 - A few cons) Fuel economy decent but not great, lack of some luxury or convenience features you'd want for 50K. Other than that, its an absolutely incredible vehicle.",5
4450, on 01/18/16 08:14 AM (PST),Tammy Willis ,2014 Jeep Wrangler SUV Unlimited Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),I THINK I WILL BE GOING BACK TO A PICKUP," I have had numerous electrical problems with this Jeep and a oil leak.  The oil leak was within the first 6 months of owing it and it took the dealership over a week to get the part in to have my Jeep repaired.  Now as far as the electrical problems, that is a different story, the first problem was, when my tire light would come on my door light would also come and, and they dealer did not know how to fix it, still not fixed to date and my Jeep is 2-1/2 years old, then my buttons on steering wheel were very hard to push, and when I would turn blinker on my interior lights would blink with the blinker, and my lights on the shifter never would light up, at this same time I complained how when it barely rains my Heep slides going around curve very slowly if I apply my brakes, and of course the dealer did not know how to fix that either, but did have to replace my blinker arm, and this fixed the buttons hard to push on steering wheel and the flashing overhead lights when blinker was one.  Now it is going back in shop because my esc light keeps coming on and my jeep makes a funny noise if I turn to the left with my brakes applied.  It seems like it is always something with the electronics on this Jeep, I am so glad I bought the extended warranty or I would not be able to afford all these so called repairs. I gave up my 1997 Chevy z71 to try a Jeep.  Not for sure if this was the best idea.  I always heard that Jeeps were tough and you don't have very many problems, so that I was convinced of so I purchased mine.  I do love the looks of the 4 door Jeep Wrangler.",3
4451, on 10/27/15 06:35 AM (PDT),Jonathan Harris ,2014 Jeep Wrangler SUV Sport 2dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),2014 Jeep Wrangler Sport Very Dependable," So first, I have to warn others first, BUY A SPORT MODEL. Don't buy a Sahara, or a Rubicon if you are wanting to modify it heavily.The Sahara has issues with electronics, and the Rubicon has constant issues with the motor in the Electronic sway-bar disconnect motor burning out, and electronics.The sport model, however, has almost no issues.Some things that me and other Jeep lovers have noticed about this Jeep that you may need to do/address:1. JEEP WAVE! When you buy a jeep Wrangler, you will notice that a lot of other Jeep Wranglers will be waving to you. This is part of owning a jeep. You MUST return the wave. A head nod does not cut it. If you don't want to wave, don't buy a jeep! (Comes with the territory)2. Remove the rear seat, it's a cheap way to double your cargo room. Plus, for me at least, it caused my jeep 2 door to do a rocking motion when going over bumps at high speeds. Removing the back seat allowed the rear to be a little stiffer, and remove the rocking motion.3. Get a cargo cover. I personally have a Tuffy Security enclosure in mine.4. DON'T LEAVE ANYTHING VISIBLE IN YOUR JEEP! Unless you want your top cut. (new cloth top costs almost $1000 dollars... even with a 2 door)5. Don't expect this to be a quiet and easy ride. It's loud, noisy, whistles, and on the highway with a strong crosswind, it's difficult to control. But hey, It's a jeep! Every one has had the same issues. (THIS IS NOT LUXURY! IF YOU ARE BUYING A JEEP FOR LUXURY, BUY A MERCEDES, THIS IS NOT FOR YOU)With all that, that's it! Welcome to Jeeping and loving a Jeep! Some people love it, some people hate it. [HTML removed]",5
4452, on 10/15/15 23:48 PM (PDT),Hudson Williams ,2014 Jeep Wrangler SUV Sport 2dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),Truly Disappointed.  Do NOT buy a Jeep Wrangler.," Before anyone reads this I want to let everyone know that I am a true Jeep lover.  Anyone that knows me would swear to that fact.  I had wanted a Jeep since I was nine years old.  My next door neighbor had a 1943 fully restored WWII Willy's.  Absolutely beautiful vehicle and amazing what it could do.  I bought my first Jeep in 2012 when I turned 40 as I was not getting any younger.  It was my first new car as I had always owned used vehicles prior to this.  I was super excited and immediately fell in love with it.  The doors could come off, the top could be pulled back, the four-wheeling it could handle!  Truly the coolest vehicle on the road.  Seriously, what other vehicle can do all that?  Sadly the honeymoon did not last long.  It began with the leaks around the doors. Twelve times in the shop and they never fixed the problems. They even tried resetting the doors with no luck.  Nothing worked.  Wet carpet in a humid climate is not ideal at all. That's not even the worst of it.  Mixed in with leaking doors, the mechanical issues soon began.  Some may not believe me but I have the records to prove it.  The throttle body went bad three times.  The fuel injection system went bad twice.  I had a cracked air intake manifold twice.  A bad oil cooling system.  You name, it went wrong.  Too many electrical problems to even mention.  The running joke in my neighborhood was that it in the shop more than it was on the road or that it had been built on the Monday after Super Bowl Sunday.  Yes, it was a lemon & luckily they took it back before my lease was up but I was still out what I had paid in the year-in-a-half that I leased it. (That's why I have the records.)Here is where it gets even worse.  I figured that since I had a lemon my first time out, there was no way I could get another bad one.  I mistakenly bought a 2014 and tricked it out.  Another bad move on my part.  I had the lift package put on it, rock rails, a wench, KC lights, bush-whacker fenders flairs, 35-inch tires with nice rims, a Gobi Rack, a snorkel package, you name it.  Again, this Jeep was going to be perfect!  A four-wheeling machine!!!!  It was for a short while and then like the first one, the mechanical problems began and have not stopped.  I didn't need to worry about the rain leaks that were happening as I had moved to Denver.  Too dry to worry about that here as it would dry out in hours.  What I did need to worry about however was that in a month and a half, it broke down on me five times.  Two times where it needed towing as it shut down completely and I was stuck in the middle of the road!  First I was told it was the oil-exchange system.  Is there such a thing?  Then it was a bent wire that shorted out.  Then the oil started leaking like mad.  I took it in three times to get that to stop.  It is still leaking oil now.  I went to two different dealerships to see if one was better than the other. Answer to that question - NOPE!!!!  Now I have a loud chirping/squeaking noise underneath the vehicle that gets louder and louder with ever bump in the road.  It is incredibly annoying.  I have been told by the dealership that it is the lift package.  It isn't.  I have had three separate specialty shops look at it (one that specializes in lift packages on Jeeps) and none of them think that it is the lift package making the noise. They have nothing to gain by telling me this either as they will make no money off of me when they tell me this.  The dealership tells me it is the lift package as that is not covered under the warranty and they don't have to pay for that repair.  Speaking of warranty.  What happens to my repair costs when that runs out?  No thanks Chrysler!!!!The point with all this is - DON'T buy a Jeep folks.  I want to save you the hassle and frustrations that I have put up with now for nearly 4.5 years!  Jeeps are incredible high on the ""cool factor"" scale.  The way they look, what you can do with them, etc.  When it comes to reliability however, this is a completely different story.  In my near 24 years of driving, the two Jeeps I have owned are easily the two least reliable vehicles I have ever owned.  Remember, I only had used vehicle prior to this and one of those vehicles was a 1971 VW Super Beetle!!!  I want to love my Jeep but I need it to run.  I need it to be reliable.  I am truly disappointed by this and really wish it was not this way.  I am disappointed that Chrysler has done little to nothing to help.  I am done with Jeep until they get their product straight.  I know I am not the only one that has had these issues either.  The more people I talk to, the more I find have the same frustrations as me.  For those of you who have reliable Jeeps, let me say that I am really jealous!  I am also happy for you and I really hope that lasts.  You are lucky.  I am finding however that the lucky Jeep owners with few repairs and frustrations are becoming more and more rare.  I hope Chrysler fixes things soon.",1

That soon ended when within the first week I had to take it back to the dealer due to a bad fan.  Dealer claimed it was a factory defect.  Two months later my check engine light came on for a day and went off. Checked the code and it was for a cylinder 6 misfire.  Thought it may have been caused by bad fuel.  About a month later we got some heavy rain and my driver side floor board was full of water( 1/2inch).  I had taken the top off maybe 3 times since I had the jeep and thought maybe I didn't put it back on properly.  My husband and I took it off and readjusted it.  Another rain storm came and soaked the floor once again.  Took it in to the dealer and said it was due to a foam piece that needed to be replaced at the top of the roof by the driver door.  Needless to say that didn't work. The foam didn't even stay on.  Took it in for a second time and all they did was replace the foam again.  The service tech kept telling me how temperamental the hard tops are and insinuated I wasn't putting the top back on properly even though I hadn't touched it since taking it to them the first time.  He then proceeded to show me where the drain plug was under the driver seat in case it took on too much water.  I thought he was joking. Again replacing the foam didn't work.  Took it in for the third time and they kept it for 3 days and said it was due to something with the frame and part of the hard top not being square.  About a month later I had no leaks and hadn't even taken the top off due to fear of it leaking again.  That seemed to have been fixed.  A couple weeks roll around and my check engine light is on again for a cylinder 6 misfire.  Took it in to the dealer and they said it was due to software updates that needed to be done on my jeep so they did the updates. Here we are about 2 weeks later and the check engine light is on yet again. I'm scheduled to take it in this week and here what they have to say. Bottom line I've taken it in soon to be 6 times in the first year of owning it.  Save yourself the heartache and money and don't buy this vehicle.,2

I have the soft top, the Willy's Wheeler Edition, and zero regrets.  So many people obsess over getting a Hardtop but I recommend saving your money and just using the soft top - in 5 seconds you can retract to ""sunrider mode"" for sun and win, and in less than 5 minutes you can retract the top fully.  The soft top is plenty warm enough for the coldest winters (I just went through one without issue) and its plenty quiet enough on the highway (I put on MANY highway miles thus far without a problem.

It did what I needed it to do getting me wherever I needed to be, protecting my children and I when we were hit by a drunk driver from behind at nearly 40 miles per hour, and the touch screen radio with GPS and HDD were wonderful to have for getting to places and not having a vehicle cluttered with CD's. I rarely took my front top panels off but when I did everyone loved it (cant say how heavy or difficult the back portion was as I never removed it).     My torque converter did go bad at 42K miles (thankfully I bought the lifetime warranty on the vehicle which in and of itself paid for the tranny issue), I had to replace the brakes at 65K miles with the rear passenger side shoe sticking and needing a-lot of work, the door hinge bushings were starting to go bad, and finally the O2 sensors (which there are 4 of) went bad twice.       I did truly love the vehicle. Visibility was great, the ride was smooth for a 4x4 and it was easy to handle. My main reason for getting rid of it is that the gas mileage is lower than I would have liked and I travel a-lot. I never got more than 21 mpg on the highway (and roughly 50k of the 75k miles I put on it were highway).      If you want a fun 4X4 and can get past the lack of mpg and a little less than desirable power the 2009 was a good vehicle (at least for me).",4

We have never gotten less than 20mpg, over the road I get 24+, and of course my wife gets 26+.  She just has a gentler right foot.

Finally, knowing absolutely nothing about jeeps other than they look Bad Ass and they are Oh soooo Pretty, I went out and bought a brand new Oscar Mike. It’s Gun Metal grey and probably the coolest looking vehicle I personally have ever seen. If you haven’t figured it out yet, I’m a female. With that being said, can someone tell me what the heck I actually bought. All I know is that it’s a Jeep Wrangler Oscar Mike. I can’t seem to be able to figure out if it’s a limited edition, unlimited, sport, etc. I’ve looked online and even called my local dealership with little success. As a matter of fact, the guy at the dealership sounded almost as confused as me. (WHAT!) I should mention that because I went out and bought a Jeep without my husband, and paid around $41,000, I’m a little embarrassed not even knowing what I paid for. He did know I was planning on buying a Jeep. Just not that day and at that price point. Seriously, without too many harsh words, can someone please help me figure out/tell me what kind of Jeep I own.

The version I have is a Sahara Backcountry so it's equipped with some off road goodies plus I found one with some options such as the 3.73 gears, Tru-Lock rear locker, top of the line audio/nav system. remote start, and the supplemental side airbags which are, surprisingly, still optional.   MSRP Over $45,000.  It's been almost a year and a half and 13k miles so I think I can give a honest review.  First, I am well aware I bought a Wrangler, and what that means as far as owning a boxy, heavy, full framed SUV designed for capability, not luxury.  So my complaints will not be about things I knew I was getting into with this.   Mine has been in the shop for about 25 days of the last year.   My freedom top leaks (and still does), an axle seal failed, rusty water is comes out from behind the center caps after it rains/goes thru a car wash, a bumper applique started peeling off, my front differential had to be completely rebuilt twice and had a recall on an airbag module. .  This week I've started noticing a rough idle combined with a rattle, possibly a heat shield, when at a stop.   I have not modified mine.  With all that said, owning a Wrangler puts you into an exclusive group (if you want that).  There's a camaraderie with other owners and feeling of security driving one.   I love the way it looks, and people give me compliments all the time or say ""I wish I could get one.""   It's a beast on sand or snow, and nothing compares to taking the doors off in the summertime.   Fortunately, I have a daily driver so mine sits most of the time, which makes it a treat to take out when I do.",4
4547, on 04/04/17 12:31 PM (PDT),Conrad Camellino ,2016 Jeep Wrangler SUV Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),Its a Jeep Thing," First, a few disclaimers. This review is on an Unlimited Rubicon Hard Rock Edition with basically every option. Keep that in mind when I say this vehicle is more luxurious than some other reviewers (for example, the Sport comes with roll-up windows and no air conditioning). Second, I've driven about 30,000 miles in this vehicle and 50,000 in a 2014 Unlimited Rubicon I had prior to this, so I've had a lot of experience behind the wheel.          1. The Good: there's a lot of it. The Rubicon Hard Rock is the single BEST vehicle you can buy for rock crawling and for all-around off-roading. That's not bias talking - its an objective truth. It comes standard with low-range 4WD, heavy duty Dana 44 axles front and rear with electronic lockers, 32 inch mud/terrain tires, an electronic sway-bar disconnect, skid plates, rock sliders, steel bumpers front and rear (the front is winch and hoop capable). It will go anywhere you ask of it, and not break a sweat. The Raptor can desert run, but isn't much of a rock crawler. The Ram Power Wagon can rock crawl - unless the trail gets too narrow or windy. Small pickups like the Tacoma and Frontier are fine, but have bad departure angles and independent front suspension (bad for off-roading). Its easy to dwell on the off-road prowess of the Rubicon, so lets move on to some under-appreciated categories. The interior, for example. Mine has heated leather seats with ""RUBICON"" embroidered onto the backs, leather center console, door armrests, shifters, and steering wheel...its got illuminated footwells and cupholders, navigation, bluetooth, voice-controlled calling and radio, DVD player (when stopped), a 9-speaker, 500-watt sound system. I could go on and on. Long story short, its a pretty swell place to spend some time, and not half as uncomfortable as some reviewers (professional and consumer) make it out to be. Its a great family hauler too - it seats five comfortably and with no discernible power drop, can fit loads of gear in the back with all seats up and an astronomical amount with the rear seats down. Furthermore, I never had any maintenance problems with either of my Wranglers for over 80,000 miles.          2. The Bad: yeah, there's some. Comfort isn't what you'd expect from a $50,000+ vehicle. Wind tosses the car (which has the aerodynamics of a cutting board) all around the road if you're not careful, and wind noise at high speeds can be irksome (not terrible, but again - for the price, you really don't want to hear ANYTHING). Technology is lacking too. I have everything I want as a twenty-two year old male with no children. But if you were using this as a family car on occasion, you might want more than 6 airbags, maybe safety features like blind spot monitoring or lane keep assist. The primary safety feature in this car after the traction control and stability control (which, admittedly, are both excellent), is YOU. A Jeep Wrangler asks you to pay attention, something fewer and fewer cars ask of you. MPG is also bad - after a point. I say this because driving 55-65 along curvy Colorado mountain roads, the Wrangler is a rockstar. It gets 20-sometimes 22 MPG on roads and at speeds like that, which is more than I would ask of a giant, boxy off-roader with a five-speed transmission. However, at interstate speeds (75+), on windy days (and the interstate often follows windy corridors), you might average 13 or 14 MPG. That sucks, to put it bluntly.          3. Conclusions: think about what you want out of your car. As a daily driver, the Jeep is comfortable enough and averages 18 MPG, which is fine by me - but there are better options out there. As an off-roader, it is hands-down the single best option currently on the market (and that includes the G-Wagen, the Land Cruiser, the Range Rover, et cetera). As a luxury SUV, it does well, if you're comparing it to 5-8 year old luxury SUVs (cross shopping this Jeep with a 2008 Mercedes M-Class or a 2009 Land Rover LR3 is actually pretty fair). And there are ways around its more unfortunate quirks. Upgrade the LCD screen to a 9-inch offering from Alpine that includes a rear-view camera. PAY ATTENTION when driving. For that better MPG, take the longer way to your destination and save fuel. And what do you get, for your trouble? One of the most badass, quirkiest, most fun to drive, most attention grabbing vehicles on the market (many would say THE most). Its worth it, by my reckoning. I'll be a Jeep owner for life.",5

I went to several off-road parks and Jeep gatherings.  I took the Wrangler through water, mud, up and down trails with inclines so steep, I could only see the sky while going up.  Keep in mind, everything is stock on my Wrangler yet.  One occasion I actually went off-roading with the doors and top off.  I started crossing a waterway and it was a lot deeper than I had anticipated as water begin filling the cab of my Wrangler, soaking me and my passenger along with the rest of the interior.  I kept going though and the Wrangler never hesitated and we made it to the other side.  After a few days, the interior finally dried out and all that was left was to clean out the sand that had made its way into my cup holders.  The interior did not stink and all the electronics still work like a brand new Wrangler.  I have been water forging several times and even took on some very rocky terrain on some occasions.  Going down some ""rock steps,"" I didn't have quite the ground clearance needed and hit the trans-axle on the rock and bent my tailpipe a bit.  The Wrangler just handled it and keep on going.

I had issues with rain leaking into the cabin on both vehicles around the 14,000 mark.  Loved the fun, cool factor, the accessory build freedom, and utility of the vehicle.  It is fun to drive, but with regard to the leaks,  Jeep says you need to expect these type of things.  I had to cut off my frustration.  With two vehicles that leaked and gave me ridiculous amounts of frustration, it is was terrific fun to drive.  I had the soft top and had it off as often as I could.  The ride is loud and rough, but not as much as you may think.  When you test drive it, your first thought is it being much more comfortable than you anticipated.  Nothing puts you in a good mood faster than driving home from work with with top down and tunes blaring.  This was used as my every day vehicle, which is probably not the best use for it.  The storage compartment is small and awkward to access with the soft top up.  Whether this is getting groceries or anything else.  I play golf and coach baseball and my gear does not really fit well.  If I lived in western states such as Colorado or Utah, it would make more sense.  I am on the east coast and it is a mall crawler.   I had to eventually part ways with my Jeep, but still miss the fun factor....but not the frustrations.",3

The ride is quite smooth, the power and acceleration is much improved, and the MPG is great considering the weight and its brick-like aerodynamics.   When buying a new Jeep, I would recommend the Freedom Top, you get a quieter ride, improved security, and you can still take off the top in about 10 minutes.

It WAS my favorite car i have ever owned.  The very next year they went to the quadralink suspension and the ""minivan"" interior.  I had to part with that great ride after a few years and have longed for one since.  After rock crawling in a rental this spring, I was hooked again.  While my new ride doesn't have a ton of luxury features, I love it.  I am so glad i found a MT version - which shifts like the 95 did, long throw lever and pedal, but you have a great intuitive feeling when doing it.  I was also skeptical of the new engines, but WOW the new 3.6L V6 is fantastic.  Crisp faster power, better mileage, lighter.  The other huge benefit to the 4 door is the long wheelbase.  It rides better than my Honda CRV.  I'll echo the same comments as a lot of others - I think Jeep has somehow kept the magic while improving the most iconic vehicle on the road.  Sure the freedom top has those hand screws and levers, but the 95 had a myriad of torx bolts in front (that went into a thin strip of metal on the windshield frame) and in back and you had to take the whole top off.  I also don't understand the gripes about the handling.  You get a feel for the turns pretty quickly - yes you have to corner slower, but there is no safety issue and it is great to feel so connected to the road.  I'm also excited to start customizing it.

I bought the Jeep after driving a Lexus Rx300 for 15 years so I was a little worried that I would miss all the luxury of the Lexus but I don't.  The car handles well and of coarse is super fun.  When shopping for the Jeep I had a few communication requirements that my Lexus didn't have and that was a really good blue tooth and a USB port.  Now it's 2016 so that should be standard, and with the Jeep it is.  That said, the USB is a complete waste as it doesn't do the one thing I need it to and that is charge my phone.  The Jeep's bluetooth is through a system called UConnect and UConnect drains your phone's battery in about 15 mins or less.  Thought I could solve the problem by plugging phone into USB, they did an awesome job designing the center console between the two front seats. They even put little groves for the USB cord so you can shut the lid but since the USB doesn't charge, its completely worthless and makes UConnect worthless.  I think the higher priced Rubicon comes with a USB that actually charges, but since this is a second car that my kids were going to drive I didn't feel the need to splurge on a Rubicon.  I still love driving the Jeep but without a USB port that charges, I can use the UConnect and thus all the great functions in UConnect are a total waste.",4

I was ready to switch vehicles after my 2012 Grand Cherokee 4x4 with the HEMI motor was pushing 80,000 miles. I looked at a used 2014 E Class Mercedes Benz. It was a phenomenal deal compared to new (with only 12k miles) but I could not wrap my head around buying a sedan. I decided to look into a 2016 Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon and was set on White with Black leather interior. This is not an easy task to find used, so I decided to lease a brand new one. I was able to drive it a couple hundred miles in the past 24 hours and I have to say it is extremely nice and well equipped compared to most Wranglers I have driven. The color matched hard top and fenders are a very nice touch and the interior with the leather trim is beautiful. I drove a Hummer H2 for years before I got my Grand Cherokee and I absolutely loved it. This Jeep reminds me of my Hummer. The visibility is phenomenal, I feel comfortable in it and the road noise is minimal, even with the removable top and mud tires. Plenty of power in this V6...it's no HEMI but it's enough. I found myself driving a little less aggressively actually. It seems like every Wrangler driver I've encountered so far waves as I pass them. This is an eye catching vehicle that I have already been complimented on a few times. While I cannot speak to dependability, I have to say I am very impressed with the styling of both the exterior and interior. I am confident I made the right decision. The price tag was a little steep at just under $51,000, but with my trade, some research, and some negotiating, I got what I think is a fair deal on a 3 year lease and I am thrilled to own this vehicle.",5

When you buy a Wrangler you know what you're getting and expectations should be in line with the fact that you are buying a rugged four wheel drive vehicle designed to take you anywhere in any kind of weather.

Looked at a number of SUV's (Ford, Honda, Subaru etc) Walked into the Jeep dealer and saw a wrangler on the showroom floor. Fell in love with the styling. Took one for a test ride and fell more in love. Rides like a truck (Love it) Find the steering is far more tight than my 97 Cherokee. Bought one nicely equipped. Power windows, automatic, 3 piece hardtop, Bluetooth.  More room than my 97 Cherokee and more pep. It is averaging approximately 20 miles per gallon. I know why Wrangler drivers wave at each other. Because the Wrangler is so much fun to drive you just can't help smiling and waving to others that are enjoying theirs. I find the controls are nicely placed.  No more noisy then other vehicles I have driven. Love the windows all around. Makes seeing what is in the blind spot very easy. Wranglers are not for everyone, but some of us find that they just fit our personality. The world is a great place there are so many choices for those that want something different.

It is a solid, dependable. powerful vehicle that handles the driving challenges in rural northern Minnesota with ease.  Gas mileage is around 18-20 mpg because I'm driving the vehicle as it is designed to be used, mostly on back country two lane no shoulder roads, often rough, 60 mph, slow down for surprise curves, animals, drivers, machinery, and small towns.  After market add-ons  are easy to install, affordable, and allow you to make it your own.  It's steering requires a little more attention than the junk that is now called a SUV, the seating is for adults- not soccer intercity mom going to Macy's for Designer Jeans, and the ride is solid not designed for cruising the Hood or playing with your latest scratch and sniff IPod toy.  I drove real military jeeps, in early 70's, and in 27 years of service found out that nothing was as good or dependable to replace it including the Hummer which was overpriced, overrated garbage.  Safety, it's safe if you drive normally and like having metal protecting you instead of designer techno garbage that provides recalls every other week because it doesn't work and was made in Mexico/China.  I have a 2013 RAV4 and traded in a 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport (5000 miles), which was preceded by 2008 GMC 1500 , 2004 Ford Ranger, 1998 Explorer sport, and 1998 Subaru Forester (All Purchased New).  Averaging 100,000 to 120,000 per vehicle before trade in/replacement.

I went for the Unlimited Sport with the S package and automatic. My previous Jeep was a 15 Sahara Unlimited, It had a stiff suspension, 18 inch wheels that the dealership had a tough time with one sided balancing. I thought it was Wranglers luxury model, Its ride was a disappointment. The 430 Nav Stereo was a disappointment. It might have been better with the speaker upgrade. On my new  Jeep the ride is nice, It has the 17 inch wheels and softer suspension. The biggest surprise is the headliner in the 3 piece Hardtop, It really quiets the interior. The base stereo with sat radio sounds great. When I was dealing with a stereo shop with my Sahara To improve the sound, the tech said to always go with the standard stereo and put your own stereo in. But I do not think I will need one. I added the Sahara sidesteps, they really protect the side paint. I went for the automatic because I live in a big city, and rush hour can get real old . I went for the 3.21 rear end for better gas mileage. I added Trac-Loc so one day when somebody wanted to do some serious off roading, they could. If you are mainly a street driver, opt for the Unlimited Sport . It takes a few thousand miles for everything to smooth out and break-in. I purchased a black one,so everything blends in, including the painted pieces in the interior. I ordered the Sahara bumper appliques front and rear in Billet Silver which should add some nice contrast with the black paint for $174.  including tax from the dealer. The engine and transmission are so smooth. I love that it is a convertible, 4x4,and utility, or tow vehicle, so flexible. I love the way it drives. The Unlimited is not as squirelly as the 2 door, and has better safety ratings. I think I should have ordered the optional side airbags, maybe on the next one. I do not know how they would work out if you were doing serious off roading.",5
4604, on 01/08/16 13:05 PM (PST),Andrew Pearson ,2016 Jeep Wrangler SUV Unlimited Sport 4dr SUV 4WD (3.6L 6cyl 6M),Jeep for Life," July 2018 Update:  Jeep is running fine.  Just changed the oil again at 40000 miles.  I switched to full synthetic oil and since I got the Jeep, I change oil every 5000 miles religiously.  The hope is that the synthetic oil will afford better engine wear protection especially as it racks up age and mileage.  It also extends oil life; I could change oil at 7500 to 10000, but don't want to push it.  Changing oil basically twice a year isn't bad at all.  Walmart started carrying the OE Mopar oil filter elements which are cheaper there than at the auto parts places.  Some might argue that the Wix or other brands are better filters, but I figure if they put them in at the factory they are good enough.  As of this last oil change I need to rotate tires; I do that about every oil change, but no less than every 6000 miles.  Also when I rotate tires, I'm going to check brake pads all around.  The brakes have 40000 miles on them; haven't had any issues; no noises or change in stopping power, but the pedal is starting to feel squishy and I've noticed the e-brake seems easier to pull.  I plan to do a full brake inspection when I rotate tires and most likely I will replace brakes, but I need to decide if I will put OE pads back on or get a ""better"" set more suited for off-roading, towing etc.  Truthfully I don't know if there is any real difference between OE and aftermarket, but usually, the ""better"" brake pads are more expensive.  Just short of three years with the Jeep I'm still very satisfied with the quality, performance, and capability of-of the Jeep.  All machines at some point need repair and maintenance.  As the Jeep ages and accrues more mileage it will be interesting to see how it fares mechanically.  But for now ... Jeep on... Jeep for Life. OIIIIIIIO",4

I average around 16 mpg during the winter and 19 mpg in the summer (All Stock Setup, Automatic Transmission). Do not buy this car if your concision about fuel. Do not drive over 110km/h..you wont make it to your destination.Driving: Interior is stone age compared to 2007+ models. Sound system sucks, speakers are made out of paper..literally.

It is exceptionally fun to take the top down, go off road, and also handles great in the snow.

My last tank of gas indicated 24.6 mpg combined city/highway driving.(25.5 highest/21.5 lowest since owning it). The key to these numbers is driving habits - keep the rpms down.  The Jeep is a great compromise vehicle that won't do any one thing great, but can do everything pretty dang well (hauling 4 adults, towing trailers, off-road and snow capabilities, convertible option, etc.) It's the genuine utility vehicle that gives me a sense of confidence in its abilities when I drive it.",4.5

The Commander is an awesome vehicle with seating for 7 (we're a family of 5) that runs smoothly and quietly down the highway while being super capable off-road if you want to go there. It can transition from comfy highway cruiser to off-road beast instantly. We've taken ours over some of the highest 4x4 passes in Colorado without any trouble at all. We have also driven it in snow and ice with confidence. We've had no mechanical trouble other than having to have the main computer replaced around 30k miles (warranty). Fuel economy is poor averaging around 16 mpg combined but we expected that in a 7 passenger 4x4 SUV. Ours is equipped with the Boston Acoustics sound system but it could use more speakers in the rear of the vehicle. We own a 2015 Jeep Renegade 4x4 as well but it does not even begin to hold a candle to the Commander. Overall it has been a great vehicle and one that we plan to keep as long as possible.,5

The rear storage is not big either. For a big SUV, the layout of this truck is terrible. The transmission was garbage. Had to put a new one in and 100000 miles.

My Acura Legend ( a fantastic car) is still in the family with 270k (still original motor and trans ) on it, but by 180k it had a lot more work done on it than our commander, like new radiator, AC compressor, etc.  I also had a Jeep Grand Cherokee with a 4.7 V8 and it was great, with few problems until I sold it with 130k miles on it.

This is a heavy vehicle and moves with sureness down the highway or other roads.  Had a small thud in front end going over sharp speed bumps.  Had a suspension fellow look it over....given the overall excellent condition of this Commander, I had him rebuild the front end, struts and ball joints, tie rod ends, shocks all around, front transfer case shaft (rubber boot was cut) + new serpentine belt, all hoses and the transmission cooler lines needed replacement.  One bad item is that an oil seal is leaking in the transfer case (the seal costs about $20) -- not a bad leak but to fix it the transfer case must be removed and opened up because the seal is INSIDE of the case.  No other leaks.  The Hemi is buttery smooth with good power.  This thing rides and drives with good control and a secure feeling.  Given the Overland equipment it is a joyful experience with its luxuries and their user-friendliness, even on this '07 model.

4879, on 02/05/17 19:33 PM (PST),Charles Rockwell ,2009 Jeep Commander SUV Overland 4dr SUV 4WD (5.7L 8cyl 5A),Quite Expensive to Maintain Despite Warranty," We bought this car because for an extra $2500 you could get a lifetime bumper to bumper warranty just like a new car. Good thing we got the warranty because we have had to replace a cylinder head, a transfer case, a differential, the power steering hoses, and rain has a massive leak to the interior thought the windshield area. Sounds great with the warranty, right? Well, we were without a car for two months waiting for the transfer case, no Chrysler-Jeep technician will even look at the rain leak, and they charged us almost a thousand dollars to replace the power steering hoses, and another $680 for the differential despite the warranty. Chrysler and the dealer just make up what they want to cover under their bumper to bumper warranty as they go along. If you don't like it then hire an attorney and go sue them. On top of this you have all the wear and tear items like shocks that went 15,000 miles ($1100 to replace all four), and differential servicing every 16,000 miles at $720. Brakes cost $650 per axle, and $200 to bleed them. This Jeep is like maintaining an old Mercedes. The Hemi engine is nice, but not very smooth due to the 4 cylinder mode at light throttle. The Jeep has excellent traction in bad conditions and on Forest Service roads. The seats are comfortable but could use a tilt adjustment on the lower seat cushion and possibly a thigh cushion adjustment if they really wanted to go first class. The rear seats are short on leg room unless the front seat passengers cooperate. You cannot drive long distances with four tall people in the car, however if the rear seat passengers are children or smallish women there is no problem. The air conditioning is weak and if I lived in south Texas or Florida I would not buy this car for that reason alone. It is fine up to 95 degrees but struggles after that. My gas mileage is 12 mpg in city driving and 16 mpg on long trips driving 75 mph. Frankly, this warranty issues sour me on Fiat-Jeep-Chrysler. I have had similar issues with my Fiat warranty where the issue is obviously covered but they want to charge me anyway. The constant fighting with warranty costs and the lack of reliability will having me switching brands with my next purchase. Too bad because the car is fun to drive.",3

The Jeep was used as a test vehicle model for customers to drive.   It’s now July 21,2018 and we still own it with 94,000 miles. The only major mechanical problems we paid for was when the oil began to drip a little bit and had the seal replaced $300. Secondary it was the electrical braking system (EBS) and that cost us around $300 too.  The cowl panel that sits below the windshield wipers to keep moisture from rising up “Disintegrated”. I have no idea what happen to it. But we had no moisture problems leaking up from under The windshield anyway.  The back passenger door handle broke on the inside really easy when I bumped into it when loading up a 5 gallon bucket of edger blades into the back seat floor board to bring to the recycle plant. But now we have to replace the entire panel in order to open the door from the inside.   The Jeep is black too so in saying that the Florida sun has turned the fender flares almost bleach white from the 12pm-4pm sun beating down.

It will go just about anywhere with ease!  We have never once gotten stuck or lost control on slippery roads.  We always feel very safe in this vehicle.  Even our friends and family have commented that our Commander is one of the most comfortable vehicles that they have ever ridden in.  The front heated leather seats are amazing on those cold winter days and the Boston Acoustics premium sound system sounds amazing!  Our Commander has the premium entertainment package with the 6-disc CD changer, Sirius/XM satellite radio, and the backseat DVD player, which is nice bonus.

It is 10 years old now and I have driven it very little (just turned over to 60,000 miles).  During that time, I took immaculate care of it. Overall, it was a great car (despite the numerous factory recalls).  I love the design, layout and look of the vehicle.  The the interior and logic of the instrumentation is great.  It is very comfortable to drive and to ride in; both in the front, back seats and even in the 3rd seat.  The mileage is terrible (city 10.5mpg / hiway ~15mpg), but what do you expect for a heavy Jeep with a 5.8L HEMI.  All was magical in the land of Oz; that was until I hit 45,000 miles and had to replace the transmission ($4000).   Then I hit 60,150 miles and experienced a ""catastrophic engine failure"" last week.    I am really disappointed that the transmission in this car only lasted 45k miles and that the engine completely failed at 60k.  I am now torn between paying $10,000 for a completely new engine and try to get a few more years out of this beast or buy a more reliable new car.  if I do get a new car, it will not be a Jeep.",3

However this time Jeep has left me beyond disappointed with the 2006 commander. I bought mine in 2005 and at first it was incredible to drive and looked great. My Jeep still looks great but the problem is 75% of the time it just wont start. Its a good looking, paid for, sitting sculpture outside my house!! The transmission has been replaced once, the fuel pump has been replaced twice and the battery has been replaced 3 times and still no luck on finding the cause on why this great looking truck wont start. in this last year it has sat 90% of the year outside my house because everytime I get it towed to a shop and drop a significant amount of money to get it fixed it always comes back home to not start again. It seems a lot of people are having the same problems with these trucks and I have yet to find someone with the remedy to this problem so yeah. I have a 1994 grand Cherokee limited with so many miles people have to look twice and its starts and runs with no problem, my 2006 commander with very little mileage for its age doesn't start 75% of the time so yeah extremely disappointed this time around with my jeep purchase and its a shame because I really do like the style and comfort of it .",2

Scanning Crigeslist in the summer of 2015 I seen an opportunity buy on a 2006 4x4, 4.7 v8, (Base) with the tow package. The price was $2,800, that's correct, $2,800! With only 126k miles needless to say it needed some work, lol. I was the second caller and a high school aged female told me that if the first person didn't buy it she'd me call back. I thought, ""Well that one's gone"". She does call me back and says that the first person wanted to bring his mechanic back for a second opinion, but didn't leave a deposit. The things that make you go hmmm, lol. I go and see the Commander and it needs some body work, the interior is filthy, both front door handles are broken, needs rear anti sway bar bushings, and has broken exhaust manifold bolts on both sides, which could be mistaken for upper valve train noise. The bodywork needed didn't effect the sheet metal, but only the front slip, one fender flare, and the rear bumper, which I was able to repair. In ending, the majority of the work I did myself, like painting the front and rear bumpers and all fender flares with bedliner spray for about $75. Replacing both door handles, purchased from eBay for $65. I invested about $1,200 including fluid changes and a complete tuneup, which brought my total cost to about $4,000! Now that everything is done I cannot believe how well this vehicle drives and handles! I've owned a Jeep Grand Cherokee and in my opinion isn't as comfortable.

It was 1 year old and had less than 24,000 miles on it when we bought it.  It looks great, but a pretty vehicle hides lots of problems.  There is a design flaw in the drain tubes from the sun roof.  The drain tubes are so small that they clog very easily and are very difficult to access to clean.  When it's clogged, the water backs up through the hand-holds and drips into the cabin and soaks the floorboard.  The door handles are attached to the plastic back of the door panel and they break easily and you have to replace the entire door panel.  We've had to replace 3 of the 4 door panels to fix the doors so we can open them from the inside.  Both front seats wear unevenly and cause the plastic panel concealing the seat adjustment mechanics to break.  The leather seats crack and require custom seat covers or you'll have to shell out over $800 for a new replacement seat.  In short, Jeep should be ashamed of this product and we've decided that we will NEVER buy another Jeep product again!",2

I think I had my seats up about 3 times in 3 years for emergency kid transport. Not good for the long haul. Second, this thing is a truck; it rides like one, handles like one and goes like one. I have driven Tahoes and Explorers that are soooo much more comfortable to ride in and handle so much better. My CDR always felt top heavy.
