0, on 03/30/16 16:06 PM (PDT),Mike Ferrugi ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Slick Ride," The only negative about this vehicle is that even with the air temp dial at max cool, there is a tremendous amount of warm air coming in through the vent around the petals.  I suspect that the outside air duct must run close to the exhaust and they pick up temperature from that and it is the sent into the car.  To avoid this I engage the interior circulation mode, which eliminated the air flow.  Also, the vehicle does oversteer or plow when making hard turns.It is a very comfortable and enjoyable car for long distance driving.",4

I wanna start with the pros of this car. Looks are sharp! I mean my kalapana black eclipse turns heads all the time and gets me solid compliments. Its a nice little 4 banger perfect for me and my chick. Installed HID 8000k lights, LED interior and License plate LED,modded exhaust, and Cold Air Intake.",4.25
2, on 03/25/10 19:16 PM (PDT),Rob ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Love at first sight!, This car is awesome. The price was great! Especially for a car of this year and miles it came with. Before deciding to go for the Eclipse I looked at the Mustang and the Honda Accord Coupe but both these car lose in looks and Warranty. I'm thankful I bought this car even though its the GS model it comes with many standard features. It drives like a dream very fast and peppy for a 4cyl engine. Miles per gallon are okay considering the weight of this vehicle and the safety features. Great car for the money!,4.75
3, on 03/20/10 19:27 PM (PDT),rayhallnc ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Great Driving Sportscar, Lots of power and handles very well. GT with the rear fin gets a lot of looks and even questions as to what kind of car it is.  Read other comments and noted concerns about the short distance of the low beams. There is a switch on the dash to adjust this. I panicked the 1st night I drove mine.,4.625
4, on 01/30/10 06:51 AM (PST),Chas ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Love this car," This car is the best performance and style value on the market.  I looked at many others before deciding on the Eclipse GT Spyder.  This car is hands down the most fun to drive for the money you can buy. Why this car doesn't get more respect from the ""Professional Reviewers"" is beyond me.  Buy one, you will love it!",4.875
5, on 08/06/09 18:12 PM (PDT),Mulberrygal ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Last Hurrah," I have had 9 Nissans in a row, mainly Sentras. I was not happy with the new look they came out with so I checked Mitsubishi. One look at the 2009 Eclipse and I was in love. I am a grandma but not ready for the rocker. This car is fast becoming my favorite ever. Hot looking, (rave red) fun driving, didn't empty my trust fund to buy it and has one of the best warranties going. I am finding reasons to go out and drive it. My car insurance only went up $60 a year from my 2006 Sentra. How could you not love this car? ",4.875
6, on 06/11/09 21:01 PM (PDT),David ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),About My Eclipse," Drives very well, especially if have driven a manual before. Gas mileage is good 20-21 mpg in the city so far, haven't taken it out on a long drive. If you know how to shift properly you'll get better gas mileage and also know how to down shift to extend life on your brakes. I also have a motorcycle and that has helped me drive a manual transmission better. If you're complaining about your gas mileage it's because you're probably not shifting at the right RPMs. It could have used a few more compartments to place items maybe behind the seats etc.; other then that a very good vehicle. I love my car!!!!!",5
7, on 04/27/09 14:25 PM (PDT),Susan ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Fun to drive," This is the 2nd eclipse that I have owned.  I love this car.  I have had many sporty cars but this car is the most fun to drive.  I love the way it handles corners.  My only criticism is that I wish they could make the front end a little bit sportier.  I love the front of the Mazda RX-8.  I wish this front had more style like that but overall, a hot car that drives great. It's amazing in the snow.  People are always shocked to hear this but it's the truth.  If you want a fun, reliable car, I highly recommend the Eclipse.",4.625
8, on 03/25/09 12:48 PM (PDT),Delissa ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),Love this car!," Two weeks ago we traded our 2006 Eclipse GT in on a 2009 Eclipse GT.  I really like the looks of the dual exhaust.  Our old Eclipse had the automatic transmission and this time we opted for the 6-speed standard.  It seems to have so much more power than the automatic.  I don't know if they have made the back window larger, but it seems easier to see behind you when backing.  I feel sure we will enjoy the sun-roof when the weather is nicer and the Rockford-Fosgate stereo absolutely rocks! I love this car and think I'm hooked on Eclipses forever!",5
9, on 01/21/09 15:20 PM (PST),Nick ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),Good value," I haven't seen a better combination of performance, looks, and price than the 09 Eclipse GT.  It has more hp than the other cars in it's class, looks better (in my opinion), and in many cases is less expensive than other cars that less to offer.  ",4.375
10, on 12/03/08 18:14 PM (PST),Kate ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),my 09 eclipse, I love the way the car drives. Its definately a quick car. ,4.375

The 650W audio w/ subwoofer is really amazing! Good audio.  The truck is hard to close. Have to bang it real hard.   ",4.375
12, on 09/20/08 11:47 AM (PDT),ken ,2009 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 5M),I love my car, Great car.  Handles like a much more expensive sports car with sporty styling.  Great acceleration for a 4 cylinder and truly a fun drive.  It is a 2 door hatchback that makes you excited to go anywhere.  I couldn't be happier with it.,5
13, on 01/20/18 17:58 PM (PST),Chriss ,2012 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback SE 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Fun little car," Actually  my daughter purchased this car back in November, and I love it. The 4 cylinder motor isn't the fastest car on the road but it is really fun to drive. The sound system rocks and the heated seats are nice to have this winter. With a 10 inch bass cannon behind the back seat, the neighbors here us when we come and go. Lots of nice features with this car. Cannot comment on long term dependability since our 2012  has only 35,000 miles, but we love it so far.",4
14, on 06/22/17 03:44 AM (PDT),Sean ,2012 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS-Sport 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),"slow, heavy, cheap interior materials, gas guzzler"," do NOT buy this car unless you are a short female. the seats hurt you spinal cord, neck and hips like a mother-fkr! I regret purchasing this car. The looks are great don't get me wrong but the power is horrid with the 4cyl. Everything in the car is ghetto-cheap plastic. What was Mitsubishi thinking???????? My spinal cord hurts now as I type this in my home. The car has destroyed my body. I've seen chiropractors, acupuncturist galore... I have owned the car 5 years and planning on buying an SUV just so my body can heal! I'm really heartbroken w/Mitsubishi. The End. Ps. If you do buy one make sure it's 6cyl and please be short or your body WILL suffer!",2
15, on 06/09/17 11:17 AM (PDT),Janice Kahn ,2012 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS-Sport 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Mitsubish Eclipse," This car was listed as an automatic but it's a stick shift.   It made a horrible noise when I was driving it and the salesman said they'd have the shop look at it.  Although listed with blue tooth, there is no blue tooth.  Although listed with a sun roof, there was no sun roof. The stick shift's numbers were all rubbed off.  The salesman suggested I write them back on.  The car looked well enough cosmetically.  Just minor dings and scratches.  It was just ok, nothing special. The price was listed at one price and I was going to buy it buy they added on over $2000. for I don't remember what.  Bringing the price well over the original price.  When I told them that the price was listed much lower they gave me excuses but refused to lower it so I passed on it.  As I told them, it was a stick shift, when I wanted automatic, there was no blue tooth, so I'd have to change out the radio.  And the car was nothing special to purchase it at the price they wanted.  So I passed.",3
16, on 05/18/18 06:56 AM (PDT),Christopher (KING) Miller ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),Love it or hate it, honestly buying this car was the best thing I've ever done. It's a sports car for somebody who can't afford high-end sports cars. the V6 engines got a lot of power the Transmissions very easy to use and regardless of what you've read on fuel economy I averaged about 22 miles to the gallon. The Hydraulics for the back hatch go out which is expected in hatchbacks. the clear coat on the paint has faded which is also to be expected at that time of painting. and it almost a hundred thousand miles the clutch needs to be replaced. all these things are to be expected from a vehicle that's almost a hundred thousand miles and over 10 years old. altogether if you find one in decent working condition it's well worth the buy.,5
17, on 04/08/17 18:07 PM (PDT),Paul Workmaster ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Driving my Eclipse makes me feel young again," I bought a 2006 brand new and it has been a great little car. Very dependable and a lot of fun to drive. For a 4 cylinder engine it has a lot of spunk when coupled with my 5 speed transmission. I'm over 6' tall and still have adequate leg room in the front seats. The back seat room is non-existent though. On a positive note the trunk room with the rear seat folded down is big enough to haul some fairly large items. I previously owned 3 other Eclipses: a 1992, a 1995, a 2001 and this one. I'd buy another one but they don't make them anymore.",5
18, on 07/29/15 22:36 PM (PDT),Kurtis Kelley ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 5M),I love this car, i absolutely love this cari an a die hard chevrolet fan but I saw this little spieys car had to have it I own newer monte carlo with the big v-6 and this little 4banger will leave it in the dust I'm a retired 40 year old military vet and I'd buy another eclipse today,5
19, on 03/31/15 15:02 PM (PDT),Ømar Chafee ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Amazing Car.," I had a dark red 06 Eclipse GT with that ""rare"" black strip going down the front bumper. It was a beautiful car I bought a nice spoiler for it too. It really drove great, I had it from 75 K miles to 115 K miles until it was hit by a drunk driver, totaling it. It gave me small minor problems throughout the time I've had it but that's almost what's to expect from any used car near or over 100 K. My car door sometimes wouldn't close, I had to get it a new battery because the battery I had was very weak.. ect. The sound quality is absolutely magnificent. That speaker in the trunk really gives the overall sound an extra punch. Acceleration is great. I liked nearly everything about this car.",4.375
20, on 01/12/15 18:05 PM (PST),garyf2132 ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Wicked Awesome Eclipse," I purchased a 2006 Eclipse GS Automatic with only 60,000 miles on it just last week. It came equipped with the Rockford Fosgate premium stereo system with subwoofer. I'm in love with this car literally. It's a real head turner. Acceleration is fantastic especially when pulling onto the highway or changing lanes, plenty of power to zoom around. The blue colored dash lights are a wicked cool feature. The bucket seats give it that extra sporty feel. The stereo system doesn't come with an AUX input jack unfortunately but I purchased an OEM Mitsubishi cable online so I will install it myself into the rear of the stereo system. Overall I love this car & wouldn't trade it for anything.",4.5
21, on 06/16/14 01:57 AM (PDT),alex195 ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),eclipse gt," Ive had my eclipse for 3 months now and it's been a bast to drive! Bought it used with 130 000km on it. Painted the front center black, fake diffuser black to make it look real, and the roof too, and put ralliart badges on. Had no problems with the engine, however... the cheap sh*t door handles did break and even the new ones make that bending plastic quealing noise, the cheap plastic key also broke, and so did the cheap plastic a/c control. But that's why it costs so little, you do get a great 3.8L v6 that could use a little more power if your used to driving high hp vehicles, but if your not its more then enough. It always pulls in any gear with no hesitation but road noise is horrendous!!",4.375
22, on 03/23/12 16:07 PM (PDT),joey45 ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Overall A Good Buy," This is a fun car to drive and a headturner for sure. I have 62K on the car and have had virtually no problems except one big problem.My breaks became spongy after 50K. Since it was past the 5 year warrenty I had to pay for the repairs myself. Bleeding the breaks worked for a few months, then the problem came back. Next, it was thought to be the master cylinder, that was replaced and then the problem came back after a few months. Now all thats left is the booster, which may be faulty. So overall this problem is going to end up costing me over $800.Also outside trim/molding for this car is HORRBle. It was worn out after only 6 1/2 years. Cost to fix? $925",4
23, on 08/17/11 12:25 PM (PDT),tombrater ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),Amazing!," Okay...I have only had this car for a week. I bought it used with 55k miles. I will update this if I run into any problems, but I am confident that I won't have to. The car looks sweet and turns heads. I took the Eclipse lettering off of the back to create an extra clean look. It is extremely powerful and responsive with acceleration and handling thanks to the 6 speed manual transmission. The RF sound system is one of the best systems I have heard. The car feels sturdy too. No rattles out of the hatchback or anywhere for that matter. The blue instrumental lighting is nice too. As for the person that paid $300 per tire, I found good year 18in tires for $140, and that was brand new.",4.875
24, on 01/14/10 00:54 AM (PST),TxFemme ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),Awesome Compromise," I bought my Eclipse used with 17K miles on it. I now have 29K and it has not so much as hiccuped. It's powerful, fun to drive, and I get compliments almost daily. The RF system is AWESOME, best stock system I've ever owned (and there have been many). It's a relatively comfortable ride for a sports car and I've taken it on several long road trips. The backseat is best suited for those under 5'4"" but at least it has one. The curb weight gives the car a substantial, safe feel. The stock tires are not as sticky as I'd like in slippery conditions. Probably the main negative point for me is the turning radius. Also, the powerful engine combined with FWD equals major torque steer at times.",4.75
25, on 06/21/09 10:44 AM (PDT),Puglove ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 4A),Can't wait to sell it, I bought my Eclipse new and the second week I had a tick in the engine and my exhaust rattled.  The dealer had no explanation for the tick except to change the oil...did nothing.  My CD changer went out in year 3.  The air conditioning controls also went out...the fan works but no cold air except for #1 on the dial. I now also have some loud rubbing noise coming from the back end.  When driving it sounds like something is open as you hear all road noises.  When it rains something in the hatch leaks.  The gas mileage is good however and this car has pep even with the air on (if the air works that is).  This is my first foreign car and will be my last. Mits has made me frown on foreign.,3
26, on 02/16/09 10:02 AM (PST),Jayme ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Dependability," This was the 1st 2006 sold in the Middle TN area and my 2nd Eclipse. I now have 57,000 miles and is still going strong. The original brakes squealed and had to replace with ceramic brakes. It is extremely quick and fun to drive. The sound system is top notch but the display could be a little more sophisticated.  The original tires have lasted 57,000 miles and just now need to be replaced. If only the resale value was better.",4.875
27, on 01/19/09 17:07 PM (PST),Jeremy ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Explore other options," I bought this car new and recently my car was tied up at a dealership for 4.5 mo. for an input shaft bearing that failed, ruining my input shaft seal, clutch and burned my flywheel. NONE WAS COVERED UNDER THE 10yr/100,000mile powertrain warranty you are supposed to get with the vehicle! The interior is easily marked, scratched. Cheap materials on panels and dash. Gauges are accurate, suspension is ok, I've driven better, and worse for stock. Wheel well gap looks a little funny unless you lower the car or larger rims. I would advise looking at other options or be aware of possible bills with this car. hope this helps.",3.5
28, on 01/06/09 12:29 PM (PST),randmanx ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),One Sleeper Of  A Car ," I bought the car used for 14k. I wouldn't pay the price for it new as it's a loaded gt v6, but it's a solid choice for the price. It's very quick and puts a grin on my face every time I mash the accelerator! I had a 98 gsx that was totaled by a deer in December and never thought another car could top that one. But I'm sold, the 06 gt is way nicer.",4.75
29, on 10/22/08 05:01 AM (PDT),DrWankel ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),So So of a car," Bought the new gen GT with sun & sound pkg when it first came out and was enjoying it for awhile till just after 2 months the front brake rotors warped.  Brought it in to the dealer and after threats I got the rotors warrantied. 2 months later again warped, replaced with aftermarket never again had a problem.  The Radio? what's up with the display? my girl's saturn has a much better read out, I mean top of the line fact Rockford come on, bad design. NOT EVEN AN IPOD JACK (dealer offers an ipod setup for a cheap $230?!)  For a car with its decent performance, the fact tires suck in every way I had to upgrade those too! Overall not impressed, I would never ever buy another.",3.375
30, on 10/09/08 11:41 AM (PDT),TB Hart ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Pure Passion," The exterior style of this vehicle is a stopper, inch for inch, its sleek and impressive lines has on more than I care to count explicit compliments from ladies and strangers on the street.  The performance of this machine is so fantastic.  When one needs power, there is more than one could hope for in a smaller vehicle.  I have an automatic and can burn rubber when I punch it at 25 miles per hour.  One minor downside is its blind spot, but the mirrors are well designed to compensate.  When one sits in this car and turns on the dynamic sound system, one feels as if one is truly ""one"" with the vehicle.  I love driving  on winding, country roads..this baby hugs the pavement.",4.75

I am on my second Eclipse-just love the RF music system, and the way you just want to drive this car constantly!  The downside of the 2006 Eclipse GT is that the tires need to be replaced much too soon in comparison to other ""Low Pro"" enhanced vehicles.What ever happened to 36,000 miles for tire life expectancy? I have 11,000 miles on my car, and at $309 per tire? I hope that the new Chevy Camaro is out for my next purchase!",4.75
32, on 06/17/08 13:08 PM (PDT),ink ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),I love this car!," I bought this car in 2006 straight off the truck (literally). I'm one of about 5 people in a 50 mile radius that even owns a 4G Eclipse, there is no torque steer if you don't floor it from a dead stop. Handling issues are pretty much B.S., I took a turn going 60 mph with no problems haha, and I can go through curves at 75 mph, so whatever. Noisey exhaust? haha it's an import - hello!!!! ",5
33, on 06/01/08 10:52 AM (PDT),azkid ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),Stunning Car," This is an extremely beautiful car. This would be my first car and i am very surprised by what this car has to offer. Sure the back seat is practically useless, but hey, it's a sports coupe! Go get a sedan if you're looking to haul around family and friends. This car gives pretty decent mileage and the turning radius is not as bad as everyone claims it to be. This car is an amazing value. Lots to offer for the price. The Gt has PLENTY of power and the sportronic  transmission works very smoothly. Also, interior is stunning at night time. Wouldn't want any other car for a first car than the eclipse.",4.875
34, on 05/16/08 21:54 PM (PDT),Decseh ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 5A),GT Auto," Hot looking car, very fun to drive.  Car is hungry to go fast all the time.  The 5 speed auto with sportshift is fun to drive, if you leave it in auto mode it shifts fast to provide better speed/acceleration.  Awesome sound system.  Nice leather interior.  Great for someone who just rides themselves or maybe one other person.  For 263 hp the cars gas mileage isn't too bad.  I drive mostly city and I'm getting about 16-17 mpg and probably about 25 on the highway.  That's driving with a lead foot too.  I don't want to get rid of this car because there's not another car on the market that compares to it.  Goes great in the winter as well with the FWD system.",4.625

Owned an Eagle Talon in '92. Decided on the 4cyl due to the gas mileage. The car takes curves nicely and there is no lack of power. Wish I had upgraded to the 6c and the better sound system. ,4

The Eclipse is stronger than my 300M was, and very sharp looking with the ground effects.  I LIVE in my car (thus the RV part of my title). I drive 130 miles/day round trip to work. 2000-mile roundtrip road trips a couple of times/year, without disappointment; 50000 in 20 months!  It has excellent handling and performance, although difficult to park.  It consistently gets 28 mpg as long as I don't drive like a fool. Seat heat & ""vibrating massage"" from the 650w speaker are also nice on road trips.  The car is built for one person, although passenger will enjoy seat heat/leg room, but no power seat.",4.625
39, on 12/03/07 08:48 AM (PST),BartD ,2006 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.8L 6cyl 6M),Happy With the Car.," I have had the car for almost 2 years. I have had no mechanical problems with it and still has the same power as when I got it from the dealer. The only problem was my driver seat motor broke, and squeaky brakes. But all were replaced under warranty. I'm happy with the car, but I am getting tired of squeezing passengers in. The road/wind noise is also starting to get to me. When you first purchase the car your notice the wheel gap is huge. While on the mitsu posters/commercials there is none. Lower the car to make it look better. I have gotten nothing but compliments for this car. It is great,strong engine, quality seats, and fun to drive but it is not very economical",4.375

So far, it still performs like it did when I first got it.  It's running great!  I'm totally satisfied with my vehicle.  The only improvement I made last month was getting a new set of tires.  Got the Kumho ultra high performance (slightly wider than the original Goodyears).  And, it certainly was worth the money - rides even better!

The four cylinder loves to rev, has adequate performance. I have 15k on the car on everything is great on it. Everybody loves my car. People think it is nice. The quality of the interior is fairly good. The optional Rockford Fosgate system booms with sound. The ride is comfortable. The steering is nicely weighted. But I hope you don't plan on using that back seat. Only children or small toddlers can tolerate it. I'm over six foot, trust me, you'll go nuts in the back seat. When it comes to cargo time, this car ain't too bad. I hauled a new boxed computer in it and monitor and it fit just right. The car in my opinion is a car that is a looker.",4.875

It handles great and has one of the best safety ratings. Stock, its component sound system is great. I have completely redone new speakers all the way around plus 2 subs which improved the sound, which is great still using the factory head unit. The 4 wheel ABS with front wheel drive is great especially for those tight turns. As for a 2.4L 4 cyl with 162 horses under the hood isn't bad for a stock 4 cyl. Hey the gas mileage is great if you use premium gas. If you use low grade, you will burn gas faster and probably reduce your mpg by 5%. If you want to greatly improve your mpg horsepower and torque do what i did... add a cold air intake & full exhaust.",4.75

The additional horsepower and torque are a welcome addition.  The change to a sensor instead of manual throttle linkage spoils the driver's input on the manual transmission version.  When the variable timing will kick in, becomes a guessing game and can have some unpredictable results.  The lower first gear combined with 50-60 extra pounds of torque makes for a quick start, but during rush hour traffic, this is more of a hazard.  Add bigger brakes for the extra weight.  All of the new features related to computerization and sensors are probably better suited to the automatic transmission.  They interfere with those of us that actually want to drive the car.",4.75

This is deffinitely a car that holds its own on the streets.  And it turns plenty of heads as you drive by in style.  Just don't plan on taking a few friends out for the night.  Maybe one in the back, but that's all the backseat is going to fit comfortably.  And that's if they recline in the whole seat with their legs up in the seat.  It's tiny back there.

It has a great look and style. Then it started having problems.  The fuel injection wasn't working correctly.  At first I though that the warranty would cover the problem, but it ended being caused by a bad tank of fuel. It caused a lot of damage to different parts of the car.

Mitsubishi decided that it was aparrently my fault, not that it might be the design (which I had a Nascar tech tell me was going to be a problem three days after I got it, during an interview for school).  Anyway I forked out almost $1,000 and that's after I got a price break because I knew a maintenace person at the dealer.  Any way they fixed it.  Two days later it was back in the shop.

We understand this doesn't affect the operation of the vehicle but it is disheartening to spend so much money and hate to drive your vehicle so much. 3. Paint chipping off and fading, all over the car. Mitsubishi says we got behind a rock truck, two body shops say the paint job is cheap and defective. 4.

I raced an Audi A-6 2.7 V6 Twin-Turbo with an automatic transmission. The Eclipse is faster off the line and will hold the A6 through the quarter, assuming you don't burn out too much.

Not because of any quality issues, but because it came in AWD.  For the price, however, the Eclipse was a much better buy.  It's also a sharper looking coupe than the TT - it really gets noticed!

It's excellent on gas (which is a plus at these prices). Its warms up fast in cold weather, but fishtails a little in the snow (which I do not like). Overall, for the price, it's worth it.

I have never been happier with my car, it's stylish enough for me and affordable, gets good gas mileage in my opinion, and is a smooth ride and yes I'll admit I've had it at its max 155 on a interstate, it rides very smooth even at that speed. If only it didn't have so much weight in it. 3550 lbs is a lot for a sports car and makes cornering devastating on your tires unless you take them extremely slow.

Even though the ride is tight, its not too hard. And all around mpg is always over 20. There are problems though.

As a high school teenager who never knew how to maintain a vehicle, I ran this car to the ground. Never gave it an oil change until after about 70k miles. All I did was add more oil to it when the light came on. I've learned since then lol. Although... I never had any issues with it within those miles. Finally blew a gasket after 300,000 miles due to a water pump leak I didn't know about (more behind that reason) and had to get rid of it as it was unbelievably expensive to repair.

114, on 01/05/17 17:34 PM (PST),John Griffith ,2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GTS 2dr Hatchback (3.0L 6cyl 4A),A great car that seems to last forever. . .," What can I say about this car?  It has been an excellent and fun daily driver for the past 14 years and is still going strong.  I have owned it since new and it has never let me down.  Oh sure there was an occasional flat or dead battery but those are maintenance items.  Keep up with the maintenance on it and it wont have any problems.  I don't think the car has ever actually failed.  It always starts right up no problems, when the battery was good that is.  I've gone through oh 4-5 batteries on it.  5 timing belts and one transmission. The transmission?  yes that did eventually fail . . . at ~320,000 miles!  I don't really think of that as a failure, just wear and tear.  It was worn out.  The guy working on it said he had never seen such wear.  Even in that state It didn't leave me by the side of the road.  I was able to drive it to a shop,  it was just acting funny,  like taking 5 seconds to shift.  Even so, 320K miles for a transmission is hard to beat in any car.  I have no complaints.   I'm not kidding this car has 377 thousand miles on it.  Original engine, and never been overhauled.   It did have lifter tick (very noisy) at 220K but I replaced the lifters (lash adjusters), which is a job you can do just under the valve covers, and it has not been an issue since.  Overall I'd say the build quality of the car is super high given the longevity I've gotten out of it.  There is very little rust on the car too.  The ride is solid and smooth as can be, even at interstate speeds.  Just keep it aligned and replace the shocks when they are due.  Again maintenance.   I trust this car as my daily driver to get me to work every day.  The engine is still strong and can still accelerate hard when I need it to.  It still gets 26-27 miles to the gallon if you aren't a lead foot.   If you keep it maintained this car will last a long time.  It does lack a bit in the radio department compared to today's radios but still sounds great.  What the radio doesn't do is bluetooth or have an aux input or navigation.   If you want all that you can upgrade it easily as it is a standard 2-din (size) radio.  All the stock speakers save one are still in it and sound great.  The only speaker to fail me was the one in the center of the dash and that was due to direct sunlight and age drying out the cone.  If you disconnect that speaker however you really don't miss it.  I do think I will need to eventually overhaul the engine, one day, I'm not deluding myself there.   Just not tomorrow.  The last shop I had it at told me the compression is still good and within factory spec.  It is starting to leak/burn oil though.  What else can I expect  from it . . . it is positively ancient in miles.   I suspect the valve stem seals are the cause, I never replaced them. .  Again I have no complaints,  it has held up so well over the years that if it is only now in need of that after all those miles, I'll just smile and pay some shop to fix it.  Its better than a new car payment and this car still looks good.  Most people never guess that it has that many miles on it unless I tell them and they they do a double take and still don't believe it.  I get it a lot from the shops that service it.  One last thing, don't ever skip an oil change and don't put anything less than premium in it.  I put mid-grade 89 in it ONCE back in 2005 I think. . . never again.   The mileage dropped to about 20 MPG and it ran like a PIG.  I shudder to think what 85 would have done.  I saved 10% cost on the gas (30 cents on 3$) but had to use 35% more gas to get where I needed to be (27 vs 20 mpg).   It is counter intuitive to some, but you actually save money using the premium gas.  That and the car will behave better and actually pass other cars when you need it.  Use the gas it was designed to use.",5

I recently traded it in for a brand new Mazda3 which is also fantastic, but I often find myself missing the Eclipse even though my Mazda3 is fully loaded and is very fun to drive itself! The car drove extremely well but certainly was not meant to be tuned as it wasn't fast and the engine was.... interesting to work on to say the least. That's certainly not saying that it was not fast enough to pass other cars with ease when called upon.She was an absolute head turner, I powder coated the stock rims black and put limo tint on the windows which REALLY made her stand out from the crowd. When I had the sunroof flipped out, she was one of the sportiest cars on the road. I didn't have the leather interior but it was still perfect with how Mitsubishi laid everything out. The sound package that came with her was fantastic and I never needed to touch it as it was spot on. I did, however, swap the head unit with something more modern (bluetooth). Mechanically, this car was partially sound. Downsides were replacing wearing parts such as the timing belt (yes, it has a timing belt in the v6) and maintaining the suspension which became a headache near the end of my ownership. The cruise control solenoid failed near the end too, which left the ""Cruise"" light on and the actual unit unusable.Another issue that apparently a lot of Mitsu's have is the engine burning and leaking oil, which at 139,000 miles on mine was a serious problem, every gasket on the engine was leaking oil (head gasket, valve cover gasket, oil pan gasket, and even the main rear seal which was NOT WORTH IT TO FIX AT ALL). I did a lot of the maintenance work on it myself such as replacing a cracked radiator which resulted from road debris, the front bumper which a truck backing out of a parking spot poked a hole into with their hitch, replacing spark plugs and cleaning the intake. I can't say my knees didn't take a beating from doing this work as a result of the v6, but at the end of the day it was easy and Mitsubishi designed this car to be easy to maintain and allowed me to cut my teeth on car maintenance for the first time. It had very slight rust issues but that's easy to overlook because it only affected specific parts of the car.I love this car and would recommend it to anyone. I enjoyed it and still really miss her, wish that I could have kept her but the dealer gave me a trade-in offer that I couldn't pass up. I hope if anyone ever owns my car in the future, they can fix her up properly and give her a garage that I always wish I could have provided. :)",4
117, on 01/11/16 23:57 PM (PST),Nate ,2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GS 2dr Hatchback (2.4L 4cyl 5M),Worst mistake I ever made.," Bought this car for $4,000 in 2012, with 80,000 miles on it. I must have got a bad one. I had to replace coil packs shortly after buying it, and a main bearing in the engine went out as I was driving down the interstate and it began knocking. I barely got it home. Had to replace the engine, clutch, motor mounts, hoses, plugs, wires, coil packs, control arms, drive shaft, and a few other things by 102,000 miles. Then shortly after, the transmission had a bearing go out, and had to replace the tranny, alternator, and tierods by 112,000 miles. Had a few misc. issues, the hatch supports that hold the trunk lost pressure and had to be replaced, the seatbelt dinger stopped working, check engine light came on, starter became weak, headlights fell apart and had to be replaced (couldn't see more than 15 feet in front of my car), and for some reason the passenger side headlamp would burn out every 2 months. The front turn signals had to be replaced because they got water in them and corroded the socket, causing the turn signals to malfunction. This car just seemed like it was one problem after the next, and I lost my rear end on this car when I finally sold it, with 125,000 miles. I also noticed that the car had a weird shift link up. The engine would drop its RPM almost immediately after pushing the clutch to shift, then would jerk when letting it out after getting the car in gear. When starting out, it would vibrate really bad when letting the clutch out. The steering would pull to the left, unless I got on it, which would cause it to go straight, until I let up on the gas. The car was not equipped with ABS, and was incredibly dangerous to drive in snow. One inch would cause it to fishtail from behind, unless I pumped the breaks, which was difficult in some situations.",1

Comparing to the Grand Prix 1997 which I used to have, it's slightly worse on the snow because it's a lot lighter weight, so have to drive with more caution. I have a GS edition with automatic transmission and it's awesome, it's really fast and like I mentioned before very agile on the road.

The brakes are of moderate quality and durability.  The window tint started peeling within 50,000 miles.  The hatchback is tough to open and won't stay up in cold weather.  The interior poorly designed - I reach too far for many things.  The plastic interior takes a beating.  The plastic hooks for the floor mats break easily.  Also, the blind spot is a major issue and the A/C (when working) saps much engine power.  On small bumps, I bottom out the nose.  But man, at 60 mph, the acceleration is great.",3.875

I bought this car used with 30,000 miles.  I have wanted one of these vehicles for years, and I am loving it.  Yes, there are terrible blind spots, but not a problem in you use all three of your mirrors and stay aware of the road.  My main complaint is the already mentioned turn radius, which is practically nothing.  I would definitely recommend the V6 GTS.  I drove a 4-cyl. and it had no pickup, with the weight of this car.

I've owned it for almost 5 trouble-free years now, and have loved it.  It got me up a steeeeeep, winding, thickly-snowed & untreated hill last winter (passing other, struggling cars), and on nice dry days it has plenty of muscle beneath the pedal when I need it (although the torque-steer took some getting used to).  This car is also perfect for short people (like me): the ""butt"" part allows quite a bit of vertical movement, so you can sit much higher than in other sporty cars.",4.25

I chose the Eclipse because money was an issue as I was fresh out of college and Mitsubishi was offering zero payments for a year and a lower APR than Acura thereafter.  Plus the RSX was in its first run while this model of Eclipse was in its second.  I figured Mitsubishi would have worked out some kinks by the second generation of that model.  Overall I have been pretty pleased by the performance and mechanical build of the engine and drivetrain.  I have issues however with the shoddy plastic quality of the dash, doors, trunk lining, etc.  The interior is a synch to scratch with keys, luggage & other cargo.",3.5

I wanted a Celica but couldn't fit in one comfortably. The Eclipse is very comfy and easy on the back for anyone sitting in the front.  Definitely not a 4 seater.  Avoid 4 adult occupancy at all costs.  The acceleration leaves something to be desired but is decent for a 4 cylinder.  For the price I found this to be real good buy, styling and comfort were big for me and this car met those easily.  I don't know why everyone rips on the interior.  I personally like it.

The car now has 53k on it and I have only had to replace the front breaks. No problems since then w/ anything mechanical. But, for essentially a two-seat sports car it could be faster. The seats should also be more supportive and less cushiony.  The suspension is noticable soft/bouncy and feels more like you're in a sedan than a sleek hatchback. It also turns like a Mac truck (40+ ft turning radius!) overstear also becomes a problem w/ more spirited driving. Consider the Acura RSX as well if you are considering a Mitsu. ",4

I have no gripes at all with this car.  It has great acceleration, has great handling and excellent performance.  I enjoy the sun and sound package and the interior midnight blue leather combo looks great.  If you can afford a few extra grand, definitely go for the GTS model.    In my opinion, Eclipses blow Mustangs away; they are much better looking, more reliable and just made with better materials (Mustang is mostly fiberglass).   The only drawback is gas mileage, but we don't buy sports cars for mileage. ",4.625

181, on 06/10/16 08:07 AM (PDT),Dave ,2004 Mitsubishi Eclipse Hatchback GT 2dr Hatchback (3.0L 6cyl 5M),"Used to love, now I hate"," I bought my 2004 Eclipse GT (5 speed Manual) brand new from the Dealership in April, 2014.  It had 6 miles on it when I test drove, 18 miles at sale.  Everything was great about it at first and it is still fun to drive, but the honeymoon is long since passed.I had owned it for less than 1 year when the air hose came unclamped causing debris to get into the intake manifold and the check engine light came on.  I had to fight with the dealership to get it covered under warranty.  When they finally relented, they said that my warranty was voided due to an issue with the title.  So my manufacturer warranty never paid for a dime of anything that ever went wrong with the car.  It would turn out to not cover many other things.After I had owned the car for 5 years (fall, 2009) there was a heavy rain.  A large amount of water got into the floor on the passenger side.  Conveniently, the amplifier for the stock stereo system sits under the passenger seat and was destroyed by the rain.  I had to disconnect the battery and remove the media fuse as it was making loud crackling through the speaker system despite the car being off.  Again, not covered under warranty and so I have lived without a radio for almost 7 years now.  The car still gets water in it during heavy rain so I have to park under cover whenever I can.Around the same time, in 2008 or 2009, since the car is black, the paint began to peel off.  Most of the car now is primer gray, with a large amount of rust on the roof of the vehicle.  There was eventually a recall and if your car was covered under warranty, they would repaint it for free.  Since I had no warranty, I got an offer for about $130 to repaint which obviously was insufficient.  I never bothered to get the paint fixed since remediating the rust first was going to be expensive.  So my car is a giant eye-sore now.Not long after that, I believe in 2011 or so, the check engine light came on for oxygen sensors and also for misfiring.  Apparently the electronic distributor had gone bad and needed to be replaced.  It had to be replaced again in 2015.  No warranty, big expense. Also in 2011, the heater started to quit working.  I paid over $3000 between a dealership and two other shops and they never could fix the issue.  The thermostat was replaced twice and a valve switch in the heater core was replaced.  It turned out that there was a lose solder joint in the electronics in the dash that needed to be redone, but I found and fixed that myself after the fact.  Never had an issue with the heat after that point.  I can't believe that they couldn't find that after $3000 of unnecessary repairs.  But driving in the winter without defrost is not an option, so I was forced to pay it.In 2014, I think, my timing belt had failed while I was driving and needed replacement.  I had less than 80,000 miles on the car at the time (I was in the military and in college during the first 7 years I owned the car so I didn't accumulate many miles) but again, no warranty so I had to eat the cost.  The mechanic said I was lucky that the engine didn't throw a rod and destroy the car as I was on the freeway at 60 mph when it happened (I lost power and had to be pushed to the side of the freeway by a police officer).For me, this car has been nothing but trouble.  I still love to drive it and it still runs great.  Although it has never handled well in rain or snow, the brakes lock up extremely easily (I thought it had anti-lock brakes but apparently it doesn't?) in even the smallest amounts of rain.  The MPG has always been terrible, even on long road trips on the highway.  In the city it barely makes 270 miles per tank and on the highway it's rarely above 350.  Since it requires premium fuel, it's an expensive car to keep fueled up.  But the car accelerates well, corners well, and has a great sound to it.  I just wish everything else about the car wasn't so cheap.I will never buy another Mitsubishi again, that's for sure.",2

The interior is some what bland, but the curves of the dash and panels keep you entertained, although the interior pattern is ugly. Performance on this, for a 2.0l DOHC L4, is awesome!

I've had to get a new fuel pump, radiator hose, timing chain, and brake pads. It's still fun to drive although the pick up has declined, and it seems like some piece of plastic falls off the interior all the time. The paint job hasn't proven hardy, either, and rain occasionally leaks through the hatch opening. It's hard for older people to sit down, but once they do it's pretty comfortable.",4.25

This is a beautiful car but it has low performance. The 420A inline 4 has amazing economy, it hits about 230-310 miles per full tank depending how you drive.

I've seen some pretty wicked 95-99 eclipses with body kits and turbo's..all aftermarket stuff. My only gripes are the few minor repairs i've had to have done to it. The Check Engine light was on due to some wires gone bad, and a little corrosion. Overall, Im pretty happy about my purchase, and i look forward to having this car for years to come!",4.5

I do drive it hard and fast, in excess of over 100mph at least 5 days a week,and a few miles at a time. I can honestly say it handles great at hi speeds in breaking and cornering. I've had only minor things go out: motor in power mirror while under warrenty, and drivers side door handle break twice also while under warrenty. I like my eclipse so much I want to trade it in for the 99' GSX - all wheel drive turbo virson which I wish I could have afforded in the begining.",4.5

Gas mileage hovered around 28-30 on my trips which consisted mostly of highway driving. I sold it about a year ago after I let a friend of mine drive it and he burnt up the clutch.

My dash was so severely damaged from the sun, chunks of it were caving in.  I have seen 30 year old cars in junk yards with dashes in better condition.   Had to buy an expensive cover for it. Transmission got very loud at about 5 years old so I had all bearings replaced and new clutch.  Less than a year later the throw out bearing went and it was back for new bearings and another clutch within a year of it breaking.  CV joint snapped while driving it about 5 months ago and took me it the oil filter which caused a big oily mess in the middle of a very busy intersection where it broke down. Clutch master cylinder broke and car had to be towed for that to be replaced. Axle seals have been replaced 4 times with after market and factory seals and still leak, huge mess in driveway from axle fluid. I had never even heard of a car needing axle seals to be replaced before this. Headlights were terrible from the day I got it so I drove around with high beams on all the time to see anything at all at night.  Replaced those with aftermarket lights and they are much better.  Floor and rear wheel wells are rotting out along with bottom of rear quarter panel on passenger side.  Roof had some rust/rot forming that was repaired. At 4 years old the power steering pump died, $700 part alone.  Valve cover gasket and strut mounts also had to be replaced at that time.  Sunroof motor has never been able to open sunroof on its own without me having to push it up to open it.  Key fobs fell apart and had to be replaced after only a few years.  2015 has had at least $4000 of repairs to this car with at least two dozen visits to mechanics in last 6 months.  I have probably forgotten to include many other repairs it has needed. I have now had the car for a little over 10 years and it has been a problem from the start.  Now, something new seems to break every time I drive it.

It had an AEM Cold Air Intake, Headers, & Performance Exhaust.

My 0-60 time is anywhere between 7.0 - 6.8 seconds which is pretty good for the price I paid for this car. You cannot find a turbo or supercharger for this car easily but if you are satisfied with bolt-ons you can expect to get a few gains outta this 3.0L.

The remix edition came with a great option package for the money. Anyone buying an Eclipse won't be disappointed. For a female driver it is a perfect comfort fit size wise. The interior seems to be better put together than the previous body style was.

At 142,000, the factory turbo is still working just fine. Just make sure you don't miss the regular oil changes and keep up with your maintenance and the car will continue to work well for you.  At 10 years old, there is no rust and everything works.

In stock form it is merely adequate, due in part to this car's cumbersome weight.  Acceleration is good enough to give you decent passing ability. Handling is very sharp, and the GS/GST/GSX versions have front and rear anti-sway bars.  Ride is a bit rough, but it enhances the sporty feel of the car.

I do have a problem with Mitsubishi and how they're packages are set up. You can't have any options with the manual. It must be an automatic to have anything in it. And you can't have a manual v6? It doesn't make sense to me and I think they're going to lose alot of business doing this. Other than that. I highly recommend this eclipse. It's a great car.

Both were in bad accidents and considered totaled by my insurance company due to debt ratio of estimated repairs vs value of the vehicle. In both accidents, i was able to walk away without a scratch. I also salvaged and repaired both cars and can still say i feel safer in them then i do in most other cars. They are also very comfortable in the front seats. My back seats have never been used for anything but extra storage space cuz there is no room in the back. The radio and climate controls are all within close reach of the driver seat and easy to use. One of the most fun cars to drive. Handles beautifully and corners like a dream. Has a bit of a lag on acceleration, but can really move once it gets going. Highly recommend upgrading the brakes/rotors. Stock brake system was not always reliable, and there was a recall on the ABS system. Rockford fosgate sound system is great. Mechanically sound design.

While this car is no Corvette (frankly the Corvettes were too much car for me), it is a lot of fun to drive.  In fact, given legal speed limits, I would say it allows one to jump on the gas and still remain at reasonable speeds, i.e., you can actually utilize what the car offers.

The styling is truly unique, so unique that it will be out of style faster than ever.

Yes, I love to travel. I loved traveling in my Ford Expedition much better but this little Outlander Sport is much more affordable to drive! The front seats fit larger folks, no problem. With the front seats fully back the leg room in the back seats is a little tight. And this is a 4 passenger vehicle, not 5, unless it is 3 small kids in the back seat without car seats! The total weight limit of passengers and cargo is 875 lbs so keep that in mind if you are larger.I have taken this car into the mountains on snow and ice and it did well for a smaller vehicle. It has decent acceleration for a small car. On my longer road trips I get around 30 mpg. Short driving around town knocks that down to about 23. I have never used the paddle shifters, cruise control, remote start, or blue tooth (I have a dumb phone) but can tell you that the seat warmers are a godsend on cold mornings!At about 60,000 miles the car developed a squeal (at over 25 mph) that changing the s-belt did not cure. The noise has changed to more of a chirpy noise now. My Mitsu mechanic thinks it is the belt pulley. Guess this is a known problem with the 2011 model but they are not covering it under warranty for the 2012. That upsets me a bit as I feel that because I am a high mileage user I am being penalized. By the time this may come out as a recall issue I will already be out of miles on my 100,000 mile drive train warranty. This is my 2nd Mitsubishi product. I also owed a 1991 Mirage that I drove 8 years and put 250,000 miles on it. It was a great little car and I am hoping that my 2012 Outlander Sport does as good over the long haul.",4

I got my fully optioned AWD outlander sport in 2012 and have put around 10,000 miles on it. As far as reliability, its been great, though you'd expect that from a brand new car. The driveability of the car is far from sporty. While it may be AWD with paddle shifters, it doesnt offer much fun to the driver. The gas mileage on it is absolutely average.

I wanted a 30 MPG SUV that was reliable had less than 50K miles for under $10K and the Outlander Sport is the only SUV that checked all those boxes.  Many reviews will downgrade the Outlander Sport because the 2.0L engine is under powered they say, but while this SUV won't win any 0 to 60 races it's has more than enough power for me and will accelerate adequately in all driving conditions.  If you drive like Mario Andretti and are an aggressive driver you should look elsewhere and expect to pay more both at the dealer and at the pump.  However, if you drive like a normal person you will love this SUV.  It has a great ride and while this is my first vehicle with a CVT, I'm very impressed with the smoothness of the transmission.  Every other SUV in the Outlander's class will cost you a minimum of $2500 more to purchase used and will not be any more reliable or pleasant to drive.  My only complaint is that the 2013-2016 Outlanders only come with a black interior which is murder in the south when your car sits outside in the summer time.

I've had my fair share of crummy cars in the past, to the point that it left me paranoid. After having had the outlander sport for a year and driving it 40,000 in one year, I can happily say this car is a champ. Not only do I drive for business and need it to be reliable, but it's really comfy and looks fancy for the cost. I've been able to fit a recliner in it with the seats down, and one trip had two medium size dog crates in there too. It's surprising how much it can fit. Then there's the gas mileage. Last fill up cost me $27 and it goes about 320 miles on that. The sound is great and I love the subwoofer in the back.Then there's the panoramic sun roof. Anytime a friend gets in the car that's the first thing they notice. As for the finishings, so far the interior holds up. I've had cars (vw's, Hondas, and nissans) that break apart or seems come apart. So far the outlander is in one piece. Oh! And I've accidently hit a few things and no Damage shown on the car. Major plus! I can't say enough positive things.Only downside, is if the car is packed with people, cargo, and ac blasting- the acceleration struggles a bit. But not surprising. If you're short like me (under 5ft) the drivers seat goes up and gives you a clear view of the road. If you're tall like my dad (6'1"") you can adjust it and feel comfortable too.I highly recommend this car.",5

Of course, my city driving is only 20%, back-roads is 60% and highways is 20%.This is my second review after owning this vehicle for over 3 years. I am glad I made the choice to buy this vehicle. There has been no major problem with the vehicle and all that I have done in the past 3 years is to change the oil when the computer tells me to do so. I bought a case of the Mitsubishi OEM oil filters on the internet and have been doing my own oil change at home. The tires still look great after 3 years and rotate them every time I change my oil. I have had zero mechanical problems and this vehicles just drives. I have driven it cross country from Reno, Nevada to Vancouver, Canada without a sweat. All the electronics and technology that came with the vehicle are all working fine after 3 years. I actually get better gas mileage than the manufacturer rated mpg. I drive this vehicle every day to work and average 33-34 mpg and this is driving in the city of Reno-Sparks.After 3 years, I can say that this is a great car, for the value, technology and reliability. I think this vehicle is under rated by the so-called review experts.",5

I live in the hilly region of western PA where we can see some harsh winter weather conditions, but this car (4WD) takes on snow and ice with no problem. I even recently took it on vacation, a 530 mile journey one way, and had no problems. The only drawback I would say about this car is the power. Like I said, I live in a hilly region and I have to step on the gas to keep the speed consistent.  Also, power can be lacking while getting up to speed merging onto highways. These are just small drawbacks, however, considering the reliability and mileage that you get. The road handling is great, and it is an overall fun car to drive.

I don't plan to go off road, but the 4WD is handy in Illinois winters, it handles well in wet/icy conditions.   The exterior dimensions are well balanced. Not too long, width adequate and height is just right.  The exterior styling is stunning from any angle, and the overall look of the vehicle is well proportioned.  I didn't need a larger vehicle, I don't do any major hauling, but with roof rails, it can easily handle larger items such as dining tables or bedroom sets.  The Sport performs as good as any mid level sedan or CUV, the 2.4L has very good acceleration and torque, so highway merging is not a problem.  Ride comfort is no different either, but as smooth and quiet as can be expected at this price.    Interior materials remain basic, dashboard layout is functional, although a bit bland looking.  Where the Sport rocks is the Rockford Fosgate navigation system and 710 watt system with a 10"" built in subwoofer, which sounds awesome at lower volumes, and still keeps rocking at highway speeds without blowing my ears out.    This trim level has all the expected options, power everything, heated leather, moon roof with mood lighting, etc. Before I purchased, I read many of the reviews, Many were less than complimentary.

HID headlights, LED taillights, Bluetooth, heated seats, climate control, power drivers seat, PW, keyless entry, and on and on and on.

There was room for more and I couldn't even tell the load was in the back.    I still got 30 mpg on the 30 mile  trip back home.

Wow! What a nice vehicle. I got a gray one with the Touring package, Rockford Fosgate sound system, panoramic roof, cargo package, and exterior side moldings. The GT version also comes with the 2.4 liter engine. For me it drives beautifully. Nice pickup and acceleration with the improved engine. The black leather interior and matching black carpet make the interior fell rich and comfortable. The navigation system/audio system is LOADED with features and looks and sounds great. At the push of a button the ceiling retreats and panoramic roof with its LED backlighting appears-- very impressive!Best Features:The sound system is too cool and if you like bottom-end bass you will learn to rock out! Night driving with the panoramic roof open and the stereo loud will make you want to take more night drives! It was easy to pair my IPhone to the system and having the system controls on the steering wheel is convenient . The leather heated seats are very comfy and the dashboard layout was nicely thought out. There is also ample leg room for rear passengers. The gas mileage is also good--my best is 33 MPG and it averages 26-28 MPG on my 19 mile commute to work.Could be better features:I am not yet sold on the voice activation of the phone or navigation system. Maybe it needs to learn my voice and after one year of trying you would have thought it would have my voice down pat? And, Mitsubishi should rethink the ""book"" it gives as owners manuals. I find the manuals to be confusing and contain too much info and printed in typeface much too small for my eyes.  And, after a year of driving, the shocks could be better. And lastly, the rear cargo area is small but certainly ample for most shopping expeditions as long as you don't buy any really larger size items. That being said, I really like the GT!",5

I bought with some trepidation, considering the expert reviews I read, but noted that most consumer reviews were pretty good. Maybe the experts expect too much from a vehicle because they can compare the vehicle to many more expensive ones. I have only had the vehicle for a few weeks, but I'm fairly happy with it. It is not a sports car, but handles adequately for an SUV. Acceleration is decent, and the engine doesn't seem any noisier than on the Rogue I traded in. Interior is a little less upscale than on some competitors, but is practical and comfortable. The ride is a little stiff, but the vehicle has 18"" '55' series tires, so that is somewhat expected. Exterior is rather attractive, and I'm getting better than advertised MPG. So far, I'm satisfiedAfter 6 months, everything is pretty much the same. I'm still satisfied.

759, on 03/15/16 15:58 PM (PDT),Jackie ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 GT 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Better than expected," I had to get rid of my 2009 lancer ralliart because it needed very expensive repairs. I literally cried. I loved that car. However, I am pregnant and needed something more practical anyways. My old car had two 10"" subs in the back and no room for a stroller. I knew this car would not live up to that car since my old car had AWD and a turbo. I like driving fast. I've been pleasantly surprised with the ""get up and go"" this car has. Not comparing it to my lancer of course. However, a few years ago I had a 2008 Ford Escape and that thing was so slow to go. I haven't been using the paddle shifters, but I might give them a try. I also need to learn better how to really use the CVT transmission. I'm used to a SST transmission. I enjoy the upgrades on this model, but I'll admit that some of them seem kind of random. I would've taken dual climate control over heated heats. I think the HID headlights are pretty nice though and I like the accent of the led lights that are always on. The panoramic glass roof is cool, but it doesn't open for fresh air. So that's another upgrade that I don't really understand. The headlights are adjustable up and down , bluetooth audio, rockford fosgate sound system that includes tweeters and a built in 10"" sub in the back, mood lighting on the panoramic roof, rain sensing wipers, chrome accents inside, back up camera. The only thing I feel that I am missing is navigation (which I honestly wouldn't use much) and leather seats. Just putting the stroller in the back takes up a lot of cargo space. I kind of wish it was a little larger back there. I know my Escape had more room in the back. I plan on keeping this car for about 3 years and then getting my race car again. This time it will be a Subaru WRX STI since Mistubishi decided to end the Lancer Evolution. Kind of pissed about that! What's the deal Mistubishi?!",4

So I thought an all wheel drive would be a great choice for my commute vehicle. Well, when it snows I'm in fear of driving this car. It has the factory Nexen tires I'm familiar with. They are known to be cheap summer tires people put on custom after market rims for summer driving. They claim to be all season with light snow rating, could not be anymore inaccurate. I will be buying new tires before our next winter to see it it helps. But coming from the factory, this car scares me driving in any kind of snow. Even if it's only a few inches. It reminds me of my younger years trying to drive a car on bald tires in snow. Even in all wheel drive it does not handle or stop with 2 inches of snow. Aside from that, once the brakes locked up on me after driving through a snow 6 inch snow bank. I couldn't have been going more than 5mph and the brakes did not function and left me sliding 2 car lengths before I stopped. I had no control, luckily I was in a parking lot.I am very lucky the one winter I drove this vehicle we seen a very low amount of snowfall and I have another vehicle to use.Besides all of the awful unsafe winter use of this vehicle, it's not bad. It had one recall repair already for potential stalling when hitting the accelerator,  which mine never did.Another problem I had multiple times was with long road trips and using cruise control. It would just stop working completely. When I would hit traffic or non passable cars and turn off the cruise control a few times within a short time it would stop working until I was done driving and had the car parked for awhile.The acceleration is the worst of any car I have ever owned in my life. It is so slow from a dead stop that I will not pull out in traffic unless the next upcoming car is 2 or 3 football fields away. Once on the road acceleration is ok.Summer driving is good. On average tank of gas I will average 26-28mpg with 80% highway. Every single fill up I hand dial to see. Winter driving averages 22-25 with 70% city driving.Overall would I buy this vehicle know all that? That is a BIG NO. After a year of ownership I looked into trading it in and it depreciated A LOT . Easily worth 25% less than when I bought it. If I bought a new pickup truck I would see 25% drop until it was paid off.This is not a safe winter vehicle, maybe new tires will help, but I'm not sure about the brake issue with snow.",3

I've owned it for 4 months, 4000 miles and We LOVE it!  I've owned Honda, Toyota, Nissan truck and Chevy's. All good cars and trucks, but Mitsubishi NEVER gets the credit it deserves for a Japanese vehicle of Superior quality and lower price than its better advertised competitors. These are Wonderful vehicles, precision built and designed. Available in the U.S. at lower prices for who knows why? lack of advertising... Take advantage of these deals and get a Well designed, quality built Japanese vehicle for a great price! They run FOREVER with just proper maintenance, the exterior stays beautiful with minimum maintenance. how many times I've said to my son ""OH U washed the Outlander (03)?'' His answer ""NO it rained""...  it looked Great. I Love our new 2015 Outlander Sport, the Rochford Fosgate Sound system is Awesome. Performance with the 2.4L is great, mileage is about 25-26 around town. Took her out in unplowed 14'' of snow in 4WD LOCK No problem at all. Heated seats, mirrors, adjustable drivers seat, steering column... 4WD, glass roof, back up camera, much, much more for 20 something K? Plus 10 year/100,000 warranty.  I love it! All I can say is give it a chance? Don't listen to the """"so called'' Expert reviews?",5

I am pleased with vehicle so far(500 miles in...) it has all the bells and whistles that I wanted at a most affordable price(compared to similar models and options) along with the best warranty bumper to bumper and powertrain in the industry(The dealer I purchased from adds a lifetime powertrain warranty).  Little things that I liked about this model are the heated seats(they heat up really fast and get quite toasty), backup monitor, parking assist sensors, mirror turn lamps, and fog lamps.  Fuel economy is around 25 mph between city and highway(a little better when I turn off the AWD to 2 wheel drive only.",5

These is a very good CUV, i admit the earlier 2013 and 2014, had a sluggish CVT, but otherwise there were great, reliable cars. But like the other review they get NO RESPECT,  Mitsubishi created the CUV concept, long before Honda hrv, mazda 3,or those others, i Got a great deal on the vehicle, and fully loaded for $22k, BECAUSE OF OWNER LOYALTY, CAR WAS VALUES AT 28K.The remote start, heated seats, auto climate, auto wipers, auto lights,  interior lights, awc, roof racks and 18' wheels. , and more,  and it has a simpe and easy  entertainment system,  and love the controls on the steering  wheel, simple and always works . Not a millions plastic buttons to push or turn. it is good in all weather conditions,  if you have the right tires, and have some knowledge of how to drive.

Well I had to use it at the 17,500 mile mark. A new transmission had to be installed! Tech at the dealership said he has had several he has had to replace and Mitsibishi knows they have a problem. So why not a recall?  Will be looking to sell or trade come spring of 2018, mileage has fallen off since new tranny was installed, driver's side power window is acting funny. After 27 months of ownership and 18,500 miles on the SUV, I have come to the conculsion that the vehicle is under powered. It needs a 6 cylinder in it.

765, on 01/28/16 16:02 PM (PST),real person ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 ES 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),For the price nothing competes," I've been looking for a  small cuv and used honda and toyotas are overpriced. Both are great vehicles but you can purchase a brand new outlander sport for what dealers want for the other vehicles used so they are basically taking your trade in for free. The outlander sport has a great warranty and rides really nice for a small cuv. The cvt trans is definitely different than what I'm used to but you can also manually shift it. The 4wd system is really advanced because you can run it in fwd (front wheel drive), auto four wheel drive or lock 4wd when the weather is bad. It stays in 4wd lock until 25 mph the automatically switches back to auto 4wd. I previously had a subaru and really didn't like the fact that it didn't have a similar option.  Fuel economy looks to be below average compared to similar vehicles but I opted for the bigger engine so I knew that. Some folks may argue that they don't have as good a resale but you are paying at least 3 to 4 grand less from the start, so the way i look at is how can it be worth more in the end. I keep a vehicle at least 10 years. I really don't think you can believe the expert reviews completely.  Better off looking at the consumer reviews.Update 1 Year and 15,000 miles. Put in a k&n air filter getting consistent 29 to 30 mpg. Rear tires seem to wear more than the frontship but will easily see over 20k with them which is good for a factory tire. No real issues except seat cover coming loose. I just put it back in the track with a stick on adhesive. Could not see bringing it back to dealer for that. Do alot of winter driving and they lIke to use rocks as anti skid. This stuff easily nicks the lower edge right in front of rear door wheel wells. Notice 2017 come with a sort of moulding or flare. Mud flaps are probably a good option. Not regrets with the 2.4. Plenty of power and does 70 to 80 straight down the highway every day. Again for the price nothing competes!Update almost 23k latter. Averaging just shy of 30mpg combined driving.  Just changed out the stock tires. Could of run them a little longer but were getting a little skittish in heavy rain. All in all good vehicle. Real only complaint is a little bumpy with the short wheelbase. For the price nothing compares. 39000 miles......still going strong.",5
766, on 01/16/16 23:00 PM (PST),Paul ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 GT 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Love my Mitsubishi!!!," I've had the Outlander Sport for 1 month now, and the vehicle is awesome!! I have the GT with the 2.4 liter engine (FWD not 4WD), upgraded stereo with subwoofer, navigation system, huge skylight and hid headlights. The hid headlights are incredible. The main light comes from a projector lens, but there's also a port for reflected light to shoot out the sides of the housing. Driving at night, especially in dark areas without streetlights, is where these headlights really perform.  I just drove on a 3-lane expressway at night, where streetlights were not on for a segment of the road. I drove in the middle lane, and the headlights lit up the center lane AND the lanes to the left and right. In another dark road I saw a fox on the road ahead of me (the headlights startled it) and I was able to follow the scruffy creature as it ran off the side of the road. Another night I saw a cat on the side of the road that turned around and moved further away from the road.The cvt transmission really lowers the engine's rpm's when not pressing hard on the accelerator. Cruising at 40 mph, the engine is at a quiet 1400 rpm's; cruising at 60 mph the engine is just below 2000 rpm's, 70 mph results in 2100 rpm's (and the engine is still smooth and quiet).The upgraded stereo sounds fantastic. The navigation system screen rotates out to allow cd's to be inserted into the stereo. Cellphone connects up to the car via bluetooth (done by car dealer the day I got the Mitsu). I thought my old mp3 player without bluetooth technology wouldn't connect to the car, but it does. There is a usb port in the compartment between the driver and front passenger seats. I hooked up the old mp3 player to that usb port (via the cord that came with the mp3 player) and the artists and albums populated on the Mitsu's touch screen, allowing me to choose what music to play.I haven't had this car long enough to comment on long-term reliability but so far it has been fun to drive.",5

Too heavy on the hard plastics (we opted for more of a base model trim.) Everything else is par excellence! The CVT is silky smooth. The 2.4L engine offers plenty of pep. The ride is sublime, very quiet cabin. Solidly put together. Comfortable seating position. Nimble handling. Took it for a spin at elevation on a rainy, then slushy, then icy road - 4WD auto and 4WD LOCK are a must have - offers incredible traction. Confident around the corners and a great feel. Wish for a smidge more room in the back for our big dog, but we are exceedingly happy with our purchase. The dealer was eager to please. Subaru has more brand recognition, but we believe we purchased the better crossover for the money.",4

769, on 10/25/15 03:46 AM (PDT),Chad ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 GT 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Massively underrated," Purchased this for my wife. We had test driven a 2013 two years ago and were disappointed with its acceleration. Thankfully, the 2015 is no where near the same. Mitsubishi refined the CVT and added the 2.4 liter motor which made a huge difference in performance. We love the HID headlamps. Since we live in the country, deer are always a hazard. These headlights have a tremendously wide angle allowing the driver to see deer much better at night. Love it. Also, the breaks are very responsive. Cruise control is great. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is worth the money...incredible for a stock system. We like the physical size of the vehicle...not huge and not too small. Perfect for a small family and easy to drive. Visibility and seating position is excellent...unlike rav4. Rain sensing wipers are handy and work well. The four wheel drive system is much more advanced than most of the competition. You can actually lock the differential unlike Subaru and Honda. Toyota rav4 does lock, but you can only go 25 mph. The dealership was great. And these motors have a great reputation for reliability. Warranty is unmatched by any Japanese brand. Proudly built in the USA. We have been getting 27 mpg in 60/40 highway/city driving. Wife loves the heated seats, auto climate control, and panaramic roof. We paid 25k. Give this suv a shot if you are in the market...don't be brainwashed by paid reviewers/journalists.Update: car has been completely trouble free. Not a single issue (as it should be) in the 14k miles we have owned it. Still no rattles. Everyone still loves it.Update 4/25/17: still no problems with the car. Coming up on 18k miles of completely trouble free driving. Feels solid as a rock. Expect many more trouble free miles.",5
770, on 10/21/15 06:04 AM (PDT),Danno ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Made in Illinois POS," Pros: decent on gas. Small.Cons: Small. Unreliable: In less than 3000 miles, this vehicle developed a transmission shudder (CVT), the airbag and seat belt warnings came on, and finally the tire pressure warnings came on. Comfort: It's horridly uncomfortable for an average American. Suspension bottoms out when the vehicle is loaded, and It doesn't have anywhere near the ground clearance needed. Obviously not designed for anything off road - not recommended at all. The Outlander might be an upsize for small-statured folks in the country of origin, but if you're over 6' or 250 lbs, fuggettaboutit. Convenience: The sunvisors don't extend. There's no aux audio input for an mp3 player. The A/C is weak and can't cope with 105 degree days. Bluetooth does pair up with your phone quickly and phone calls work good. Performance: Nonexistent from idle to 3500 rpm. The throttle needs gouged to spin the motor to redline. Highway passes made easily but the car sounds like it's coming apart when flogged. Transmission shifts are atrocious and a pronounced driveline shudder appeared in the first month.Safety: given the cramped quarters in the foot area, in the event of a frontal crash, you'd be pinned in the car with two broken legs. Given that the airbag lights came on in the first three months of use, the car seems like a death trap waiting to spring. Reliability: nonexistent. The car accumulated more issues every month. Dealers are only located in metropolitan areas, for us a 150 mile drive. Overall: We turned this POS back into GSA and pray they don't ever, ever issue this model to anyone else.",2

I've been driving this car for a year and love this car.The acceleration and cruise control are awesome.  A friend of mine who is 85 years old went on the trip and told me she thought it was one of the most comfortable car rides she had been on in her lifetime.  I find a feature not addressed by many of the 5 star ratings was the seat and steering wheel adjustments.  You can pump the seat higher and don't have an awkward look out your front window.  The steering wheel adjustment allows additional comfort.Now if I could stop my Husky/Malamute from shedding, I would have the perfect car! I highly recommend this SUV!",5
773, on 09/23/15 13:26 PM (PDT),Michele Knight ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV SE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Outlander Sport Obsessed!," I read all of the reviews before deciding to purchase the 2015 Outlander Sport SE.  I live in Florida, so having heated seats was not a big deal for me.  However, it did have to have great braking and great traction on the busy roads.  This vehicle does NOT disappoint.  My last car was also a Mitsubishi and it lasted me 13 years.  That, in itself, sold me on the Mitsubishi line of cars.  To be honest, Mitsubishi is highly UNDERRATED!  I see people complaining about the CVT and the torque of the engine.  It doesn't bother me at all.  The main thing that you must keep in mind is this SUV is NOT an off-roading vehicle.  Also, just because it has ""sport"" in the name, doesn't mean it's a sports car!  This car, for me is EXACTLY what I wanted without going into MAJOR debt!  The navigation system is great, the 9 speaker Rockford Fosgate with the 10"" subwoofer really kicks some music butt, and the panoramic moon roof is incredible!  This car drives like a dream!  The 4 disk brakes are highly responsible and the steering is spot on!  What I really enjoy about this car, is the fact that I can change from an automatic transmission to a manual transmission.  This works out great when you want to get off the ""red light line"" first or, you have to speed up on a highway on-ramp.  Unfortunately, not many people who come to Florida, know how to drive their cars and proper road procedures.  Currently, I am getting 25.6 mpg driving in the City.  Keep in mind, I am also not driving the car like I'm Mario Andretti!  I'm a 43 year old mom.  I don't need to drive like a maniac!  But when I do, this car has the needed ""get up and go""!  I highly recommend this car if you are in the market.  From what I understand, the 2015 will be the last made with a gas engine.  In 2016, Mitsubishi will be redesigning the Outlander Sport with a Hybrid engine.    Regardless of whats to come, I am extremely happy with my purchase!  I like having a vehicle that doesn't look like every other SUV on the road!",5
774, on 09/08/15 07:31 AM (PDT),Bravin Hughart ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV SE 4dr SUV 4WD (2.0L 4cyl CVT),"Don't be fooled by ""expert"" reviews! GREAT CAR!"," Edit, after 90k miles, not one repair. Tires have been changed twice and normal maintenance. Car is awesome! Are you kidding? Buy it! We mulled around for two weeks trying to decide between the Honda CRV, Subaru XT and the Outlander Sport. The Mitsubishi had the best warranty by a long shot (not the warranty was much of a concern with Honda or Subaru). It boiled down to bang for your buck. We got a LOADED SE Outlander with the glass roof for around the starting price of the other two. We bought the Mitsubishi thinking we just got more bells and whistles but a cheapo car. Well, we were wrong. We just wrapped up a 2000 mile road trip and we were stunned. Economy: This car averaged 31 MPG over the full distance. (Keep in mind this is the 4X4) The insurance rate was lower than the other two SUVs we were considering. Comfort: I have a very bad back and that is the most comfortable I have been in a car since I drove a Lincoln. It rides, handles and stops very well. Power: Many people comment the power is lacking in this car. My wife and I feel it is just right. It is not slow by any means. 70 -80 mph with no issues through the mountains. Acceleration is actually impressive. MPG is the concern for us and this car finds that balance between power and MPG. The CVT transmission is a little weird at first but you soon get used to the shift or no shift depending on where your foot is on the accelerator. I have fun working with the transmission keeping the MPG maxed out. Design: The interior is not Lexus quality but it is as good if not better than Honda, Toyota or Subaru. We LOVE the Rockford Fosgate stereo system with the touch screen and deep bass. The illuminated glass roof is a treat at night. The exterior is aggressive and sporty. It turns heads. We had several people ask us what kind of car this was and they liked it. Value: We feel we could not have done better with any other car. The Mitsubishi dealers seem happy to have our business instead of considering it a chore to sell us a car (Honda, Subaru). We bought this car for work commuter duty. We have already decided it will be much more than that.",5

The 2.4 in the Outlander and the refined CVT make the Compass look like, well, a Compass. I was very skeptical after reading other reviews, but really liked the styling. After test driving the Outlander Sport, I was sold. This is a very nice vehicle with an attractive warranty. The Compass has the same motor size and a CVT transmission,  but there is a huge difference in the two. The Outlander Sport rides nice, has sufficient power with the 2.4 and is at least unique. Not one person in my county has the same vehicle. The dealership was outstanding as well. Go buy an Outlander Sport!",5

The backseat has more room for me at 6'2"" than our Jeep Grand Cherokee. People who think this vehicle has pokey acceleration were not taught how to use the CVT transmission properly. It's just like a snowmobile or automatic 4wheeler. It has a ""powerband"" in the 3-5000 rpm range. If you keep the Rpms in this range it's pretty dang snappy, even while moving at about 45. It has a great ride, it's quiet, it looks great, I don't know what more I can say. LED driving lights, fog lights, paddle shifters, auto climate control, touch screen stereo, backup camera, heated seats, adjustable headlights, I mean. What more can you ask for an suv that costs $21K?!? Oh yeah. 30mpgs and 4wheel drive! It's ridiculous. Knock it all you want, but I'll take a $300/month payment for a brand new suv all day.

779, on 07/18/15 15:25 PM (PDT),Kyle ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),It's not all it is cracked up to be....," Firstly this vehicle is catered to a cheaper market i get it but it is none the less a vehicle that should have not ever left the drawing board.  Firstly I am luck to have only rented this vehicle and not purchased it.  That is really dodging a bullet.  Ok picture this a car salesman doing his job and trying to sale you a car talking about all the features in the car blah blah blah. With that being said there are things you would never pick up on when you are on a test drive. So lets get started...First the car is so under powered and is poor at accelerating I think my poodle can run fast than this car. Pretty much don't rely on this car if you need to get out of the way or move out of danger quickly. Truth be told I was getting on a highway on ramp and it took forever to accelerate. Secondly I think they rushed the design of this engine or at least the cruise control system....I'm sorry to say but it is garbage. Why is it garbage you might ask? If it is not busy increasing and decreasing rapidly the RPM's it's busy struggling to keep up with you speed change request. Not just that the way it engages it the most counter intuitive way to engage it. To engage it you turn on the master switch on the steering column, then while you are at the desired speed release the acceleration pedal the depress the set mode then hold the accelerate mode on the steering column for approx 8-15 second to see any increase in RPM, then finally it increases but just maybe 100-300 increase in RPM, then finally it gets up to 3000-4000 RPM. Mind you i'm going highway speeds at level ground give or take. It was more annoying to have the cruise control on than anything so i just left it off for the duration. The electronic information available to the driver is very minimal would be nice to know whats going on with the car while your driving. The entertainment system is an attempt to stay with the times but it has a ways to go....not to user friendly to driver in particular the satellite radio functions. Finally there is only on usb and that is in the central arm rest. Its funny that it has the option for a line in component such as a mp3 player but physically there is no location to plug in the line in... It wouldn't have been for those items to be corrected i would say this car could have the potential to last more than 5-8 years. I can just see the lemon tree grow......Good try Mitsubishi but i'm not convinced.  I'll give it to you though your partners on the lancer side of the house have got it down but this Out-lander Sport needs to be redesigned.",2

Which is being able to speak the address you want to go to and have the car actually get you there.

Then it started happening after driving for short periods of time on the freeway, then it would happen after driving up any hill, then after just driving a few miles in the city, then I started getting a warning that said ""Transmission Overheating, Slow Down."" The dealership assured me this was a normal complaint with this year and model and it would go away after changing the CVT fluid at the 60,000 mile service. Had the 60k service done at 57,000 miles because I couldn't stand the transmission noise anymore, but it continued to be a problem. Took the car back to the dealership and they still insisted it was normal. The next time I took it in they said it was because I'm driving in 4wd mode. When the problem happened in 2wd mode I took it back and they said they couldn't reproduce the issue and decided that it must not be a problem. The final straw was after an easy 30 minute trip on the freeway. I got the warning and couldn't pull off to let the transmission cool down, the car completely lost power and stranded me. The transmission eventually cooled down and I was able to drive it again, but the dealership still insists it's either a normal issue or the problem doesn't exist.

I am also an athletic coach and this car comfortably fits all my equipment.  Even with the seats up the cargo space is still more than adequate.  The bluetooth comes standard and is simple and easy.

The poor engine would almost be forgivable if the car achieved the advertised gas mileage, but after nearly 3 years of ownership I still average around 20mpg City and 25mpg Highway.

This car got me where I needed to go in all road conditions with no problems - but I should mention that I did put studded snow tires on for better traction when my road is icy.  I would just add two downsides I've discovered.  First, slush, snow or mud on the inner side of the rims can cause the tires to be out of balance and make the car to shimmy.  When I wash it off, I still have to dig around the rims to make sure it is totally clean or it continues to shimmy.  I may try different rims.  Second, the low beam headlights create a distinct line so that only the immediate road in front of you is lit and nothing high (above car height) or in the distance is lit.  You get good lighting only on the high beams. Those things aside, I would still highly recommend this car.  Original post:  I've been looking at cars to replace my 2009 Suzuki SX4 for a few years now.  That car's only good review was that it was the least expensive 4WD vehicle on the market at the time.  But it is still running great with almost 160k miles and hasn't a spec of rust on it.  Needless to say, because of that, I read expert reviews a bit skeptically.  I've always liked the look of the Outlander Sport and, in doing my research, kept coming back to it despite the mediocre expert reviews (these reviews seem to place more emphasis on things that are not important to me anyhow).  I finally bought one last month.  Basically, I needed a vehicle to get me to work and back.  I'm not going to be driving the Autobahn or loading up with gear or kids or am trying to impress folks with an overpriced luxury brand name.  I need a dependable AWD/4WD car with good ground clearance because I live in Vermont and have to travel 2½ miles on a hilly dirt road to get home.  This road turns to muddy soup in spring and, of course, we usually get lots of snow, ice, etc, for 5-6 months of the year.  A Renegade and a VW Tiguan were in the running but both didn't get great reliability ratings from customers (I always read the customer reviews!).  I didn't need any bells and whistles, but I ended up with the SE model and am having fun with the infotainment system and love the heated seats!  I like that this car has the push-button mode of driving like my Suzuki that allows to you to easily switch from FWD to 4WD to 4WD low.  I also like that there is a manual mode with the automatic.  I can go down my road in 3rd gear and not have to brake or give it much gas.  I don't notice anything different about the CVT shifting that the experts mention.  There are only 6 gears (unlike the Renegade, which has 9) so that mean less shifting, I supposed.  The MPG is about on par with the Suzuki at 25 mpg combined, but considering this has a larger engine, I'm okay with that.  I need the extra power to get home much of the time.  The car also just feels very solid - nothing tinny about it.  My only low marks are because of the back seats.  There is plenty of room back there, but they just aren't that comfortable.  Fortunately, I rarely have backseat passengers.  So, if you want a very reasonably priced, dependable, solid vehicle that'll be good transportation, this car is definitely something you should consider.",5
818, on 08/31/16 06:10 AM (PDT),Rob ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 SE 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Hidden Gem," This 2016 Outlander sport SE 2.4 AWD is the best kept secret. As others have said it is underrated for sure, it is quiet, good MPG, CVT transmission is far better than the DCT (duel clutch transmission) many makers are putting in their models. So called expert reviews are really lopsided on this vehicle, Before you buy one of the EXPERT best rated models, go with the consumer ratings and give this hidden gem a try, I did and I am more than satisfied I made the right choice.",5
819, on 08/05/16 08:10 AM (PDT),Lucky 7 ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 SEL 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Objective review, I won this car in a drawing."," I was not in the market for a small SUV and it is not really my thing.  I just sold an S2000 sports car, drive a BMW 328i and was shopping for a new Boxster so the Outlander sport was not really in my wheelhouse.  And then a telephone call came that I was a finalist to win one in a drawing I had entered online.  I went to the final drawing and won the car.  I had been helping my sister shop for a small SUV so I was very familiar with the Rav4, CRV, Mazda CX4 and the Escape having looked at all of them with her very recently.  We did not look at the Outlander Sport and that was probably a mistake, and the big mistake comes in value for your money.  After I won the base model 2.0 I was allowed to drive a loaded GT model with the larger engine.  First, skip the base 2.0 and go straight to the 2.4.  I drove around and the car did not have as much power for what I was used to and I had never personally driven a CVT car but it was decent.  I am used to cars with lots of power and thought I would be severely disappointed, but I wasn't.  I don't drive like a maniac and for a car to commute comfortably in, this car will do fine.  I spent some additional money to upgrade my base model to an SEL model which the dealer sells for No haggle at $23,500 with the current rebate structure. It has proximity keyless entry, leather seats, a backup camera, a decent touchscreen audio system, bluetooth, the larger engine and all the other common features like power windows and cruise, and I almost forgot, AWD.   The only features I did not pay extra for were the panoramic roof (kinda cool) upgraded stereo and Nav.   So the car was pretty loaded for a low price compared to the competition and has a very comprehensive warranty (10 years 100,000 miles on the engine and transmission, 5 year 60,000 bumper to bumper).   The car rides and drives well, is fairly comfortable, and has lots of features for the price.  There had been some quality issues in the past from a factory here in the US that was closed, and all Outlander Sports now come from Japan and the quality seems very good.    Of the competition, most have better engines, better fuel economy, some have better interiors, maybe a little more space, or drive sportier.  But the Outlander  Sport offers a pretty good little car for a very low price with lots of content and a top notch warranty.  I was going to trade mine but I am keeping it.  It is a neat little car that does a lot really well, just not very fast.  It could do with about 15 more horsepower and 4 more miles per gallon to better compete but those are my major gripes.  If you are in the market for a small SUV/Crossover and want a lot on a small budget, give it a look.  You might be very pleasantly surprised.  Just be sure to get the 2.4 liter engine.",4
820, on 07/19/16 20:00 PM (PDT),Valerie ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 SE 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Best compact suv," I had a 2011 Mitsubishi Outlander but wanted a smaller suv with 4wd option. I looked at Honda HRV, Mazda CX5, Nissan Rogue, Kia Sportage and none even compare to the Outlander Sport. My requirements are good stereo and satellite radio. You have to buy top of the line trims with the others to get this. The SE trim also has push button entry which is a great safety feature and means no searching for keys. The chrome on the front makes it look expensive.   The AC is very cold which is awesome because we are having record high temps this summer. Lets not forget the 5 year warranty and roadside assistance (which I never used on my last one).  Please ignore the ""expert"" reviews and look at consumer reviews for past years.",5
821, on 06/15/16 14:59 PM (PDT),John ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.0 ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),More Than Good Enough," We have been 'watching' the Outlander Sport for several years.  We finally bought a 2016 Outlander Sport ES to replace our 2005 Mazda Tribute i.  The Outlander Sport is a much nicer vehicle and we paid less for it than we paid for the Tribute in 2005.  Why would we buy a vehicle that rates an 'a rare Edmunds ""D"" rating'?  Lets count the reasons:1.  Safety - The Outlander Sport has 'Good' IIHS crash ratings except for an 'Acceptable' Front Small Overlap rating.  The old Mazda received a 'Poor' side crash rating.  Many newer vehicles do not pass the Front Small Overlap test.  2.  Reliability - 2015 CR states that the Outlander Sport has excellent reliability.  Models built from 2012-2015 were made in Illinios.  2016 models sold in this country are made in Japan once again.3.  Features - Comes standard with everything.  You won't need to upgrade or get an option package for Cruise Control which seems to be very common for vehicles in this price range.  Love the usb port, heated side mirrors, rear center arm rest with cup holders, easy fold split rear seat and the Hill Start Assist feature; again all standard.4.  Performance - According to Edmunds 0-60 in 8.8 seconds(2011 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport Road Test), 60-0 in 119 feet.  Reported best gas mileage to be 29-32 without trying too hard.  Comfortable seats and yes it does have a telescoping, leather wrapped steering wheel standard.  It rides better than the Mazda did and it is quieter too.  You can hear the engine during hard acceleration but it quiets down while cruising.  We don't have any issues with how it handles. Perhaps it is not 'Sporty' but even CR gave it a good (1/2 red dot) Routine Handling rating.  It has the nicest interior of any vehicle we have ever owned.  Maybe it is true that 'the rate at which vehicles have been improving is staggering' but so has their price.  The  Honda HR-V and Mazda CX-3 must be fantastic vehicles if they are really that much better than the Outlander Sport.  The problem is that for the price we actually paid for the Outlander Sport, they are not competing against each other.  In fact for the price we paid there are very few new vehicles to consider and the Outlander Sport beats them easily.  If you are looking for a vehicle capable of handling four tall adults and their stuff there are very few choices in this price range.If you are the type of person who replaces their vehicle as often as their iPhone then the Outlander Sport is probable not for you. But if you are like many Americans who agonize over every dollar spent you need to at least consider the Outlander Sport.  Compare it to the one you are currently driving not to one that will put you in debt forever.--------------------------------------------- Update -----------------------------------We took our Outlander Sport on a trip.  We started where the speed limit was 65 MPH. It then turned to 70, then 75 and finally 80 MPH.  It made little difference, many drivers always go 10-15 mph above the limit.  At least the semis seem to stay in the 65-70 MPH range. We cruised at 75 MPH for a couple of days including mountain passes.  We then went up twisty switchbacks to 11,000 ft to get to a cabin.  The Outlander Sport did well.  Noise was something of a problem on certain sections of the highway while on other pavement it was very pleasant.  When the time comes we might try some different tires (Michelin Defenders) to see if that helps.  The Outlander Sport rode well.  I detected a little 'float' while driving around a bumpy corner once but no one else in the vehicle noticed anything.  After 6000 miles our best gas mileage was 34 MPG, our worst was 27 MPG.  Overall we are very pleased with our Outlander Sport.  It isn't a Toyota Camry on the interstate but then again I wouldn't want to take a Camry on some of the dirt roads we ended up on.  One improvement we made to our base model was to add tweeters to our front speakers.  The wiring and everything is already there so it was pretty easy to do and really added to the overall sound quality.",5
822, on 08/06/18 19:35 PM (PDT),Justin Time ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.0 ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),True Sleeper," My 2017 Outlander Sport is the first ""import"" I've ever owned. Probably owned or driven [because of my work] over a hundred different vehicles and this is hands down my favorite. I bought an end-of-the-year base model with the 2.0 and manual 5 speed for $15,000. out the door price. The standard equipment on this car is impressive. Power windows, cruise, stereo with cd player, hands free Bluetooth for phone and that standard Mitsubishi warranty that's second to none. The first new vehicle I ever bought had AM radio as an option to be negotiated…..otherwise, just a blank plug in the dashboard! These cars were assembled in Illinois until late 2015, but moved their operations back to Japan after the U.S plant closed. I had done my research on Mitsubishi before that and thought I was buying an American built car- but, once I took it for a test drive, I knew I was going to buy it regardless. Stable ride, plenty of power with the 5 speed, quiet, nice climate control, great heater, availability of parts should be fine with Nissan being an international partner. They've been making automobiles since 1917 so..... not new to the game. Love driving this car!",5

It was like traveling in Time to drive 80-th cars. The most annoying thing was a keyless/remote. Why do I need to press twice to open all doors?! Why there is no signal to tell me that I just locked the doors? Why do I need to press twice ""lock"" to make sure that the car is locked?! Stereo was a joke. HUGE mirrors what you can't make look away because it is not going to move all the way! No under engine cover like in every other car. Engine gets dusty. Engine is only 4 cyl and it should do better than 25 mpg! I had my own reasons to buy this car and it would be a good car for 200K miles but this car depreciates super fast and it has no class. I've noticed that majority of drivers are sr. citizens and I made a decision to sell it. Dear God, thank you... I sold my 2017 Mitsubishi and for many other things too, thank you!",1
824, on 03/29/18 17:46 PM (PDT),Jim D. ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.0 LE 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),"Don't listen to the ""experts""!"," I've owned several Subaru vehicles, until they got too expensive. I then moved to Kia, which was ok as well. I wanted something different this time around, so I started looking at small SUV'S. I wanted something that wasn't outrageously priced, with a good warranty, that was also reliable. I looked at Honda, Kia, and Hyundai...all great cars, but more money than I wanted to spend. So I looked at the Outlander Sport. It looks great, and from my test drive, it seemed more than capable, the engine ran great, the CVT transmission was a bit odd, but did the job, and the stated MPG wasn't all that bad either. I'm not a professional reviewer, nor am I an auto snob, I just wanted something decent that wasn't going to cost me a fortune. So I pulled the trigger, and bought my 2018 Outlander sport Limited Edition. I paid less than $20k, and got more than enough options to make me happy. I've owned it now for a week, and so far, I'm VERY happy with my decision. I'm averaging about 35mpg. The transmission is just fine, now that I've adjusted to it, and it has more than enough power to get on the freeway without worrying if I'm gonna get hit from behind. To me, the front seats are very comfortable, the instrumentation is laid out well, climate control works as it should, and cargo space is more than enough to suit my needs. I don't know about you, but I'm not gonna spend an extra $10k+ because some reviewer, who may have had the car to use for a week or less, tells me to. Pick a car, ANY car... look at the ""professional"" review, then look at the OWNER reviews... they rarely come close to being the same. Mitsubishi has one of the best warranties out there, with a very respectable record for repairs overall. If you're considering a small SUV, then at least LOOK at these. Something is definitely wrong when the ""pros"" give it a score of 6, but the owners, HUNDREDS of them, give it a 9 or better! I got a very well equipped, comfortable, decent looking car for thousands less than anyone else's Base model.  All that extra cash is right where it belongs...in MY pocket.",5
825, on 01/12/18 20:09 PM (PST),John R D ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.4 SE 4dr SUV 4WD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Actuall bought it instead of the Subaru Crosstrek," The visibility for the driver is great.  I backed out of the Crosstrek because it honestly was useless trying to look out rear window. The 2.4 is plenty peppy.  Seems every professional review comments on the power and they mainly describe to 2.0.  The technology is usually a reason the professionals down grade this SUV but I really did not want to buy all the expensive tech stuff (but much of it is available).  Ride is fine and i did not notice any real difference from the Subaru. The Honda HRC was another option - worse visibility than the Crosstrek.  I wanted a small SUV and found this body style way more useful than the fastback styles.  With Nissan buying 34% ownership in Misubishi in 2017 (by far the majority owner) I am comfortable for future service.  For a bit less than similar equipped rue and honda I got over 8"" ground clearance, 168 hp, very acceptable ride, noise etc. My purchase price included total coverage for 10 years or 100,000 miles with a vanishing deductible.  Mitsubishi has been a leader in 4 wheel drive systems for years.  Value for the dollar, reliability and warranty, a dated but still one of the best looking small suv forms are some of my reasons for buying.  In the end I could not be ""brand shamed"" into not buying this car.  We have owned the Imprezza before in our family - good car some flaws but over all reliability is average in most reviews.  I'm really glad I looked at this cat.  It is our second car our bigger vehicle is a Honda Pilot 2013.",5

We drove it for a week and were enjoying it but, after a day trip we took, we fell in love with it. You can not go by the professional reviews.  Read the one by owners . the wind , road and engine noise was not bad at all. Has good pick up. Great gas mileage. Using hands free phone and text has great sound. I enjoyed it so much, I went back and bought an Outlander for my self. I will say, Mitsubishi could make the seats a little more comfortable ( they are average). I have day running lights but, not auto( LE or SE package). They need to put auto with day running . They need auto dim on rear view mirror on the LE/ SE models. The price is 2000-3000 less then any other brand. Mitsubishi builds a great car for a great price.",4

Acceleration is ehh, the sound system isn't the best, when my window is down it rattles and when I have the Apple Car Play hooked up it sometimes doesn't work properly. I love he HID headlights very good visibility at night and the gas mileage isn't bad for an SUV. Compared to its contenders its a great value, but does have some ""quarky"" negative things about it. The CVT transmission is just OK I feel when I accelerate it lags a bit. It drives very ""trucky"", can definitely feel it when you hit a bump.",3
829, on 08/23/17 08:40 AM (PDT),KG ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.0 ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Glad I purchased it," I bought a 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport brand new for 16,990.00 .  I researched the hell out of it but never test drive one. Edmunds gave it poor reviews but I noticed owners have it great reviews. I test drive toyota rav4 and the new chr and then the outlander sport. I felt the outlander was way better than the toyota and the price was even better. It accelerates just fine for the small engine and the transmission seems great too. Ya it's not a Mercedes or BMW but that was not the prissy kind of vehicle I wanted.  I wanted a vehicle to drive. I am not a snow flake and know how to use mirrors to back up. I have a smart phone for navigation and those items were judt an added expense on other vehicles. Bottom line us I am honestly impressed with the handling acceleration and the look .  I could afford a BMW or Mercedes but am comfortable in who I am that I don't need a sub like that, the outlander is perfect for me and how i use it. 02/25/18. Still glad I bought this ride. The drive feature let's me choose front wheel drive, all wheel, or 4 wheel drive perfect for MN Winters. I was surprised on the stock tires it came with but do think an upgrade will be better.  Put another 4 k miles on.  Really line this vehicle",4
830, on 07/29/17 23:13 PM (PDT),Alex ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.0 ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Made in Japan. Planning to keep it.," This is an updated review after 8000 miles. Part 1. If you are looking for sporty vehicle and you're looking at this one, there is nothing ""sport"" about this SPORT. It needs more power. It's something else: ""ASX"" or whatever they call it. If you are a guy: Engine is weak (unless you are over 50). If you are ""a young female professional"" or a car is for a high school girl-this car is fun to drive and she won't get speeding tickets. My car is a base model, ES with Auto transmission. Car is very slow. It needs V-6 or Premium gas or both. This 2.0 Litre engine is good engine, many Korean cars have it. But it's good for a small sedan (Lancer). However,  the CVT transmission works fine: it finds the right gear, quiet etc. Great in traffic: inching is easy; I've heard it's not overheating anymore. Oil changes: I did change the oil myself. Aware that it takes Full 5 quarters (!) of synthetic oil - this is the only type of oil you shall use. I purchased Mobile 1 0W10 15000 miles, filter Mobile1 from Walmart. Changed oil myself because I had nothing to do that day. Mitsubishi dealer is going to charge reasonable $45 for synthetic oil I still get about 28-30 mpg in the mixed cycle. Part 2: Mitsubishi Outlander Sport with Manual 6 speed Transmission is not ""bad choice"" but less comfortable because controls on the right side of your steering wheel if it comes with them. This car is for Asia where a driver sits on the right side of the vehicle. You are going to find yourself frustrated with controls if your model will have steering wheel with controls and any model  windshield wipers (right side is cleaner than your side). And you won't get better mileage AND you will need to change the fluid: gear oil AND a few parts in manual transmission after about 60,000 miles. Good idea to change oil in Auto transmission but you can drive it up to 100,000 miles.   I paid less than $17,500 (cash, $500 off because my girl had MItsubishi and same address+ traded-in VW, all taxes and fees included). I needed a car ASAP and I didn't have time to shop around. Again, if you buy 1-2 yo car you can save around $8000 and pay less Tax/Registration. These are good cars and safe buy. Do not buy brand new one because it will lose 1/2 of its value after first month (Cars do depreciate. Didn't I know this already?).",5
831, on 06/18/17 07:32 AM (PDT),Richard ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.0 ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl CVT),Better than expected," The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport ES had gotten some poor reviews from professionals.   Had I read those poor reviews beforehand I wouldn't have bought this vehicle, but so far I'm glad I did.  I've had it 2 weeks, but I'm impressed with it.  Steering is much better and tighter than reviewers claimed.  Quick turn radius.  Front seats could use some more support for us with longer legs.  The very tall headrests are unnecessary and blocks view looking back but i guess are more for neck protection in an accident.  It is a small engine, but since i don't haul any cargo or any other people around often it is fine for me.  My daily commute is either 40 mph speed limit or 55 mph on the expressway, so who needs more power than that?   not me.   The ride at those speeds is good and smooth.  Braking is quite good and responsive, as I've found out already.  The CVT does take a little bit of time to get used to, as it's much different than my old Oldsmobile transmission, but nothing here to complain about.  I LOVE the standard 18"" tires on good looking alloy wheels.  No cheap plastic rim covers.  The stereo interface is a rather plain and lame looking (but perfectly functional), but the USB port and bluetooth works great for my MP3 player.  Standard armrest is cool (wish it was a bit larger).  Comes with 4 floor mats, which some SUVs charge extra for.   The big plus for me is the super warranty.  10 years on powertrain, 5 years roadside assistance, and 7 YEARS FOR RUST!!!  Rust warranty is important for me since I live in Chicago and don't have any indoor parking.  My previous car completely rusted out at the bottom.  So don't let the negative reviews bother you.  They should review a vehicle for what it is, not for what it isn't.  So far I think I made a good decision to buy this vehicle.  But as always, time will tell.  I paid $18,563 after taxes, title, fees and rebates applied.",4

I always liked the muscular looks of this car, and test drove all it's competitors before giving it it a try.  The 2.4 liter has plenty of passing power, and I get low 20's mpg, doing almost all city driving.   Highway is close to 30.    For under 20k, I got 4wd, push button start, tinted windows, heated seats, and 10 yr/100,00 mile warranty.  I love this car!",4
833, on 04/24/17 21:31 PM (PDT),Slater Alden ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport SUV 2.0 ES 4dr SUV (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Base with a manual transmission is the way to go!," Just bought a brand new 2017 Outlander Sport and I must say that it is truly extraordinary when you consider the price of it. Although it is a relatively small car, it being a compact crossover, it feels incredibly solid and planted while driving. The steering feels great, I honestly thought it was a hydraulic because it's so communicative but no, it's just a really well done electric one. And the steering wheel itself ups the entire value of the car, it feels much nicer than others at this price. Seriously, I get more feeling from this Outlander Sport than new Mercedes and BMWs. Also the manual transmission is the way to go. If you don't know how to drive a manual then learn. It's worth it. The clutch throw is short and it engages near the bottom, where you would expect it to. The shifter is a little long but considering it's an SUV it shouldn't be short and notchy like a sports car. Pretty much the manual ups the useable power of this car because it's always right were you want it instead of having to wait for the CVT. I got everything bone stock and am very happy at all of the options is has. One of the things this car gets dinged for by 'expert reviewers' is that it doesn't hold up to all of the little tech features like push button start. Sorry but I just don't really care about things like that. It has a key fab so... yea, I'm good. All in all, do some research in a 200 mile radius from where you live and find a great deal. Drove 5 hours away to a different state but got 5k off sticker price. Very worth it.",5

They are usually LOADED with features, and they are animals in the snow. I drove a 2004 Galant until it just gave out, and we bought this Outlander Sport. I adore this car. There are really amazing features, like heated seats, that are available in trims below the GT. The panoramic roof is bada**, and it rides and handles curves amazingly. Plus with rain sensing wipers, the FAST key system, it has everything and more. Bonus, because they're so unappreciated, they're also underpriced.**UPDATE** I have been driving this car for close to 7 months now.  I still love this little SUV.

After a couple of weeks of searching we found that Mitsubishi had a generous factory rebate and decided to give the Endeavor a test drive.  We were impressed by the handling and lively engine performance.  We have two children and were concerned about interior room, since we were used to the spacious interior of our Yukon.  We were pleasantly surprised when we all piled in and realized that we had plenty of room and that the large cargo area had sufficient space for our large stroller and many other ""must haves"" for parents.  We took it home that day. ",4.25

It is now 2018, and I've just rolled over 188,000 miles.  This is still my primary vehicle, but I am considering a new car, although I don't know that I will ever find another I like as well.   It still runs well and is still fun to drive with plenty of pep.  We have had no engine or transmission issues.    On the whole, this has been an amazing car.  The AWD has been great in snow and icy conditions.  We replaced a timing belt at around 100,000 as part of general maintenance.  Had the a/c problem with water pouring into the front floorboards around.  Fixed at dealership.  Had another issue with heating and cooling in 2013, required two trips to the dealership to fix.  Now, in 2018, my mechanic thinks it needs a compressor because the a/c starts blowing hot air when you drive above 55 or 60 mph/get above 2500 rpm.  Works great at speeds less than that, or while idling.  The paint is starting to look terrible, and the headlight covers have yellowed and seem cloudy, making the lights not as good as they once were.  We have replaced motors in two windows, and wheel bearings three times.  Calipers have to be replaced every few years, and we have replaced rotors three times.  Currently need to replace passenger side door lock bc it will no longer automatically lock and unlock, but it can be locked manually.  I still really like to drive this vehicle, but it is looking bad on the outside and I need more seating for my family.  That, combined with my current a/c issue and the appeal of better gas mileage and being able to buy regular instead of premium gas, is why I am considering a different vehicle.  We will keep this one, though, as a spare, and also because I don't want to part with it!",5

The only issues were the A/C condensation leaking into the driver's side floor and the P0431 code for catalytic converter slow to warm which causes the check engine light to illuminate.

It was used as our primary vehicle and traveled ALOT of miles since we lived just outside of Orlando and due to family and work we had to travel a average of 50-60 miles round trip for just work/family. During our ownership we had no issue with the Endeavor other than a rear drivers side window actuator going out which was only $70 in parts and extremely easy to fix yourself. The engine didn't give us a single issue and the transmission shifted smoothly like the day we got it. Interior materials are not high end quality, but still very good quality. The paint on the side mirrors and door handles are bit thin and showed fade/oxidation even though I hand washed and wax and sealed the vehicle. Interior cargo room is amazing...able to transport decent size furniture from Ikea many times and packing for long vacation trips with no issue and easy access too. Unfortunately a Toyota Tundra hydroplaned through 3 lanes on the opposite direction of traffic, crossed the median and slammed into our Endeavor during rain. Our Endeavor was totalled but did its job to protect my wife, mother in law and my 2 year old son who was sleeping when the Tundra hit us. We walked out with no major injuries..just a couple bruises but my son and mother in law walked away without a scratch. My wife loved the Endeavor and still after they discontinued them would like another one. Great vehicle and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a affordable dependable SUV.",5

We have had up keep that is normal for a car this age, brakes, belts, hoses, shocks, etc. we also have had to replace the water pump, and all bearings on the axles. I would drive it across the U.S. Today without hesitation. It still doesn't use oil. Have always run synthetic oil since we owned it. It still runs like a sewing machine. We will keep it until we have it towed off hopefully many years from now. If you find one well maintained, BUY IT! Is very safe and dependable. The AWD is invaluable for rain, snow, and ice.Update: May 2016After changing sparkplugs and changing in all belts and hoses for the very first time since owning my Endeavor, the motor runs so smooth and still very peppy.  This is now our second vehicle and does not see as much use as it once did. Still this vehicle has been outstanding. It does have inherited design flaws to contend with but they are not dangerous. If you can find a used Endeavor the 2004 model in particular you will have made a good investment. The key is well maintained. The motor still does not use oil, the transmission is very tight and drive line incredibly strong. I still feel this vehicle has been on of the very best I have ever owned. I would never find an equal anywhere that had the same miles. Still only one occasional squeak in the interior. There are some design flaws with the vehicle. Exterior door handles, exterior vent in front of the windshield, and paint is peeling in various spots.  I still feel and wish I had bought two of these 2004 Endeavors. Still a great vehicle and dependable anytime and anywhere.Update Nov. 2016We still own our dependable 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor. We just put I believe our fourth set of tires on it. Nothing much has changed. The vehicle is an outstanding daily driver. It is ugly as hell because of the peeling paint but otherwise sound. I still wish I had two of these vehicles. Just a bulletproof vehicle. One thing of note, the timing chain is something that should be checked and adjusted every 25 to 35,000 miles. Do not forget or overlook this very important item less you have aluminum shavings ruin your motor. All electrical still works et. power windows, locks, wipers, heater, A/C and blower. This AWD would be a great vehicle for a first for your teenagers.It is now May 2017. This old Endeavor is still as sound and not using any oil. I have to replace the rear drivers side exterior door handle. The second of four so far. These handles just don't handle UV rays! Other than looking like it has some paint disease it is sound. All electrical items work. It only has 118,000 miles. It has been regulated as my second driver. I think it has become part of the family and most likely be around for a long time to come yet.

All were wonderful, but only the Pilot & Endeavor drove like I wanted my wife's SUV to drive. The torque in this thing needs to be felt to be appreciated. It might not have seating for 7 or 8 people/children, but the 5 that do fit, do so comfortably. The steering is tight & responsive & the drive is stellar.

At age six it began to methodically fall apart. The engine has had few issues, but the window systems will break and fail within 6-7 years after purchase, especially the rear windows. If you have a sun roof, DO NOT USE IT or you’ll be sorry like me, it will break in the open position and it will cost 2K to fix. I suspect I have no trade in value with this car, just in the past 6 months, this year alone I’ve spent 4K on this car just trying to keep the water from coming up through the driver’s side floor. Yeah, you see, Mitsubishi put their A/C evap tank in so that the entire dash has to be taken apart and removed to get to it. Mitsubishi did send out an advisory but not a recall. I suspect Mitsubishi’s reasoning for that is that there were not enough people complaining of this to justify a class action law suit so their position is [non-permissible content removed] You.

This can destroy the wiring underneath which will total the car. Luckily I fixed the leak before the wiring was destroyed, but it cost me $1000 to repair. Mitsubishi should had made this a recall. I've heard  the same issue happening in other Mitsubishi models. The hydraulic arms on the lift gate eventually go bad and won't lift the gate.

I got a 2005 DVD navigation disc instead of a 2007 or 2008 version? Going to have to call.

Safety and reliability are important for me...I took a huge loss as I had negative equity when I purchased that car and then again trading into my Galant.                                I’d say by far the Galant has been the best vehicle I’ve ever owned. It was made in my hometown state of IL.. and I’ve only had to do some minor maintenance on it and the factory tires.. are AMAZING! I’ve special ordered the tires three times from my local tire dealer because of how well they held up... and they are cheaper since they’re petroleum based. My Galant was purchased with SIX miles on it and I now have nearly 190,000! I’ve thought a couple times on trading into a SUV for my growing family but feel this car will continue to be reliable and safe for my family for a few more years! I commute to work daily (70 miles) and have taken 3 19+ hour trips and never once felt it would have any mechanical issues. Although my family feels it’s time to move on to something newer with less miles, I’m sticking to this Galant until it becomes too costly to repair issues.. I hope to see 300-400k miles out of it!

It is at once distinctive AND doesn't call attention to itself. 2009 restyle fixes design incongruities from earlier models. 4 cyl engine does much better than I thought it would. I'm very pleased.  If you are moving from a lesser car you won't have many complaints. I test drove a 2010 Kia Optima before this one, and the 2009 Galant kicks its behind. But then, I guess it should.

The interior is nice but leaves room for improvement. The plastics are cheap and that cheapness is everywhere. The plastic scratches very very easily. My car has 4000 miles and looks like it has 50,000. It has only one 12 V adapter. Cup holders are way to far back, seat heater buttons are in a horrible location. The car runs and drives great with the 4cyl motor. This motor does take a bit to rev up but then the power kicks in. By no means is this car fast from the stop, if you want that get that Raliart model. I have already had the turn signal break and the rubber on the brake pedal fall off ( warranty items).

I've had a lot of mediocre cars and this used car has by far, given me the most bang for my buck. Since getting the car, I have had to replace my battery/starter, and my AC died on my cross country trip (replaced for $600 in the heat of August somewhere in Texas...eeks). I replaced the radiator on it, and replaced the brakes. I know this SOUNDS like a lot, but I consider this car to be the perfect vehicle for me. Prior to my move, I was driving around 80 miles a day on it. After the move, I'm still putting about 40 miles a day on my commute, and it just keeps hanging in there.

The car performed well for 4.5 years and required only routine maintenance.  Two problems came up at around 55,000 miles that I think you should know about.  Heater problem-  The heater began failing intermittently (vents would blow, but no hot air).  The problem was not the heater core, but rather a component (a valve or a switch) of the heating system.  I found that this was a common Galant issue and is not cheap to fix unless you diy.  The other problem was that the driver's power window began to fail intermittently around 57,000 miles.",4

Gets good mileage (23+) and not a penny from me for maintanence (Free!).  Pearl red paint is Candy apple in the sun.

My Galant gets very good gas mileage, about 28 mpg (I do 80 percent highway miles and 20 percent rural driving with few stop lights).  Quality and reliability is probably a little bit below Honda and Toyota, however the cost of the vehicle new is below the other brands, and used Mitsubishis are fairly inexpensive.  The two bugaboo's with this car is the brakes - the rotors warp and there is really no solution so just drive it with warped rotors - and the dealers which are far and few between.

The only problems that I have had are that it squeaks a little (which is probably just the belts getting old) and it needs a new alignment and this is a 6 year old car with almost 90,000 miles on it.

Reliable, feel safe, dependable, great body design which will never look dated.  A lot of people thought she was an Mercedes, Audi, Infinity etc.  However, I had to replace the tranny at 170K. Got a used one 62K. Somewhat of a design flaw with the screen built inside. So, I recommend a fluid/flush every 25K which I didn't do. Always check. The leather interior is still perfect. No rips, tears, wear, etc. Inside is flawless. Only a small cracked line (2"") at the front of dash. Can't noticed it at all. The low profile alloy rims were included when I bought her, and they look great rolling down the street/highway. Clear coat started to fade about 5 or 6 yrs on top only. All I need is a paint job. Rest of car is great. Body is straight, no major accidents etc. However, the ride is noisy, unsmooth, turning radius is about 26 which is wide for a small car, It's light so cornering at high speeds is a no-no.

Any Galant 2002 and up has a very smooth steering and heavy bass sound system that comes standard, which no one really knows about. Japanese cars are the most reliable but this model has two major flaws. 1. the Galant's engine coolant system is made out of plastic, so after about 100,000 miles, it may melt and start to leak. Another is that brakes have to be changed often (about once a year). Over the last 7 years, no repairs needed! Parts are not that expensive. Other than that, enjoy Mitsubishi power",4.625

I fell in love with the side profile and spoiler.  This is my second car (my first was a 1990 Mazda MX-6).  I would say most of these reviews are accurate.  This is an excellent used car to buy.  The only problem I've encountered required a new front oxygen sensor.  Otherwise it's mechanically sound.  Despite my inexperience with cars, I feel this car handles very well.  The acceleration is pretty decent too.  I can't wait to throw some moderately flashy 18"" rims on it to make it really stand out.

I'm disabled,and this vehicle is comfortable, has plenty of room and is easy to get in and out. The more I drive it the more I like it.

Having owned two of the previous style Galants ('99 and '02) as well as Maximas, etc, I feel qualified to make a judgment. The big thing they finally got right was the room.  This car has a fantastic roomy back seat, even more so than Maxima in past. Beyond that the quality is up to snuff, and the driving experience is terrific even though only the 4-cyl. engine. I enjoy driving it more that our 2004 Cadillac DeVille DTS. Though the 4-cyl is slightly on the noisy side, it is the best of breed.  There is always enough torque and power available (better than the '89 Maxima V6). The car moves out so easily it's hard to believe, even on passing.",4.5

It has enough horsepower and the interior is very nice. I don't really like the exterior though, it looks like all doors to me. I can live with that I guess. However due to the sloping down of the roof when I pull the seat up so I can reach the pedals I have virtually no head room unless I lower the seat and then I can barely see out.

I needed something to drive that day so I had my daughter take me to the nearby Carmax store.  I was going to buy a used car that was safe and that would get better mileage than my van.  After looking at several used vehicles with limited warranties, the salesman told me about the Galants that they sold that were new and had great warranties and prices.  The styling did not blow me away but it was alright.  The test drive was ok so I went with it.  23,000 miles later I've come to really appreciate this car.

If it does, it's not great.  So it's a bit tough to accelerate from wet pavement.

Turning a corner is one of the best things to do in an Evo - it loves corners. When other cars slow down in a corner, the Evo seems to want to do the opposite.

I had my MR for about a year.  I opted for the MR because I didn't want the ""hey cops, look at me!"" spoiler, and I wanted the faster shifts from the TC-SST transmission.  It was a fun car to drive while I had it.  It did consume fuel at a prodigious rate, even if I drove ""nicely.""  However, you don't buy an Evo to get great mileage.  You want great mileage?  Get a Mirage.  You want a car that will grab you by the scruff of the neck and not let go until you beg for mercy, get an Evo.  It would do whatever I asked of it without much complaint, except really MOVE off the line.  MR or GSR, didn't really matter, off the line you have to deal with the turbo, unless you use launch control.  Who has time to muck about with launch control on the street?  Once the RPMs climbed over 3K, the boost kicked in, and then you needed to hold on for the ride and hope your eyeballs didn't pop.  Until then, a 1972 VW Beetle would be faster.  Even though the interior styling was dated, the amenities were nice.  Power windows w/ Driver side auto up/down, power sun roof, heated seats, Bluetooth connectivity, satellite radio, etc., etc., etc.  No, it wasn't posh luxury, but it was surprisingly well appointed.  I fit 4 adults (3 average and my 6' 4"" 240 lb. large frame) in the car relatively comfortably.  The trunk was on the small side, but that's because the battery, differential fluid and windshield washer fluid reservoirs hung out back there.  So no folding down of the rear seats for extra cargo space, which would sometimes be annoying.Ride quality ... my grandfather would have called it a ""mechanized buckboard.""  You would feel every little wrinkle in the pavement.  Often in your kidneys.  Sometimes in your teeth for larger bumps/rocks, or holes more than 1/2 inch deep.  However, if you want a car that will devour most of it's contemporaries in the twisties, you'll have to put up with a harsh ride.  Let's face it, you don't buy a car like an Evo MR and expect to have it ride like a Rolls Royce.  It just doesn't happen.Let's talk about the tires ... the stock Yokohama Advans were pretty good tires.  Once they got broken in (took about 1000 miles for that), and once they warmed up.  Took about 4 or 5 spirited miles on Texas roads in the summer to warm up.  In the winter ... well.  They're summer tires, so it wasn't surprising that they were kinda like hockey pucks in the winter.  Also, after about a year and 14K miles, they needed replacing.  They still had some functional tread on them, but were REALLY close to the end of their useful life.PROs:Wickedly fast once the boost comes on; it's glued to the road with unbelievable handling; the Recaro seats make sure you stay put; great visibility; almost telepathic handling; nice amenities in the MR; blindingly fast shifts with the TC-SST transmission; looks better than the STi (honestly, the STi is looking rather dull these days).CONs:Thirsty, thirsty, thirsty (forewarned is forearmed); stock tires take a while to warm up, but until they do, they're hockey pucks;  Recaro seats are rough on hips, even for slender people; convoluted process to engage launch control on the MR.Overall, if you're looking for a car that is fun to drive, holds onto the road almost like it's using Velcro, but aren't looking for street drag racing, or you're not particularly concerned with MPG, see if you can get your hands on an Evo.  Just bear in mind, after 2015 you'll only be able to get used models, and odds are, they were driven hard.  You don't get one of these to putter around in it; you get one to DRIVE it.  Just keep that in mind.So, why did I have the car for only a year?  Because my brother traded his Fiesta ST (a fun, fast hot hatch!!!) for a Mustang GT ... which would do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds ... without the need for launch control.  So, I got a Mustang, too ... yeah ... had to.",5

Great stock stereo, but no steering wheel control, seats are great, if you fit their ideal size, because they hardly adjust, plus the material is cheap, and wears quick.

(front, rocker panels, and trunk deck)  Second the windshield is wafer thin. Mitsu did this to save weight. I got a minor chip in mine and the windshield split when trying to repair it.

The 5 speed is notchy when cold, but otherwise the car performs well. The handling is truly the best thing about the car. The steering is telepathic, and the brakes are excellent. Power is fair, but the second factory reflash helped smooth things out and helped the upper rpm range. I fixed a rattle in the glovebox, other than that the interior is quiet.

I was planning to get a reasonable car, like an Acura or something, but figured you only live once, so I got the Evo.  I have a perma-smile since I drove it off the lot.  The few things I don't like, the driver seat is not very adjustable, the shifts into 2nd and 3rd are kind of clunky until the clutch warms up, the trunk is tiny (not big enough for golf clubs w/ sub, and no fold down seats for snowboard) and the road noise is loud on rough surfaces.

I have owned Trans-Am's and Camaros my entire life. I was in need of a 4 door car and fell in love with the looks of the Evo. I am amazed at the power the little 2.0 liter engine makes with the Turbo. It is such a different driving experience than the torque monsters I am use to, but I love it! It takes turns and curves like it is on a rail. I miss fish tails and power slides, but being able to take turns at speeds my Camaro SS could never achieve makes up for it.

It's a quick car with a great suspension.  It's a great car for the track. It's lots of fun to drive on the highway, canyon, or the track.  It is not the greatest every day car and the exterior looks make everyone think your on your way to see the next ""Fast and Furious"" movie.  The interior is basic and simple, but great for the track.  Its suspension does a great job in the canyons and tracks, but provides a VERY bumpy ride on anything but smooth and new road.  Its steering is quick, which is great for salom or the track but on the highway can get you into some trouble.  If you're not paying attention, you can end up in the next lane. Its acceleration is very quick and you hit top speed of 149 in less than a minute, at the track of course.",4.25

Absolute raw power and top-notch handling.  You don't really buy a car like this for gas mileage, but I was surprised to find I averaged about 22 mpg, and I drive pretty spiritedly.

After months of research, driving cars, etc. I went with a 04 Evo VIII w/SSL. I know without a doubt I made the right choice. This car is simply amazing! If you are unsure at least test drive one.

Not to mention, the car was kept clean and waxed every few months, but the paint developed rust in 5 areas after 4 years.

OEM Brembo brake pads cost over $300 per side, and keep up with pads because replacing rotors will cost you over a grand per side.  OEM tires last about 10K miles, and cost over $300 per tire.

Plenty of improvements over the previous model. The new EVO weighs more and has more things in it but it still has the heart of an EVO when you give it throttle. IMO, it is a great alternative compared to a BMW 3-series, Lexus IS, or Audi A4 for a lot less money.

It's a great value, particularly when you add up all the federal, state, and local rebates that go with it. Compared to other crossover SUVs with hybrid or electric technology, this was priced very well. Corners that were cut to lower the cost seem minor to us (ie quality of some of the interior elements) but I do wish the front seats were more comfortable for longer drives. Lower back can get a little sore after a couple hours - we plan to use a lumbar support pillow for our next road trip. Battery range for EV only driving is good at ~20 miles - while part of me wishes that was a bit longer, that would mean more battery which means less cargo room and a heavier vehicle, so it seems like a good balance. Cargo space is very good. Safety features on SEL model are appreciated. Vehicle accelerates smoothly and switches between EV and gas mode smoothly and quietly. Car looks good too (though I would lose the huge PHEV stickers on the sides).  I'm surprised it took so long to get to the US after excellent reviews and sales in Europe, but I'm glad it's here now!",5

Once you slide into those leather seats and grab the shifting knob and roll your hands over her firm steering wheel then slowly ride her as she quietly drives with that electric drive....mmmmmm so nice.

Test drove a silver GT and red SEL.  Impressions: 1) Gorgeous exterior, nothing not to like.  Nice to have 8.5 inch ground clearance, beats most other CUV's, except the CX9.  Stock rims look great.  2) Interior is also nice.  Seats very comfortable, good thigh support for a 5'11 guy... for what that is worth.  Both driver and passenger seats are 8 way power adjustable, which is very rare for this class.  Not having a third row is probably the deal breaker for my wife.  Between the black and brown leather, I liked black with silver stitching, my wife liked brown with red stitching.  3)  Performance.  Good not great.  Thought acceleration was a bit slow in the 30 to 60 range, although it was plenty zippy off the line.  Really loved the paddle shifters, adjusting the engine resistance when foot was taken off gas (for accelerated charging). B5 for tight city driving or hills made one foot driving possible.  B2 or 1 for highway driving.  Love the amount of control you have over the electric, or combustion.  I would recommend going combustion on the highway and electric in the city.  A guy who bought one at the dealer was in to get a tow hitch installed and told me he was getting 125mpg so far using that technique.   As far as sspension and braking, it was phenomenal.  Ive never experienced regen brakes that tight and smooth... did not feel like hybrid brakes.  Suspension was perfect.... firm but not crazy tight.  Definitely minimized body roll, but could be considered a bit rough for those used to a boat like cadillac experience.  Tech: I'm not a big fan of my car braking for me, so I could care less about that, but for SA, the GT trim has all this crazy safety, tech features plus the moonroof and Rockford sound system.  Android auto, Apple car play standard both trims.  Misc:  Surprised about the 11.5 gallon gas tank... deal breaker for me.  Unless you do all short trips, this is not the right car.  300ish mile range is no bueno if you have to do a cross country haul on occasion.  Worse range than almost any hybrid vehicle.  Still a five star vehicle... but I'd be traveling with a 5 gallon gas can in the rear. Overall great day driving Mitsubishi, and with a 2500 dollar rebate and fed tax refund this is a great deal.",5

It is well equipped with standard features, like power windows, locks, bluetooth, automatic climate control, traction control, stability control, and more. The car isn't going to blow anybody away with performance, comfort, or refinement. What will impress you, however, is its gas mileage and overall quality. Sure, there are time when you are reminded that you have a cheap car. For example, the interior plastics are rough, but this helps durability and keep the cost down. Also, the exterior styling isn't going to get you noticed; however with the bright paint colors available, it can stand out from the crowd. The leg and head room in the front is great, and i'm 6'1"". Getting in and out of it is easy. The rear space is great for city driving, however i wouldn't want to be back there for a long trip. The cargo room when the rear seats are up is enough for getting groceries, and with the rear seats down, i've managed to get a 50"" tv in the back. It has been very reliable, with almost no repairs needed. I have a short three mile drive to work, twice a day, 5 day a week, and it has been two months since i last refilled the tank.Excellent fuel economy.

My mom is disabled having several spinal fusions she can't turn her head and her arms, neck and shoulders are in constant pain she LOVES my little Purpink (that's what I call her) we raised the seat up so its easier for her to get in and out it definitely doesn't feel like a tiny car you don't feel like you're sitting on the road and when the seat is raised it sits like an SUV. The steering wheel initially feels loose it takes small inputs to move it .. Once you get used to it every other car feels like so much effort to drive .. And I nearly take out curbs etc in other vehicles as I'm uSed to the tight turns Purpink can make with minimal effort .. My mom drives my car with ease .. She's even taken several 12+ hr road trips with me which she never thought she'd be able to do but Purpink is so comfortable and easy to drive. I'm 5'9"" and a large person my family/ friends etc are also 5'9"" or taller and no one is skinny everyone fits great .. We don't even have to touch in the front seat .. My friends who have ridden in back say it's not bad ..  I drove from wi to NY and back over the winter we spent more on tolls .. than gas .. On the way home we hit a 6 hr snow storm throug Ohio cars were spinning off the road .. We were totally fine .. Kept my speed down and she drove as well as my AWD suv.

We spent the majority of time on gravel roads and remote camping we drove up and down a nearly straight up and down rut covered dirt hill to get to our campsite on the river even pick up trucks had an issue making it .. We just went.. Up and down it repeatedly zeroIssues .. People kept staring at her all amazed that she could even make it there and she did it with ease .. I LOvE this car ..

2013, on 08/17/15 22:21 PM (PDT),Eric ,2014 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),A modern take on the original VW beetle," I have owned this car for just over a year now, and have approximately 22,000 miles on it. This car is a great value as it gets unbelievable to MPGs and comes with an outstanding warranty. It is also cheaper to insure than its competitors. I have driven this car  in all types of conditions nclude up Vermont snow covered mountains (with studded snow tires), driven on muddy dirt roads, and have taken numerous long trips on the highway. All of which it does well. I don't know what the reviewers are talking about when they criticize this cars performance. It does well doing what it was designed to do. It is inexpensive, utilitarian, reliable transportation. Think a modern version of the original VW bug. Its inexpensive, fun, quirky, and doesn't resemble everything else on the road. Being said, the car is also fun to drive. I think it goes without saying that this car will not give you the driving experience of launching you back in your seat when you hit the gas. It does give you the type of fun driving experience that is associated with driving a lightweight car that you can whip around corners, and in my opinion the car has a very nice exhaust note while doing so. Many of the professional car reviewers over dramatize this cars ability on the highway. It has adequate acceleration, and does fine at higher speeds.

It's light and flickable. Gets the job done, and there's aftermarket performace support.BUT, there's a huge problem that Mitsubishi should be making a recall for.The rear alignment is non-adjustable, and can't even be shimmed. The spindles are welded directly to the axle. So, if your rear toe or camber is out of spec (which 95% of these seem to be), they'll just say there's nothing they can do, and you'll watch your tires wear out unevenly and quickly. As this is clearly a manufacturer's defect, it should be addressed by Mitsubishi, and since it's affecting such a large number of cars, it should be made a recall. New rear axles with bolted-on spindles (not welded) should be manufactured and installed on every 2012- Mirage sold around the world with out-of-spec rear alignments.",3

For a car with a sticker price of $18,000 I feel it is lacking many basics including an armrest, sliding sunvisors with mirrors, and lighted door controls (windows, locks, and side mirror controls on dash). I don't like fumbling around at night trying to find the buttons.Gas mileage in town is not impressive and on the highway I average about 37 (driving 70+). Now if I drive like a grandpa I have actually hit 51 mpg's before, but that is very rare.Other cars with bigger engines and more horsepower get about the same mileage.

2017, on 01/03/15 14:13 PM (PST),sdaigle ,2014 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Quirky and Charming," *UPDATE 7.26.17""My Mirage was totalled in a rear end accident back in March. Mileage was right around 56k. Nothing new to report on reliability or quality.*UPDATE 1.26.17*I've owned my Mirage now for over 3yrs and 52k miles. Still loving it. It's having first year model teething problems, but nothing that keep it from being drivable and safe...or making me regret my purchase. I've noticed recurrently that on warm, humid days (rain or not), the car idles erratically upon startup of a cold engine. The RPMs ""bounce"" by a couple hundred RPM. It goes away once I put the car in gear and doesn't return until the next warm, humid day I start the engine cold. The other engine-related concern is a horrible rattling noise from the engine at start when cold. It only lasts 1 to 2 seconds after startup. I've heard of some Mirage owners having to have their engine replaced under warranty. I'm wondering if my engine will become one in time. Thank goodness for the 100k mile warranty! From what I read, this is a common complaint with the 2014. The only other issue that's worth mentioning, which is also a common complaint, is that the glove box door rattles on rough pavement. It ""chatters"". Very annoying, but not a real problem. The issue being that the glove box door does not latch tightly enough. Otherwise, everything works like-new and the car drives well. My biggest complaints to date are still unchanged. Slow, jerky acceleration at times, especially when the AC is on. It's intolerable. Passengers who aren't accustomed to my car always ask ""why is your car doing that?"" So embarrassing.*ORIGINAL REVIEW* I stepped down to this car from a 2012 Nissan Versa SV sedan. That's my basis for comparison. I don't have a lead foot and quickly adjusted to having only 74hp in the Mirage. I find the power adequate...unless the air conditioning is on or I have to accelerate from 0 to 45+mph with the flow of traffic. This little car just can't accelerate fast enough to keep up without pushing the engine hard. The air conditioning compressor saps a lot of power from the engine. On the plus side, the auto climate control and AC work great, even in hot Florida.I've got to be frank about the transmission. It's pretty terrible. It clunks upon initial acceleration. It clunks when coming to a stop. Half of the time, while accelerating, it over-revs the engine while providing less power until it ""gears down"". I've discovered if I let off the throttle a bit, then lay back into the throttle, it corrects itself and provides more thrust with lower RPMs. I thought this is just life with a CVT. The CVT in my Versa was terrible as well, but for different reasons. Then I drove my mom's new 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport and was extremely impressed with the behavior of its CVT. Always delivers power in a silky smooth manner. No clumsiness and seems to put the power to the wheels much more efficiently.The ride is very comfortable due to the softly tuned suspension. Unfortunately, the handling is sloppy as a result. Contributing to the poor handling is the very light, vague steering response. It's only bothersome to me when driving on curvy country roads when it's very apparent. Thankfully, I live in a more urban area now where it's not an issues for me. Speaking of which, this car is ideal as an urban runabout. Crazy tight turning radius and its tiny size fits anywhere.The interior is attractive and quite comfortable. Great ergonomics. Comfy seat and driving position. Controls are large, well-labelled, and logical in operation. My only interior complaint is that everything in the gauge cluster glows orange. Orange needles on orange dials. Looks bland and cheap. Very happy they corrected this on the 2017. Otherwise very happy with the interior. Interior build quality is quite solid overall. No squeaks or rattles. The only issue is the passenger airbag cover doesn't fit properly. I had it replaced under warranty and it still doesn't look right.Like the vast majority of Mirage owners, I've had an airbag sensor fail causing the airbag light to come on, as well as having the rear wheel alignment issue for which Mitsubishi currently has no remedy, other than replacing the rear axle with another new defective unit. Otherwise, the overall quality of the car is proving pretty good. MUCH better than my Nissan Versa. Read my review on that car for details.Overall, you're basically getting what you pay for with the Mirage and you have to keep your expectations realistic and focus on the positive. Its low-price, good fuel economy, comfortable interior, and low overall running costs make it a good value for those who need basic transportation on a budget. If you want a small car and can afford a bit more , I recommend something like a Kia Rio or Hyundai Accent, etc. For the time being though, I am perfectly content with driving my Mirage. If the next generation Mirage is improved enough, I'll definitely consider another one for my next car.",3

Excellent car, 62975 miles to date. Fuel economy- I average 44 to 52 MPG summer, 38 to 44 winter, mixed city / highway driving. In summer I've gotten over 60 MPG on longer trips at a steady 55 MPH, 72 MPG at steady 45 NPH. When new, MPG improves gradually as the car gets more miles on it, until 40K then stays the about the same. Ride, handling, and braking also improve gradually with use; German cars I've owned were like that. Great in snow, even without switching to winter tires. 6"" is deepest snow driven in so far. On glare ice the electronic traction controls are impressive.  Maintenance / Repairs - in 3 years I've had to replace one headlight bulb ($9.00). Though not necessary, I also changed fluid in the CVT transmission, installed iridium tip spark plugs, and added a K&N air filter element (clean/re-use type). In sub-zero degree weather the car cranked slowly so the 3rd year in fall I replaced the battery with a more powerful one (500 CCA). Replaced front brake rotors and pads at 62K miles, did myself, quick and easy, parts were $145.00 from NAPA Auto Parts. Other than that, just wash, wax, vacuum the interior,  rotate & balance tires, change oil & filter every 10K miles. Seats are very comfy even on long trips (e.g Madison WI, to St. Loius, MO and back, in one day) though at 50K miles I noticed padding on drivers seat cushion is less supportive than it had been. In general the interior is comfortable, and  well laid out, Controls are sensibly located, intuitive, and I'm 5' 10"" and 160 lb. yet it is easy for me to enter / exit the car, has plenty of headroom, shoulder room, and legroom. Seat base is height adjustable, very helpful. Great for parallel parking - small, short turning radius, and it has a backup camera. The tires show moderate wear at 63K miles and seem to have better traction than when new. I highly recommend this car, new or used, and you can get a nice used one at a great price if you shop online. That is because resale value isn't great, which may change as word gets around that these are great little cars, but until that that happens I'd say don't buy a new one if you don't plan to keep it for at least 5 years.",5

The exterior is what you would expect from a '00 model year.  The trunk space is good.  The car drives well and its body integrity feels better than most other small cars, especially Kia or Hyundai models of the same year.

Not bad . it's very dependable. I know it's going to start every time I get in it. The cons: the window regulators are cable driven and are famous for the cables to break. But it only take about 15 minutes to swap one out. I had to change 3 of them when I bought it. Got all 3 at the local junk yard for $60.and fuel sending unit was bad. But also so easy to replace.

Only issues are so minor I don't even care (cup holders as mentioned are long gone), driver side door electronic lock wore out, keys are getting worn so only one will open the trunk.  Lever to pop the trunk is broken.. but all these are so minor for such an old car, that the fact that nothing major has ever gone wrong yet on this car is truly a testament. Having had many used Ford's, Chrysler's, with MUCH lower mileage etc over the years and having to continually put in tons of work just to get the thing to run long enough to get to work, and then having this has been amazing.

2093, on 07/10/11 21:00 PM (PDT),richgroh ,2001 Mitsubishi Mirage Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 4A),Red Beauty, This was my first car and have owned it for over 3 years.Bought it at 104k and it i now at 145k. Only problem ive had so far was the a/c compressor went out at 110k but you have to expect things to break with this many miles. I has been totaled 3 times and still runs like a champ. Besides routine maintenance and the a/c compressor it has been very reliable so far. I am a delivery driver and my other job is a long commute so alot of those miles were hard on it and i also have a pretty heavy foot. I average around 22mpg which is good considering my lead foot and it is alot of stop and go traffic on long island plus it is also an automatic. ,4

It may be small and cramped (or I am just way to big) but it makes up for it in reliability and ease of care i have had no problem doing all the maintainance to this car myself and it is a breeze.,4.125

Right now the car is at 151k miles and still runs like new. I'm constantly getting over 35 MPG. I use regular oil (change every 5k mile) and regular gas. The only issue I had at 105k miles was the spark plug cables which had to be replaced. Actually, I should still call it regular maintenance.

I currently have almost 150k on my 01 ES Sedan.  My opinion has not changes since my last review. I average between 31- 35mph on mostly highway commutes. This vehicle has not let me down. The engine while slow is smooth and reliable. The transmission works well with the engine. The car is much more comfortable than its size belies. I do agree that cruise control would be nice, the paint chips easily, and a tachometer should be standard.

Its speakers are pretty good. It is lacking in low-end torque, but has enough juice to get me out of hairy situations.

After owning two lemons (an '06 Dodge Dakota and a '13 Ford Focus) my Mirage has been a great, reliable transport. It has gotten some negative press for being ""cheap"" or feeling like a 1990s subcompact, but that's its charm! Anyway, it does NOT have 1990s tech inside. It's got Bluetooth, power windows, keyless entry and start, cruise, aux jack, USB jack, A/C, all the stuff you need...It's much-lauded gas mileage is very true: I get high-40s mpg with my manual without trying very hard. (My commute is about 75% highway.) I would highly recommend the manual version (if you can find it)...it's fun to whip the 1,996-pound car around corners, and you can park this little beast anywhere. It FEELS like 1994 when you drive her, and who doesn't want to re-live 1994 in this day and age? It's acceleration is a bit sluggish, but that is to be expected in a 74-hp car. But I regularly pass vehicles on the highway without much trouble, and man are some of those drivers pissed!...I have no criticisms of this car beyond it NOT being a Volkswagen Golf GTI. I would, though, criticize Mitsubishi for trying to move a new Mirage at 15K or more. This little tinpot needs to be at a base-Nissan Versa price point or below. It is the best value for your money. Which brings me to another frequent comment: while inexpensive, this is not a car for poor people. It is a car for subcompact enthusiasts. I am not poor. Keep this in mind, Mitsubishi!

The steering wheel locks up and sways very easily if the weather is a bit windy, that coupled together with a steering wheel that continuously locks up and is stiff makes for a very unsettling drive. This car does NOT accelerate easily and my commute is very noisy. I bought this car because the price was right and it gets great gas mileage but if I'd known then what I know now I would NOT have purchased this vehicle. Also the interior is cheap. The handle that's above the driver's side window is loose and a screw came out. I've only had the car a little over a year. If you're considering purchasing this vehicle PLEASE reconsider!!!!!",1

My 5 speed has great acceleration which seems to be a complaint with the CVT owners. I have had the car for 17 months and been to the mountains of Tenn. and up to the Adirondack Mountains of New York twice with 2 adults and 3 children and a big load of luggage with no problems what so ever with acceleration, mountain climbing or handling. When using the air conditioner you do lose some power but it really is not a problem even with the mountain driving. The car gets about 35 miles per gallon around town and about 48 miles per gallon on a trip. When using the air conditioner, those numbers drop by a couple MPG. The noise level with the windows up is no greater than in any other car I have ever driven. I love my car and have had absolutely no problems with it what so ever.",4
2124, on 06/27/17 17:34 PM (PDT),Pete_in_Pa ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Vastly underrated vehicle," If there were 6 stars, I'd give it 6, although I might wait to see the reliability after 100,000 miles.  First, the very few negatives.  Ride is a bit rough when going over township installed road bumps designed to slow down traffic, but that's to be expected with small cars.  Noise level is not good, both wind and engine.  Tire size is very unusual, leading to only 2 manufacturers and lack of discount prices, but that might change as the car becomes more popular in future.  Now the good- INCREDIBLE gas mileage, by far the best even when compared with other subcompacts I've owned and currently own, every bit as good as advertised.  Attention to detail is excellent; amount of cargo room as good as vehicles that get 2/3 the gas mileage or less.  Handling/control very good.  Interior room OUTSTANDING, better than mid size cars my company has rented for me when I travel, especially in back seat.  Controls in logical places.  Easy to service yourself when replacing filters, checking fluid levels, etc, which is not true with many small cars.  A/C and heating are powerful.  Warrranty is among industry's best- my Nissan Versa has a 36k mile warranty, and after owning it for over 60k miles I know why.  If my wife will let me, I will buy a Mirage to replace her Versa when the time comes.  Obviously if you have 3 young kids and 2 dogs, this is not a suitable vehicle for you, though I can easily carry 4 people or my wife and our 2 dogs in ours.  I have yet to have grocery or other purchases that won't fit easily in this car, including when I buy enough to stock up the basement freezer or when I buy stuff at the home improvement store. When the back seats are folded down, as Robert DeNiro said in that movie, ""you could fit two or tree bodies in dere"".    Great car, really.  Update after owning almost 1.5 years:  I now have a total of 40k + miles on it, of which I put on about 15k.  No major repairs yet.  Still love the car.  Road noise continues to be worst feature.  There are some additional tire brands available in this unique size, though most are made in mainland China.  However, there is a company in Taiwan, Federal, that Walmart occasionally carries in this size and that is offered on the internet, that has been making tires for major US companies for half a century and when you can find those tires they are usually under $50.   The company seems to only do a run in this size once every few months so the tire isnt always available.  For those of you who are history buffs, Mitsubishi made the famous WW2 Japanese Zero fighter plane, one of the finest carrier based fighters of its era.",5

As most customer reviews appear to agree, the gas mileage is great but pick up/acceleration is lacking but sufficient for all but emergency situations. Willing to put up with lower cost vehicle options for steady, reliable, economical, operation. Shopped a few other used car dealers, but couldn't find acceptable color or model (ES w/cruise control) till I went to a local Carmax. They had another similar vehicle, but I paid $99 shipping fee from another nearby Carmax because that vehicle had less miles & was cheaper (by much more than the $100 shipping fee). Used money from my retirement fund, so financing was all my own. Hope to make up some of the money paid out by gas savings.

2127, on 01/15/17 05:34 AM (PST),Kevin M. ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),2015 Mirage ES & 2017 Mirage G4 SE," Hello :-) I own a 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage ES CVT w/ Navigation.  I purchased it brand new on July 24, 2015.  I knew I wanted a Mirage after I went with my friend on November 19, 2014 and she purchased her brand new 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage ES w/ Navigation.  I fell in love with the little car, there is just something endearing about them lol.  Now after 18 months and 13,000 miles I still love it as much as the day I bought it and have had no issues to speak of.  I owned a 2013 Hyundai Elantra before this and wanted something smaller and better on gas.  I looked at the Nissan Versa, Chevy Spark, Honda Fit, Smart ForTwo and Ford Fiesta but none of them could match the MPG, features per dollar, warranty, and optional features.  I did not want a bare bones subcompact, I wanted all the features I could get and that is where the Mirage shines. It gives buyers the option of a basic 5 Speed or a top trim CVT with all kinds of options not found in the class.  My Mirage has basically all the options and accessoried that were available.  Navigation & Back Up Camera Package ($900.00), Chome Package ($225.00), Color Keyed Bodyside Moldings ($155.00), Exterior Appearance Package ($695.00), Park Assist Sensors Front & Rear ($450.00), Cargo Package ($100.00), All Weather Floor & Trunk Mats ($175.00), Mitsubishi Gear Shift Knob ($120.00), Headlight & Tail Light Chrome Trim ($200.00) and more!  As you can see the options on this little car are unreal & even the base trim has PW, PL, PM, A/C, Auto Climate Control, Floor Mats, Keyless Entry, AM/FM/CD & USB & Aux Hook Up & more.  So in my eyes the Mirage was the perfect for me because alot of these customizable features were not available on any of the others and for a top trim model in the other cars it was thousands above my Mirage (I paid $16,500.00 after rebates & loyalty cash).  It has been great on gas averaging  40mpg city, 45-48mpg highway and I can go higher if I try which is kind of fun to see how good on gas you can do while watching the MPG number on the gauge lol.  It has been very reliable with only 1 issue and that was my Navigation System would sometimes lose its signal and Mitsubishi immediately replaced the whole unit under warranty with no fuss and I have had no other issues with it.  Has no trouble starting on really cold mornings and it warms up super fast & these cars have a heat pad wrapped around the internal part in the engine to provide heat quicker to the passengers before the car warms up (can look this up online is where I found it).  The hatch area is surprisingly roomy and deep which is nice so groceries dont roll out when you open the hatch.  I have fit $250.00 worth of marketing in the trun with no problems and was even able to keep the cargo cover on and shut the trunk.  Now if you fold the back seats down it really opens up for you like a mini SUV ready to swallow large items!  Now lets talk about the 1.2 liter 3 cylinder with 74 horsepower (2017 models get a bump to 78 horsepower).  When ai first drove the car it felt a little slow off the line but I quickly adjusted to it and now I dont even notice any difference.  3 cylinders have a unique sound to them when reving which sounds really neat and kind of tuff so its fun to rev the little engine up and the CVT does an amazing job holding the revs right around 3,700 to 4,000 rpm if you are climbing a steep grade say on the interstate (can hold 70 mph no problem).  Even when reving the engine like this it still delivers around 38-39 mpg numbers no problem.  The 5 speed manual is quicker (I drove one) but the CVT is the fuel economy king and I chose it based on that.  The CVT also has idle neutral logic to save fuel when stopped and you will feel it shift into neutral at a stop and when you let off the brake to go you will feel a little bump as it goes back into drive for you (this all happens so quick and does not interfere at all).  One of my favorite features is the Push Button Start and the Keyless Access Buttons on the Drivers Door & Hatch so you dont even have to use your FAST Key Fob to get in the car (just has to be with in like 2 feet of it).  This is a super convenient feature and makes for easy access and it even has a little place above the cup holders that your FAST Key Fob is made to slot into and if in this slot the car will beep when you go to get out to remind you not to forget your keys.  We just had about 5 inches of snow the other day and it had been so cold it all layed on the roads just as deep.  Driving my Mirage in the snow with the factory 14 inch Dunlop Enasave Tires I felt very confident at how well it handled the snow with out sliding or slipping even on hills.  I guess these skinny little tires make it easy to cut through snow because I felt very secure and just took my time.  All and all if you are looking for a cheap new car with a lot of standard features, class leading mpg, great warranty and reliability then the Mirage is a great choice.  Their owners love them.",5
2128, on 01/13/17 17:27 PM (PST),R.Lien ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Excellent little car," I purchased this car because I was looking for small hatchback with great fuel economy. After test driving several other vehicles in this class I went with the Mirage mostly because it seems to be the perfect car for a shorter person...Meaning I'm 5'2"" and no amount of adjusting mirrors or seats seemed to make the Nissan Versa or Honda Fit a realistic option for me when it comes to visibility. So if you're short like me, the Mirage is probably a great option for you.  This car is pretty basic and bare bones, but that's all I need. It's not a super quiet ride, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but it seriously gets close to 50mpg most of the time and my biggest complaint is that the clock runs slow and has to be reset frequently. I've driven the car in MN winter conditions with no issues and have driven up and down mountains in OR...It doesn't do great going up steep hills. Overall all, it's a much better car than I expected to get with my budget. I've been driving it for a year and a half now and have no regrets about my purchase.",5
2129, on 10/12/16 11:12 AM (PDT),Mirage owner ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),2015 Mirage DE - fantastic car," Bought new 2015 Mirage DE 5 speed for my daily driver. Price tag was under $10k off the lot. I have 8 months ownership now and close to 10,000 miles. Only major maintenance issue so far was bad rear alignment, which there is no adjustment for. Dealership replaced rear axle with a new one under warranty. I am 6'3"" 240lbs and the car handles just fine with myself, wife and kids in the car. Plenty of leg and storage room. Excellent MPG. A little rough on the long highway trips because I have the base model with no cruise control, but aftermarket cruise is an option. I LOVE just about everything about there car but I will list the minor complaints instead of all the awesome stuff . Complaint #1 - car rolls a bit in the curves. Soft suspension helps with the bumps but the cornering kind of sucks. Complaint #2 - plenty of storage room for luggage, but no actual center console. You have 2 cup holders up front center, additional bottle holders in the front doors, a small center tray for change and items, 1 cup holder for the rear and the glove box. That's it. Aftermarket center consoles are available however. Complaint #3 - as is with most new vehicles, the factory Enasave tires don't last long. I drive under normal conditions and my tires are expected to need replaced around 20-25k miles. 14"" tires aren't cheap and harder to come by in the states although some owners state 15"" wheels can fit. Complaint #4 - standard CVT model has no soul. Complaint #5 - the AM/FM radio sucks for some reason, but the overall sound system is fine. CD, AUX and USB all work great. Done with the complaints. Go 5 speed manual if you want a little bit of fun. Overall this car cannot be beat in quality, price and efficiency. It does exactly what it was designed to do, and does it VERY well.",5
2130, on 09/29/16 14:15 PM (PDT),Dane ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),After one month with a 2015 Mirage CVT," I started looking for small cars with great gas mileage when my 14 year old Hyundai Sonata hit 180,000 miles and I knew I was going to start facing some significant repair costs. I liked the Chevy Spark but it was almost impossible to find one in the $8,500 or less range that hadn't been used as a rental. I liked the Honda Fit and the Toyota Yaris, but anything in that price range seemed to always have at least 50,000 miles on it. I Briefly looked at a Smart Fortwo with less than 10,000 miles on it, but just couldn't bring myself to take that kind of size hit. I saw a 2015 ""Sapphire blue"" Mitsubishi Mirage with 14,000 miles on it. After a test drive and a little dickering I got it out the door at $8750. Here are my thoughts after 30 days with the Mirage. Is it as loud, slow, and unresponsive as the professional reviewers have labeled it? No. It's louder, slower, and less responsive than my old Sonata was, but it also gets almost exactly twice the miles per gallon. The key to owning the Mirage is all in expectations. If you're expecting a car that gets 45 mpg while still being able to do a 9 second quarter, handle like it's on rails and haul you and 4 other people around at 75 mph in the quiet comfort of a Mercedes 500 series, I'm thinking you may have a long search for your next car. My Mirage has had no trouble getting on highway entrance ramps at 35 mph, then accelerating to 65 by the end of the ramp in order to merge with traffic. Does it accelerate like my 6 cylinder Hyundai? No, but I've never had to put my foot to the floor to get it up to speed like some reviewers claim either. I do occasionally find myself checking to make sure all my windows are completely up when I'm doing 65-70 because there's a bit more wind noise than I'm used to, but it's not like it's loud enough to affect a conversation, or listening to the stereo. And of course the bottom line for me is that I'm getting 45 mpg consistently in real world driving with this car, which saves me almost 1/3 of my monthly car payment in gas over what I was spending with the Sonata. Now if I can get 185,000 miles of trouble-free driving on the Mirage like I did on the Sonata, I'll be more than thrilled with my purchase. One side note- the CVT transmission does take a little getting used to. The absolute key to this transmission is keeping your right foot steady. Slow, steady increases in accelerator pressure lets the CVT rev the engine up smoothly and relatively quickly, and then drop down the same way. Hitting the accelerator hard gives you the ""rubber band effect"" where your engine revs but you don't accelerate for a second, then suddenly catch up. The CVT also has an odd habit of ""clunking"" slightly when you come to a complete stop before the car settles into a fairly smooth idle. My opinion of the 2015 Mirage after 30 days is that this company did an amazing job engineering a car to get 45 mpg while still letting a person drive normally, in reasonable comfort.",5
2131, on 08/09/16 20:36 PM (PDT),Keith ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Incredible value.," I went in to look at the 2017 model, but found that they had a 2015 leftover buried on the lot. It took a while for them to get it out (they didn't know they had it). It turned out to be a CVT (I wanted a stick) ,but I took it out anyway. After reading all the negative PROFESSIONAL reviews, I however was very impressed. (The so-called PROS act like this is the worst thing since the black plague.) It has plenty of room ,it drives well ,rides good, handles well, sure it's all hard plastic inside, but it looks good and seems to be put together pretty good. Yes it does have some tire noise, and wind noise. But it is no more intrusive than some other cars I've had ( focus). Acceleration (lol) is rather leisurely. It has PW,PL,PM,CVT,TRAC. CONTR.,ABS,CLIMATE CONTROL,NICE STEREO W/ USB CON.plenty of cargo room ,good room for 4 adults (5 no way) and a great warranty. I decided to go for it. It had 41 miles on it, sticker was $14,905 (too much, it is 2 model years old after all, there was no 2016). After some minor back and forth I was out the door at $9,400!!!!!!!!!!!. For a brand new car? Amazing!!  I have since driven the car over 2,000 miles and I like it even more. The CVT takes some getting used to, but I'm adjusting. I'm getting 38-43 mpg without trying. No it's not a Lexus, but it's not meant to be . It's basic transportation at a good price. I didn't drive the 2017 (it's supposed to be better) I don't know. DON'T BELIEVE EVERYTHING THE PROFESSIONALS SAY. Try it for yourself, it might not be your cup of tea. But it might impress you. If you can get a good deal go for it. I hope this will help you make an educated decision. I went in ready to hate, but came out with a car . Good luck with your search.",4
2132, on 07/27/16 06:57 AM (PDT),Ted ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback Rockford Fosgate Edition 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),I'm hooked!," My little white Mirage is very economical and pretty fun to drive. I can get 42-46 with mixed driving. It goes way down with a head wind, but I usually find a truck to draft when that happens. I go from 37 to 42 when I draft at about 65 mph. I would have gotten a 5 spd if one would have been available, but am glad I got the CVT. When you get used to it you can kind of make it 'shift' and get your highway rpm's to about 2200 and save fuel. On hilly 2 lane roads I can get 48 mpg if I'm not in a hurry. I pop it in and out of neutral a lot. I also like the trans brake and really think it will save the brake pads. It has tire pressure monitors, hands free phone, high quality sound, auto, ac, PW,PB, alloy wheels and 100K warranty for $11,600 out the door! (Plus sales tax) I just went to Louisville a couple weeks ago (850 mile RT). It cost about $40 in fuel. My mileage check will be over $400! I did some drafting and didn't use the Cruise Control, but I'm a little OCD about my mileage now! Nearly the same mileage as a Prius and 1/2 the initial cost! My 'normal' commute is 160 miles RT. I used to need 11 gallons every other day in my Century, now its about 7.5! I had to fix a flat today, I was pleasantly surprised at the jacking points. The tire monitor probably save me a tire. My first couple miles is on gravel and I may not have noticed the rear tire was flat if not for the light. I'm hooked! Would recommend and re-purchase if a deer or other accident were to total it!I still like the Mirage and now have 35,000 miles on it. I recently put a little center console in it. It was on Amazon for about $50 and is a great addition. I just replaced the factory tires yesterday. To get the 165/65/14 tires would have been $85 per tire but getting 175/65/14 tires was only $55 each. So be sure to ask! I haven't had a single bad experience with my Mirage and would replace it with another if it were totaled.Update:Nothing new, I still like the car at 55,000 miles. I've had no problems to date. The tires I installed at 35000 miles are wearing better than the factory tires but initially caused by mpg's to drop to 38 for a couple thousand miles. They were not the 'low rolling resistance' type. I did a little bit of internet research and found this is normal. Due to the price difference the cheaper tires will still cost less per mile to run. I am still running the factory brakes and they have plenty of life left. I am very easy on brakes though. My 2000 Silverado 2500 with 150K has it's original brakes!The Bluetooth is great for listening to audio books on my commute and making hands free calls. I would still replace it with another and saw a grayish one at the dealership that looked sharp. I am kind of interested in the Kia hybrid though but do want to run the Mirage to 200K.Now I have 72000 on the egg and still think it’s great. Getting ready to put the second set of tires on it soon. There have been no problems and I don’t notice any loss of performance or efficiency. It’s still a keeper and I would definitely look at getting another one if I were to wreck this one. It’s still looks new though!",4

Critics aren't always right. A lot of critical reviews of this car malign the handling and ride. First the handling feels somewhat detached, but it is precise. Critics tend to want cars to handle like a sports car, which is fine if you're driving short distances and limited amounts of time but it becomes fatiguing over time. The nice easy steering and soft suspension make this great for long commutes. I can drive this longer distances than my Fusion without feeling stiff. It is a very comfortable car for its size to drive a long distance. Seats are decently comfortable. I'm not exactly a small guy and I typically drive larger stuff like say a Grand Marquis or F150. I'd even call it enjoyable to drive. If I had to say anything negative, the biggest drawback is acceleration.I hear a lot of complaints about the road noise. While the engine isn't terribly refined the factory supplied tires are geared towards economy, so they're noisy. Once they wear out and you put some softer touring tires on or ones with better tread pattern, it would be a lot quieter. I've noticed that on the right highway surface even at higher speeds it's fairly quiet in terms of wind noise. The car offers a lot for the money. When you compare what you get for the money you get more features with the Mirage and a better warranty. Like your Bluetooth, automatic climate control, automatic transmission, push button start, power locks, power windows, power mirrors for driver and passenger sides, AC? Imagine getting all of them for under $12000, including fancy rubber floor mats, unnecessary chrome highlight package and alloy wheels.Fuel economy will easily best it's rated number with the CVT, my wife and I took a road trip over hilly terrain last week and got 48mpg with the AC on (which has climate control too).Serviceability of the engine compartment is good, there is plenty of room, the design is straightforward.Cargo capacity is quite good if you fold the seats down. The rear seat is serviceable if needed.While it has some quirks the controls are easy to use and adjust to. The cruise control and the radio controls on the steering wheel took the most adjusting as did the rear wiper (but I only own one other vehicle with a rear wiper and it's an 88 Aerostar).Given the fact you can put yourself in a new one for less than the cost of almost any new car, many used ones and given its long standard warranty, it deserves more of a look. It offers fantastic fuel economy and great options for the cost. This is an excellent starter car for a first time driver (they won't be able to drag race), or just a sensible extra car with a great warranty.",4
2135, on 05/09/16 21:08 PM (PDT),Dean Saxon ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),FANTASTIC CAR!  FITS MY REQUIREMENTS PERFECTLY!," Being a recently retired automotive professional, I did a lot of research to get the biggest bang for my buck on a brand new car. I had quite a bit of experience on automotive reliability (42 years in auto parts sales). I knew Mitsubishi was second to none in that category. I wanted a vehicle that would let me enjoy life on a budget, yet be comfortable and meet my driving needs. That's what led me to the Mitsubishi Mirage. I'm saving lots of money every time I travel, whether I'm zipping to town or on a trip. I purchased an ES model with 5 speed manual. I traveled to Albany Ga. to get the exact one I had in mind. The dealer there made me feel like family and far exceeded my expectations. This was the second brand new car I ever purchased. The first when I was 18 years old, now this one at age 66. I have found the quality and reliability to be exceptional. The clutch is smooth and effortless. Transmission shifter has a close positive gate. As for handling, It may seem a little awkward to start, but no two vehicles drive exactly alike. With a little experience, if you can modify your behavior, you may just fall in love with the Mirage's steering and suspension. Some have criticized the noisy engine. On mine, you can only hear the exhaust lightly howling when accelerating out onto the highway. ( Personally, I like that)  When coming to a stop, sometimes I feel like the engine has stopped running (It's that smooth and quiet). Fit and function of controls are very conveniently located and easy to use. The comfort level of the seats seem better to me on the ES model, as they are slightly softer with premium materials, and the drivers seat also adjusts up and down to conform to the drivers height. The interior is exceptionally roomy and close to that of many midsize cars of today. I think the power level of the engine is sufficient. Living in the Appalachian mountain area of extreme North Georgia, I have no problem climbing hills or passing other vehicles, but I do know how to use that 5 speed transmission when doing so. If you are capable of doing any of your own service work, both major and general  components that may need attention at some time are fairly simple and easily accessible. No professional reviewers address that.  I understand the professional reviewer's comments on this car. Who else gets to drive and evaluate every car on the market. What's right for you may not be right for the next person. After almost 2 years of ownership I have absolutely no complaints. I'm still lovin' mine! Gas mileage is unbelievable!",5

Unbelievable!  Huge sale brought me into the fold and the car doesn't disappoint.  The car is packed with standard feature and Is easy to drive.  Professional reviewers mention how the handling and performance are sub par but in reality the car is fine on the road.  Sure it could be tuned to be tighter but it is fine.  Maybe the '17 model will include a USA tuned suspension.  Acceleration with the 5 speed is fine and the car is totally geared towards fuel efficiency.  On the first tank of gas the car pegged 46.3 miles per gallon in mixed driving.  I find the car super easy to drive and it's very comfortable on the inside.  The dash design is good and materials are par for the class.  The seats and auto climate controls are far above class average.  If your going to drive a small car you hope to get above 40 mpg.  In the Mirage you actually get that high mpg at a low price in a good package.  The car is a great value and I'm glad I waited to get one.  I almost bought one in the fall for around $11,500 but I waited and lucked out.  Now that I own one I would say anywhere between 9500 and 11500 would be a fair price for the Mirage.  On the upper end ES model prices can get up there pretty high and I would question the value of those models seeing that they have all the same mechanics as the DE model.   The DE model come standard with power windows locks and mirrors.  It also has a/c and a good stereo.  Look for a bargain and get yourself a Mirage.",5
2140, on 02/23/16 14:32 PM (PST),Arne ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Amazing car for the price!!!!!," I read plenty of relatively poor reviews by the official car rating companies, as well as relatively positive rating by consumers before deciding to buy my  Mitsubishi.  I decided to trust the consumers and I am very glad I did.  I love my car, and I am very happy I bought it.  I knew going in that it is not a luxury car nor will I win many interstate races with it.  I have a 60 mile / day commute to work so I bought it for that reason.  I have been incredibly impressed with the gas mileage, I am always getting 45 miles / gallon and much of that is over dirt roads and back road driving.  I live in Vermont and I have had no major issues with driving the car in the weather.  It isn't great in the snow but it isn't that bad either.  As far as the poor acceleration, I disagree, I have had plenty of power and acceleration for the type of driving I do.  I don't slow down on the hills etc.  I am impressed with the 3 cylinder engine.  It is a little noisy as your driving it, but I am usually listening to music anyway, so I don't notice it.  By the way, very nice stereo system.  If you are looking for an inexpensive car with incredible gas mileage and I think plenty of power despite the small engine, I highly recommend this car.",5

I've driven to Cincy and Nashville from Indy so I have a little more knowledge about my Mirage.  I read A LOT of professional reviews and one of the many things they criticized was the acceleration.  Long distance driving was fine except I wish I did have cruise control.  My leg got pretty tired after 200+ miles in the same position.  Again, moving with traffic (or passing it) was not a problem.  I drive 22 miles to work each day and I have no problem moving in and out of rush hour traffic either.  After driving my mom's 2015 Chevy Cruze I will say my car doesnt' take off as quickly as hers, but I haven't had a problem merging into traffic. I also read a lot about handling.  Easy fix! I bought a $10 wheel cover and I can't believe the difference in the handling.  (The steering wheel is a little on the skinny side so sometimes it felt like the car was getting away from me.  Turns out it's all about the ""grip"".)  There was also something said about braking, which mentioned coming to a complete stop from 60 mph.  Really!  If you find yourself doing that more than once in a while, you need to retake Drivers Ed! My sturdy little racecar has taken a beating. I've been rear-ended, my windshield cracked by a rock flying off a truck and I've run over a couple of pretty huge curbs.  I have a few scratches, but no major damage.  Gas mileage is awesome, parking is so easy and my cargo space was adequate when traveling with my two grandsons and all their belongings last month.  The interior has survived several spills (including nacho cheese on the carpet) and cleaned up very nicely. Overall, buying this car has turned out to be an unexpected blessing.  Like I said back in July, ignore the haters!  I'm still loving my Mirage! (Read my original review below)Three weeks ago I walked into the Suzuki/Mazda/Mitsubishi dealership (after having totaled my beloved 2004 Suzuki Vitara) needing a cheap car quick!  I don't care about features and technology and bells and whistles, I just need a reliable piece of transportation for getting to and from work and comfortable enough for my twice yearly 1,300 mile road trip to visit my grandbabies .  The dealer told me he had a 2015 Mirage with 1,200 miles on it.  My salesman took me for a test drive, but I was too busy chatting to pay attention to the actual ""ride"".  (Duh...I know! ) Anyway, it was a cold, snowy night and I just wanted to get the car and get the heck out of there, so I signed on the dotted line and rolled out.  It wasn't until I got home and pulled up reviews on my phone that I started having big time BUYERS REMORSE!  After reading the ""professional"" reviews, I thought to myself, what have I done?! (*$%#@)  Then I found ""real people"" reviews and instantly felt better.  Yes, the tires are teeny and the ride can be a little bumpy.  For sure I get blown around on the highway on a windy day (did in my Vitara too). Yep, the interior is a little cheap and no it doesn't look like a Maserati.  BUT, for someone like me this car is PERFECT!  I actually don't mind the plastic interiors because I'm a tad messy and I prefer wiping to scrubbing! I love the gas mileage, the ease of using the wipers, radio/cd player, adjusting the heat, etc.  Parking is a breeze! Mine is Infrared with black racing stripes (yeah, it's a little funky!)  So, if you're looking for a high performance, chick/dude magnet with nav systems, wings and landing gear--this ain't it!  If you want a reliable car that you can drive forever with a 10 year, 100,000 warranty that gets 37 MPG--then yes, this vehicle is all that!  Ignore the haters!

Not everyone wants a touch screen to control every system in the car.  If you are this way then this car is worth a look.

I thought the low cost, features, and warranty of the Kia Rio were good but she didn't like the car.  It had too many features such as a touch screen and the like that she didn't want.  It was love at first sight with this one.  It had basic intuitive controls that were easy to operate and the manual transmission model drove smooth and has plenty of power.  We did not test drive the automatic/CVT model.  I see other reviews categorizing this car as sluggish so maybe they are reviewing that transmission option.  The transmission in this one has appropriate gear ratios and has plenty of power.  The engine is TIMING CHAIN driven which is almost unheard of in a cheap 3 cylinder car like this one and has variable valve timing which produces a nice flat torque curve.  The engine is being further improved in 2017 with the addition of roller lifters/cams for slightly more power and economy.  Some engineering went into this one.The car has room for 4 adults and doesn't bog down with the extra weight.  You wouldn't take a long vacation in this car with 4 people but there is room for a suitcase or two in the back hatch.  You could also fit several file boxes back there.The car has one of the longest warranties in the industry.  It meets or exceed that of Kia/Hyundai in every category.  It is also great on gas.  We seem to get around 36 in town and 48-50mpg on the highway.  I suspect this might improve as the engine breaks in more.  Again, this little guy has plenty of power.  I drove it home on the interstate and it didn't slow down on even some pretty large hills.  I was maintaining speed and passing trucks in 5th gear without even really pushing it.  The ""Eco"" light never even went off.  Apparently this car switches to a more aggressive tuning that isn't as good on gas when you really punch it and this light goes off.The engine is a little loud during acceleration but this isn't the end of the world.  It definitely idles very smooth which wasn't the case for past 3 cylinder cars that shake quite a bit.  Obviously the engine is better balanced.The interior isn't fancy but simple which is appealing if you ask me.  Not everyone wants a complex touch screen to turn on the ventilation, radio, and more.  No, this isn't a fancy car and there are other good competing options you should look at for other cars in this price range compared to cars of this segment in decades past.  The Kia Rio certainly fits the bill.This was purchased at Springfield Mitsubishi/Springfield Imports in Springfield, MO.  I highly suggest this location if it is near you as it was a low-key experience and you didn't feel you were in a mind game with the dealership the entire time.",5
2145, on 01/25/16 14:43 PM (PST),RannyV ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Rental Car Experience," Much to the surprise of the rental car company, I recently requested the Mirage when on a 5 day vacation to the Bay Area.  After having noticed the discrepancy between professional and consumer reviews, I had to see for myself what the real story was with this car.  That, and I am a fan of basic, high MPG transportation.  My car was an uninspired silver DX with black interior and the CVT automatic and not much else.  I took the car over winding highway 17 to Santa Cruz and than back to San Jose via the most challenging, pot hole filled winding roads.  The steering and suspension isn't ideal for higher speed corners such as those found on Hwy 17.  It sways a great deal and the steering is sloppy.  It never lost grip, but I wouldn't want to do an evasive maneuver.  What was surprising was that the little 3 had decent power and the CVT did a good job of keeping it in the power band.  I've read that the suspension was designed for 3rd world roads and on my trip home over the rutted back roads, I'd have to agree.  It did a nice job of soaking up bumps and only hit the suspension stops once.  It also has a wonderfully tight turning radius which makes low speed driving in cramped spaces a joy.  This isn't a car to drive on winding roads quickly, but if you aren't in a hurry, it's quite alright.  I also too the car on longish (hour each way) trip up to the North Bay and it performed admirably and kept up with the swift Bay Area traffic without fuss.  In all, I covered 200 miles and got 40MPG as measured at the pump on fill up.  I'd estimate my average hwy speed at 60 - 65 with a max speed of low 70's.  It's an honest little car with personality.  Hopefully the revised 2017 will address the handling issues.  If you're not out to impress people or want to make an anti-flashy statement, the little Mirage is worth a look.  Were I shopping for an inexpensive car, I'd give it serious consideration.  I hope it's a success for Mitsu.  Cheap gas won't last indefinitely and when it inevitably goes up again, this car could be a rock star.",4
2146, on 01/18/16 07:51 AM (PST),Rachel K ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Great Car in a small package," If you are looking for all the bells and whistles you should look elsewhere, but if you want a great warranty, reliability, fuel economy, and easy parking this is the car for you.  I had a Ford Escort back in the day and loved it.  Eventually got a Ford minivan but my kid toting days are over.  I don't haul a lot of stuff and I have no kids at home, so this car was great.  I take long road trips and the fuel economy is great.  52 mpg at some points.  Costs me very little in gas and now that I am experiencing my first Erie, PA lake effect winter in this car I am loving it.  I was very afraid of getting stuck but bought my snow tires in October and have not been stuck yet.  I didn't even shovel this morning after a 4-6 inch snow storm and got out of my driveway without a hiccup.  My Chevy Malibu I traded in for this car was stuck all last year.  No snow tires, but it was a heavier car.  Gas mileage on that was horrible and the interior was cheap and plastic.  And I paid more for that car even with it being 3 years old.  This was a brand new car with a 5 year 60,000 mile basic warranty.  Compare that to the normal 3 year 36,000 mile on most cars.  That was the biggest selling point.  I could afford a brand new car with no worries for 5 years and have no car payments.  It's small but very much a great car.  Go ahead and pay more for the Chevy Cruze (which has nothing on it for their base price) and see the cheapy plastic interior and how many times you need it serviced.  And our Mitsubishi dealer here in Erie could not be better.  They get 5 stars.  Gave me a loaner for an oil change.  Who does that?  They treat you as well as the person who bought a $30,000 car.  The Mirage is not the fanciest car, but it does the job and does it well.  No complaints here.",5

2148, on 11/25/15 20:25 PM (PST),Jerry Smith ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback Rockford Fosgate Edition 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),This is a great extra car., This car is great basic transportation. After adjusting my driving habits from a 300 Hp ride to a 74 Hp economy car I have no complaints. All cars have different handling characteristics and should be driven accordingly. While this car is capable of doing just over 100mph I recommend keeping it under 75mph. I did add some spring stiffness blocks to the rear springs and handling improved significantly. I do not know why the professional ratings are lower than consumers. They are either out of touch or do not have realistic expectations when it comes to basic transportation.,4
2149, on 11/04/15 09:25 AM (PST),douglas lafferty ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Buy it already!," Bought this car over the phone in New Hampshire on a Sunday afternoon. Two days later I rented a car drove from CT to pick it up and drive back. The only thing I knew about this car was it was affordable with great mpg's, had very poor professional reviews but extremely positive consumer reviews.The first time I sat in it was after the transaction as complete and I was driving home. I was blown away on my 3 + hour trip back with how awesome this car is!Everything that the professional reviewers say with the exception that it does feel ""slightly"" top heavy in highway speed turns as totally false.This car is a blast! Did 70-75 mph all the way home, hardly touching the pedal and got 47.6 average mpg! It feels like a much bigger car and is way bigger than you think inside.I love this car, I feel it is very well built a blast to drive and with the gas mileage, it's almost like driving for free! Mine is an ES model with CVT .",5
2150, on 10/29/15 07:31 AM (PDT),Pernell Robertson ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),great gas mileage 52 miles per gallon on a manual, My wife took the car out we had it for a month great on gas mileage we have the manual transmission we put 5000 miles on it and getting 52 miles per gal miles per gallon on the interstate doing 80 miles an hour to 85 miles an hour we took a trip in it went to Colorado in it from Louisiana handles real good in the mountains special for a manual transmission what you need in the mountains looks real great we got the DE added cruise control to it and fog lights not much  extra.

2151, on 10/23/15 04:43 AM (PDT),Speed-Timer ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Perfect for those who just wanna get there CHEAP!," I LOVE this car.  I have had it for ten months and have put nearly 25k miles on it, so I now feel as though I am in a position to comment on it here.  I bought the Mirage mostly for the same reason people bought VW Beetles back in the '60s or Chevy Chevettes in the '70s.  Not for performance or handling, not for comfort or style.  But for economy.  The comparison of the Mirage to the original Beetle or the Chevette is not an unwarranted one.  Adjusted for inflation, the Mirage, the Beetle, and the Chevette cost about the same amount.  In 1970, the Bug was about $2000; in 1976 the Chevette was near $2,800...both of which would be right around $12,000 today.  Though I don't think the VW or the Chevy came with automatic climate control and power windows as standard equipment...in fact, they weren't even OPTIONS!The average transaction amount for a new car nowadays is somewhere north of $35,000, so if a person is spending less than half of that they can expect to leave a few things ""on the table"".  This is not a fault with the car, but rather just COMMON SENSE!  Is the car a bit noisy?  Yes.  Does it handle well?  Not really.  Does it accelerate like a rocketship?  Nope.  Many other reviewers lament these facts (unfairly), but the Mirage simply isn't designed for any of that.  Though the one thing it IS designed for it does very well.  It is cheap to buy, cheap to insure, and VERY, VERY cheap to run.  Most critics of the Mirage simply expect too much for the car's incredibly low price point.My 5-speed ES model was a shade over $14,000.  Could I have bought a 37k-mile 2011 Corolla with that money?  Sure.  But I wanted a new car with a warranty and without a previous owner's cigarette burns and dog smell on the seats.  And I didn't want the Corolla's 30-ish mpg, either.  Over the 25k miles I have driven, I have averaged about 48 mpg...that is not an exaggeration!  Driven correctly, these cars are almost unbelievably thrifty.  Creature comforts are in line with a 21st century car...even an economy car.  Fog lights, passive ""F.A.S.T. key"" ignition, nice stereo, Bluetooth, alloy wheels, automatic climate control, power everything, etc, etc.  I have had ZERO problems with the Mirage, and all it has needed is oil changes.Not everyone wants or needs the classic ""A-to-B"" car anymore, and there are those among us who feel that we, as a species, should have evolved well beyond such humble cars by now.  But for those of us that DO still just want to get there without having a $600-a-month car payment, I really can't recommend the Mirage highly enough.  As an economy car in a bad economy, it truly has no equal.***Original poster here.  Just an update on the Mirage.  It has been outstanding!  The car has needed nothing but oil changes, a set of front brake pads, and a set of tires over the 35,000 miles I have driven it.  Still averaging around 48 mpg.******Original poster again.  Another update on my 2015 Mirage, which I have now owned for almost two years.  I just rolled over 50,000 miles, and the car is as solid and trouble-free as the day I bought it.  No repairs of any kind have been needed, just oil changes.  Still averaging right around 48 mpg.  Would I buy it again?  YOU BET!******Original poster.  Nearing 80,000 miles over my three years of ownership, and the Mirage continues to impress.  Still getting around 48 mpg, and all the car has ever needed is brake pads, tires, oil changes, and bulbs.  If you want inexpensive, simple, reliable, and efficient...like I did...the Mirage is a great bet.  I would buy another one in a heartbeat, and that really is the best compliment any driver can give a car.***Original poster.  Just under 100,000 miles now, and the mileage has dropped off a bit.  Used to be 45 to 55 mpg (averaging 48), now 40 to 50 mpg (averaging 44).  I am not surprised by this at all as it is simply due to mileage and normal wear (plus larger, non-LRR tires).  Mileage may improve a bit after I do the 100k mile service on the car.  Engine now consumes a small amount of oil between changes.  I wore out the driver's seat and had to replace it.  The Mirage has been absurdly reliable, and still has only required 'consumables'.  No leaks, no squeaks, no smoke, no rattles, no problems.  Not even so much as a ""check engine"" light.  Starts EVERY time.  This vehicle has redefined automotive reliability for me!  I fully expect to get another 100,000 miles out of it.",5
2152, on 10/19/15 11:16 AM (PDT),Steven ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),My adult son called it a clown car, Had the Mirage for a week as a rental.  Engine is noisy and buzzy.  If you need to pass with the A/C on you had better get a running start.  Handling wallowed on expressway off ramps.  Driving position  very uncomfortable.  Two airline size carry on's would not fit in trunk they had to rest in the back seat.  My Corolla gets 7 mpg less but I would take over the Mirage anytime.  I wouldn't recommend this car to my worst enemy!,1
2153, on 10/14/15 07:08 AM (PDT),Meghan Puente ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Great bang for the buck," I bought this little Mirage DE in Mystic Black with the 5SPD and I couldn't of been happier. With rebates (Previous Mitsu owner, year end rebates, rebate from my job being partners with Mitsu) My final price was just over $11,000. Only option was blue tooth. Good:I drive 75 miles a day, so gas mileage was important, I average 42 mpg highway/traffic, and I don't have a light foot. trying to drive conservatively and a long highway trip I actually reached almost 52 mpg. As long as you stick in your lane and don't feel like you need to weave in and out of traffic, it keeps up just fine. The seats are supportive, and the ride is comfortable enough. I am 5'11"" and there is plenty of headroom. The piano black trim inside helps break up the matte black plastic so it doesn't look that bad. I do like how this car has 7 airbags and climate control.10 year/100k mile powertrain warrantee and free oil changes for life are a plus from Mitsubishi.Bad:Suspension is soft though and some has some body roll. I wish the car came with a armrest. The Bluetooth works but when I play music through it, Pandora from my phone, the sound is low quality/tingy (AUX cable works better and my music sounds better then Bluetooth). Also I have the Bluetooth that is not apart of the steering wheel. Learning to use the Bluetooth button on the dash is like learning morse code. You have to press it once, twice, three times, hold for one , two, three, three seconds all to do 6 or more different functions. I just stopped using it for music, just to take calls. If you get the DE model, make sure you can live with the seat not being able to adjust up and down. I am 5'11"" and where it is at is ok, but any taller, I think it would be inconvenient. Overall: This is a fun little car to drive, you wont win any races but for the price, gas mileage, great warrantee, its worth it. Critics seems to be harsh on this car, but then again they are not usually concerned with the fact some people just want basic car that is reliable, and get them to work/school and back, and are not trying to set amazing lap times on a race track.",4

I have had it 36 months now and hv 42k miles on it.. and it has been 100% reliable..for what it is Im very happy..great little economy/commuter car..one thing I was shocked to see..it has a timing chain instead of a cheap rubber belt like most new cars now days have..this car might not be the best looking or best performing. But it definitely 100% gets the job done..still surprised at how zippy it is..it will flat out move if I'm not payn attention to speedo I'll be on highway outside of town doin 90/95 and not even know it. Says 140mph on speedo and I can confirm I was almost there once. Just to see if it could. I got scared and let off at 120mph..but still had not bottomed out my pedal.

2155, on 09/20/15 21:50 PM (PDT),Erik ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),I still love my hatchback," I have owned a Mirage for the past year and a half now. I traded in my Ford Focus ST for two of them, one for me and one for the wife. Let be honest in saying I couldn't be happier with my car. When I first drove it I thought ok it's fun to drive but it's just ok, the price point is right and my wife and I need a gas efficient inexpensive car so we made the purchase going these are ok; however three days later I realized that this little car is amazing, it doesn't pretend to be something it's not, it's not a 6 cylinder mustang with a shouty exhaust pretending it's a v8 race car. It has room enough for four people comfortably and five in a pinch when four buddy's and I make a lunch run. It has 2 ways to connect my iPod for tunes and a CD player for good measure. As far as the masses of people who say this vivacious little go cart is under powered, I have to disagree; I have the 1.2L standard transmission and have had zero problems accelerating off a stop light or getting up to highway speeds. That being said I have not driven the cvt model and can't attest to how it drives. The trim is adequate for the price and the controls are exactly where I feel they should be. The seats are very comfortable and the only thing I could ask for is an arm rest (I seriously want one). I have not treated my mirage like a weak little city car I fold down the seats and put several hundred pounds of tile in it for home improvements; I've taken it up logging roads unpacked, unpaved, and very up hill. This car has very much changed my view of vehicles and practicality, I don't miss my Focus, in my opinion the Mirage is more fun to drive it handles like a go cart you can do a u turn on a two lane road with out going off on the shoulder, you can park it literally anywhere, and finally they under sell the gas mileage I usually see 42mpg city and about 46mpg highway, my highway driving in Washington state is normally at 70mph. All in all this is my favorite vehicle that I have owed and the only changes I plan to make are adding fog lights and a roof rack.***Update***It's now been two years since my first entry to this review; my car now has 27000 miles and my wife's car has 64000. Both cars continue to run just fine with zero issues. The gas mileage we are seeing continues to be excellent and actually seems to get better as the engine gets broken in! Can't say enough good things about this car.",5

2157, on 08/09/15 09:37 AM (PDT),Bryan ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),"Most ""Honest"" car on the market"," Don't believe all the negative reviews from the media.  The Mirage may be the most ""honest"" vehicle on the market today. Simple, reliable transportation with a quality drivetrain that delivers excellent mileage. The 3A92 motor is a very good motor designed for longevity. Timing chain instead of a belt with a double overhead cam. You shouldn't be able to wear out either the 5 speed or CVT. Other than replacing the clutch on the manual and changing the gear oil it should last a really really long time. The CVT is way over engineered for the Mirage. The JATCO Cvt7 is designed for up to 150hp and the Mirage has 74hp.  Yes, with the CVT it can be kinda slow off the start but the Mirage just isn't designed to be a performance car.  Once rolling along I've had no issues with passing.  If you've ever owned a Colt, Metro, Fiesta, Swift, Echo, Aveo or any other low cost subcompact you'll love the Mirage.  Is it perfect? No.  The ride is soft and handling is a little wonky but I've gotten more than 50mpg on the highway.  Better than hybrid mileage for less than 1/2 the cost of a hybrid.  The haters are gonna hate this car no matter what.  I'll just keep smiling at every fill up knowing that my cost per mile factoring in mileage & price of the vehicle just can't be beat!It's been 7 months now and I still love my Mirage.  It's been flawless in it's operation and no issues have popped up.  Once the updated 2017's come out I'm thinking about buying a second one used with a 5 speed.Update #2-It's been 14 months of problem free ownership.  Has 74hp been enough?  Yes, but if I lived in an area where A/C usage was required constantly it would be more of a struggle.  Overall, my opinion still stands.  Great inexpensive, efficient car.  Not exciting, not powerful, not a sports car, just good basic frugal transportation.Update #3-The Mirage continues to deliver reliable, efficient ownership.  27,000 miles now with no issues.  Combined overall MPG has been right at 40.  Still love this little car.Update #4-It's been over 2 years of trouble free ownership.  36,000 miles now with no issues.  I've replaced the front tires but other than oil changes and two air filters no other maintenance items.  We continue to love our Mirage!Update #5-Just hit the 50,000 mile mark and 3 years of trouble free ownership.  Replaced the rear tires and cabin air filter since last update.  Other than regularly scheduled oil changes no issues whatsoever.  Still highly recommend this little car for basic, inexpensive, efficient transportation.",5

I'll be brief. Good for the money. Tires and brakes went in the two years at 25k miles. It's a lil cheap, a lil funny looking. The acceleration is fine. The vehicle serves it's purpose well, I'd buy it again. One note: put your car seat in the back before you buy it, to see how it fits. It's akward. Nbd. I'd buy it again",4

I averaged 50mpg on the drive back.  The ride is amazingly smooth for such a small car!!!  I love the Navigation and Back Up Camera that I got as the $900.00 option package and it also has the $695.00 Sport Appearance Package which really makes it look sharp.

Chevy Volt.  Totally rejected due to Onstar and the inability to truly disable it even when unsubscribed.  No spying is desired.2.  Nissan Versa.  Off the line performance sucks bad, even though it has a bigger engine.  It seems like they have detuned it so that you can't peel out.  I wouldn't want to cross 4 lanes with this one.  Car is most comfortable but feels heavy and gets bad MPG.3.  Mitsubishi Mirage.  Best bang for buck.  Great acceleration for size of engine/MPG with stick.  Seats could be a little more comfortable, but not bad.I bought the base version as I did not want the proximity key/push button start that comes with the upgraded versions, since so many of the proximity keys have been hacked.  It would have been nice to have the alloy wheels and cruise, but I feel much safer not having the proximity key.",5

Ok -- acceleration isn't stellar, but it's not nearly as bad as the professional reviews make it out to me.  I can easily maintain 70-75 on the highway without a problem.  The interior is great; comfortable seats, nice controls for stereo, temperature, etc.  I should add: I'm a 23 year old female who just graduated from college, and this is the first car I've owned myself.

This is one of the reasons that made me initially interested in the 2015 mirage.    Things I love:   Compact, easy to park and turn around,  I can't even begin to describe how much the MPG impacts me, it's amazing, I got 42.5 mpg just city driving so far, I can't wait to take it on a longer trip to see how it does.   I love the temperature setting, you can adjust it as low as 61 and I think as high as 89, i can't remember I haven't had to use the heat setting yet (summer in AZ).     I got the ES model with the bluetooth, cruise control, drivers seat adjusts in height, I love that feature, it's not as low to the ground that way, makes it easier to get in and out of.  I love the fact that I don't have to use the remote if I don't want to, I can simply push the button my car and get in, as long as I have the fast key remote on me.   I LOVE my new car!!!!  I was listening to other people telling me what I should get etc. and so glad I went with my  gut feeling and got what I know and trust.  Plus, you cannot beat the warranty.      Now for the cons:   No center console, but I can probably fix that problem and buy something to work as others have, especially for long trips it would be nice to have that.   It has all sorts of warning lights that come on when there is a problem.  I like those, however I already dislike the TPMS light for low tires, I'm having an issue with that coming on even though the dealer just filled my tired 2 days ago, so back to the dealer I go with that issue.   That wouldn't sway me from buying this car, just an annoyance.   The back seat isn't real big, it's ok for children but I don't think adults would be to comfy on a long trip.     It does take a bit to get used to the steering, my first day it was horrible I felt like I was all over the place.  Now, I've got that figured out and happy with it.     I would definitely buy it again and recommend if you are wanting something small, great on gas and a great warranty.",5

I bought my 2015 Mirage ES CVT for $14,119 ( plus tax/title/ect ). This is my 1st import, I have always bought American, but they had NO vehicle that compared to the Mirage in price with options and gas mileage.The power to get up to speed is fine, no Chevy with a 454, but it gets the job done. I'm a BIG guy at 300lbs and my wife is 175lbs. We just took a round trip from Mid Michigan to southern Arizona ( 4600 miles total ) with our little Mirage. Now I have to admit, it needed a little more HP going up some steep mountains. It made it, but gas mileage dropped to 36mpg. Averaged 42MPG overall on the trip. I average closer to 50MPG currently.UPDATE: 15600 on the odometer now. The gas mileage has improved. I now average 55+ mpg on the hwy doing 55mph. Getting 45-47 in town.",5
2164, on 04/28/15 09:15 AM (PDT),distantthunder ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Follow Up On Mirage ES CVT," I did my research...oh did I do my research on this car. I am truly grateful for all those owners that posted their honest opinions, likes and dislikes which were more informative than the jaded opinions of the professional reviewers. I am of the generation that wished for a simpler, inexpensive car that got great gas mileage with roll down windows (less to break down unless you had my new Chevy Monte Carlo at the time which got lousy gas mileage and on which everything broke). If I could have fit this car into that one Corvair body year I liked it would have been perfect. I absolutely love this car.  I've seen Consumer Reports trashing this car (more than once). I'd like to think I have reasonable expectations when buying a new car (I've have over 10 in the last 45 years during that time driving about 40,000 miles per year) knowing what are the plusses and minuses of each so I don't know if I can be accused as having low expectations and/or if Consumer Reports has some sort of issue with their own evaluations of vehicles. It's almost as if they're being prissy about it as if they're being put-upon by having to explain to us lesser mortals what should be obvious to everyone. Well, it may be obvious to them, but not to me. If I want something that is a definitive sports car I'll get a Corvette; if I want something that defines luxury maybe one of those in the class of a Lexus, top-end Hyundai, etc. I wanted something this time as an economical alternative to the wife's very nice SUV as a practical matter. For 14 thousand, contrary to Consumer Reports, the car handles well-enough, has enough power if you drive it intelligently on the road (I used to own the original Volkswagen normally aspirated diesel which taught you to be aware of your driving conditions and to think ahead), the CVT works well with the non-hybrid 3 cylinder without the heavy added costs and complexity of a hybrid, has proximity sensors and a decent radio with mapping and Bluetooth. Of all things, the fit and finish is better on this car than ALL of my previous new ones-and cripes, it's made in Thailand. But then I did take the time on the lot to look for the one that looked the best to me in terms of fit and finish and took it for a test drive. Yes, it doesn't have a center console but with the space savings I found I didn't need it. Yes, it doesn't have Corinthian leather, but it saves me attempting to patch it when the dog attempts to claw it to death. Yes, it doesn't like potholes and bumps. But on a decent road it rides as well as the wife's SUV. Yes, it leans on turns and I would have preferred to have a sway bar, but not dangerously so unless you are stupid enough to try to drive it like a sports car. Yes, it has 14 inch tires and I would have preferred 15 inches. But it actually drives pretty good in the snow.  Yes, because the car is so light it doesn't like strong crosswinds and the CVT intrudes in the cockpit. So what? I'll take that for 50 mpg with the air off. And it has ""gasp"" a spare tire unlike the low end Hyundai and the newer model version of my previous Optima. You get a can of useless flat tire repair for that. But to my immense irritation, it didn't have hooks to hang laundry like on my last car. After grousing about that to the wife for about a week I ordered a hanger from Amazon that attaches to the back of the front passenger seat. All is good.Update request by Edmunds: Car itself has been perfect....except the steering wheel has discolored...maybe my sweat is corrosive...the CVT has been properly matched with the engine and is very smooth...for a 3 cylinder noise and vibration is better than most of the 4 cylinders from other cars in that class...and I test drove most of them...doors have stayed aligned unlike previous cars and there are absolutely no creaks or rattles...I have never had that with any other car and there are some really bad roads in NJ...I hate the standard Dunlops...they do not hold air well...they are ok in the snow and for handling but once they wear out I will replace them...It's not just these Dunlops...the Dunlops that I have had on other cars with different sizes that came standard I have had problems with also so it seems to me there is a quality control issue...either they didn't hold air or blew out from small potholes...it will either be Michelins or some other manufacturer when replaced...I still can't understand Consumer Reports and other ""professional"" reviewers trashing this car...one of the few objective evaluations I have seen of this car came from MotorWeek...and from individual assessments from actual owners found on the 'net...I do like the ground clearance the car has consider it is a small car which works well in snow unlike a earlier Honda I had that acted like a snow plow...Second update requested by Edmunds: err ""boys""...evidently I can't give any more updates since I hit my data limit for this posting. Anyway it's all good with the car. Car is perfect on update request",4
2165, on 04/16/15 12:37 PM (PDT),jwbrooks ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback DE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Better than the Pros think," ORIGINAL  (We owned a Honda FIT for years and loved it.  But when it came time to get a new car, my wife got to choose and picked the Mirage DE 5 speed manual.  One year and 14000 miles later we have no regrets. Combined with great maneuverability, the proximity sensors make tight parking a breeze. The small engine does work hard at the new freeway speeds of 70 mph.  Our mileage drops to about 41 mpg at those speeds.  But at speeds at 60 mph or below, we routinely average true mpg of 50 or even higher.  (Note the mpg on the dash does often read a few mpg too high)  Because of the higher ground clearance, the performance in the snow is surprisingly good and better than the FIT.) ---------------  (UPDATE)  Now after 4 years and 67,000 miles,  I am still pretty positive about the car.  The true lifetime mgp is 44.2 mpg, a slight drop mostly because we have taken a few long trips pushing the speed limit a bit.  The only real repair issue was a faulty heater core that was replaced under warranty. My major complaint is that the stock tires will not last much more than 30,000 miles.  I am just about to purchase the third set at just over 67,000 miles.  I will be trying an after market brand with a mileage guarantee.  The winter traction continues to impress me, even with worn tires and minimal tread.  Living in the snow belt just a few miles from the Canadian border gives me lots of opportunities to test cold weather driving. It is a budget car, and should not be compared to cars costing almost twice as much. The current resale value is about 1/2 what a comparable Honda Fit would be, so it is not the best choice if you plan to trade every few years, but for a long term hold it is a low cost option for people who value the environmental plus of getting almost 50 mpg without the cost of a hybrid.",4
2166, on 04/01/15 05:05 AM (PDT),distantthunder ,2015 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Professional Reviews vs Customer Ratings," This is the best car for the price I have owned other than the original normally aspirated Volkswagen Rabbit diesel. My priority was mpg and I'm getting about 54 for this 2014 leftover. The build on this car is tight with all seams aligned. The CVT is not dangerously slow. You just have to think a little ahead in certain circumstances as I did with my Volkswagen. The ride is as good as the 2011 Optima I traded in. This is a very light car so there is some wind buffeting but I'll take that considering the mpg. Comfortable seating. No harsh vibration from the engine at idle. At least on my car, the engine is smooth and the noise level is only intrusive at hard acceleration.  Good radio. Update requested by Edmunds 10/2/2017: I have another review in here somewhere that is more detailed. This non-hybrid three cylinder was/is the best bang (and build) for the buck of all cars I have owned...from sports to luxury-and I have owned many driving over 40,000 miles per year varying from a 280Z, Hondas, Toyotas to a Lincoln Continental. I was very surprised at the sophisticated electronics in this car considering the price. Car has remained ""tight"" with no squeaks and rattles with all seams still aligned. The so-called professional reviewers really need a reality check considering their criticisms of this vehicle. The ride is no worse than my wife's $40,000 SUV on good roads. It doesn't especially like bumps and potholes-so what-for what the vehicle gives me in mpg I'll ""suffer though it"" unlike the pansies at CR and the other car mags. The car is nimble enough for both turns and off ramps if you don't try to drive it like a sports car. It's knowing the limitations of the car and your own expectations (and maybe your age). I came to appreciate a car that could satisfy multi-functions such a rear seating, ability to carry groceries and have great gas mileage. As my next door neighbor said once to me...""Having a Corvette made me appreciate my Honda that started every day.""",5

Don't use cruise control at freeway speeds 65+ mph or up mild to steep hills. The CVT transmission is like a slipping clutch and cruise control is not designed to handle this. It will reach RPM's over 4500 and kill your gas mileage instantly. The transmission itself can not handle 65+ mph. The gas mileage has been as low as 30 MPG at speeds of 65 mph. I should have bout the 5 speed. The Mirage is everything the Geo Metro should have been except that horrible CVT transmission. I don't know what kind of highways they test mileage on but even a level road at 65+ will not get you even in the 40's with or without cruise control.,3.875

Before buying it, reviewers, including Edmund really put the car down. I feel most of them were unfair with the reviews. This car is no louder, rougher, or less quality built compared to other subcompacts cars out there and I drove quite a bit before deciding on the Mirage. Yes it is a little loud when revving, yes it can be bumpy on a bad road, yes it is small and compact but at $13,000 base, it's loaded enough and fun! I got it for a better price with some effort. Think of it as a Modern Geo Metro, better built! ",4.625
2170, on 04/05/18 11:39 AM (PDT),KECIA TODD  ,2018 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback SE 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Love my silver bullet," I purchased my Mitsubishi Mirage in December 2017. I have already put 3600 miles on the car driving back-and-forth to the grandkids house. It has enough horsepower to keep up with other cars on the road and to pass when necessary. The interior of the car has ample space in the front seat and even seems larger then some full-size cars. I can park in tight parking spots and turn on a dime. I only have two issues with this car, one is there are no little pockets to put things in and the back up camera is not as clear as it should be. All in all I love this car and I think it’s fun to drive. If you’re looking for a small car with excellent gas mileage (41 highway 39 city) this car is for you.",5
2171, on 02/19/18 14:49 PM (PST),Jake ,2018 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Best Value," Bought a 2018 Mirage 5speed in November of 2017 for $9988 plus tax/license. After 13,000 miles I consider it the best small car on the road for these reasons:  The 3 cylinder engine has been around for decades and is both refined and powerful for its size. The car easily keeps up with traffic and holds 65mphon the highway with two adults at 3400 rpm, which is about half throttle. Engine red line is 6,500rpm. The interior is spacious and comfortable and the ride is surprisingly smooth. Handling is nimble and secure at legal speeds and interior noise is low to moderate. The car has bluetooth/USB and touchscreen controls, although I mostly use the manual controls and just listen to the radio using the steering wheel mounted buttons. It has power locks/windows and numerous airbags, and even a backup camera, which seems a little unnecessary to me.  Using the heater all winter( which runs the compressor and lowers mileage) I have averaged 45plus mpg in general driving and 48-50mpg highway. On warmer days when no heat was needed the mileage went up so that one tankful averaged 49mpg. This is phenomenal for a non hybrid car. My wife had a 2012 Prius C and the Mirage has a similar 'feel' and fuel efficiency for $10,000 less. My only complaints-and these are minor-is that the manual transmission is a little 'notchy' at first and requires some practice and break-in to shift smoothly. (The gear ratios, however, are Perfectly spaced for the engine and allow the car to cruise most roads at under 3,000rpm. The  little engine is NOT straining as one would expect, rather has a smooth, torquey power band.) The only other minor flaw is that the windows tend to fog up a little in winter unless the fan is on. This will not be a problem in summer.  This car has a 10 year/100,000 mile powertrain warranty and 7 years rust through protection with a 5 year roadside assistance. It is solid all around transportation that is fun to drive-not in a Mazda Miata way- rather in a perky small car easy to drive way.My advice is to IGNORE the 'experts' and test drive this car! For the price of a used car like a Honda Fit you will have a great little car with a fantastic warranty.UPDATE: September 2018..after 13,600 miles the car has been totally trouble free and the shifting has smoothed so that I easily go between gears. The air conditioning draws some power from the engine and is not the most powerful air I have ever used, buts works well enough. NOT a big deal. I honestly like the car more and more and would recommend this vehicle to anyone. It is not the smoothest, fastest, quietest, biggest, best handing car on the road but it is NOT supposed to be- Remember that it costs less than $10,000 new and it does EVERYTHING well For basic all around driving... At 46 to 50 genuine miles per gallon what's not to like??",5

2178, on 01/17/18 17:40 PM (PST),gary greenwell ,2017 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl 5M),Retired mechanic loves the Mirage," I started working on cars in 1968, doing bodywork. Later I bought and ran a repair shop. Also built close to 200 salvage vehicles over a career that ended in 1999. I paid cash for the car, have carried no debt for 21 years now at age 67. I can afford to buy more expensive, the wife can afford to buy even more expensive. I bought the Mirage after researching the MPG capabilities especially those drivers who could reach 60 mpg in this car. The rear seat leg room is ample for my parents (96&92) to ride comfortably up to 50 miles each way without any problem. with my 6 feet in the drivers seat moved all the way back.  Closing in on 3 years and 38,000 miles, the biggest problem was rear axle alignment which Mitsubishi finally fixed with a replacement rear axle. i had almost the same problem with a 2006 Corolla bought new which required a body shop to re position the rear axle mounts. The Mirage axle had camber and toe issues with the right rear wheel. Now I have a new set of Ensaves and a properly aligned rear axle and can really feel how well this car handles, with no modifications.  I can go around the turn into my neighborhood coasting at 27 mph without any problem except the gasp from the wife if I tried to do that with her in the car. I have driven almost any car you could imagine including a DeTomaso Pantera, Ferraris, Jag XKEs. The Mirage is not one of those but with the alignment fixed it's completely capable of doing things on cloverleafs that would make you gasp and that is with stock suspension components. As far as resale value, I have no intention of selling my Mirage so resale won;t happen unless I become physically incapable of driving a manual transmission, at least until the warranty expires, by which time I will be 73+ years age. I actually bought another car to keep the miles down on the Mirage so it will be under warranty for the full 10 years, or at least close to that number.  Still feel the same way as I did when I first posted this review.",5

The ""expert"" reviews failed to recognize the best feature of this car - low cost of operation. First you get 43  to 46 miles per gallon.  Couple that with it's 5 year bumper to bumper warranty it makes sense for buyers who  need low cost of operations this includes young adults starting out, college students, and commuters.  Not having to worry about a major repair bill in the first 60 months compared to 36 months in a GM, Ford, or Honda is a big plus.  It is the  best bargain out there.  You can get I into an Base ES with CVT, blue tooth  and fog lights for $12.5k-$12.9k with the rebate. That translates into a $230 car payment (60 month). When my daughter's used car was in need of replacement our first thought was to buy a low mileage use car, but having a vehicle  without a warranty would require buying an extended warranty.  i never considered Mitshubisi, but when I learned that they had a 5 year warranty we decided to look at the Mirage.",5
2185, on 03/20/17 10:16 AM (PDT),mzcoleman ,2017 Mitsubishi Mirage Hatchback ES 4dr Hatchback (1.2L 3cyl CVT),Keep Ignoring the Haters!," I just read a review of the 2017 Mirage on MSN and I am perplexed!  The reviewer basically ended his scathing review of this car by saying owners would not take care of it because they won't love it.  What?!  Are you kidding?  Did he bother reading CONSUMER reviews of this car?  Probably not.  I don't know what it is about the Mirage that reviewers hate so much, but I couldn't disagree with them more.  Over a year ago, I wrote my first ever review shortly after purchasing a 2015 Mirage.  My review was titled ""Ignore the Haters"" and I detailed how I had extreme buyer's remorse because of the professional reviews. Thankfully, I started reading consumer reviews and instantly felt better.  My 2015 was a very base model, which was fine with me.  I'm not a car person.  Just like something reliable.  I had purchased the 2015 after I totaled my previous car (on black ice).   The Mirage was what I needed at the time and I planned to drive it for the next ten years (or more).  Unfortunately, at the end of last month I was rear ended on the highway and surprise-- my car was totaled! (Thankfully neither me or my passenger where hurt.  The Mirage sustained a 50 mph impact which first appeared as just a horizontal crack in the bumper.  However, when the bumper was removed, there was over $5,000 in additional damage.) I returned to the dealership in hopes of finding another 2015 Mirage.  I ended up with a 2017 Mirage with all the bells and whistles:  Bluetooth, backup camera, keyless entry, cruise, press to start, etc., etc.  Whoa!  I had never been impressed with the extras, but now that I have them I LOVE 'EM!  One of the main reviewer gripes concerns horsepower and acceleration.  If I was trying to win the Indy 500 that might be a problem, but I'm just trying to get to work! And maybe it's my imagination, but those four extra horses in the 2017 seem to make difference.   My Mirage moves when it needs to.  And the new steering wheel makes handling so much better.  Yes, there is still cabin and engine noise, but it doesn't both me because I'm usually playing the radio or a CD.  Yes, it's still lightweight, but I swear this baby rides smoother and feels bigger!   Yesterday after scraping off the dealer decals, I couldn't wait to take that Pearl White beauty to the car wash to clean her up and show her off.  I love this car! And if you buy this reliable piece of transportation that gets great gas mileage and also has some pretty great options for an awesome price, you'll love it too!  Keep ignoring the haters!",5

It's a car, it has a radio and CD player, and heat and a/c, what else do you need in a car.  Praying for not too much snow this winter as winter driving is the only thing that scares me. I'm not a bot, I'm not a Mitsubishi fanboy, although I always wanted a 3000 gt when I was younger.  The car will get you to work, school, the store, wherever you want to go.  The fact that there's some riding lawnmower with more horsepower is funny but right now, for the money I have to spend this is the car for me. I'll update after a snow drive to see if it can stay in the road. Take care",2

While 78 horsepower sounds wimpy on paper, it's more than enough for what you're usually doing (driving to work, on freeways, around town, etc.). It's not like you were planning on towing an RV. Also, keep in mind that the Mirage is one of the lightest cars in its class, which lets it sail gloriously at speed. The interior is completely acceptable and if you want to improve it, there are wonderful seat covers available from independent vendors that will give you as much cushion as you need. My only reservation about the car is that it is a bit Mirror-Reliant due to the hatchback window being so small. Fortunately, the car also has one of tightest turning radiuses in its class, so it can maneuver through anything without trouble. Overall, I love this car! It's adorable and not a faceless blob!",5

There isn't a squeak or rattle to be heard. I attached a Curt hitch just so i could haul more with a hitch carrier. The interior, although Spartan but some standards, shows no sign of wear or tear. We just had a snow and ice storm and this little car got around so well it surpassed my expectations. I am originally from North Dakota, so I know my winter driving. It handles great. Now it has Dunlop Enaslaves 165-65-14 tires as standard equipment. The only other tires in this size are Bridgestone Potenza, so stick with those brands. They are LRR so mpg won't be affected, but switching to cheaper, more common tires will decrease mpg. The least amount of road friction fit this little 78 HP the better. I did swap out the rear springs for Volkswagen Beetle rear coils for a ride rear height and stiffer ride. Just a thought. Also, check out mirageforum dot com for many of us who love our Mirages.

The engine sips gas and I love the 5 speed manual transmission too. The only things I dont like is the lack of a light in the glove box and the lack of an outside temp gauge, thats it! The room inside the back with the rear seats down is pretty damn big and the front seats for me are pretty damn comfy, Im 5 ft 8 and fit just right in this car! There is some truth in some road noise on the highway with the stock Dunlop tires, but its not overpowering and the new radio for 2018 takes care of the noise anyway!

The gas tank cover does freeze under 25F. The Rockford navigation system is a bit awkward and takes some time to adjust. Voice command inside the car is hopeless.

Awesome looks, great handling & it is pretty quiet. The ride is very good on the expressway, but around town on less than average roads, it tends to buck a bit. The hatch offers more space than the sedan. But IMO, the taillights are the biggest let down VS. the sedans. The CVT is for the people who want mileage over performance. You can play with the paddle shifters & NEVER have to worry about over-revving the engine. It still steps out nicely, but you won't win any drag races off the line. My mileage has been for the highway doing 70-80: 29.3 mpg & keeping a solid 55 MPH pace I get usually over 35. Around town I normally get about 25",4.375

It is like a horse that needs you to let out its reins. It holds the road well at high speeds and the engine does not even labor a breath - even at 90. However this is not a good city car because of poor gas economy during non-highway driving and hard to park because it's wide and not too easy to see behind you because of an excessively slanting hatchback; and the imperfections on city streets shake the whole car making the city ride very unpleasant.

Very small bumps are okay and smooth roads great. But any other size bumps are bad jolts and very uncomfortable. Road noise is pronounced because poor insulation. The rear view is awful - obstructed by low hatchback, head rests in the back seats, and if people sit in the back seat, it's hard to see anything.

Mitsubishi had done no promotion of it and it sat unloved for almost a year at the dealer. We were replacing our 2001 Honda Odyssey after it was totaled by a bad/unfocused driver on the highway. We test drove nearly 70 new vehicles before we drove this one. It grips the road and the driver feels very connected without being beaten by it. It lacks many bells and whistles, but there is something so pure about the experience that it is hard to explain. There are faster and better MPG cars all around, but few can haul as much and look so unique doing it. I get thumbs up and comments from EVO guys all the time. It is like a secret held between those that know. I had a guy follow us into a parking lot to ask about it. He first thought it was a Volvo C70 wagon that had been chopped. When I have it waxed and shining, it still looks good. PROS: It can haul nearly as much as our Honda Odyssey did, but it is smaller. It sounds tough (the kid in me likes that). It has enough zip to get you moving as needed. It grips the road and the sway bars make the curves fun. This is a very mechanical car making it feel very connected to the road, in a good way. CONS: Parts are difficult to find for this car and they are moderately expensive. It has some EVO parts, some Lancer parts and some Ralliart parts. The AC blew and it took two weeks to get some new and second hand parts to fix it. I hit a huge pool of water during a nasty storm and now we have squeaking from the shock bushings. The shocks are still good, but I may have to replace them. OVERALL: I would buy this car again without hesitation. I know a day will come when finding parts becomes too painful and I will have to sell it. I hope it will go to someone that loves it as much as we do.",5

This car has been fantastic and is affectionately referred to as my Swiss army car.   Now at 106,000 it has had nothing buy routine maintenance.  Engine is still strong, interior held up very well with no rattles or squeaks from rubbing components.  The cargo space is great including the gear storage tray under the boot floor, which has been the permanent home for tools, climbing gear, misc. camping supplies and all those small things you should have brought but always forgot.  I can fold down the seats and fit my ski's and 29er Mt. bike or throw in some blankets and camp for the night with my 150 pound Rottie by my side.  It's no speed demon but certainly no slouch either.  Yearly 10-12 hour trips to the Carolinas have been comfortable and stable averaging 85 mph.  I can pass at high speed with ease & jump into highway traffic from a stop without concern.   The only cons I have experienced are the following: 1) The cooling fan has always run intermittently, even 2-5 minutes after the car is turned off. From what the forums say, this is known but never recalled for a fix.  2) I have had consistent uneven wearing of the break pads? 3) Factory replacement parts are stupid expensive from the dealer!  OEM exhaust was $1300 + & only one company makes a aftermarket stainless steel replacement for the down pipe (Eastern Aluminum) at roughly $375 with CAT+ $400 (+/-) for the magnaflow CAT Back in stainless steel.

Just turned 22000 miles (Jan 2008). Knock on wood the car has been free of any problems of any kind. Short of routine maintenance the only thing I've had to do is change a tail light bulb.  Car is comfortable but about 5 hours into a long trip I find myself wishing for just a little bit more lower back support.  Fit and finish is excellent inside and out. For a wagon it's peppy and handles very well. Gas mileage is what I'd expect for a sport wagon and the engine sings over 3500rpm which is when the engine kicks over to the second cam profile. Ride is stiffer but it's suppose to be - sport suspension.  Very happy with the car. ,4.875

The longest day was acroos Texas, 750 miles day. No problem what so ever!! If you can be really gentle on the gas pedal like myself, 24mpg with that kind of load is possible. On the hills it struggles a bit. The sweet spot for the rpm is arond 2200 to 2600. I found that at the 4th gear this would give you 50~63 mph and really efficient. 32~35mpg on the high way is possible if you do this constantly. I had the car for more than 3 years now.

However, the paint job is horrible, easily scuffing and flaking after the slightest scratch on the bumpers or quarter panels.

Not four months after my tune up, my car broke again. The first time was a faulty crank sensor (whatever the heck that is) and second time was some accelerator sensor.

After 30,000 miles in 6 months, my fears have been unfounded so far. I have only made one trip back to the dealer for a minor problem.  Its fuel mileage is OK, as mentioned the real culprit is the small fuel tank. I get about 25-27 mpg in the mix of driving I do (usually about 40% city / 60% highway).   Paint is irritatingly cheap tough. My car already has lots of swirls and scratches and I generally don't use automatic car washes.  As was also mentioned, road noise on the highway above 65 mph in this car is obnoxious. The seats are OK, but were never designed to spend hours in everyday.

My only complaints are that the gas mileage could be better, the A/C controls feel cheap, as do some other interior pieces.  But I'm glad I bought this car instead of a Focus wagon.

What a blast driving this thing.  Always have a smile on my face.  Wish I had bought it sooner as the winter is here and cannot enjoy the top down.   Good acceleration and handling.  Back seat space for sitting is limited, and hard to get things in and out of, but decent trunk space.  I'm having issues with fogging on the inside of the front window after it rains (don't have access to garage parking).   I'm going to get a cover to see if that helps.   Also when it rains the water drips into the car if you put the windows down.  Got space for a car seat since I'm a new grandma, so I will enjoy for years.   ",4.875

The blind spot is a beast, but with attentive lane changes and side mirrors, it is possible to maneuver.  It's still early to be sure about reliability, but it seems pretty good with gas.  If you have children this car is a no no!  I am sure the back seats are just to get an insurance break on being a ""four seater"".

Seems sturdy, rides nice. Seems to be plenty of leg room in the front. I love the convertible top and ease of operation. I got the GS instead of GT because of the lower octane (the GT requires 91). GS seems to have plenty of power for my use. Blind spot in right rear makes you really look when changing lanes though.   Also, beware of adding a factory spoiler, can't see out the back, even when top down... right in the way! I added camera back up. Standard fosgate radio,Gs needs better antenna, anti skip (would upgrade if doing over). Burned Cd's skip A LOT. Key had remote buttons and chip in it... pricey.

So, speed and acceleration was a consideration. The kids are no longer at home and there was no need for a back seat. We have owned four-door sedans for the past 25 years and decided to take a plunge to the past and enjoy the sporty vehicles we once drove. We looked at a number of other makes. Our considerations included body looks, interior size, engine size, and cost. The cost eliminated many other vehicles, as well as the interior space. It seemed the more sporty, the smaller amount of front seating area. We have had the car for only two months and do enjoy driving it. ",4.625

My old car was 19 years old so to me everything about driving this car is new and exciting. The convertible top goes up and down with one push of a button. The car has so much pep and drives so smooth that I find myself speeding at times. The camera (new in 2010) that is used to help you when you put the car in reverse is great.  Merging to get off a highway while moving to your right is very hard due to the huge blind spot the convertible top gives you. Driving with the top off is the best. This car is fun to drive but it takes time to deal with the blind spots that are huge. The backseat is useless. The trunk is big even with the top off. ",4.25

I agree with the purists: the Spyder is not a real sports car (front-wheel drive pretty much closes the argument on that). But it has good looks, great interior, room to spare in driving position and very good performance with the V6 6 speed manual transmission and all this in better than average comfort. The car also made sense budget-wise. I feel I have the best of both worlds: a car that offers sports-like performance and looks with more room and comfort than a lot of more expensive two seaters. Good-looking, but with brains! A word for the torque issue: real, but only if you really push hard the revs, otherwise OK. Mine is triple-black. Love it",4.5

Beautiful design turns heads, esp. with skirts all the way around. Great performance, steering, suspension; good brakes. Nice throttle note. Roomy front, but adults are really pinched in rear. Excellent stereo. All controls silky and intuitive. Wheels are set way out, and easy to scrape... watch out. Top functions and seals flawlessly; minimal wind noise. I love this car.

Although the turn radius is greater than my last pickup and with the top up you can see very little around you, it more than makes up for having to be extra careful with the fun of owning a convertible AND the really flashy look that draws everyone's attention!

I saw the Pontiac Solstice in a Bon Jovi video and it got me thinking I should have a new car. I went out and test drove the Pontiac. Next I drove the Spyder. There was no comparison. In the Spyder you have enough room in the truck to put a set of golf clubs and some extra stuff. Also you have enough room in the back seat to squeeze someone if you have to for a short ride or more realistically use for additional storage. I have no complaints except for the blind spot when the top is up. ,4.875

I've driven the 2007 model as well. The 08 adds 18"" wheels in place of 17"". The handling is phenomenal. The smooth, quick stick and power make this an incredible sports convertible.

I took it on the Blue Ridge Parkway a few weeks ago, and the girl I was with asked me to slow down at first until she realized how well the car hugged the corners, so she just sat back and enjoyed the ride.  Nothing has broken in three years, and people even tell me they still notice a hint of new-car smell.  The back seat is more comfortable than you'd think.",5
2300, on 08/13/05 01:53 AM (PDT),DT ,2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder Convertible GT 2dr Convertible (3.0L 6cyl 5M),My latest purchase," I have wanted one of these since I first saw one.  I finally got a used one last weekend.  I like the handling of the car, although the turn radius is big. With the top up, the rear window is really small, and the rear quarter blind zones take some getting used to. However, I love the size of this car.  I am 6'2"", and I still feel like I have plenty of room.  I drove it about 100 miles on a highway at 70 with the top down, and didn't get blown away.  Good gas mileage, as I got 30 expressway on the way home.  This was the perfect car for me!",5

2303, on 01/19/05 17:16 PM (PST),Wally ,2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder Convertible GT 2dr Convertible (3.0L 6cyl 5M),Affordable Price yet Costly Upkeep," I bought my 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse for the sole purpose of having a fun convertible at an affordable price. I was disappointed to discover that I was visiting the gas station more often, especially with the impractical premium gas prices in California. But despite all that, I still enjoy the car and I think its very attractive. I get a lot of looks and girls definitely enjoy cruising with me in it. Another disappointment was the price for maintenance. In the service manual, it says to replace the spark plugs at 25,000 miles. Just the labor itself for 2.5 hours is about $200. That is not including the six spark plugs you have to buy for $20 each. I guess that is what a high performance engine calls for. This car Earns a B- in my book.",3.75

I wanted a convertible and I didnt need 350Z performance.  I wanted good gas mileage and a car that I could put gas in, change the oil periodically and otherwise forget.  I am 63 so a lot of other cars were out.  This car has been a very pleasant surprise.  I have had no problems with it and it has been fun to drive even in the worst traffic with the worst drivers on the planet.  It has decent pickup (GTS 5 Spd) and decent handling.  I bought it two years old with 20,000 miles and it came used with a better warranty than almost all US cars come with new.

I have never gotten less than 27 mpg CITY (mine is a 5-speed stick)!  It handles pretty well.  It rides like a Benz (trust me I know I work for them).  It has decent trunk space compared to the  '99 model that I had a few years back.

Convertible top operation is easy and quick.  Its handling however leaves a lot to be desired.  It is not very responsive especially for a sporty V6.  Its ride is acceptable for a sporty car.

I did get ripped off on the GPS Guidepoint system and the alarm which the dealer talked me into buying for $2,200 only to find later the coverage would cost me another $500 a year, and they tripled the price from what I could have got it for privately.

Another plus was that I thought it was imported; boy was I wrong.  I soon discovered that the top leaked like a river (2 days after purchase), and the transmission shifted erratically.  My mechanic said these cars are disasters (engine leaks, failures, etc.); however, I gave it a chance, but before I traded, I knew the tranny was getting ready to explode.  I also had a problem maintaining the oil level in the car.

I could really care less if it has space to take 4 people, the point is-it can carry a girl in the passenger seat. This is an awesome looking car; mine came fitted with a loud blow-off valve which makes it all the more fun to rev up.

Top leaks like no other in a rainstorm, flooding the rear top cavity, creating standing water. Car smells nasty afterwards.

I have a burgundy GT with the tan top, which is very stylish.  The version GT with the 3.0L engine is a must!  Its gas mileage is almost exactly the same as the smaller engine (1 mile per gallon difference) so why skimp? The tiptronic auto is the best of both worlds, auto for in town and switch it to manual when it's time to have some fun.

2560, on 07/29/16 23:34 PM (PDT),Pete and Judy ,1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder Convertible GS 2dr Convertible,love this car," I bought this car from a good friend who was the original owner.  He always took the car to the dealer to get serviced.  It is a red convertible with gray interior and black rag top.  normally aspirated 2.5 liter and auto trans.  When I first bought it , I had to do all 4 brakes completely (rotors, drums, pads, slave cylinders, master cylinder, and bleeding). They worked flawlessly after that for about 6 or 7 years, and then I just had to turn the rotors and install new pads.  A couple of years ago I replaced a broken alternator belt.  Then a few months ago I replaced the original water pump. And of course I did the timing belt and balance shaft belt at the same time, which were still in relatively good condition.  And a new battery.  And that is all the maintenance I have to do in the 9 years that I have owned it.  Basically just a few normal wearing parts. Oh yeah, the original owner replaced the transmission with a brand new one a couple of years before he sold it to me. He had no other issues whatsoever. Enjoyable to drive, and something I wasn't expecting: in the summertime with top down it is a great chick magnet! That particular series of Eclipse has a much sexier look than any other series that was built before or after it.  Pros: fun to drive, very reliable, and very affordable to own.  Cons: the rag top was leaky and no good to drive in the rain.  But I'm told that could have been avoided if the original owner had used a conditioner on it every few years, and garaged the car more often. And the front end body work is very close to the ground.  You must always tap the brakes and unload the suspension before driving over any bumps or dips, and enter or exit steep driveways very slowly and at angle. If you like this style of car and can find one that has been well maintained over the past 2 decades, buy it!",4
2561, on 01/15/10 02:23 AM (PST),liz ,1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder Convertible GS 2dr Convertible,GREAT CAR," I read some of the other reviews and wondered if I had the same car.  Mine has never given me any major problems.  I bought 4 yrs old and has been my primary car for the last 4 yrs.  I did replace the top 2 yrs ago and the top brackets. Other than that, we are talking different cars as mine has been great fun and a joy to drive.  I have the 5 spd manual and takes corners great, the turning radius is tight, gas mileage around 25, radio works fine, no rattling, nothing loose or broken, dealer oil changes, rare front brake pad replacement, tranny fine.  Maybe I'm in the wrong section?",5
2562, on 01/16/09 16:22 PM (PST),Rachel ,1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder Convertible GS 2dr Convertible,Convertibles issues," The convertible top on my car leaked every time we had a bad rain. It was horrible driving with the rain pouring in from all different places. My car also had an engine problem where it was burning oil and I'd have to put a quart of oil in it almost every week. And when it was raining and I drove over a lot of water in the road, it would cause the car to shake horribly and I would have to pull over and wait and rev the engine to dry it out. But, despite all its issues it never actually broke down on me. The engine was strong, and I will definitely purchase another Mitsubishi in the future. If I had it to do over the only thing I would change would be to get the hatchback instead. Ha.",4.375

This car is so cheaply made it seemed sooner or later everything fell apart, including the leaky rag top. I was SO disappointed as I love the Eclipse and it had been my dream to own a Spyder.

I had this problem with the original top and a newly installed top. The automatic transmission is horrible. It doesn't shift crisply and solidly as desired.

I just replaced the clutch which required the engine to be yanked and re-installed. The interior plastic is easily scratched - don't take dogs for a ride! Otherwise, the car has held up great. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is at 500 watts per channel is more than adequate with the subwoofer mounted in the back seat cushion. The car is very quick and agile on windy roads which makes it very fun to drive. Visibility out of the back window when the rood is up is limited by the small oval rear window, but at least it is glass and not Isinglass. The car is solid with no rattles after 10 years which is remarkable in and of itself, but being a convertible makes it even more impressive.",5

Vandals sliced open the Convertible top in 2017 and I took it to a Company in Kansas City, KS under insurance. Top King specializes in that kind of work and it is flawless again.

I've read multiple reviews here, and those with certain issues should read their owner's manual.  It specifically conveys to NOT clean the car via an automated car wash.  It specifically conveys that if the CD changer ""overheats"", it WILL shut down to protect the system.  These are really incidentals in the grand scheme.  I do wish that I didn't have to take it to a dealer to change the gear box fluid of my 5 speed.   I've never done that in my life for cars that went 200K, but it is what it is.",4.25

Not much has gone wrong yet. There is a heat shield that rattles because of the Ohio winters and the salt on the roads corroded it loose. It handles quite well for a 4cyl. but wish I had gotten the 6.  Gas mileage is good, not great, but what do you want for 170 horses.  Needs a place to put your left arm when it is not on the wheel. CD changer would not play some CDs when it got very hot outside, then it fixed its self when it cooled down.  Top is well designed and works very fast.  Top material seems to be high quality and does not make much noise at highway speeds.  Aerodynamics with top down are very good. ",4.125

Good luck with that. - TERRIBLE ACCELERATION, it's almost a joke. -Underpowered so much that when you have passengers gas mileage is about 17 to the gallon. -Rattles everywhere. -Backseat too small -Cheap to the touch. -Top leaks in car washes and can't be patched or fixed without buying a new one.

So fast, and even with the 18"" wheels, rides very well in our rough NJ pavement. Cuts corners like a pro, shift throws are short, braking is strong. Fuel mileage is so-so compared to my last GT 5-speed, but it makes up for it in sheer power. Thanks Mitsu for finally installilng a REAL sound system, heated seats, a windscreen, auto climate control, and an automatic boot cover. Those few things totally transform the car and make it feel much more expensive than it actually is. Love this car!",4.75

The Honda 2000 is a faster Miata, but it is too small,  The Mazda RX-8 is very unconfortable.  Its arm rest is too high, it has a quirky engine, and the air didn't work very well.  The Toyota Solara made for Grandmas.  The Corvette is too common.  At last we come to the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spider.  It is a fun, sporty car that my wife and I love.  It's our weekend cruiser.

I went back to the dealer who stated, ""not our problem, it's not covered under the warranty.""  They directed me to Bridgestone who ""did me a favor"" by replacing the tire. No one wants to cover the damaged rim due to Mitsubishi putting defective tires on their new car.

At the end it the Spyder vs. the MINI S. The tonneau top, superior AC, and vastly more comfortable seats gave the nod to the Spyder. The MINI S, although a quicker and tighter ride, was left to someone else willing to pay a hefty premium.   The GT has plenty of power although it does not really kick in until the RPMs hit 4,000. Because of this I prefer that the TAC is on the left where I can see it. This comes in handy when playing with the Sportronic AT whilst driving with the top down and Rockford system UP.

This vehicle is spacious especially with the back seat folded forward. The fuel economy is better than I had hoped after only 2 weeks - averaging ~24mpgs combined. Handles well, can't wait for snow - actually I can wait forever for snow but by Lake Erie in northeastern Ohio it won't be long. A little hard to keep clean, the interior attracts and holds dog hair.

I don't expect luxury in this price range - and I sure didn't get it, but it's decent looking, inside and out.  I'm not thrilled about the velour cloth seats, I don't think they'll hold up.

I would agree that the interior is not the most expensive materials used, but they are lighter weight and help reduce the total weight of the vehicle. We have no complaints with the engine, I mean it's not a dragster and it has plenty of pep. I am 6'04 and am able to sit in the back seat easily even with the driver seat all the way back.

Then I test drove the Outlander and the Honda CR-V EX, which is often regarded as the leader in this segment.  The CR-V is more refined (quieter engine and ride, nicer interior materials) and has a better 5-year resale value.  But I was swayed by Outlander's equipment, warranty, and appearance.  As for resale value, by that time I'll be 70 and have bigger things to worry about.  Bottom line:  This is a nice vehicle, especially if you don't need a plush interior.",4.625

The going consensus is that the type of transmission this car has, a CVT, isn't possible to just fix. I have been told that this year in particular was one of the first years that this type of transmission was built so it's very problematic and buggy. My car is at 116k miles. The manual says to change the transmission oil at 120k. Aside from this issue, before the problems started there were many things I wished I'd noticed. The back seat folds down strangely where the seats fold up rather than down. If you're a camper like me and appreciate having the option to sleep in your car, you won't be able to do that in this car. I'm 5'4 and had to curl up my pegs to fit. Also, this car doesn't do hills very well, you can hear it really working. And add using the air conditioning, it really slows down the car. The best thing about it is the sound system, roof rack and back up camera. I wouldn't recommend buying this car though. Regular shops don't appear to work on these much and dealerships aren't that common.",2

The ability to switch between 2WD, intelligent AWD, or full time 4 wheel drive is very nice, and the transition between each is seamless (so far, I like this AWD even better than my old Subaru and Audi A4 Quattro).  Yes, its underpowered and is not going to rocket you anywhere (0-60, quarter mile, etc).  I used to get back and forth between Buffalo and Cleveland in the winter just fine (while others are careening off the road, I am going highway speeds with the Rockford Fosgate punched up high).  The cabin is comfortable, the cargo space is very good, and the feature bundle is pretty fair.  The windows are no longer aligned perfectly going up and down, but they work just fine.

When I started looking for a different vehicle, the Outlander wasn't even on my list. But after I saw it and test drove it, I fell in love. The exterior is fairly aggressive and the seats are very comfortable. The ride is nice and smooth and it has been able to haul anything I needed. I have not needed the AWD yet but with winters in Wisconsin I'm sure it will come in handy. The mileage is ho-hum at about 20 mpg and it's not very peppy off the line, but I knew it wasn't a race car when I bought it. The mesh cloth seats are great.

I still feel that the car is very smooth. It rides very quiet and is very comfortable. I especially like the transmission, allowing to shift up and down on the go. The sound system is great.  I found that the rear wiper to be almost useless. It does not clean a large enough surface to allow for a clear vue, The rear wiper is a pain to change.  The plastic on which mudguards are mounted is beginning to deteriorate.  Gas mileage is disappointing from a 4 cyl. car.  I find the tires 215/55/17 to be oversize and the 94V rating in unnecessary for this car with a top speed of 120 mph. The windows and sunroof freeze when cold.",3.75

The engine has plenty of power even when entering/passing on the highway.  The Infiniti sound system is great.

Stereo system sounds great.  More room for small family.  However, the highway ride is a bit rough and noisy.  I am so used to my Tacoma.

What got me to look at the Outlander was that I couldn't find any complaints from people that bought a used one. The same was not true for the RAV4, CRV, Ford Escape or the Forester. I originally was going to buy a 2007, but decided to test a used 2006 LS AWD. Both my wife and I felt the 2006 was quieter and road better. I haven't driven in the snow, but I am sure it will be great up here in Syracuse where we get 160"" a year, thus why I wanted an AWD. The interior is big compared to my Camry.

I wanted a truck, but we picked the Outlander as a compromise. After years of driving a very powerful, low profile car, the Outlander took a lot of getting used to. However, once I was comfortable I love it. I hate super plush cars, so this is a great compromise between a car and a truck - and honestly, with Mitsubishi's road rally experience, I expect to be able to get out of my driveway many mornings without snowblowing. Once I get my first scratch I might go down some dirt roads.  If you're looking for something with quick acceleration, this is not the car. But it does cruise quite nicely. ",4.625

While I wasn't a big fan of the outer appearance, it was nice to look at a car that wasn't exactly the same as all the other small SUVs.  I ended up buying the car after checking out some of it's competitors (i.e. CRV, VUE, RAV4) and have found my Outlander to be a terrific buy.  I think it is very comfortable, with a simple, clean interior.  I would recommend this car to someone looking for a smaller AWD vehicle.   ",4

I had a 1998 Ford Explorer with 50,000 miles prior to the Outlander. I put over $3,000 in repairs into it in the last two years. I was looking for a quality vehicle, I found that in the Outlander. I am sold on Mitsubishi. The Outlander is a great crossover vehicle, it is fun to drive and handles great.  I live in Western PA and the winters are nasty.

Even though this is a ""base"" model it has lots of perks like power locks, power windows, a decent stereo and rear defogger. This is stuff you would pay extra for on some of the other small SUV's.    The 5-speed transmission is pretty responsive and, in reality, it has plenty of power for a SUV this size.

I didn't want another Honda CR-V or Ford Escape like everyone on my block. The wife saw it first. The more I checked it out the more I liked it too. It was overall exactly what we needed at the time. The deciding factors were its good gas mileage, interior space, reasonable price, color and the desire to own something different. It could use more power and two more seats though.

I also wish that acceleration was smoother when merging and passing on highways. Despite these gripes, six months into ownership, I am very pleased with it. No regrets!",4.375

It's handling is sharp and the ride is firm but not harsh.  Good feedback from the road and drives like a car with a low center of gravity.  Acceleration is brisk and the 6 speed transmission is fun to shift with the paddle shifter. Body roll is minimal and I find myself taking corners faster and more confidently than I would normally be with a SUV.  A/C is very cold and much appreciated in 100+ degree Texas heat.

My only suggestions to Mitsubishi are regarding the tires and doors. The Good-Year Eagle LS2 radials are not the best choice for rain or snow. I bought a new set of wheels and tires for winder driving (NOKIAN - Hakkapeliitta R SUV) they are the best tires at a great price. The doors on my GT feel light and must be slammed to close.

Driving is a simple pleasure.  I've used the paddle shifters for passing power a couple of times; it's a nice feature even if it won't be used daily.  The audio system is just amazing.  The auto-rip of CDs is a great feature though making your own play lists takes a little getting used to.

However, with that stowed, and the 2nd row moved back, there is adequate room for 5 adults (even if they are on the tall side). The V6 is peppy, and the S-AWC handles aggressive cornering well.

Like the contrasting leather, fit & finish. Lot of storage locations.

Some may look at this as an average vehicle but personally I used to hate buying a car and all the accessories fall apart and the handles falling off the doors and the stereo systems not being very well and seats covers cracking. I have to say the Mitsubishi uses the best parts for the interior of the car because none of them ever fall off or fall apart and the seat covers look like new when we handle the car back in. The Fosgate stereo system with the bass booster was just awesome and it really didn't cost that much more to get the extra accessories when you actually see what you get. All-wheel drive would have been wonderful but the car handle pretty well in bad weather. The one thing that I agree with is the two seats in the back we're kind of useless facing forward. They should have had it designed so that the seats would be facing looking backwards so that you had good leg room. I just took out one of the seats and made extra storage cargo. It was fine for my needs and my family. Overall, this is the really the best bang for your buck at a great quality level. The tires that the car came with lasted 50,000 miles easy. The four cylinder engine also seem to hold up very well. We put about a hundred thousand miles on the car and never once had a major repair except one recall on the emergency brake cable.

Next day they worked. Next week, the Bluetooth kept randomly going into call mode, it wasn't calling anyone, I wasn't calling anyone. I restarted the car several times at stop lights, same situation happened. Decided to take it to service for diagnostics. Whomp, whomp, it was the ENTIRE RADIO SYSTEM. It would cost about $1200 with labor to replace the radio (& that's without NAV). Figured I'd deal with it until it truly went kaput.

I made an appointment ASAP! Compressor was leaking so I got a new one that day (they had them on hand as they said they have been having issues with them). I have been juggling with the idea of trading in before it depreciates in value even more from me packing miles on it for work (avg. 5k every 2 months) or buying an extended warranty for around $1,500 which would allow me to get a new radio (hopefully the Bluetooth would be smoother on that one) & I would have a backup camera again after a year without. 1st owner, would hit 4 years in May of 2018 if I keep it that long. I'm worried I'll be 2 hours away from home & the Keyless Push to Start won't work next. Great PRO is that Mitsubishi is the only company with a 100k mile Powertrain Warranty.

Fun to drive thanks to solid road feel, very spacious interior and virtually no blind spots. Since owning it, had a couple of long distance road trips with heavily loaded car or trailer. Pleasure to drive, much less tiring than with previous car and super easy to pass, even with load. Major complaint is lower back clearance in back with load.

I'm 5'5"" and I was able to sit in the 3rd row. I wouldn't want to sit there for long trips but it should be fine for my needs around town. I can't wait to try out the 4wd on the snow.

As you ease into a turn and begin toaccelerate the steering wheel will not begin to return by itself you have to pull it back and sometimes jerk it back .(Also told this is normal).Will have to get rid of shortly to get soemthing My 17 yr old can drive.

Sluggish off the line. Yes it is a 4 cyl. But no low end torque to speak of. The CVT is my first and am not impressed in one area. Slowing down it feels like the brakes are being applied.  My first Mitsubishi with mechanical problems from day one. Turning left a clank. Same for turning right. Rear end screech when backing. Knocking noise mid vehicle. The dealer said they could not hear the clanking so did nothing. How about putting it up on a rack and turning the wheels? Said the screeching was the brake rotors. Normal. A first for me on any Mitsubishi. Average fuel consumption is not what we want. We want exact MPG.,3.75

I am getting 26.3 mpg driving to work (mainly highway)- more than I got with my small Benz!  The CR-V is too econobox, the RAV4 has no nav nor shiftronic transmission, the Forester is too soccer mom/housewife.  Both the CR-V and RAV4 A/C is poor- can't cope with our heat!

The number one priority for ourselves, and many other drivers right now, is fuel efficiency. The Outlander has delivered just what it promised with a mixed city / local driving average of around 25 MPG. For a vehicle that size and weight, sometimes carrying 2 - 4 people, that figure is more than acceptable to me and I feel it may improve even more when the engine is completely broken in. Can't wait to check it out on an interstate road trip.  With good fuel mileage and the rest of the package working flawlessly, I'd rate the Outlander as a smart choice. ",5

It has not had any major issues (regular maintenance only), other than a known issue with the dash AC/Heat selector.  Now I must switch from AC to heat from under the dash or pay to fix it (around $1500, so I won't do it).  Mileage is right around 20mpg for mix of around town and highway.

On railroad crossings and bumpy back country roads it does rattle a bit, but the reviews mentioned that and it is not a problem. It tracked well when I stomped on the brakes to see how they did on an icy road-tracked straight ahead and continued ok when I let off the brakes.

I know that's how I felt.  I should have listened to the consumer report review that said the only thing that works well in the car is the AC.  The engine was powerful enough to pull a lawnmower and the sluggishness made this car unsafe to drive on the highway.  The third row seat is pretty much a scam as nobody can fit back there.  I would feel I was endangering children back there as well.  Oh, and the fuel economy in my experience is also BS.  I never got beyond 27mpg and that was five hours on the highway.

It's comfortable to ride and drive.  It hasn't got the 'most' power but has all I need.  The 10/100,000 mile warranty was more than I expected but haven't had to use it.  It's only needed routine maintenance in 2 years, oil changes, tire rotations, that's it!  Mine also has a no-rust warranty which is almost unheard of and a great perk for any vehicle being drive in Maine.  Super reliable.  The back seats are all that comfortable but they're not used much anyway.  No kids.  Mileage is average.  The ground clearance is actually what attracted me to this vehicle.  It's more than my previous SUV that kept getting stuck in my driveway when there was a significant snow fall.  I haven't gotten stuck with my Outlander.  Heated seats....just awesome!

2990, on 01/12/17 08:12 AM (PST),Fazzster ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),1.5 years and 28k miles," Being an auto enthusiast and having owned an embarrassingly large number of cars, I knew enough to ignore the so called journalist reviews and check this vehicle out for myself. I like the fact this Mitsu is 100% made and assembled in Japan. The build quality is excellent as a result. There is really no other vehicle for the price that offers a 3rd row and come with all the goodies. A Highlander will cost you nearly $10k more and Rogue only comes in 1 trim if you want the 3rd row. With $5k in Mitsu incentives plus a large dealer discount, this vehicle can be had for very cheap. Plus you get a 100k mile warranty. This is where ""you get what you pay for"" comes in. The engine design is over a decade old so if you care about the latest and greatest, you may not be satisfied. It operates very smooth and efficient in normal driving but when you tap into the power the noise can be obtrusive and is not helped by the nature of the CVT. But to its credit, it still remains relatively smooth under load and delivers excellent MPG. The suspension is a little harsh (which was addressed in the 2016+ models) when handling choppy pavement but otherwise it smooth and quiet on good roads. The AWD system is brilliant and the snow setting is excellent. I run dedicated snows in the winter and the grip and control is very impressive. Interior; the materials are very good and are on par with the class and wear well even with 3 kids. My wife and I are short at 5'3"" and find the seats comfortable with decent adjustability. Our Outlander has been reliable at 28k miles so far with no repairs to report. In short, most people would be pleased with the Outlander. However considering its poor resale value, crappy dealer network, and the competition that  keeps getting better, the Outlander is a value proposition only vehicle. Meaning, if you can't get it for at least $8k off MSRP then you maybe better off with something else.

2991, on 12/24/16 08:41 AM (PST),Dutch Deblouw ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV ES 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Pleasantly surprised !!," we bought this about 4k miles ago with a salvage title, spend about 10k out the door with only 9k miles on it, was a flood vehicle.  they had refurbed it and it still smells and smelled like a new car.  I had test driven a used one with equivalent miles to make sure all was on the up and up and when i picked this one up i fell in love. its the burnt orange color and has the bells and whistles, heated seats, gps, back up cam etc, love it!! solid feel to the car, our previous car was a 2006 mazda 5, so performance wise there wasnt much difference, yes, its a 4 banger and it is not designed to drag race, if i would like in the metroplex i would rather have a v6, but in small town texas a 4 banger is just fine... i routinely get 26-28 mpg when i decide to drive the speed limit, other wise it sits steady at 25mpg which is still better then our much smaller mazda5 did... seats are great, back is small, but thats to expected. love the push start and onboard computer stuff.UPDATE:After about 10 months of owning it i must say we still love this car, great gas mileage, good comfort, and we have the bells and whistles so back up camera and gps etc, Gps is cumbersome and we hardly ever use it, phone is easier to us, but, the screen is nice for settings, music info etc.haven't had a lick of trouble out of it.Update: about 20k miles later. Still no luck of trouble out of it. Crack in windshield. But that's hardly to blame on the car. I'm not a fan of how the engine sounds. But that's just because I like the sound of a v8. This sounds very little (which it is) Very happy with it though",5

Have had people in Prius' and Smart Cars pass me from a stand still. Worst/Slowest acceleration EVER!!! I would hope that with such slow and strained get up that I would at least get good gas mileage but that was terrible as well.  Right now I'm getting about 20 miles to the gallon.  Some pro are: Interior, Seats, Technology and exterior is nice. But do not but for the 7 seats unless you have two children or ""little people"" riding back there. And once you put up the third row there is NO and I mean NO truck space.  I have a car seat in the second row. Have to keep third row folded down just to fit in average size stroller.  Will not be buying this again",2

2994, on 08/24/16 23:11 PM (PDT),Dominick Scalcione ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV ES 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Horrific A/C, Cooling; Poor Delivery"," Can't recall having these issues with any previous import.  To start with somehow the dealer delivered the car with all four tires over-inflated at 45 PSI pressure.  The SUV was all over the road as you can imagine and had an extremely hard ride over bumps.  Since this was my first car with TPMS, unfortunately I never thought to check the tire pressure.  The TPMS it turns out only monitors for under pressure tires, not over.  As a result I didn't realize there was a problem for 3 months.  On research I learned that some foreign manufacturers over-inflate to guarantee that the tires will not go flat in transit, and it's the dealer's responsibility to set them correctly on delivery.  But I think more likely this dealer prep guy had a brain freeze and over-set the pressure.  I just wonder how many other cars they sent out on the road in this dangerous condition?  That was the first problem.  The dealer corrected the tire pressure, inspected the chasis and had to reset the wheel alignment.  The 2nd problem, was the odor of coolant around the front of the vehicle when it gets hot.  It could be smelled from up to 15 - 20 feet.  This went on for more than a year.  At this time the odor can be smelled from very close to the front of the car.  The 3rd problem is the most serious.  When the ambient temperature is 95 or greater, and when the vehicle comes to a stop at a traffic light at idle, the A/C starts blowing HOT air.  At other times when the outside temperature is 85 and after a half hour or more of driving in the midday heat, the same problem occurs, at idle the A/C starts blowing HOT air.  In both cases as soon as vehicle motion starts, A/C is restored.  The dealer has not been able to duplicate the conditions for the A/C failure, so as yet no resolution of this problem.  I called a Mitsubishi dealer in St. Petersburg, Fl. after a hot spell.  They reported no issues with vehicles coming in for this condition.  Finally to be fair I should note that I got a very good price on this vehicle with a 6 year no interest loan from Mitsubishi.",1
2995, on 10/25/15 11:37 AM (PDT),John ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Awesomeness on 4 wheels," I normally would never have purchased a Mitsubishi anything but, while in Europe for work, I rented this model on 2 separate occasions.  The first occasion was for a drive from Germany to Italy (11 hours from where I was).  The car handled great, was very comfortable and roomy enough (I'm 6'7""), and the fuel economy really impressed me. The second occasion was to travel across Germany from the most western part to Berlin (7 hrs with traffic/road construction). There were 4 of us and we thoroughly enjoyed the comfort, size and the easy transition from highway to driving into the heart of the city. When it was time to buy a new vehicle I had absolutely no doubts as to what I wanted. I'm impressed with the V6 power and I like the ability to choose what type of driving performance at the touch of a button. With the AWD I don't worry about any sudden weather changes in winter or rainy season.",5
2996, on 10/06/15 15:17 PM (PDT),mt ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),I like it.," I wasn't in the market for a car.  Was looking for something for a 3rd row for my sister.  The Outlander GT caught my attention because I really liked its lines.  This car is like a big station wagon with some ground clearance.  I'll never use the 3rd row seat, but I have a great amount of space in the back with the third row folded down.  There is also lots of space for passengers in the rear seat.  Just had adult friends sitting in the back, and they had at least a few inches of space between their knees and the front seats.  I just drove it from Philly to Cape Cod and back, and it was a very nice ride.  Back wasn't sore, plenty of power to pass, and no complaints from adults in the back seat.  Also had plenty of room for luggage in the back.  Only thing I noticed was that if you have to floor it to get our of a hairy situation, the engine is really loud.  That happened a couple times, but overall, cruising in the left lane and merging on to the highways was done easily and quietly.  I'll never use the paddle shifters, so I can't write anything about them.  Visibility is great.  It really feels like a station wagon inside, which I like.  It drives more like a truck, which I also like.  It reminds me of Jeeps and pick-ups that I've owned in the past.  It's probably less carlike than its competitors.The audio system is great.  I have to take the time to read the manuals to figure some stuff out, which I'll probably never do.  I hope there are some overrides so I can make some changes to music or nav system while driving.  A passenger was trying to do some stuff that could not be done if I wasn't in park.  An Iphone was also unable to configure with the audio system while I was driving.  I love the power lift-gate that can be operated with the remote.  Also like the push-button start, and being able to lock/unlock doors without taking key out of my packet.  I've seen reviews that say the interior looks cheap, but it looks ok to me.  The fake wood is minimal, and the vented leather on the seats looks great.  I do hate putting premium fuel in it, but I drive less than most people, so that didn't bother me too much.  I got the car used.  It was a dealer demo, and I got a really good deal on it.  I would never pay the MSRP for it, but for what I payed, I think it's a great car/truck...whatever it is.  Hope to have it for a long time.  Going to add a remote starter, and then I'm happy as a clam.  The 2016 has the power fold in mirrors.  I miss having that feature.April, 2017 update.  I've put about 15k miles on car, and I still like it a lot.  Don't love it though.  Only complaints are that there is noticeable wind noise on the highway, and it takes big bumps pretty hard, especially the rear wheels.  Other than that, no complaints from me.  Car has plenty of space and it's very comfortable.  With seats folded flat I can jam in 15 - 20 bags of mulch.  I love the stereo, and that solves the wind noise problem for me.  Back seat passengers have great space.  I never use the 3rd row, so there is a ton of space in the cargo area.  I have the white exterior with light tan leather, and I think it looks great.  Maybe kind of soccer mommish, but I like how bright it is.  I got a comment the other day that it still smells like a new car.I've had no mechanical issues, and twice I've left the interior light on overnight and it still started in the morning.  That really surprised me.Had one big snow storm this winter, and it got through it like a champ.",4
2997, on 07/24/15 08:29 AM (PDT),Jesse Coley ,2015 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Honest Little Family Car," UPDATED JULY 2017:Edmunds asked me to update my review again. Our Outlander continues to be endearing to us. Friends and family often dismiss it (or start wondering about our credit status) but then actually ride in it and are blown away by how solid and well-built it is. They often appreciate the lack of ""gimmicks"" that are present in other popular compact SUVs. The third row seat blows minds, too. No, it's not a minivan, but yes, we can take your kids home if we have to! Ha ha!I do my own oil changes (with lots of documentation for warranty reasons) and it is a breeze. I don't even have to put the car on ramps. Everything is easy to get to and replacement OEM-spec air and oil filters are readily available (some people make comments about Mitsubishi parts being rare or something).It's a great family car.UPDATED JANUARY 2016:We are still loving our Outlander and it continues to do everything we ask it to do. It's had it's first scheduled maintenance (free from Mitsubishi) with no issues to speak of. Everything works properly, no electronic hiccups, no drivetrain surprises. Now that the CVT has gotten ""broken in"", it has become much smoother and less noisy. The engine continues to deliver adequate power, though you can hear the valves ticking at idle (like a diesel). That seems to be common now with all the fancy valve timing cam switching voodoo, so its not something I worry about.We have several new Ford Escapes at work and how magazines can recommend them over the Outlander is beyond me; The Outlander is simply BETTER in every way. The Escape has less USABLE interior room, tacky interior design, a laughably small backup camera display, and is so cheaply built that the hood vibrates frantically at idle. The previous generation Escape was a much better vehicle, in my opinion, but I digress.Get yourself an Outlander and stop caring what those car magazines say.ORIGINAL REVIEW:We have had our Outlander for a couple months and about 3000 miles now. We are a family of three with a very active 2 year old and are always going on trips with friends and family.We previously had a 2011 Ford Fusion as our primary family car but found it incompatible with the constant demands to have more than ""just us"" in the car. We bought the Outlander because we wanted the ability to seat 7 (4 adults and 3 children most commonly) in a pinch but still have a smaller, frugal vehicle for our everyday urban driving. It also surprisingly takes up much less space in our small garage than the Fusion did, which I think is something that isn't touched on enough: Most modern cars and trucks are too long, too wide, too fat. The Outlander is lean and compact, yet still has loads of room on the inside.Automotive ""journalists"" seem to universally dislike the Outlander (and Mitsubishi in general) but from actually test driving and now living with our Outlander, I know I was right to take their reviews with a grain of salt.Yes, the CVT is slow, but in normal traffic you aren't blasting away from every stop light anyway. If you ever have the need for speed, there is a ""sport mode"" that I've found to more than adequate when I need to pass someone quickly or ""get the heck out of the way"". The venerable (but excellent) four cylinder has plenty of power to move this thing, even while on a recent trip to the mountains of East Tennessee, with seven people, and all of our stuff. Not once did I wish I had bought the V6.Build quality is excellent. Every part of this vehicle is durable and honest. The interior is mature and tasteful. I guess some folks call that ""bland"", but folks like me don't want their interior to look like the cockpit of a jet fighter. The seats are great, the second rows adjusts easily, the third row has PLENTY of room for children and even most people. (Honestly, are all your car reviewers basketball players or something?)The suspension is a little soft and the low mass of the vehicle makes crosswinds very noticeable, but you quickly adjust and stop caring. The ride comfort is more than worth it.We got the mid level SE, which I would say is the ""sweet spot"". Lots of bells and whistles, but no guzzler V6, no sunroof you'll never use, no navigation that is rendered redundant by any given smartphone these days, no leather that you'll just have to keep oiled or it'll crack, etc etc.The air conditioning is brilliant. I have been repeatedly told that it is too cold, by third row passengers, in the July heat of Memphis! I am not exaggerating! The only real problem to speak of is a tire that needed to be rebalanced (at no cost from the dealership).I should mention that we shopped the Outlander against the Toyota Highlander (new and used), Kia Sorento, Mazda5, and Volvo XC90 (used). In the end, we actually fell in love with the Outlander.It's not perfect, but it's honest. It does what it's supposed to do and it does it well and it does it for an unbeatable price. I can't recommend it enough.",4

3004, on 08/20/18 07:33 AM (PDT),Michael ,2018 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Why the press hates these cars is beyond me," My family has bought 5 of these cars (so far) a few Outlander Sports, and I have bought 2 Outlanders myself. This is the only vehicle on the market that can seat 6 or 7 people, has all-wheel drive and gets better than 30mpg. These are the criteria I use to make a vehicle purchase. The 10 year warranty (7 years beyond everyone else's) is an awesome plus. I routinely get 32 mpg driving around coastal Maine, and the only vehicle with a better AWD system is a Range Rover (which will set you back about 3x what this thing costs!). We live in Maine, where we have ice, snow, and slush 5 months a year, and a majority of people's houses are down long, un-paved driveways. This is the only car that has yet to get itself stuck! The S-AWC system keep the thing on the road really well, and adds a significant amount of control in everyday driving. The 3rd row seat IS tight, but I can ride back there in a pinch, and my wife and my kid can do so with no issues, and it is temporary! This is not a Caravan, or a Suburban, but for the 4 or 5 times a year when we really need to carry a bunch of people it is perfect. A far bigger impact is the fuel economy, which comes into play every time you start it- there is nothing on the road (that is not an EV) that can touch this car for efficiency. If the performance/acceleration of this thing bothers you, you should buy a sports car, not a mid-sized SUV. This thing has plenty of performance unless you need to drive like a moron, I have yet to get into a drag race with a Nissan Rogue or a CR-V, and my masculinity would survive if I did. This is not the fastest car in it's class, but it is the best. Your rational choice should outweigh whatever rubrik the automotive press uses to describe this type of car.

This car is an unbelievably great value. I had a Cadillac SRX before I got a 2016 Outlander in August of 2016. The Outlander looked good, but too good, so I leased it, figuring I'd get out of it if it went bad. It was half the price of getting another CRX! It was a great car! It was a little slow off the starting line, not an acceleration star, but I'm over needing that these days. It had plenty enough acceleration when I floored it when I needed it, like merging into speeding commuters on the highway. My soulmate loved it, said it wasn't any different from the CRX, ride, quiet and comfort-wise. It's a great quiet cabin, smooth and easy ride. The gas mileage was a big improvement, 28 on my commute, and 32 on a trip. My gas bill went down by 50% (I suppose not sprinting off at every light like I did with the Caddy had something to do with that.) I was so pleased with that car that I just got the 2018 version when the lease ran out. The new one is even better! I'm just learning the about new features -- blind spot alarm, auto-lights, 360 degree cameras (It gives a bird's eye view), great sound system with Apple play, I don't even know everything that's new, but it's great. Looks better too, nice accents. This is a great car at the best price for the best features of all comparable SUVs. And the dealer was excellent too. No monkey business, no games, no time-wasting ""stories"". They gave me the honest right price right off the bat (I've had a little experience with the business and this is my 23rd vehicle purchased for my own use). The service I got from the dealership during the 3 year lease was extraordinary too. My experience buying 23 cars over the years had me thinking bad thoughts about the dealerships and their people, but this dealership convinced me we still have professional and honest people with integrity in this business. The dealership is Sarasota Mitsubishi. --- William Anderson, LMHC, Sarasota, Florida",5
3008, on 06/19/18 10:18 AM (PDT),SoCalMark ,2018 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Mitsubishi, the ""diamonds"" in the rough winner"," I was extremely skeptical of this vehicle and after so much research was heading to the Honda CRV instead. My wife has a friend that is a salesperson for a Mitsubishi store and after I test drove this vehicle I was not thrilled about it --- but now that I own one, it was the best decision I ever made. This car is loaded with technology features (although I have not gotten Android Auto to work with the vehicle yet at all). I was shocked that 'Car and Driver' gave this vehicle such a low score on handling and comfort. I had a Ford Escape before this and the Outlander is extremely wonderful to drive long distance with. I read one woman's review of the back seats and granted there isn't much space back there this should not be compared to a full-size SUV. If you want a full-size SUV then pull out your wallet and pay for one and stop your griping, this car isn't presented as this. U-turns are so simple and the vehicle sips gas very slightly. This is an awesome road trip vehicle to have with the family and as a soccer coach, I find the back with plenty of space for all our gear. One of the things that steered me to Mitsubishi is that I make several trips to the Philippines and in this country, vehicle maintenance on a regular basis is scarce and yet I see Mitsubishi cars and trucks that have enormous amounts of mileage on them and they just keep running compared to their Toyota counterparts that are falling apart. I love this vehicle and it feels and looks like any of the top end SUV's out there. Get the side windows tinted and you will be happy with the look and feel of the interior too.",5

I was planning on getting him a used car but then decided my credit was good and I could get a brand new car and give him the Galant. I wasn’t planning on getting a car until December of this year (2018) but I went into the dealership to get an oil change on the Galant and ended up letting them run my credit and was able to get ANY CAR I WANTED WITH NO MONEY DOWN!!! Talk about going in for an oil change, a new battery for 1 of the Galant remotes and an extra key for the Galant to additionally walking out with a 2018 SUV!! I knew the car I wanted that I wanted to have: 1) leather seats 2) heated seats 3) power seats 4) Bluetooth 5) Blind spot monitor 6) Navigation 7) sunroof 8) Sirius XM radio 9) backup camera ...now out of those 9 things I got 8!! What I learned was every model has something the other doesn’t. I’m 37 years old and this is the 1st time I’m actually paying attention of what I want in a car vs. just having a car, funny thing is I was looking for another sedan and didn’t even want an SUV because I thought I’d be spending more money on gas, let alone I said I wasn’t buying another Mitsubishi. Now my Galant has not ever given me any problems but I thought I’d just get a different brand since this would be my 3rd and final car. When I was pregnant with my son I had a 1998 Mazda Protege and that was in November 2001 then I got my Galant in February 2005 and here it is February 2018 and I’m buying another Mitsubishi. I did t want a car note I was originally planning on going to an auction but figured I’d i was going to have a car note to try and have it paid off in 2 years by the time my son graduates from high school. When I looked around I saw the SEL sport model and thought it was cool cuz it had the heated seats and everything that I wanted besides the sun roof it had a moonroof. When she showed me the LE model yes it had the sunroof and multi camera view but it was manual seats and they weren’t heated so that was a no go. Then she showed me the SEL Outlander and had me park it right next to the Sport SEL model and that was it, it was 13 inches longer and had more cargo space which I needed because I shop at Costco. I was looking for a car that was no longer than 191.5 inches because I have a garage and we park both cars behind the other so in order for the garage to close I needed a car that was going to fit length wise. I looked at Honda’s, Toyota’s and Nisssans and I would’ve paid more for the Nissan Rogue with everything I would’ve wanted an additional packages, the Toyota CH-R had manual seats and the Honda HR-V didn’t have the Honda Sense safety features. I didn’t get the S-AWC nor 4WD because I don’t drive in the snow, mud or mountains, I live in Long Beach,Ca and having the V6 engine wasn’t needed for me. It was going to be more on gas and I’m just a regular driver so the 2.4L with CVT was suitable enough for me as I am a sensible driver. Then when it came to my car insurance it was CHEAPER than getting the other 3 brands I looked at and priced certain models so I am very happy with my car. To think I didn’t even have an SUV in mind and I came out with one plus got $2,500 in rebates so to come on here and see actual owner reviews made me happy because the expert revues were poor. This thing doesn’t need a V6 engine, I just put it in sport mode and I get a HUGE KICK in speed whereas the speed in the regular drive mode is good. I have an iPhone so the Apple car play is perfect for me and my son when we are in the car, I was bummed that my particular Mitsubishi dealership didn’t have the SEL model where I could’ve had the Touring package which had the Frontal collision mitigation and lane departure BUT when I was originally making my list I didn’t have those things in there for safety so the blind spot monitor with lane change assist and rear cross traffic assist are just fine, I tell you ANYTHING that I would’ve got was gonna be an UPGRADE from that 2004 Galant so I’m happy, I didn’t choose to get a sunroof in my model and I’m ok without that and the navigation really comes from my iPhone connected via USB using the Apple car play so it’s cheaper than the Nissan or Honda models which actually has Navigation in it because I’m using my cell phone so that’s ok to, I still say I have Navigation because of the Siri maps and GPS on my phone. I won’t really be using that 3rd row I just wanted it because other cars with this price range had the normal 2 rows and I know the Rogue has 3 rows but the Outlander has more cargo room overall. Besides it’s just me and my teenage son who now has his own car so now it’s just me and I’m ok with what I have, this car will last me 15 years just like my Galant, if I do get another car after this my son will be buying it for me.",5

To upgrade to a 6 cylinder brings the price up too high. There are other vehicles available for less money. Also to get the safety options you have to pay more. The base models don't have them.,4

Warranty was only good to the driveway out of the dealership.  Mitsubishi says thats how it's supposed to be because all the other new ones are the same.  To me that means they are all broken.  Blue tooth only comes out on the passenger speaker and at a very low volume.  Making it impossible to use while driving.  2018 Outlander,3
3018, on 12/10/15 14:04 PM (PST),Christina ,2005 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV LS AWD 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 4A),10 years later," I bought this car brand new off the lot in 2005.  Within the first couple of years I had to have it repainted twice because it was already rusting. I had the bushings, control arms, tierods, and brakes replaced pretty much every year I've owned this thing, since the first year I bought it. I don't mistreat my car or drive it rough because I'm too paranoid something will go wrong with it. At 7 years the motor blew and the dealership refused to honor the warranty, despite it having 93,000 miles on it (well under warranty). The transmission was bad after the first year. The radiator had to be replaced after 8 years, even though it leaked since the first year I got it. The dealership wouldn't cover anything with my 10 year/100,000 mile warranty except the bushings. My window motor died after 9 years. The rear window windshield wiper died after 3 years. I feel I'm replacing the lights every 6 months, and at $35 a light, it adds up real quick. I've pretty much replaced every single thing on this car since the year I bought it, without any help from the dealership or warranty.  Now it's paid off, you better believe I'm going to drive the hell out of it for another 10 years because I've rebuilt the whole thing.  I paid $27,000 for this car, and I refuse to let it go out of sheer stubbornness, and not wanting to have to buy another car. BUT, I sure as heck will NEVER buy another one again. Wasn't ever worth the money. And I didn't even get the nice packaged one, it's just plain jane boring. I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone. It's hard to find parts for it, and everything costs a ridiculous amount.",3

Its ride is stiff but very very solid. Its controls are simple. The 2.4L engine offers adequate power and is smooth. The transmission is also well matched to the engine and shifts smoothly, sport mode is great in town and with the cruise on it prevents downshifts. The stock 4 speaker stereo is average.

However, since none of the 6 dealerships in my area treated me like I was a loyal customer I actually entertained other competitor's products.  I have to admit that I didn't know what I was missing.

3054, on 07/18/18 09:41 AM (PDT),Alison ,2011 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Prepare to replace an $8K trans at low mileage," I bought this car 3 years ago. I would have really loved it if there weren't so many problems that have plagued me since the day I drove it off the lot. Most of them, on their own, wouldn't be a big deal. But when they all pile up on top of each other, it made for a really stressful car-owning experience. I bought it used in 2015 and was very excited about it. Good things: lots of cargo space, handles amazing in the snow (the 2WD to 4WD option was one of my favorite features) decent gas mileage for the size, fantastic Bluetooth connectivity, comfortable, good visibility for a 5'0"" tall girl. Bad things: (1) The check engine light came on the day after I purchased it (turns out the fuel pump was cracked and the Mistubishi dealer either didn't notice or didn't care), and basically has been on since, even though I've thrown over $1000 at different fixes. After two years, I just started ignoring it. (2) The vents for A/C and heat aren't properly controlled by the knob on the dash. I have to sit there and turn the knob back and forth until the car decides it wants to send the air out of the vents I want it to come out of.  (3) the headlights don't feel very powerful - I honestly can't even tell they're on unless I'm on an unlit road by myself. (4) Most recently (AND MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!) the transmission failed at 120K miles for absolutely no reason. It was fine one night and broken the next morning. Wouldn't shift or go over 55 mph and didn't feel safe to drive. Took it to a trans shop and they said it had failed for no discernible reason, and that it had to be replaced with a brand new OEM transmission from the dealer. It has a very specialized CVT that Mistubishi doesn't seem to allow remanufactured versions of. So I either need to pay $8K to fix a car that's worth less than $6K, or scrap the car and lose all the value of it plus what I still owe on it. I called Mitsubishi and they said it's out of warranty so there is nothing they can do and it just has to be an out-of-pocket expense.

3055, on 02/20/18 13:04 PM (PST),Seamus Train ,2011 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),2nd Worst Car I've Ever Owned," Buying a 2011 model of this vehicle back in 2013 for $17k seemed like a good deal. I couldn't have been more wrong. The only car I've owned that was worse than this one was a 1986 Bimmer. I can't speak for the other trim versions, but the SE is complete garbage. The car had about 35k miles on it when we purchased it. It now has almost 200k and it's been a very painful journey getting this far. I'll start with the good points which aren't many: • it handles beautifully in the snow, • it has pretty good cargo space, • the third row seating is very handy, • attractive body design. Now for a list of all of the bad (repairs the car has needed within 5 years): • front wheel bearing needed to be replaced, • wiper motor died and had to be replaced, • climate control blower motor died and had to be replaced, • radio and bluetooth controls on steering wheel stopped working, • A/C has a persistent leak, • outer tie rod ends had to be replaced, • exhaust started to leak near the downpipe, • rear differential skips and causes the car to jerk badly at times when making a turn, • front end starts to vibrate and make a clanging noise at low RPMs at times, • one rear brake caliper seized and needed to be replaced, • vehicle staggers in traffic if the gas pedal is pushed down too quickly, • the car now burns through about a quart of oil a week and vibrates horrifically at red lights. Needless to say, we're ready to part ways with this vehicle now. Many people may say that you would expect problems going into 200k miles, but I have a 2007 Eclipse that has not had many of these problems and continues to be one of the best cars I've ever owned. It's also approaching the 200k mile mark. It still runs solid and seldomly gives me any problems. The 2011 Outlander SE has been the sole factor in my decision to part ways with Mitsubishi. At one time Mitsubishi made some of my favorite vehicles. It's a shame what the vehicle division of the company has become.",1

Come to find out this transmission is like finding a needle in a hay stack. Owner of transmission shop told me it is year specific, model specific, sub-model specific, engine specific, and drive train specific. He actually found 1 brand new transmission in his US wide search, but to buy it, have it shipped, and installed will cost us almost $10k....the vehicle is only worth around $7k. You do the math, plus we still owe money against it lol. Called Mitsubishi Corporate to give them my opinion of the matter. Nothing...sorry about your luck. Wow! I even said well i guess me, my wife, my children, my grandchildren, my family, and friends, and co-workers, and everyone I know on social media won't ever buy another Mitsubishi again, the guy from corporate said, sorry to lose your business. lol, i was like...mic-drop jaw open. Not once did Mitsubishi Corporate offer any assistance or try to help me find a replacement transmission, or offer any options for us to persue.

However the engine required a tune up; there was an issue with the timing belt which could have caused an engine seize and car being totaled if we hadn't caught it. Then the damned intake manifold went.  The truck is great the problem is Mitsubishi is the worst company to deal with in regards to parts and service.

The 6-cyl is real spiffy and I can actually pass cars now which I couldn't with the 4-cyl RAV. It handles great. I live in a mountain area and it takes the curves smooth.

The Outlander with leather seating, V6 engine, AWD, rear seat DVD, and upgraded MP3 stereo was $3-10K less than the competition.  It is not the most luxurious, road noise is a little higher than the Acuras and Toyotas, and the suspension booms over some potholes but for the money, it can't be beat.  It blows away the 2003 Pathfinder we sold and I really liked the Nissan.  Highly recommended if you are shopping for the best value in a CUV.  My kids love it too.",4.75

It hasn't really had any problems yet as it is relatively new.  The only quirk is a clunk from the ABS system when you start it and take off, but that's it.  Acceleration is REALLY good.  Braking is great.  Gas mileage is good, especially if you let cruise control do its thing.  It is sensitive to weight of the tire.  OEM tires, the computer said we were getting 27MPG doing 70MPH on Texas interstate.  Firestone Dueler tires get 23-ish, but they are heavier.

After 24 used cars, the first to make me jump into a new car was Mitsu's 'Outty'.  Rock-solid reviews everywhere peaked my interest. The unique fold down tailgate got me to the dealership. The absurd amount of cool features for the same cost as a base CRV or RAV brought it home.  Obviously, the exterior looks darn good. Despite other reviews knocking the interior, my wife and I (both designers) love the it, and respect Mitsu for not putty phaux grain on plastic.

Went rounds with mitsu only to find that since this is exterior damage that occurred after the vehicle left the lot, it is considered wear and tear.  I figured the person driving the demo was abusive, but have learned this is a common problem with the design.  This chipping paint is going to look terrible in a year or so.

The side-view mirrors were rattling a bit and a cap beneath it was loose and fixed. The only thing not fixed is a delay when shifting from Reverse to Drive. There's always a couple of secs delay and will cause a lurch if the shifting is too fast. I've verified that this is not a problem on other vehicles.

My husband likes the head space, yet it is small for tight garage. My only complaint is the seats are very sporty & not as soft and comfy as I would like.

I saw the great reviews by everyone and thought that it was going to be a home run.  Since the Outlander is based off of the Lancer, it definitely drives more like a sports car.  The ride is very firm and you have a tenancy to feel every bump in the road.   The interior left a lot to be desired compared to the Santa Fe and CR-V.

It has a number of features usually found in much more expensive cars, but if Mitsubishi wants the XLS to compete against the higher-end SUVs in its segment, then they'll have to ""up the ante""; they'll have to install illuminated vanity mirrors (and improve quality of sun visors), programmable automatic locks, dual express-down windows, real fog lamps, mudguards, driver and passenger power seats, auto-dimming mirror w/built-in compass and HomeLink.

3148, on 10/21/17 05:28 AM (PDT),Dokako ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Don't believe the professional reviewers," I have had my 2016 Outlander SEL for about 5 months now. We had a 2006 outlander  with 185XXX miles on before we purchased the 2016 and had no problems with it. I have thought for years now that the Consumer Reports test drivers are out of touch with the average driver. We don't all need Top of the line everything in a family car. I also don't need the latest electronic infotainment system, it will be outdated by next year anyhow. I don,t drive my car on a race track and I do not drive like an idiot on the freeway. The car looks great, handles great, has one of the best warranties, is plenty quite for me, has great quality and great features. When I tell people that I paid $21000.00 for an AWD fully loaded Outlander with a 10 year warranty from White Bear Mitsubishi they don't believe me.  People - do not take the Consumer Report review as gospel, try one yourself",5
3149, on 09/11/17 08:50 AM (PDT),David M. ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Great car. Except for mpg and resale value," I purchased the Outlander for its supposedly great fuel economy and third row seats.  First of all, the good.  The vehicle in the SEL trim is luxurious and nicely put together.  The leather seats seem to be good quality and though the lumbar support is lacking they are reasonably comfortable.  Like most of today's vehicles, there is plenty of plastic on the inside but the fit and finish is nice, tight, and clean; a nice mix of chrome and leatherette.  The third row seat came in handy on more than one occasion.  You'll find other reviews stating that the third row is for emergencies only and those reviews are correct with regard to adults.  However, kids fit just fine and since kids are most likely to occupy a third row seat in any vehicle, I consider this a non-issue.  However, for infants and toddlers, though two car seats will fit in the third row and can be secured using the old fashioned seat belt technique (pull the seat belt all the way out until it starts clicking when you retract it), there aren't any car seat anchors or rear tethers and you aren't actually supposed to use the third row for car seats.  Handling is a little squishy and unlike my 2012 Chevy Equinox, seems tuned toward off-roading rather than sport.  Not a big deal to me.  Now on to the bad parts of this car.  First, the acceleration is sluggish.  You have to floor it if you want it to get up and go.  Not a huge problem since I drive like an old man and always choose fuel economy over horsepower.  Nevertheless, the slow acceleration is super-annoying when you are trying to merge in heavy traffic.  Next, the supposed fuel economy is no where close to reality.  Stated fuel economy is 23/29 for the AWD 4 cylinder.  Highway mileage has been about 29 mpg for me so I can't complain about that.  However, I average a disappointing 18 mpg in the city.  Since I do about 70% of my driving in the city, I find the 18 mpg to be a deal breaker.  Last but not least, resale value is TERRIBLE.  Just TERRIBLE.  I paid invoice for my SEL (a little less than $32,000 as I recall).  Eighteen months and only 11,600 miles later, two different dealerships offered me a measly $15,000 for my Outlander.  That's less than half of what I paid for it.  That's a $17,000 depreciation in LESS THAN two years.  I did take it to Carmax and was offered $18,000, but unless you're buying a car from them, you take the tax hit by not trading on your new car.  And that would still be a $14,000 loss in, again, LESS THAN two years.  In summary, if you're in the market for an 'OK' used car or just don't care about resale value, maybe the Outlander is for you.  Regardless, DO NOT buy it new and DO NOT buy it if you expect to get the stated fuel economy.",2

I want to love my 2016 AWD Outlander.  My son and I bought one at the same time.  Unique in an Outback world.  Great rear cargo space (BTW, get the roof racks.... makes the car!). HWY mileage at 30+ is great.  Driver controlled ECO and AWD options a good thing.  Rubber band tranny takes getting used to but all good otherwise... EXCEPT the paint application on the hood and pillars ON BOTH OF OUR CARS is flawed.  Google it.  You will start seeing more complaints. I have owned Porsches, Lexus, Jags, Saabs, Volvos and everything American.  I have driven some to 100K and have not changed my driving habits (I know to stay back from trucks, am not four-wheeling my Mitsu, etc.).  Both my son's brown 2016 Outlander and my pearl white continue to chip away upfront.  I have more marks on my car than I have ever had when trading in 5+ year old vehicles with 5 times the mileage.  The regional Mitsu guy suggested no coverage and would not acknowledge any flaws to the paint (despite the fact I have had several new car dealers and exceptional auto body shops all acknowledge that this is faulty application and is ""soft, not cured properly"" paint. So.  If you think of buying an Outlander, ask the dealer to put a note on your P&S agreement that this will be covered if an issue for you and DO NOT BUY without installing a bra / wind screen.  Paint-sticking $56000 worth of two new mitsus that are maintained preciously should not even be a thing.  Can you say ""class action?"".",3

There were many minor but glaring faults that make me question how much road testing was done for this vehicle. Climate control was abysmal with no consistency in air temperature. It fluctuated from frigid to steamy humid constantly. Road noise was pronounced and overpowering, making long trips even more exhausting. They obviously never tested fitting a child seat in the rear because the latch clips were way too close together to get a solid mount. Cargo space was pathetic for the size of the vehicle. I fit more luggage in my Mazda 6 and nothing blocked the back window. The kids were much more crammed in this thing than in the Mazda 6 as well. You can't change the volume on the radio without brushing the touch screen and jacking up the settings. There is no auxiliary input and pairing with Bluetooth was a royal pain. The gas tank is tiny, restricting you to a maximum of 350-400 miles in perfect highway conditions. I'm glad I got to turn it in, good riddance.",1

3155, on 07/26/17 10:48 AM (PDT),Biff A. ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Mitsubishi, not Mercedes"," Update:After owning the car for a year and 12K miles, I would recommend the '16 Outlander to anyone looking for a compact SUV and 7 seats. The car is unparalleled in snowy weather, and is still a smooth drive at 70 MPH (eat your heart out Jeep owners). I can't think of a single other car this size that would get 34 MPG on a highway trip to Dulles Intl. airport that doesn't have some sort of electrical engine. The 4 cylinder engine still has enough  power to get you on the highway! This is still a new car, so I have yet to encounter any major mechanical issues. I will do my best to update this review if/when I do. I have owned this car for 6 months, and this is a summary of my experience. Do not compare this car to a Mercedes, as so many professional reviewers are in the habit of doing. I obtained my 2016 Outlander for just over 22,000USD brand new, which is over $10,000 less than other SUVs in its class, with the SAME exact feature set. It's shameful what other brands are charging, and the price gouging stops with Mitsubishi. Starting with the outside of the car, I adore the design, it's reminiscent of a Lexus RX series, but design is subjective. I bought the 4cyl model and it gets me 27MPG in inner-city daily driving, and over 30MPG on the highway (no I'm not exaggerating.) This car is roomy in the drivers' seat for a 6'1"" Male. I love the headroom, something other cars were lacking, and my knees can breathe as well. Many reviewers complain about the third row...this costs half as much as a Toyota Highlander, and goes twice as far on a tank of gas!! Those seats are intended for short adults or kids. I have taken teens and short adults on hour long road trips with no complaints. The only issue with the back seats is no ventilation, something Mitsubishi needs to work on, make sure you cool the car down before stuffing people back there. Kick the car into lock mode and it powers through snow. I had to go to work in 8 inches of snow (24/7 365 workplace) and this car drove right through it, I did not get stuck while driving in the tracks of other trucks. This car is a comfortable ride for a crossover SUV. It is not a Lincoln, or a Mercedes, but it IS loaded with features such as power windows and heated leather seats, it costs less than a Honda Accord and comes with more utility. The warranty length is fantastic (5-year/60K mile full vehicle, 10-year/100K mile powertrain). The lights work very well and LED DRLs are standard. Fog lights were a must for me and those are effective as well. If you want a car to carry you and a few others year round, that can be packed to the gills with either people or stuff on occasion, this should definitely be on your test drive list.",5
3156, on 07/17/17 07:41 AM (PDT),Josh ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV ES 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),The SUV that checked all of the boxes," I purchased a used 2016 Outlander ES AWD in February 2017 with just under 20K on it.  For the money I paid, there wasn't a better deal out there! I originally went looking at the Outlander Sport but quickly realized that with a young growing family, there just wasn't enough space in the Sport. The dealer suggested I check out the Outlander. I actually test drove a 2014 and found it was a doable option. When I found the 2016 I purchased I immediately fell in love. It checked all of the boxes I was looking for: AWD, Bluetooth, decent gas mileage, and space! The third row was the final check mark. It is a nice bonus to have in a pinch. Yes, it isn't the most comfortable third row seat but for what I need it for, it's a nice option. Is this SUV the most sporty or fastest? Absolutely not. However, for everyday driving and situations, this vehicle has plenty of power and get-up. Plus, you can't beat the 28mpg combined average I've been getting in a 7-passenger! The only reason it's not a five star rating, there are some options not on the ES trim level that I wish were there: automatic locking doors when in drive, backup cam, rear air vents. With that said I would definitely recommend checking out an Outlander if you are doing a search for a new SUV.***UPDATE (1/17/18)*** Almost one year later and I would still say the same about the Outlander. I've put about 11,000 miles on it with zero complaints. Plus, I've now experienced an entire Michigan winter in the vehicle and can't say enough about the AWD abilities of the vehicle. Always felt in control and under control thanks to the S-AWC on the vehicle.",4

3161, on 04/09/17 14:38 PM (PDT),B. K. ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Experts have established their biases," I was in the market for a new vehicle for my wife replacing a wonderful Mazda MPV we loved but after 11 years of wonder use it was time.  We shopped around and we found the 2016 Outlander for really attractive pricing and great options with the SEL model.  We drove to the nearest dealer an hour and a half away.   Before I going I went to the normal review site.  The 'Experts' seemed to have neutral to negative options.   It startled me.  Then I read glowing reviews from owners.   Quickly it was obvious that the 'Experts' with many of the so called leading review publications must suffer from established biases limiting their ability to have a fair, impartial or relevant view.  This still concerned me, but owners are the real experts, so I decide to make the trip.   We took the SEL for a drive and I wanted to see how it did especially on getting onto a 70 mph road.  As I turned right onto the ramp I focused on the traffic that I needed to merge into.   I thought to myself, gee this vehicle seems to be slow accelerating, so I looked down at the speedometer.  To my surprise I was already doing 70mph.  I guess the 'Experts' were expecting Porsche like performance from the Outlander vs what I experience, solid smooth and surprisingly good performance.   What impressed me the most was how quiet the cabin of the Outlander was.   This in fact is a part of the reason for it seeming to under perform.  There's little to no noise to indicate a highly rev'ing engine or whining transmission to make you to have a performance feel.  I guess Mitsubishi should do like some automakers by creating this sensation through the sound system.   We decided to purchase the Outlander.   With a drive back to our home with a rather challenging 4 mile mountain climb I thought to myself, we'll find out the Outlanders breeding.  The mountain is set to 65mph but most trucks are lucky to make it at 40-45.   We started up the mountain and concerned not to push a new vehicle beyond reasonable break in, I kicked of the cruise.  Without issue or pushing with a heavy foot the Outlander easily kept a 60-65mph pace even on the more difficult inclines.   The CVT transmission and engine combination out pace all my expectation.   I guess I should have had some of the 'Experts' along for the ride to have a real conversation and experience of what the Outlander is and can do.  Frankly, I'm embarrassed for the 'Experts' inabilities to understand that their biases are getting in the way of truly fair, impartial and accurate reviews.  Loving my Outlander every time I drive it and I don't feel the need to attempt to make it perform like a V6 or V8.",5
3162, on 04/02/17 20:04 PM (PDT),Value Shopper ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Do you yourself a favor and check it out," This is my 4th Mitsubishi (2 Outlander, 1 Outlander Sport, and 1 Galant).  I like them since they have Japanese quality but with a Korean price tag.  This spells value to me. This is important since cars just loose money so the name of the game is to loose the least amount.  Value in a large purchase is the most important item to me.  It is not status, top rated, looks, cool factor.... Bottom line my personal view of a car's job is to get you to point A to B with no issues, safely, and with comfort.  To add the status or the cost of the car should not limit the use of your vehicle since its only job is transportation.   The Outlander does this very well.  I have also found that it is hard to buy a popular car with built in value since the market places a high price point on it so your financial value is eroded due to supply and demand.  I think the best way to buy any car with built in value is to buy it used.  I like to buy a car with low miles and sell it at around 90k/100k. I have done this with three Mitsu's (in fact with all of my cars) and in my experience the cars just run and all you have to do is keep the fluids clean and tires rotated/updated.  One of the main reason why Mitsubishi does not receive high marks from the professionals is they typically make one car for all markets globally.  In fact they sell more cars outside the US.  The markets they do well in are rugged 2nd world and 3rd world locations where the car needs to work and it will be exposed to extreme conditions.  They also do well in certain 1st world countries where the economics of owning a car are different than in the US.  Example the PHEV is the best selling EV in England due to the tax incentives and price point of the vehicle.  This leads to a car that has a gap in features (tech and comfort) compared to cars made specifically for the US market.  If you think reliability and value are more important than tech and comfort Mitsubishi is a good car for you.    When I was looking for my latest car I did not blindly pick the Outlander.  I drove all the its competitors CX5, CRV, Rav4, and Impreza/Crosstrek.  I also travel a lot and drove many others including the Cherokee, Rouge,  Santa Fe, Tucson, Renegade, 500X, QX30, Frontier, Explorer, Audi Q5, and Enclave.  Many of them I ruled out for personal fit (size, ride).  The ones I liked I did research by checking consumer reviews and used a detailed financial model to buy the best car for the money.  Please do this research since there a lot of rotten eggs out there.  Just look at the reviews of the Cherokee.  Its a great driving car but a horrible transmission.  That is a deal killer on any car. All the research came to one answer the 2016 Mitsu Outlander. The added benefit is the 2016 is refined.  It has a great ride, quiet, roomy, great viability, comfortable, and the biggest surprise is getting better gas mileage than my Outlander Sport that had a smaller engine and is lighter.  The 2016 Outlander is a very good car so it is worth a look.  Don't let the moderate professional reviews and lack of them on the road deter you.  I also think the that Nissan recent investment in Mitsu will ramp up the promotion on the vehicle. Nissan needed the Mitsu's leading technology with 4WD, Plug in Hybrid, and electric.  In my opinion their 4WD/AWD system is one of the best on the market giving you options on what to do when you are in the crud.  Mitsu are popular in harsher locations in the world.  This mean they are made to take on more than the average 4WD/AWD, take a beating, and still run.  Bottom line go check on out you will be pleasantly surprised.Update: Very happy with the Outlander and honestly the best vehicle I have owned.  I even say that with getting into an ""act of god"" accident where a tree limb fell and hit my car.  It caused $3,800 in damage resulting in a new radiator, AC condenser, and bumper.  I owned the car for 3 weeks.  The car is running great even after the repair.  6 Months of driving I am averaging 29.6 MPG compared to my Sport that got 28.6.  I allays have it in ECO and most of my driving suburban/rural areas so traffic is low but there are intersections.  I have also debunked the ""its too slow issue"".  You have many ways to make it faster.  Turn off ECO or shift it to DS.  Either one will give you more then enough speed for any situation.  In fact even in ECO I can get the acceleration I need.  I have seen more Outlander on the road so I think the value is being recognized.  We will likely see a few more when the PHEV hits the dealers in December.  The PHEV looks like a well appointed and significantly less than any other PHEV on the market.   The big question you have to answer to step up to the PHEV is does the higher price pay for it in lower fuel cost.  This is simple math when all the final numbers come out.",5

I'm not sure what the problem is, but their treatment of the brand comes off as wholly unwarranted if you look at the value and quality of their vehicles. Sure, their lineup isn't as elaborate as it once was, and sales have suffered, but that doesn't mean the vehicles they DO SELL are that bad. I owned the original 2003 Outlander for 5 years and 90k miles and loved it. I've probably owned 8 vehicles since then, and I still kick myself for ever selling it. Best ""New"" car purchase I ever made. I recently purchased a 2016 Outlander ES AWD. I've driven it almost 2 months now and can say that it is one of the best values out there for a Compact-to-Mid size SUV. The features available in the base models are functional and competitive with rivals. The higher-end models can get pricey, but they're still below par compared to the competition. The ride is good. It feels like you're driving a larger sedan. That's one of things that cracks me up about some of the expert reviews (both here, C&D, and other places). IT'S A 4 CYLINDER FAMILY SUV. It isn't going to corner, accelerate, brake, or sound like a Corvette. The CVT takes some getting used, but after a couple of days you don't even notice it. The acceleration from the VERY fuel-efficient 4cyl is more than adequate for us mere mortal drivers who are never going to take a 7-passenger SUV to the skid pad to get G results. I drive in stop-and-go traffic, every single day on the way to work and back. It is literally stop-and-go the entire way (I live 7 miles from my office, and commute is regularly over an hour). I've averaged around 24 MPG up to this point. I'm not sure what else to say - if you came here to see whether or not you should look at an Outlander, just go drive one. It's either for you or it isn't. Just don't let what appears to be a biased car media steer you away from what could be a great vehicle for you. In the meantime, I'm just going to sit here and ask the ""EXPERTS"" to show me another 25-30MPG SUV with AWD, 7-passenger capabilities, and Japanese build quality and reliability (and a great warranty) in this price range. Go ahead. I'm waiting.",4
3166, on 03/04/17 14:40 PM (PST),kmagman ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Don't Overlook this SUV," Just to be clear, I needed a car with these specifications and price point ... It was NEVER on my want list.  However, having said that, I bought this Mitsubishi Outlander GT because:  1.  It has a traditional 6 speed automatic, NOT a CVT (Contiunously Variable Torture).  2).  A very reliable and time tested V6.  3).  A squared-off cargo area that actually has very useful space ... in my case for 2 dog crates 4).  Easy entry and exit ... dealing with transporting senior citizens 5).  AWD .. a surprisingly sophisticated system with different mode selection 6).  Best in class ground clearance 7). Hill holding feature (awesome for urban areas with hills!)  7).  EXCELLENT headlight system 8).  EXCELLENT sound system and seamless handsfree connection with iPhone 8).  EXCELLENT seat heaters .  However, even the best vehicles have some CONS.  These are the things I don't like about the vehicle 1).  Very finicky automatic liftgate actuation ... on multiple occassions it baulks opening ... especially with key fob ... very annoying  and has a lock out feature if you make too many attempts ... MITSUBISHI, please make this feature more user friendly  2).  As for handling .... at least for me, there is too much body roll/bobbing on country roads.   I know I did not buy an Audi or BMW, but tighter handling would be better.  OVERALL - I give this vehicle very high marks and is a great VALUE.   I will keep for a very long tme.",5
3167, on 02/06/17 08:03 AM (PST),Former Isuzu Guy ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),"Listen to the owners, not the ""experts"""," I recently posted the following review on another site:  This review subject to revision as time passes, of course, especially since I only took possession in October of 2016 and only have a little over 2,100 miles on the odometer. I looked at a LOT of similar vehicles before making the purchase, read a ton of reviews and took a couple of test drives as well before I plunked down the dough for the GT version (no extra add-ons, but I'll get into that later). This Mitsu provides very good ground clearance and real 4wd for those occasions when my business travel takes me off the pavement. So far, I've only needed the 4wd once and it extricated me from a severe mud-hole where awd would have had difficulty. Visibility from the driver's seat is very good in all directions. At first, I thought the seats somewhat uncomfortable, but now I don't. Dash controls are configured effectively but I'm still finding new ""stuff"". The radio sounds good, really good, but I'm not sure I am benefiting from nine speakers. I do worry about the big woofer in the back hatch area getting damaged, and I may try to figure some sort of grill guard to employ. I do appreciate that I have the option of both key and keyless operation, for both starting the vehicle and opening the doors. There's a lot of room inside this vehicle, especially when the rear seats are down (easily done). Several rear-seat passengers have said they are quite comfortable and like the options of both reclining and seat travel (although the seats don't really move that much). This is not a heavy vehicle so all the road cracks and bumps aren't soaked up by the suspension and soundproofing, but all-in-all a pleasant drive. As for the driving experience, let me just say it's enjoyable.The little V6 hums along nicely and quietly and propels the vehicle as fast as I need it to. The handling is crisp and the vehicle holds the road well. I'm not the type that worries about 0-60 acceleration stuff, but this Outlander has no problem merging into traffic on expressways and interstates. I feel safe. Mileage so far has averaged 29 mpg during some long hauls, but only 25 mpg during mixed local use. The owner's manual recommends premium fuel, but all I've put in the tank has been regular. One matter I am having trouble adjusting to are the LED lights; I just don't like the curtain effect that is projected into the darkness. The Outlander provides the driver with the ability to easily adjust the beam angle, and that has helped a little. Of course, the whole world is lit up when the high beams are on. As already mentioned, this vehicle comes well-equipped, and in some ways with more features than I really needed or wanted. Nonetheless, I did add an oem bug/stone deflector (that does actually work), and also, a set of oem mud guards (that don't do a very effective job at minimizing wheel spray onto the body). I will also be adding some 3M protective film on the tailgate ledge as well as on the door sills and door edges to help minimize scrapes and chips. Mitsubishi should have included these four items as standard.Many of the vehicles I examined fell short when comparing my needs and wants. Several had deceptive ground clearance specs; some vehicles had protruding air dams, front bumpers or exhaust components just waiting to get snagged and torn-off. Other vehicles claimed good ground clearance, but didn't truthfully say whether it was ""maximum"" or ""minimum"". In my opinion, the Outlander stacked-up well to other similar vehicles, and in many areas, better, especially when considering the out-the-door price and warranty coverage. True, many of the reviews, especially those by the so-called ""experts"" minimized or trashed this vehicle. However, most actual buyers/owners/users provided favorable reviews, and, I intend to agree with them.This Outlander replaced an amazing Isuzu Trooper that gave me 260,000 miles of reliable service. If Isuzu was still selling a Trooper-type vehicle in the USA, I would probably be driving a new one. I'm hoping the Outlander proves a reliable successor.As of now, I’m enjoying this new vehicle and becoming more comfortable with it as the miles roll along. I believe, like the Trooper, it will provide me with good value. Maybe another update down the road??",4

Trim and fit is first rate, quality of materials is very apparent.  Great gas mileage, and stunning handling and performance.  Best car you will find in its class.Car continues to be just a great car.  Driving habits changed a bit, little more city routes, so mileage has dropped about .3 mgp or so.  Sure c an not complain.

I own three Mitsubishi cars and I believe they make a better car than Toyota, but with more bells and whistles yet a much lower price.  The rebates on these cars are insanely generous.  I have the 4 cylinder which is good enough for me, acceleration is acceptable as I am not looking to race anyone.  Nice interior.  Ride is very smooth and quiet.  I got the Premium sound system with mine and it's spectacular.   I expect quality to be outstanding based on my prior experience, and the warranty is excellent as it exceeds most manufacturers.  You owe yourself a look at the Outlander if you are looking for a small SUV.  The downside of Mitsubishi cars is that they depreciate greater than their Japanese cousins, simply due to market share and not quality; I don't care about this as I keep my cars a long time.  I almost bought an Avalon and I am glad I got this one instead--saved a lot of $$$ and this car is more practical.",5

Most of the automotive magazines hate this car and I'm not sure why.  I love my Outlander! I have a fairly significant commute; about 60 miles a day so fuel economy was an important factor.  The Outlander gets the best mileage of any other non-electric SUV out there.  I put it in eco-mode and I'm getting an average of over 30 mpg. The acceleration is not zippy but it is fine.  I also opted for the safety package which gives adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance.  I really like having both of those features.  I would never have thought to buy a Mitsubishi but happened to be looking at a used car at a dealership and the salesman convinced me to test drive the Outlander.  This vehicle is an exceptional value.  The purchase price is considerably less than any other similarly sized SUV out there.  It comes with a great warranty and roadside assistance.  Do yourself a favor and go test drive one.",5

At the dealership, I test drove many vehicles including; the Jeep Compass, & the Hyundai Santa Fe. Both Vehicles had more features than my Outlander but once I drove that thing, I loved it. To me, it had the best ride feel, great price, and it feels like a larger SUV than what it really is. Mine is all black with black accented rims, so it looks sharp. I'm disappointed in all the expert reviews saying this car is average because it does not come with all the latest in cabin features, but I don't need lane assistance, parking assistance, or even the heated seats. This is a fantastic SUV, extremely underrated, and great price. The one thing I do agree on with the expert reviews is the third row seating. That thing might as well not exist, because only my 4 year old can fit back there.",4

You'd think Mitsubishi spit in the face at all the reviewers at one time or another for them to raise such an eyebrow on this vehicle.  Edmunds rates it a C.  This vehicle is B+ at the least.  Edmunds claims the interior quality is cheap, but it is really no worse (better in my opinion) than many competitors that I drove.  Get into a Honda CRV and see how much racket you can make with your fingernails on the abundance of plastic haunting the dash, and then get in here and you tell me what you see and feel.  The AWD system is fantastic, one winter down with it and it absolutely crushes anything (within reason, of course) you throw at it.  Gas mileage is average, but pleasant for the size.  Acceleration is good, with the 4 cylinder I noticed if you do have a few people in the car it will feel a bit groggy.  However, for everyday driving it should be more than adequate to the average person.  Safety was a huge plus for me here too.  Overall, I have 12,000 miles on it, have been driving it for over a year and no trouble yet.  Props to Mitsubishi!

The battery might be going as it sounds a bit sluggish as we turn the car over. The two accessory plugs have quit working, it's probably a fuse. Other than that it's been wonderful and we can get 30mpg on the highway at 70-73mph and average about 23-25 in the city. The 3rd row seats have come in handy on a few occasions but i'd prefer the extra cargo over the seats if I was given a choice. All in all we'd buy another in a heartbeat, a bit bummed about the battery issue and accessory plugs but it's very minor and the vehicle is still under it's bumper to bumper so no biggie. If it was a Toyota/Honda/Nissan/American we'd be out of warranty so let that sink in, gotta love the 5/50 and 10/100 warranty, blows most of the competition away.""UPDATE 5/29/17: 12k miles now without any issues whatsoever. Believe it or not I prefer driving this to my Mercedes E350. The ride is smooth and the cabin is so quiet it's hard to believe this is considered a budget vehicle. As far as the 4cyl motor? No problem, it's not a HP winner but it is much more than just adequate. Loving this car!"" My 07 had 233,000 miles on it and still ran as well as it did when new. It was by far the most reliable vehicle I have ever owned and that's what led me to the new 2016 Outlander SEL. The new Outlander is entirely a different animal. It's so much quieter and the ride quality is vastly improved as are the materials used for the interior and soundproofing. This new Outlander is QUIET, the old 07 was noisey, tons of road noise and wind roar, virtually eliminated in this new 2016. Fuel economy is impressive, we are averaging a solid 27 combined and have seen as high as 32mpg while cruising open back-roads at 50-60mph.  Hopefully once it's broken in a bit the fuel economy will rise a bit as we are only getting about 27 on the highway at around 75mph. The Rockford Fosgate sound system is really nice, a bit muddy and punchy compared to my Mercedes E-350 but It's not really fair to compare a 60k vehicle to this, for the price point you would be hard pressed to do much better.  The exterior looks nice but to me  all crossovers look about the same, the 18"" alloy's are a nice touch though. The 2.4 motor coupled with the re-programmed CVT is lackluster but functional. I miss the power of the old 6cyl in the 07 but I don't miss the appalling fuel economy that came along with it. For our purposes the 2.4 will be just fine and we have zero issue merging onto the expressway or overtaking. Comparing the two models the 2016 just blows the 07 out of the water, it's a huge improvement. As for comparing it to other crossovers, I just spent a day driving around in a 2017 Subaru Outback. The Outback was much more peppy and it's CVT more refined. Ride quality was better, it has a more substantial solid feeling as far as the suspension goes but road noise was about the same and the cabin was nothing to write home about, I think the Outlander is superior and more comfortable along with feeling significantly larger with a higher more commanding ride. Considering how much more the Outback sells for I am VERY happy with the Mitsubishi Outlander, it represents one hell of a bargain at $22k and if it holds up as well as our 07 we will be incredibly happy owners.",4
3177, on 11/16/16 21:42 PM (PST),Mohammed Habib ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),WOW!," I spent 6 months researching cars. We rent a tiny little parking space in NYC width wise, and we were restricted to a car that is less than 75"" wide. The family also got a little larger, and we needed a car with at least 6 seats. SO logically I went and researched the top most 7 seat SUVs, which were the Toyota Highlander, Honda Pilot, Nissan Pathfinder and the Nissan Rogue. To be completely honest, a 5-10 minute test drive of each of those cars, they felt the same. After seeing the width of Highlander, pilot and pathfinder, I realized none of these will do. I went at the nissan dealer, got a final cost of a rogue which with tax came out to almost $31,500. The rogue came with cloth seats, navigation and some extra stuff. Then out of nowhere saw an advertisement for outlander. We went to go see it, and instantly fell in love with it. Now all those negative reviews on different websites, where did they come from? I am driving a FAMILY SUV, I DEFINITELY don't need it to go from 0-60 in 3 seconds, I am completely fine with it going in 8 seconds. I have the AWC, but keep it off most of the time because I want to save gas. I love the leather, especially since it has on every part of the trim. I opted in for the SEL AWC. One thing that is lacking is the screen. Nower days the cars come with touch screen vs buttons, but I will gladly press buttons and pay 6k less. All honesty this car feels and drives like its worth $35,000. I got 3k miles on it, and took a 900 mile road trip and everything worked wonderfully. ONE very little thing is the paint chip and scratches. You just gotta be careful how you drive the car that's all, and take any paint chip issues straight to the dealer and they will fix it right away.",4
3178, on 10/31/16 18:58 PM (PDT),Mark Hunter ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Tough enough for Australia," Everyone gushes about how much they love their new car, of course. We were in Australia for three months, and drove two of these for just over 10,000 KM (about 6,300 miles). This is a useful seven passenger three row size, partway between the smallest and biggest SUVs. The Outlander’s third row seat is not the biggest, but it does offer about a foot and a half more room between the second row and the hatch. That means a lot to us on an extended road trip with lots of luggage and gear.We drove the ES/SE (rental hybrid of trim levels) with the 2.4 CVT in Australia, and bought the SE S-AWC a month ago here in DFW. I had the same experience as other private reviewers. I don’t understand what the pros are talking about when they say this doesn’t have enough power. I never had to floor it to merge into traffic. It has plenty of power for passing, easily goes from 55 to 70 uphill in the mountains with a full load of gear, and tachs at 2,300 when cruising at 70. It has a very smooth stable ride, a good driving position with comfortable seats, feels confident when cornering, and brakes well. The interior is remarkably quiet. The salesman said it has acoustic glass. Who knows? One feature not available on any other small SUV (that I am aware of) is the ability to disengage the AWD system altogether, using just the FWD and saving a penny on gas. We test drove most of the manufacturers, and could feel the difference between the AWD and the FWD.  The Outlander’s AWD was not noticeable whether engaged or not. We spent a lot of time and miles in the Outlander ES/SE in Australia, and found it (and Australia) altogether agreeable. We test drove the GT (V6) and the Sport (shorter wheelbase). The GT and the Sport have firmer rides for different reasons. The seven passenger ES S-AWC 2.4 CVT is the way for us to go. It’s an all day driver, and carries our full load of gear without breaking a sweat.Update May 2017. Still like the ride and drive. Worst gas mileage was 21 mpg going west on I-40 at 70 mph up from Amarillo at 1000 ft elevation to Tucumcari New Mexico at 6000 ft elevation into a gale force headwind that blew through the door seals. The cvt was bouncing the rpm’s to almost 4000. We were passing all the big trucks (for a change). The best gas mileage was 33 mpg coming from El Paso east on I-20 through the oil patch to Midland/Odessa. Speed limit was 80. Must have been a tailwind.",5

This is the best SUV in the class. The engine and transmission are time tested and solid. Yes it's still timing belt driven but this engine is going to last!! The ride quality is smooth and quite. The upgraded Rockford Fosgate sound system is fantastic, spend some time playing with all the different sound options and find the one that sounds best with your music.

3181, on 10/11/16 13:49 PM (PDT),Christian ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Best Bang for Your Buck," As many others have said, the so-called ""experts"" seem to miss the true appeal of the Outlander -- an AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, SAFE, FUEL-EFFICIENT family SUV with a load of features that would easily cost you thousands more elsewhere. We were able to get our 2016 Outlander SEL for $25,000, and that was WITH 0% financing for 72 months. Shop around, and you won't find another SUV in its class that comes even close when you factor in the features Mitsubishi includes as standard with the SEL trim level. So, what do you get for the money? Well, for starters we are routinely getting 31+ mpg on the highway, and up to 36 mpg in some instances. On hilly back roads and in town, you will run pretty close to the 24/25 mpg advertised mileage, which is still fine for a vehicle of this size. In addition to the economy, you're getting a 5-star safety rating, a 5-year/60,000-mile bumper to bumper warranty and a 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Again, Toyota, Mazda, Nissan and all the U.S. auto makers don't even come close on warranty. And if you compare similar vehicles from Hyundai and Kia with the features you are getting from Mitsubishi, the price isn't close. So, on top of the economy, safety and reliability, now you can add a nicely appointed leather interior, heated front seats, heated side mirrors, 6-inch color touch screen entertainment display with integrated Bluetooth for your phone, fog lights, keyless entry, power driver's seat, 18-inch allow wheels, LED brake lights and daytime running lights and more. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the all-wheel drive on the Outlander is a full-featured system that allows you to switch to various modes and even lock the wheels. We haven't had any poor weather yet to truly test the AWD system, but based on other drivers' reviews, I am confident it will serve us well this winter on the mountain roads around our Pennsylvania home. As for the third-row seats, yes, they ARE tiny. You certainly would not want to ride across the country in them. However, I imagine most families are like ours and the third-row seats are not for everyday use but rather for occasional use when the kids have a couple friends along or when grandma and grandpa visit and we want to go out to dinner without the need to drive two vehicles. In such instances, the rear seats are more than adequate and represent a real convenience that most other vehicles in this class don't even offer, or charge $1,000 for as an upgrade. Plus, when the third-row seats are folded down, the Outlander offers generous cargo capacity, and with the second row seats folded, there is plenty of room for hauling even large, bulky objects. As for the driving performance, it is true that the 4-cylinder engine is a bit underpowered. Acceleration is sluggish, but that's the tradeoff for the great fuel economy. Besides, my wife and I aren't race car drivers, and we find the overall performance more than adequate. The overall comfort of the leather seats (first and second rows) is very good, the standard sound system is quite good and road noise is quite good. We are only a couple months in, but so far so good with the Outlander. Honestly, I feel this vehicle represents, by far, the best family SUV value on the market, and after looking at MANY other options, I just could not get away from the fact that Mitsubishi offers consumers a lot more for their money than other manufacturers. Add in the great warranty and I am confident that this Outlander will serve our family's needs for many years.",5

3183, on 10/02/16 16:22 PM (PDT),PK ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Outlander excellent, auto media reviews are biased"," Biased and disconnected auto media... Why do the Edmunds owner reviews not reflect this horrible car you profess? Your credibility is doo-doo.  Real proactive lockable 4WD with torque vectoring and major ground clearance (~2+ inches more than most). You only get this grade 4WD (~Quadra Drive II) as a spendy option on a Limited or better Grand Cherokee. $50k for starters. Not even available with most other mfger's. You could stick with the cheapo reactive 4WD (a simple ABS mod actually) where it kicks in after the wheels slip. Great! AWD kicks in -AFTER- you're already sliding into the ditch! Shame on you Subaru for going this route to bump your fuel ratings. Oh well, join the club then. OMG, doesn't handle like a CX5? No kidding, it's biased for 4x4 capability, not car-like compromise. Unfortunately you can't evaluate 4WD capability in the ten minutes the auto journalists spend with the car in southern California. 3rd row seating is tight? How many SUV's in this class have 3rd row? Right, it's not a Suburban, why compare it to one? Low on power? Acceleration is the same as prior model Toyotas and Honda's, but nothing was said about them at the time. I'll take tried and true power train over ""experimental"" systems that boost power at the cost of reliability (widespread direct injection teething problems, Chrysler 9 speed transmissions, etc). It's criticized that Mitsubishi has the lowest output V6 available. How many of the small SUV's are available with a V6? Almost none. And the power to weight ratio is the same as a Grand Cherokee with the Pentastar, which is panned as ""more than adequate"" power. Notice the 100% ""built in Japan""? That means all parts are high quality. Look at US built cars. 70% US parts, with 30% coming from Vietnam,China, etc.. Have to offset the cost of the good stuff with some crap. Oh, and the crap is the stuff the mfgr has no warranty or accountability for. Wear parts; Shocks, brakes, ball joints, tires, tied rods,etc.. Plan on replacing those at 30k miles. The Fosgate audio system gets criticized hard too. Give me a break. It's the best sounding system out there. It destroys the Logic 7 in my old BMW. The head unit isn't a technical wonder, but oh, the sound... My biggest problem is that they are comparing MSRP to MSRP. To compare apples to apples you should compare -actual- average purchase price. What they are selling for, not what they'd like to sell them for. Throw in the 60k/10 year bumper to bumper and it's an easy choice for a lot of people. Problem is they don't even drive one after they read the 5 minute test drive review from the guy who re-printed the previous year review, who just got out of a Land Rover and a Corvette. This vehicle needs a proper review, unbiased, with attention to detail, with no comparisons to vehicles that are dissimilar. Mitsubishi is not getting a fair shake here.Update 4/28/2018: Same opinion, no regrets. 43k miles without a problem. Yeah, it's a snowmobile in the winter. Lock the S-AWC into snow mode and forget about it. Still a smooth ride, bangin' stereo. The versatility of the fold down 3rd row seats has been more valuable than I thought. I won't buy another SUV without it. I have managed to deactivate the power hatch twice with the little button in the lower center console. I thought it was broken, but nope, my fault. I still like the looks a lot, it hasn't gotten old. It does seem like a much bigger vehicle than it is.  Roomy and can pack lots of stuff in it, but it parks easy and can fit into tight spots. Lastly, when I bring it into service at White Bear Mitsubishi, I see the two crashed Outlanders proudly displayed out front. High speed accidents with semi trucks. Both drivers had minor injuries. The ""Rise"" safety frame technology in these Outlanders is no joke. Gives me as piece of mind about my purchase every time I drive in. I'll be back for the PHEV version at some point. Happy camper. .",5

This is basically a company car that I use for work.  I love it but the maintenance cost is brutal.  The higher ups got tired of the expenses and ordered me to get a new car.  I actually picked a Mazda CX-5 and was ready to get the papers when I walked by the Outlander...... It sounds weird but it felt good to be next to it and I just had to test drive it!  Needless to say, I completely forgot the Mazda and bought the Mitsubishi Outlander SEL!  I brought my ""Navy Mitsu"" home the next day and love it!-------------------Well, after driving the car now for over a month and adding over a couple thousand miles.....the gas is great, savings galore since it uses regular instead of 93.  Pick up is a little slow but it is a 4 cylinder.  The 2nd row seats are ok, mind you, my son is 6'5"" and it is a little hard for him.  The 3rd row is a little useless so I just keep it down.  Overall, I do miss the luxury of my MB but this is worth the money because it gets you where you want to go and the gas economy is great, and the drive is smoother than you would think.",5

3189, on 08/04/16 20:05 PM (PDT),Rob ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Four months after buying and still loving it," We shopped for a year before deciding on the 2016 outlander sel. When we started our search the ""Mitsu"", as my wife calls it, wasn't even on the list. One reason it didn't make the list was the horrible reviews from ""experts"".  After looking for a while we narrowed it down to the Nissan Rogue and the 2016 Mazda CX-9. The main requirements we had was a three row SUV that got decent gas mileage. Well once pricing came out on the cx9 that pretty much ruled that vehicle out. We owned a 2008 cx9 and loved it and really liked the new design but the sticker price combined with the mediocre gas mileage with premium fuel was just too much. So we test drove the rogue and actually really liked the way it drove but the options on the mid level trim were slim for the price. The mid level is the only trim with 3 rows and leather isn't even an option. So we decided to try the outlander and drive it the same day. I didn't think it drove as well as the rogue but it had a few things going for it. 1. It was bigger, much bigger in the 3rd row 2. It got basically the same mpg even with the increased size. 3. It had a TON more options including leather, sub woofer, moonroof, led lights... 4. It was cheaper than the Nissan.  We were sold. There are some complaints. The average mpg gauge resets after 8 or so hours so you don't actually get the average mpg per tank. The handling is ok but not great, 2008 cx9 was better. Thought it had led daytime running lights but it's just led parking lights in the front. Infotainment center is a little behind the times, still works fine but hard to navigate. Things we really like: third row is fine for kids even our 12 year old. Gas mileage we average around 28 but constantly get over 30 mpg on highway trips. The subwoofer is awesome, great stereo. The warranty was an added bonus especially when compared to the competition. The power is sufficient, I know many reviews talk about the lack of power but most parents don't actually need a 8 second 0-60 time, they prefer savings at the pump and I appreciate the fact Mitsubishi recognizes that. We leave ours in Eco mode and are more than happy with the acceleration. So the short version, if you need a 3 row suv that gets great gas mileage and has a long list of features, make sure to test drive an outlander.",5

We had a snow storm and even with all season tires, the snow mode gave me a lot of confidence. Other than oil changes, the car had been solid. Mpg is lower than advertised. The only thing I wished it has is heated steering wheel. Original reviewWhat you should know is that the outlander is in a segment that has almost zero competition in North America. It is the 3 row compact class. It's just there outlander and the rogue. And the rogues dont come with a V6. Reviewers compare the outlander to 2 row CUVs or 3 row mid size SUVs. Regardless, no other car epitomizes value like the outlander. V6, power lift gate, sunroof, rain sensing wipers, wiper de-icers, 18"" wheels, fosgate sound, s-awc, power folding side mirrors, leather etc. All at a lower price point. I can't speak about reliability as I just bought the car but the handling and comfort is definitely at least a B+. It's not a sports car. It's a family vehicle. My kids love the car. We find a excuse to drive as a family.",5
3193, on 06/08/16 05:52 AM (PDT),Eric Vanhinkle ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Great Car Horrible Paint," I purchased this car with 4 miles on it.  I noticed after my first oil change that there were specs on the car's hood.  Very small at first then increasing to the size of a pea.  At my next oil change I mentioned it to service who took pics and sent to corporate as the dealer cannot make warranty decisions on leather and paint.  I had the regional director of service come out and inspect my vehicle who took more pics and turned into corporate.  I was told these were stones and not covered under warranty.  While I am not a care engineer, repair or sales person, I would think that if I was hit by something hit my car hard enough to chip my paint to the gray primer there would probably be a dent, which there is not.  As the chips are increasing in numbers and size, I am anticipating my entire hood will be gray and not the beautiful cosmic blue before the loan is even paid off.

Alternatives were a minivan...nope.  A ton of cash...nope.  Or a Journey or a Rogue.  The Journey with leather seats and AWD came out with less mileage and more $.  Plus they have not been reliable and have a short warranty.  The Rogue back seat was ridiculous, plus no leather with that extra seat option. -So I went back and forth on the Outlander because it got middling to poor reviews, particularly with Consumer Reports.  But I realized the poor reviews came in areas I do not care about because I drive like a grandma.  Acceleration slow?  So what.  Some lean on corners?  Who cares.  I stick the thing in Eco mode X 2 (AWC Eco and the Standard Eco) and get 34 on the highway with an AWD vehicle on a nice day.  -It's also comfortable and quiet and my 35 mile commute in the am is incredibly pleasant.  -The warranty is king, and I took it to the life of my payments (84 months...at 0.9%..Yeah, seriously)  for 1200 bucks.  -The safety ratings are outstanding.-It looks good with a metallic coppery brown exterior and beige leather interior.-I'm happy.",5

The OEM oil drain plug started leaking and I replaced with aftermarket one and that fixed the problem.If you have never driven a CVT it will take you a while to get used to it. We had a turbo charged vehicle with a 6 speed tranny before and it would really take off after the turbo lag. It takes a while to accelerate with a 4 cyl and a cvt.

The Mazda was noisy and road ruff. Ford Escape was ok but didn't like rear seat room or the packages they offered for the price. Hyundai and Kia are only a good value if you buy the base ones. GM Trax was really nice but again was too small. Toyota Rav 4 was very unimpressive and pricing was very high for what you recieved and the warrenty was half as long as the Mitsubishi. Nissan, well what can I say, again high price, worst CVT transmission I drove, Lots of consumer complaints .  If you go and drive the competition then drive the Mitsubishi and consider price and warrenty I think you will be driving one home like I did !!

Fell in love with it immediately. The step up in brakes and steering alone was awesome.The Mirage brakes were horrible, the steering fair. Sure there are better brakes and steering out there, but for a big SUV it's pretty nice. Have driven a FordFusion (rental), it does feel similar, at least to me. The blue tooth is great in it. First Cruise control for me. Really like it. The seats are comfortable. Could maybe usean extra adjustment on the seat, but it does feel comfortable. The biggest complaint is the big headrests on the third row seats, do block the rear view a little, butthey are removable, so not a huge deal.The radio stereo is the basic brand, but it's a huge step up from the Mirage's stereo. The Mirage you had to play your mp3music at nearly full volume. The Outlander at twenty four the music is pretty loud. So far only really drove it back and forth from work, but so far I'm loving everymoment. This is no where near the top vehicle on the road, but it is a value SUV. The Mirage wasn't a bad vehicle either. The biggest downside probably wouldbe the gas mileage. From the Mirage I got around 37 MPG regularly, never less than that from fill up to fill up. Looking now at a possible 26 MPG area. I would recommend this SUV to people looking for a nice vehicle for family driving or light hauling. The towing capacity is pretty light on this vehicle. It's listed at onlyfifteen hundred pounds. The Continuously Variable Transmission is fine on the ES model. You can punch it and go with little effort.",5

I've got 25K miles on mine and love it!  I burn regular unleaded and get an avg. of 23 MPG's!  I've tried a couple tanks of premium and get the same MPG's and performance!  The vehicle is solid in snow traction, acceleration, quietness, steering, etc.  I love the LED headlights and tail lights - you don't get that on a 2016 XLE Rav4!I did test drive a LOT of 2015 CUV's before I bought this model.  I recently drove a 2016 Rav4 and did not like the bumpy ride, noisy interior, poor acceleration and LACK OF TOWING!  AND the price for a 4 cylinder vs. my V6 was ALMOST the same with the same options I have!!   I think Mitsubishi messed up there marketing and some of their models over the past 10 years or so but this car is NOT bad!  I had a Mazda for 12 years before this and there is no comparison to that vehicle with the smooth shifting 6 speed the Outlander has and power over that Mazda that had a 200 HP V6.  So.....try it out before you buy something else!",4
3211, on 02/01/16 18:21 PM (PST),Jeff W. ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Take another look.," This is as honest as a car gets.   There's no flashy advertising, no crazy hamsters driving it around, you get the picture.   I bought this when we traded in our 2011 GMC Terrain.   Our Terrain was loaded to the gills with options but it was becoming unreliable.   We got the Outlander SEL with AWD and the safety package which comes with rain sensing wipers, automatic headlights, adaptive cruise and collision mitigation.    I was surprised when we were shopping to learn that this was a top safety pick, so we gave it a shot.  So far it has been great in this Buffalo winter and has had no issues in the slop that populates the roadway this time of year.   No heavy snow yet but I'm confident this will be fine.  The rear seat fits both our car seats with ease and I don't have to have my seat all the way forward for them to be comfortable (I'm 6'4"").   The passenger seat could use some more room for us tall folk but that seems to be the norm for this segment.   The warranty can't be beaten since it's bumper to bumper for 60k for 5 years and it includes free roadside during that time as well.  The financing options are very good also.  We have average credit and were able to get 3.5% for 65 months with the option to turn the car in at 48 months with 60k miles and just walk away.   (We had some negative equity on the GMC)  So if you're sitting there thinking you can't afford a new car, you really can and it will be worth it to have a warranty for 60k miles.   Overall you can't beat what you get for the money with this car.   If you're in the market for a crossover that gets decent gas mileage, take another look at Mitsubishi.   You'll be surprised what you find.",4
3212, on 01/05/16 13:24 PM (PST),John ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Great for dad and kids in the city," I needed a car with a third row for occasional use by young children (depending on how many kids I'm commuting with).  The car needed to be not huge -- something I can comfortably drive in traffic and park in tight spots.  I was happy with my venerable stick-shift Ford Focus, but it's now too small.  (At first I really wanted to get the 2014 Mazda5 6-speed manual, but crash test scores made me reconsider.)  After deciding that the Acura MDX was too expensive and the Dodge Journey a bit too bulky, I considered the Outlander along with the Nissan Rogue and the Kia Sorento.Here's why I picked Outlander:- Adding the 3rd row in the Rogue (family package) or 4-cyl Sorento (convenience package) adds roughly $1K to MSRP and rules out leather.  Maybe it's standard on the V6 Sorento.  The cloth on the Sorento is very sturdy, the Rogue and the Outlander pretty basic.  All the third rows are small (and fold away), but the Rogue's was extra small with very little vertical leg room (so knees go up).  The Outlander's third row is maybe slightly smaller than the Sorento's (but standard).  - The warranty is better than Nissan (5 yrs > 3) and on par with Kia (slight edge to Mitsubishi on roadside assistance)- During the test drive, the Outlander delivered comparable acceleration with less CVT screaming than the Rogue.  Power and handling seemed comparable to the base Sorento, but with somewhat less snap around center steering.  The Sorento also offers a turbo 4-cyl but without third row seat (sigh).   - It's just a good looking car.  I really liked the ""cosmic blue"" and the ""quartz brown.""  The Sorento has a nice ""dark cherry"" though.- Better standard sound system with HD radio.  - If you like 4WD, it has selectable active 4WD vs the passive AWD I believe you get on the Rogue and Outlander.  I'm just leaving it on ""eco"" until it snows or something.Here's how Mitsubishi could make me like the Outlander even more:- One-push turn signal for lane changes (see the Sorento)- Make auto on/off headlights standard (currently only with safety package or GT trim, I believe)- There's a lot of empty space under the hood.  Maybe this space is used by the GT model, or by right-hand steering on Japanese versions?  Maybe it could be shifted for greater front leg room.- Provide a non-CVT option (below GT trim)- It was hard to find an SEL trim with FWD.  I wound up getting a 4WD I didn't really need just due to pricing and inventory.- At least with Kia and Nissan you get final assembly in USA.  Mitsubishi just closed its only USA factory.It's definitely bigger than what I drove before, but the kids and I enjoy it.  We were saving up for it, so I paid cash (there's a cash back incentive or zero APR, but not both -- also a nice military rebate) and still had a little left over for their college savings!",5
3213, on 12/15/15 11:15 AM (PST),JT ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Great car, practical!"," This is my first Mitsubishi. We had a Mazda5 2013 for almost 3 years but decided to sell it after bad crash rating released recently and major warranty work on the engine tappets (not a good sign). So we were looking for an SUV with third-row that's not a full size or V6, and it boils down to Mitsubishi Outlander or Nissan Rogue (with 3rd row option and run-flat tires since the third row takes over the spare tire space). We test-drove our friend's 2015 GT and was quite surprised with the car and I was glad to find many improvements was done to 2016 version. The Rogue is out of question since we would rather have spare tire than using run-flat tires.We ended up getting the cosmic blue 2WD SEL with roof rack, and exterior package. The car is primarily driven by my wife and she couldn't be happier with it and I also really enjoyed the car. I drove it to the mountain and the Bay many times, the performance is good. I'm not sure why the the reviewers from certain auto mag and review sites gave it such low mark (biased-much?). The engine power is decent, don't believe when reviewers slammed about how slow the car is getting into freeway ramps. I lived in CA and drove to the SF and the bay many times and it gets to the ramp fine even in fast paced traffic. Maybe those pro reviewers are so spoiled with testing high end cars and have snobby attitudes against more affordable car for the masses. I also used to own 2007 Acura MDX with technology package and I enjoy driving the Outlander more than the MDX to be honest.I can't say anything about the warranty yet but the 10-year 100k miles warranty should give you peace of mind. All in all, this car deserves a look, it's a great people mover, fun enough for weekend driving and it's priced great for it's class.PS: look for real world reviews in youtube and websites. This car is actually selling well in Europe and not sure why it's hardly heard in US (I would blame Mitsubishi North America marketing department for this). The plugin Hybrid version is selling like hotcakes in Europe and will come to US sometimes next year.",5
3214, on 10/28/15 14:42 PM (PDT),Tyler ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV ES 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Outlandish Surprise," I needed an affordable SUV for my family of 5. I looked at all options including some large sedans and mini vans. Then I came across the Outlander. I've had the car  for only about a month but I am totally impressed. It looks great, drives great, gets amazing gas mileage for a full size SUV. I am consistently getting 31-33 mpg on the highway and 29 mixed. I can get my wife and three kids in this thing and jump on the highway and go! It also doesn't require Premium gas just basic unleaded. I have the base model but I love it for what it is. A simple clean performer. The bluetooth phone connectivity works great and much better than my last 35 thousand VW. The stock wheels look very nice and fresh. It's also very quiet on the road. It's a just a real good performer for the tasks that I use it for. My model doesn't have all the bells and whistles but honestly I don't need Nav. I have my phone and it works great. I also love that I sit up high on the road. It's as high as most trucks and higher than most vans. It's got tons of cargo space and is really flexible when you're hauling people or cargo. The build quality feels good.  The ride feels solid with nice balance of road feel and comfort. It has high clearance so although I haven't tested it in the snow, I am expecting decent performance. The warranty is amazing. I simply do not believe that there is a better SUV buy out there for $19,785 especially one that sits 7. The Outlander will haul people and cargo and do it with style and great gas mileage. Plus you get the added bonus that they are not a dime a dozen. In a way they are a bit like a boutique company. I read all the reviews before I bought it and many complained about the lack of power. I don't get it. It has enough power. Is it fast? Fast enough. Is it a race car? No. In drive mode with ""Eco"" mode enabled at can at times feel a little sluggish but it's not that bad. If you feel the need you can always drop the shifter in ""sport"" mode, click off the ""Eco"" mode and get much snappier performance. I actually like that I can turn this stuff off and on. That way I can get great mileage most of the time but get performance when I feel like it's needed. So far I am really liking the OutlanderAfter having this vehicle for almost 3 years now I can honestly say I am very pleased with the purchase. It has performed perfectly with absolutely no down time, no repairs and no problems. I love that I can get up to 31-33 MPG on the highway but I can also carry all five of my family members in relative comfort. Great value!",5
3215, on 10/19/15 15:43 PM (PDT),JD Anderson ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),2016 OUTLANDER SEL AWD," This vehicle has rugged good looks and sensible features. Where else can you find a third row AWD wagon under 30,000? Initially my wife and I  were drawn to the Subaru Forester, but after thorough review and test driving, determined that the quality of the Forester felt too small inside for our growing family and the materials not as durable as we would expect for the price. So, I continued researching all of the recommended models comparable to the  Forester. Subsequently I test drove the Outlander SE AWD and the SEL AWD. A local dealer was offering a manangers special on a 2015 SE AWD at an ubeatable price. I test drove and fell in love with the outstanding practicallity of the design and relatively understated body design- more about rugged simplicity than urban bling. I took the test drive alone, with my wife trusting me to come home with a ""managers special"". My wife would have been perfectly satisfied with the SE, but I couldn't help taking notice of the 2016 SEL AWD on the lot. I took a test drive, and I was definitely impressed. Still functional and spacious,  and the 2.4 L engine adding the power some may expect from this bigger SUV AWD wagon. I took it upon myself to go over our budget and surprise her with the  2016 Outlander SEL. I was a bit anxious, as my wife is more practical than myself and really would have lived with the winier 2.0 liter 2015 SE without complaint. For the price difference- I thought the upgrade to the SEL would be a good long term choice for the family. My wife is driving the vehicle daily and sends me messages throughout the day expressing her enjoyment the car. In my opinion, Mitsubishi is offering great AWD wagon packages for the value-minded that appreciate classic rugged good looks and AWD driving functionality. The expert reviews do not cover many of the positive attributes that make this SUV such an exceptional value, such as the alternative AWD modes- totally absent in most of the other SUV wagons. The Outlander is a unique SUV and deserves far more credit than the experts give it.",5
3216, on 09/14/15 11:30 AM (PDT),Priji Eapen ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Great Improvements from the previous year model!," I owned a 7 seater Outlander 2014 before. When I did a test drive of the 2016 model, I was quite surprised to see the improvements that  Mistubishi made in the 2016 model. I've noticed a considerable reduction in outside noise and vibration. They’ve made significant improvements to the performance of the vehicle as well. 2014 Outlander lacked the responsiveness you’d expect when you press the gas pedal. Mitsubishi addressed this issue and new model is much more responsive compared to the previous year models. Ride comfort is also better.  Although not significant, improvements to the interior and the steering wheel are also adding to the overall improved appearance of the interior. 2016 Outlander is fun to drive. Although the the third row seats are not ideal for adults, it serves its purpose when we have to occasionally transport 7 people in a single car.I’d say there is room for more improvements. However, this is definitely a step in the right direction for Mitsubishi. Hope they keep improving the Outlander to make it even better. I feel that the SE model offers a great value for the price you pay for the vehicle.",4
3217, on 09/01/15 09:40 AM (PDT),Jon ,2016 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),The 2016 Highlander SEL is well worth a look," I've now had the SUV for 61,000 miles and it's still going strong.  Everything is holding up well.  No squeaks or noises in the cabin, which I really appreciate.  The Rockford Fosgate sound system seems to sound even better after a few tweaks.  I'm getting new tires this month, the original tires have worn well, no complaints. I find it to be a very capable commuter with great mileage for it's size.  The grand kids love riding in the third row seats....for now...once they grow a bit, it's a very tight fit back there.  I still would recommend this vehicle for those who don't want to spend a lot of money, but need the full size and good mileage.",4
3218, on 07/26/18 12:18 PM (PDT),chris ghengeaua ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),don't buy this brand," i've owned two (both V6 models...bought brand new from their dealers..2016 and 2017).  reliability is horrible...i though ""made in japan"" is the way to go....but to my surprise it's been very bad. Components failing, assembly issues, poor design. I lost the brakes while driving ...pretty scary. ABS pump was leaking and took air into the brake system....brakes got soft out of nowhere. Brake fluid leaked all over the engine bay and sub frame....peeled off all the paint. Took alot to get brakes fixed but all paint damage was ignored. Mirror broke, interior parts started squeaking and rattling (no offroad driving). All doors started getting stuck or misaligned. Too many issues to describe.  Based on my experience dealing with Mitsu USA,  the company has such a small foot print in the states that they don't quite have the financial resources to back up their flashy warranties (10 years)....they don't have the financial backing of a big company with large funds...and that comes through in all the dealings a customer would have with them....from the sale staff, to financing to service and warranty claims....to the quality of the product itself. At all steps , you feel like you're dealing with a mom/pop business....very low grade....as if the company can't afford any better.   As far as warranty and repairs,if it is not a minor issue, they do not even what to hear about it. So between a subpar product and crappy service, one should look else where. I live in a large city and the local dealer has one service rep and one mechanic. Imagine having to have major repairs done there.   i wanted something different than the usual honda and toyota....but i found out first hand why this brand is almost disappearing  from this market....their products are not in the same league as the ones from the other more famous manufacturers. I was ridiculed when i chose this car by friends and coworkers.....now i can't argue for it anymore.   I wanted reliability...i did not get it...not even close. Other details on this car: in city driving, i was never able to average above 15 mpgs (on either v6 cars) ...driving with EXTREME light acceleration. I used regular gas (87) after testing the car for a few months with premium....no difference in acceleration or fuel economy (or any improvement in engine harshness). I believe under a heavier foot, the car would burn gas even more. Winter times (miami) with ac off , fuel economy 15 or worse. Cruising on highway....19.5 to 20 mpg average (with or without cruise control). I've had one car for 15000 miles and the other one currently has 2500 miles....neither has ever seen average fuel economy better than 20 mpg....EVER....regardless of gas used, eco mode or not, ac on or not. i've had oil changed on average every 3000 miles (every time i was in the shop with issues)....did not make a difference on fuel economy.   V6 is very slow unless...you shift gears manually and almost floor it....than is pretty fast and sounds much better than any 4 cyl.   Transmission is tuned for fuel economy...and engine is low in torque. This combines for dangerously slow vehicle. All this at sea level...i can't even imagine a customer up in the mountains.  No vents in rear seats is a huge issue in south florida....i've added ultra dark tints on windows to try and mitigate weak rear ac..but there is no substitute for actual . interior is quiet if you keep it under 80 mph.....large side mirrors get noisy at high speed.   Suspension is very floaty....80 mph cruise on a highway that is less than perfect is very scary...car bounces and shifts weight around making it difficult to keep in lane..at speed car requires your full attention...tall , narrow and floaty.  Long highway drives are tiresome for that reason. Suspension set up is good in the city... soaks up bumps ok at low speed. Sound system is pretty great...more quantity than quality but for the price is pretty good. Sound system is what sold me the car (also good financing terms).  Both V6 cars had a weird ""hesitation"" at idle when at a stop light....as if the engine was choking....though it was a defect with the car, but both of them did it , regularly. Idle at 600-700 rpms than followed by a sudden drop of a few hundread rpms...jolts the entire car...as if the engine stalled for a second.  This was extremely frequent....in both cars...all the time. Engine would never stop so i learned to live with it.  Did it just the same when running the recommended premium gas. there were lots of recalls with the car but that's with all brands nowadays...just an inconvenience having the car in the shop for days.  From a technology point of view, the car is years behind the competition...engine performance, fuel economy, handling, active safety. Active safety in this car is just a marketing tool....they don't really work...just little trinkets added to an aging car...not really well integrated into the car's systems. Thirsty v6 under powered by 4 cyl standards .",1

Where do I even begin...paint, door handles, seat material, windows and door and window seals all CHEAP.

After owning the 2017 Outlander SEL for a week, I think I’m a customer for life.  Seriously, ignore the so called expert reviews.  They point to things like acceleration and inadequacy of the engine and fuel economy.  What they don’t realize is that most people aren’t using this car to drag race with.  For the normal everyday family, this car can’t be beat.  It’s whisper quiet, gets amazing fuel economy, and drives smoother than any car or suv I have ever owned.  I don’t even know what side of the car the gas tank is on because I haven’t had to fill it up yet.  It’s easily the best bang for your buck.  It feels much more expensive than it is.  It has awesome features like awd, Apple CarPlay, heated seats, etc.  It’s also very nimble and fun to drive.  I would recommend this car to anyone.",5
3223, on 03/22/18 12:34 PM (PDT),Michael Lacy ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Had em all," I have had CRV EX-L , Legacy sedan, Toyota 4-runner Limited, and now the 2017 Outlander GT.  Pound for pound it wins hands down.. Great ride, smooth engine, 24-31 mpg depending on the type of driving.  Do not listen to those asinine reviews stating how it doesn't stop like a M-5 Bimmer, handles softer than Corvette etc.  They are correct because it is just a very nice, smooth, nice handling and quiet underrated SUV.  My wife has a Lexus GS-350 AWD and believe me she loves driving this Outlander.  Couldn't get her in the 4-runner only under duress. The only thing I don't like is the power lift gate.  I've on 20K on it and still can't get used to it.  Acts like it has a mind of it's own.  As soon as the warranty is gone I most likely get another GT.  It is well worth it.

This car is indeed a hidden gem! It handles great on the road, not to mention that the acceleration is decent and reasonable for a car with V4 engine, not like what so-called experts say 'kind of sluggish'. I owned and drove many different  makes and models in the past, including Honda, Toyota, Mazda, KIA, Hyundai, Ram and Ford. Mitsubishi and Ford are the best cars I have driven thus far. My Outlander drives so smooth on the Interstate, and very quite - the level of road noise is much better than Mazda or Honda. Also, once a while we need a couple of extra seats for a short trip. The fact that Mitsubishi Outlander comes with a third row seating, it serves our purposes. Overall, I've been completely satisfied with the way this car performs.",5

It's only been two months but I feel like I drive a luxury vehicle for almost half the price!! The dealership is outstanding! I had a leased Mazda CX-5 and the Outlander blows it away! And I pay $15 more a month and I own it! I liked the Mazda CX-9 but never drove it as I was not paying almost 50k for a car. I stumbled upon the Outlander and I was very pleasantly surprised! Yes the third row is only really for kids. I had to sit back there once but we didn't pull the middle seat up. If we had, I think I would have been fine. And the acceleration is great. Don't listen to that review. It has a sport mode. If you want an extra kick just push it over to your ""S"" mode! It has great pick up with this mode. So so many features. I have the premium package but basic comes with pretty good features. The car even has snow mode for the SAWD and lock mode for more blizzard conditions, Apple car play, leather. It's endless!!! Don't be fooled by Mazda when they say they are the only ones with blind spot monitoring because the Outlander has it. The safety features and warnings are awesome! The side mirrors fold in - press a button if you want to do it when you park or it does it when you lock it. It's crazy!!! Sticker was 30k. I had some negative equity and I literally financed 29k. Absolutely do not look past this SUV! Even if your dealer is a little far away. It is totally worth it for only two - yes two oil changes per year!!! A++ now go buy it!",5

3231, on 12/20/17 02:36 AM (PST),Glenn M. ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Great Vehichle and Overlooked," 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander is one of those mid-sized SUV that most overlooked. Took home a new 2017 Outlander over a week now and so far I'm very pleased with the purchase. I've had driven multiple SUV's in the past and its a must to have an AWD/4WD here in the US northeast part of the United States. One of the best decisions I've made this year has to be purchasing one of the Outlander and glad to get rid of the 2017 Jeep Cherokee only driving the vehicle just over 2 months. I did own a 2015 Highlander (great SUV, terrible in gas mileage), 2016 Crosstrek (too small and not much power) both love these SUVs but I needed something affordable and at the same time have the luxury feeling and performance of a V6. The Outlander is pretty affordable and have the looks and the ""techie"" stuff inside. Also, the warranty is one of the best out there with 10/100000 miles coverage. Highly recommend the Outlander to those seeking affordable and reliable SUV. The only complaint I have at this time is the 3rd row seat does not have much leg room, but if you just have more than 3 kids then that wouldn't be an issue because my sons just love to sit in the 3rd row and they seem pretty satisfied with it.",5
3232, on 12/15/17 11:13 AM (PST),John Ho ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"Zen to drive, Zen to own."," We test drove everything in and near the compact to midsize SUV segment and were surprised and most impressed by the Outlander and bought it after test driving everything else from the Rogue to the all new Tiguan.  Update: We still could not be more pleased to be driving the Outlander SEL AWC. No regrets, not one. Every part of this review still holds up, about 1 year later. It's a really functional size, has good visibility, and gets 25-30mpg consistently which makes it great for commuting and being the family car. It's a car you like to spend time in. It shuts out the traffic and drama =zen.The quality: The Outlander really showed a pride in craftsmanship and engineering that was steps above the rest. It is quiet, relaxing, well built/thought out, and is very sure footed. Engine: On paper, 166 hp doesn't seem like it'd be enough but the transmission does an incredible job of putting the power to all 4 wheels and it actually felt faster than many of the 200hp + vehicles we test drove in our search. 70 mph mergers are no sweat.The Outlander is light while being sure footed and has a very strong chassis made from a proprietary Mitsubishi Steel alloy and you can feel it.The Outlander being a 2017 IIHS Top Safety Pick was icing on the cake and piece of mind.The cvt transmission: is shift point free in auto mode, very smooth, and absent of the delays in acceleration found in transmissions with gears. It reminded us of the LEAF. It keeps the engine in the powerband and isn't limited by set ratios. The Outlander's 4wd system is simply incredible and keeps the Outlander in control in the snow/ice without drama. Off-road, this thing is very very capable. I took it up a loose gravel 40% grade at a crawl and it just went up it without pause even getting one wheel off the ground from a rut! On the stock all-season toyo tires! Impressive.Interior usability is good: The 2nd row seats slide and adjust and are great for car seats. We keep the third row folded down mostly (it disappears into the floor) but if you are under 5'11"" it's actually pretty comfortable. You can put two child seats in the middle and left side leaving the right middle row seat open for access to the third row. You can also put 5 high back boosters in the 2nd and 3rd rows without much drama as well should the occasion arise.  The engine had way less plastic engine parts than the Nissans, Toyotas, or especially the VW which the entire front engine was plastic)This is the stuff that degrades after 120k miles... ya know, out of warranty.This is a well built vehicle that is fun and relaxing to live with everyday.",5
3233, on 12/07/17 15:21 PM (PST),cl ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Went from good to best!," As every dollar-minded car shopper today knows,at least baby-boomers like us,the most bang for the buck is very important,especially with cars.Last year I decided to trade om 2009 kia sorento,which I loved,for another suv as we have grandchildren and like to take them for long rides occasionally whenever we can.We wanted another newer Sorento but decided to test drive a Mitsubishi when we learned the drive trains of Sorentos were actually made by Mitsubishi.Traded for a 2016 Mitsubishi outlander 2.4 4 cyl.Drove it for a year and a half but just wasn't happy with what I thought was a lack of power on big mountains,we live in the Ny Adirondacks and powere is essential.So while having an oil change done at dealer last month,11-17,i test drove a 2017 outlander 6 cyl,with a few more bells and whistles and a third row of seating for grandkids.We loved it!Arranged to trade for the new car that day and when they found the color I wanted a few days later (pearl white),we signed,Very happy with the trade,getting around 23.5/26 highway on regular unleaded.Hope to get even better when we go cross-country next summer.Have leather seats,back-up camera,710 watt stereo system with 3 month Sirius xm satellite trial subscription,not sure if i'll keep that,but we love it.With the bigger engine,we can tow a small boat or camper now.Got 4k in rebates and couldn't be happier!",5

Budget drove me to look at the Outlander.  All the consumer reviews were pretty good, so I pulled the trigger.  Once I got past the more luxury aspect,  all is good.  For half the price of the Nissan,  cannot be happier now.  For a 4 cylinder I am amazed, cruises at 80 smoothly and still has acceleration, up mountain roads at 75 no problem.  Tight solid feel in the cockpit.  Leg space was only glitch for me, my big leg rests against the console, just have to deal  with that. For practical around towner and possible trips to the trailheads with lots of cargo space, giant warranty, and in 20k range, no brainer.  Sales folks were great, no bs.....I hate buying cars and this was not that painful, very happy with purchase.",5
3236, on 11/20/17 10:46 AM (PST),Ibrahim ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),There should be more on the road!!," Was on the market for 3 row SUVs with good gas mileage. We wanted the 3rd row only few times a year when our extended family visits us, so we did not really care about the 3rd row leg room. Like others say, the value for money in this SUV is incredible. This is what I would pay for other sedans. Remember this is a efficient family hauler, not a sports car, nor is it a SUV loaded with unnecessary creature comforts. I am a hypermiler, and if are one, this is the SUV for you. I always clock 31 + mpg on the gallon when I drive. The CVT transmission is not designed for aggressive drivers, but for those who drive sensibly. When others drive my car with a heavy braking/ acceleration, they got 25-26 combined mpg. Road visibility is great, the safety features are also awesome. I have lived in the middle east where Mitsubishi Pajero's (Montero) are legendary. I see that Mitsubishi has integrated some of its class leading AWD (they call it is Super All Wheel Control) into this SUV. Other awesome factors (84 month 0% finance, 10 year powertrain warranty + lifetime powertrain warranty from dealer, etc) made this a no-brainer buy. Remember that this is a unique class in itself (bigger than the RAV4's/ Tuscon/ CRV/ Rogue) but smaller that the Highlanders/ Pathfinders/ Traverse; which is why some of the experts confuse themselves while reviewing this SUV).",5
3237, on 10/30/17 08:11 AM (PDT),Mike ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV ES 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Not worth the money," We have 8,000 miles on the vehicle and so far have already received 2 recall notices from Mitsubishi Motors. The first one for faulty door latch components and just got another yesterday for defective relays involving the engine control unit. If the relay fails the engine will stall while driving and cannot be restarted. If the relay for the engine valve lift control fails, it limits the available engine power. If the relay for the radiator fan fails, the engine may overheat. We brought a vehicle that we thought we could rely on and with the recalls we are now in doubt. Because there are no local dealers in our area we have to drive 4 hours for a 1/2 repair or more to have the recalls taken care of. I'm disappointed in the reliability and lack of dealers. For the time we have to spend driving and the expense to get the recalls taken care of we do not feel that this vehicle is right for us and do not think I would recommend this vehicle to someone else.",1
3238, on 10/04/17 08:06 AM (PDT),John White ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV ES 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Bought another one!," Best value for your money.  Good looking vehicle.  Had a 2016 with 14K miles with no issues whatsoever.  Liked it so much, We bought a 2017 also!",4
3239, on 08/19/17 04:23 AM (PDT),norfla71 ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),"I agree; do not listen to paid ""expert"" reviews."," Just bought mine last night; traded out of a 2017 Jetta S and what a difference! Frankly, I wanted the Outlander first but got a better deal on the VW;  however, a good deal is not that good if you can't live with the car daily. We needed something bigger for road trips and box store runs that would fit a family of 4 and 2 dogs. After 3 days (2 night test drive included) we are over the moon, as they say. Had I listened to any number of negative reviews, rather than reading actual, real world owner reviews, we would have paid several thousand more for much less vehicle. The pros are awesome MPG (averaging over 35 combined, but I drive to keep the tree green), lengthy standard features list (especially in SEL trim, which is why it we chose it over a cheaper SE), comfort (front seats, ride, NVH; my 7 mile old Jetta already had a nasty rattle in the driver's door that no dealer could fix), great ingress and egress, very good infotainment system (base system rocks; IMO not worth upgrading to the optional system), easily garage -able and very good value for the dollar. The cons are mostly nit-picking; that smaller size limits interior space. However, we bought it knowing that 3rd row was not going to be used, and needed more space than the Sport model had (Sport also cannot tow, and we need that capability). It lacks all the current active safety features, which are included only in an expensive package. At least BSM and RCW should be standard. The camera lines do not turn unless, again, you upgrade to that expensive package, which included 360 surround. You have to take your eyes off the road to scroll through SXM folders as the wheel control will only scroll through what's on the current folder. Finally, there needs to be more info available in the dash. Even basic vehicles these days come with a minimal TFT screen, and it would be nice to see what's playing on the radio or what speed my CC is set at. Overall, as another review said, this is an undiscovered gem in a crowded market. I'm hopeful the Nissan really infuses some cash into this brand, and can't wait to see what the next gen will look like (though it will, most likely, also compete in a higher price bracket, taking another affordable option off the market).",4
3240, on 08/02/17 12:23 PM (PDT),J Harvey ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV GT 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Severely Underrated and a Tremendous Value," After much research I narrowed my choices to a Subaru Forester XT Touring and a Mitsubishi Outlander GT.  They both seem to have the best AWD systems in their class.  My first choice was the Subaru, especially coming from a 2013 XV Crosstrek, but I couldn't justify the additional expense over the Mitsubishi.  The biggest advantages the Forester had over the Outlander were steering feel/handling and resale value.  However, I prefer the Outlander's traditional 6 speed automatic over the Forester's CVT.  I also find the front seats to be more comfortable.  The Outlander's build and material quality is top notch.  I haven't found one flaw.  Engine performance is strong and the fuel economy has been surprisingly good.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  You really can't beat the value here for what is truly a quality vehicle with excellent safety ratings and best in class warranty coverage.",5
3241, on 06/20/17 13:20 PM (PDT),Kristen ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),A hidden jem," I was concerned bc I haven't heard a lot about the outlander from people I know -  no news is good news.  I needed the 3rd row in a small SUV and the Rogue seemed too tight and blah interior. that's how I stumbled upon the outlander.  What I want is comfort, great mileage . Reliability in the snow , attractive inside and out, and a good price  The outlander delivers!I’ve been an owner 14 pmonths now and I still love my outlander! So roomy and I love the heated steering wheel in the winter!",5
3242, on 06/11/17 23:31 PM (PDT),Rick ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Great Value," My wife and I were looking for a third row SUV and were shocked at the sticker prices on most of them.  I had previously owned a Mitsubishi Lander and loved it so we decided to check out the Outlander.  After some negotiating we got the SEL for what they were asking for the ES and it was a deal to good to pass up. This is now my wife's everyday car and out family car on the weekends and we couldn't be happier.  While the four cylinder does lack the get up you'd like in an SUV the MPGs more than makes up for it.  We get 30+ MPG on any interstate trip; It feels like weeks between fill ups, and as much as we drive that's saying something.  The push button start and keyless entry means looking fooling with keys is a thing of the past.  My biggest complaint is the lack of places to put stuff like my phone.  Most vehicles have nooks or something to put your items in, they forgot about that when designing it.  All and all we couldn't be happier.  We would recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for an SUV who isn't looking to tow anything.",5

I drove both the 2.4 and 3.0 version, settled on the GT with touring package. I have previously owned Saab's, Audi's and still own a Honda. There is just no comparison of value for money - I fit three kids in the 2nd row, and yes the third row is smaller than my Honda Pilot, but manageable for the few days per year I really need it. Safety features are outstanding and work in real life driving. Ok, it doesn't drive at the same level as some of the new BMW/Acura/Mercedes models I tested - but realistically I am getting 90% of what I would utilize from those cars for 50% of the price. For my daily commute and moving kids around to and from school and weekend road trips this is an amazing car. I recommend people to actually research AND test drive this car - many people will find it surpasses most of the competition in value, performance, comfort!",5
3245, on 04/27/17 19:01 PM (PDT),Will Deal ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV SEL 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Real Review," I purchased the 2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SEL trim with the SAWC. It's a 4 cyl, and that part of the deal makes the vehicle light on performance. It's got this grind when taking off from a dead stop if you're on the gas, and in my honest opinion its just slow. The vehicle does offer a lot of bang for the buck, but not in the performance department. It is a stylish vehicle and i like that. The tech is outstanding! You'd pay a lot more cash for many of the standard options that come with the vehicle. If I had to do it over again I would not buy the 4 cly, I'd get the V6 hands down which is about 4-5G more. That may have come down some since I purchased mine back in December 2016. Oh, the paint is another problem. You will get paint chips when you first hit the road. I have the cosmic blue and the paint chipping stands out like a soar thumb. I plan to buy the hood protector, but Mitsubishi could have done a much better job with the paint coat, at least for the hood area. Trust me that issue really ticks me off. Like others have commented it is a very nice vehicle for the money, but look around before you buy this vehicle. I would recommend the vehicle to anyone is looking for nice standards, reasonable cost, outstanding warranty and a great stereo system this car get's five stars in those categories. Mostly everything else is about middle of the road, and performance is not great.",3

3247, on 02/07/17 14:36 PM (PST),Jason K. ,2017 Mitsubishi Outlander SUV ES 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Exactly what I was looking for in a low-cost daily," Update (8/8/17): I've driven this car over 10,000 miles now, performed multiple oil changes which are comparatively easy, taken her on a 3,000 mile road trip through the mountains and down the coast of California, and loaded plenty of cargo she probably wasn't designed to haul (brick, wood, etc.).  She's handled it all like a champ with a few exceptions.  First, the trip panels over the roof mounted seat belt and other miscellaneous interior trim pieces are easy to knock out of place and rather difficult to fit back in.  Second, if you store anything in the hidden storage compartment, you have no access to it unless you're not hauling cargo.  Third, with the 60% middle seat folded flat, the cargo storage area between the front seats only opens part way.  These are all tiny complaints but good to know, nonetheless.New things I've found that I love are as follows: With the back seat cushions folded up (step 1 in folding them flat) but leaving the seat-back in place, the indents are a perfect place to transport a propane tank and you can even strap it in with the belt.  It's almost like Mitsubishi wanted it that way, it's fantastic.  I transport 2 tanks at a time to the propane store with no worries about getting the upholstery dirty or the tanks damaging bits in the back while rolling around.  Second thing is that if you move the front passenger seat all the way forward, remove the head rest, and recline the seat all the way back, then fold the 2nd row seat-back down (skip step 1, folding the cushion up), it creates a 2 foot by 8 foot area to transport 8 foot long lumber.  It still won't haul a 4x8 sheet of plywood but it'll handle 2x8 strips and any 8 foot lumber I can fit in there and that's fine with me.Original Review (2/7/2017): I knew going to the dealership what the pros and cons were of this vehicle but I desperately needed to replace my 15 year old daily driver with something better.  I weighed the options and considering that this is the 3rd car in our driveway and didn't need many bells or whistles, so I chose the ES model for its overall value.  I truly enjoy driving this car everyday and it does exactly what it's supposed to do, get me from point A to point B with zero issues or worries.  She's a very nice looking SUV, has plenty of room for cargo, drives perfectly sound and true, isn't to loud, handles the elevation changes like a champ, and is very comfortable including in/egress.  The trip computer is nice but sometimes a little goofy as is the radio but it's nice that it has a 6.1"" touchscreen with bluetooth standard, not many cars include that in the lowest trim level.  I got a great deal on the car with the help of a pre-approval from my finance company and I've gone from filling the tank once a week with premium fuel to filling it once every two weeks with mid-grade fuel.  I'm very aware that many people will have complaints about little things but as I said initially, the total value and amenities provided by my Outlander are exactly what I was looking for in a tidy and attractive package.

It certainly is not the fastest, however it's not a dog either. It turns heads of even the higher end enthusiasts with its exceptional looks and the fact that there's not as many around as Mustangs which are a dime a dozen. The 1999 SL from what I have researched is kind of a rarity since they made less than 200 available for purchase. I hope this model increases in value as time goes along. I am keeping mine in mint condition and putting little miles on it by only driving in the summer occasionally. It handles the curves really great. I have had no problems except replacing the driver's seatbelt as it was retracting to slowly.

I have a budget and wanted a car with a reasonable price. The headlights look like a jag and the doors have indentations like a viper. Since I'm a girl it's aggravating not having man hands to check under the hood. I don't drive it everyday but when I do it is puts myself in total bliss.

I bought it in late 99' and saved $12,000 from the original $36,500 retail price. It has just over 40,000 miles on it now. I have not yet had a single problem with this vehicle.  I'm 6'2"" / 190lbs. and I do fit in the car fine, but someone taller or over 250 pounds would likely not be comfortable. The back seat is pretty much useless unless you're driving around someone under the age of 8.  The performance on the SL is decent overall. The handling is great, It's a little slow off of the line, but better than the average car out there. Stock it has 220 HP, but I recommend getting a filter intake performance kit to knock it up to 230-240HP for under $100. It looks great!!",4.625

If you're going for looks, get this car, if you're going speed, get the turbo.  This car turns a lot of heads with its looks, and $2,000 dollar rims.   When I bought mine it had a 3 stage pearl white paint that was in excellent condition, a huge rear spoiler that looks great, and leather interior.  It's slow off the line, but that could be just do to the automatic transmition.  It comes with an economy/power switch, that helps the performance a bit.  Personally I prefer the looks over the performance.  Overall in my opinion this is a great car and it was worth the $12,000 cash that I paid for it.",4.75

I know it's not the VR-4 or the SL, but hey, look at the bright side (with gas prices like they are, I can use 87 Octane, while those models require 91 Octane).

Even though it is a little heavy with AWD and all wheel steering, acceleration is fierce at 5.3 sec/>60 mph. The VR-4 is well built and very dependable. I bought mine new and has 71,000 miles now. Although the car is expensive, you get more than you paid for. Even in wet weather, the car never fish tails or slips its tracking around corners, thanks to AW steering. Yes, the rear wheels turn up to 15 degrees in proportion to the front wheels steering. The 320 HP rating can be increased relatively cheaply w/intake and exhaust mods to 400 HP!  ",4.625

With the radio controls on my steering wheel, I never take my eyes off the road. It feels comfortable on the road. It pulls real hard on the take off when the pedal is to the metal.

The only problems so far were the rear brake calipers went out on it and the exhaust downpipe. But other than that it is a great car, quick and reliable. It is a big car, though, clearing in at 7ft wide and 14ft long. It sticks to the road.

This car gets me all over Texas as well as a daily commuter. The only negative I can say is it randomly won't start but then will fire right up. I thought it was a fuel filter but much to my surprise this car only has one in the fuel pump in the gas tank? Upgraded the sound system and w/ Bluetooth makes it one awesome lil car. ,4

I've had two prior generation lancers and they all were highly reliable, with minimum repairs and breakdowns under severe use. The car is very safe and sturdy - uses very strong steel.

Also the appearance package is a must, it gives the car a great aggressive look. The leather wrapped steering wheel has a great feel and quality to it. I think there is plenty of pickup to the 2.0.

The ES comes standard with many nice features such as steering wheel mounted audio controls and alloy wheels. You don't need to spend a lot of money to get a great looking Lancer.

However, I've found that the perfect combination of these features exists on a Lancer GTS, with all three available packages (sun & sound, technology and touring). Sure, it hasn't got the power of a GTI, but who redlines their cars on a daily basis?

Since winter started the rear door windows are taking FOREVER to defrost (over an hour) and interior parts are rattling (locks on the doors, back window, silver stripe on the passenger door). We called the dealership and they told us there was nothing they could do about the rattling or the defrost issues as when it gets cold that's what happens. Nice response! ",4.375

I really liked zipping around in this little car during the summer but then winter has come along and I can honestly say that this is the worst vehicle I have driven in the snow. The car does have decent pickup but I think it could use a little more HP. If you live in a warm climate and want a fun little car to zip around in then this one is for you. My best mpg is 29 on the highway and I usually average around 17 in town. Seats are comfy but the ride can be rough at times also.

I kinda wished I had gotten it but I couldn't justify the extra cost.  As far as the performance, the car is quick and handles great.  The tires seem to be the limiting factor.  Everywhere I have looked people criticize the Dunlops for their lack of traction, especially in the snow. The car is comfortable and drives great.  The gas mileage is awesome.

It's relatively quiet, it has a fair amount of power and never feels slow on its feet. The thing that sold the car for me was the ride. It's never choppy and I could relate it more to a big car then anything else in its class. The clutch and the transmission is very smooth and easy to operate and to me feels like a manual transmission should.

Highway MPG is very respectable, city isn't the greatest but isn't that bad either.

It felt like you were driving around in a shell, road noise permeated the cabin, stock tires were very poor. The car improved greatly when they were replaced with Toyo T1R's.

I wanted the Evo, but i didn't want to spend 40 grand on the MR touring. This car is a great deal for the money. You could take that 10-15 grand you saved and make it alot nicer and or faster if you wanted to.

Shifts are precise, engine is solid, turbo  is ample. Just a true joy to drive when you are in the mood. However, it's not a great highway cruiser or Sunday driver, it's a harsh and loud ride with little insulation and driver amenities.

Even with those, I'm saddened by the fact that I won't be able to buy a re-design model as Mitsubishi has decided to cancel the car for now. Pros: would be affordable, AWD, Blutooth works flawless, heated seats with cloth (i hate leather), and great handling. The biggest cons are the fact that while the 2.4L will get you up to speed and stay there easily, it's dull to drive and slow to respond because of it's rubber band effect. The 2.4L with a shiftable auto would have made this car loads of fun. Also the CVT used to be extremely jerky. This was remedied by getting the transmission fluid flushed, but I wish I had known that initially because it was miserable at slow speeds the first few years. Anyone buying used should immediately have the fluid flushed on it. Also road noise is not reduced in the least. All that said though, this thing eats snow for breakfast, handles road trips like a wonder, and is the best value car i've found.

The CVT is just fine in power! If you are not used to driving one, it may feel different. So in a with a regular auto transmission, a sign of an underpowered car is when u push the gas hard, you will see the engine RPM go way up but the speed lags until it up-shifts a gear.

My brother is still driving it. The 2006 Lancer feels much stiffer, has more power, interior room and should easily last 250,000 miles+ if maintained according to the owners' manual.

The Alternator had a service ticket issue which did make a weird noise for about a month before they called me. Thats all cleared up now. It has started every time. It handles well but feels a little boxy. It is not the most fuel efficient ride in its class, but 30 MPG on average for me isn't bad at all.

Mileage is okay but not the best (low thirties on highway). Handling is good for its class but you can find other cars handles as good if not better (Mazda3). Leg room in second row is one of the best but is it that important? When it comes to shortfalls the list is longer; Engine noise is something to pay attention. Interior plastics are not better than what you would find on vacuum cleaner (similar to previous generation US cars). Together with weak engine, CVT makes you feel dead.",3.125

I don't recommend the automatic transmission I read lots of complaints about a lack of power. But my 5 speed had plenty of power. In the end it proved itself to be extremely safe.

I also don't like the upholstery a kind of felt material that my dogs hair clings too.

First thing I notice, rattles came in pretty soon, about a month after purchase they came from the road noise and when I turn the music at near half power speaker grills rattle and doors to.

It is the CVT auto and I don't know why people say it doesn't have enough power, it's plenty and when I switch to the manual sports mode, it goes well enough.

I have had no mechanical problems so far which is a testament to Mitsubishi's renewed oath to quality. I would recommend getting aftermarket performance parts to beef it up.

There was absolutely no traction from the tires and when I called the dealership, they suggested I get snow tires to the tune of $1300. They did offer to mount/balance them at a discount, however I was very disappointed.

It is on the verge of replacing the Honda Civic, Scion tC and Mazdaspeed3 as the next tuner favorite. The CVT is a pleasure to have along with the other tech-worthy toys inside.

Being young and immature I drove it like a rally car the first 10k miles of its life. As I got more responsible and mature I began driving it normally. After getting married and having 2 kids it made a great family car. My wife now uses it everyday to make long commutes to work and school driving at least 150 miles a day. This car still gets great gas mileage around 27mph average, has never let me or my family down even at 80k plus miles. This car can take anything you or your life throw its way. All it asks in return is follow its maintenance schedule by the book and this car will do whatever you need it to do.... within reason! Highly recommended.",4.5

Even a minor problem can be very expensive to fix. The reason is the car is constructed in modules, like a lego set. If one little piece of the module breaks, you have to replace the whole thing. For example, the plastic door on the heating duct got warped. (This is a small plastic piece that moves to switch you from cool air to hot air.) Cost to fix: $3000 because the entire heating/air conditioning module had to be replaced. My mechanic told me the same problem would have cost $100 to fix on a Honda.",2.875

The only maintenance I have done is change the oil, had the belts changed at 100,000. I just had my spark plugs changed at $115,000, you think the dealer would have told me every 30,000 miles for the plugs, since that is where my oil changes are done.

It is extremely comfortable to sit in and fun to drive but not worth it anymore.  Also, as I work in a city and have to parallel park, my car gets bumped around a lot be less contentious drivers.

The only problem I have noticed is a delay in staring in the summer months...due to the higher concentration of ethanol in the gas.  It has no problems when driving, just starting.  I put in NGK Iridium plugs a few months back and that seemed to have corrected that.  If your not having the problem, I would not recommend those plugs, they are too expensive and the gain is minimal. Mostly though the car is a great everyday driver.  Comfort-wise, it's a very good deal for the money.

It replaced my 1998 Nissan Altima which had 217,000 miles and a fantastic service record, i.e., minimal problems and great fuel economy.

I am a medical courier and as of 9/20/2006 i have 200,867 miles on this little cracker-box car.  I change the oil (and filter of course) about every 5,000 miles, use only regular (87 octane) gas as recommended, and change spark plugs about every 30,000 miles using only the recommended ngk's (don't make the mistake I did by using other plugs).",4

It's been a solid performer so far, but it should be for the first 100,000 miles. Any car should. The car should have more horsepower. There's no reason it shouldn't be in the 160-170 HP range when the Rally version is well over 200. The gas mileage is disappointing, it too should be better. I've experience high 20s when traveling on the highway - it should be in the mid-30s at least. All in all, the Lancer is a half-way decent alternative if you cannot afford the Civic or a comparable Toyota or Nissan. My only other concern would be the automatic transmission.

It is a very reliable car with great gas mileage. Of course, gas mileage and horsepower are inversely related, so I don't expect a thrill ride when I punch it. However, the little 2.0 4-cylinder does have some pep to it, and has great throttle response. (It also does some nice donuts for front wheel drive :-D).

The Infinity audio is about as much as you can stand in a car (315 watts with subwoofer) and the sound quality is great, though I prefer to listen to the exhaust sound - the best sound I ever heard from a 4 cyl., especially if not revved over 4000 rpm.

I just wanna rip it out and paint it to match the gun metal-ish color surrounding the deck. Grrr!

I have had this car for about 2 years now, and have driven it really hard. The build quality is impeccable and its reliablity is outstanding.  My car handles like a race car and the more miles you put on it, the faster is gets.  Its gas mileage is reasonable considering the power and torque you get from the 4 cyl engine. I have had Toyotas and Hondas, and I feel that this Mitsubishi is just as good if not better, plus it has a 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty and free maintenence to boot.

We bought it with 12,000 miles on it and got a great deal. Unfortunately, we have already had it in for new struts, motor mounts,and the clutch is starting to shutter a bit. On top of that we only get on average 18-21 MPG with a mixture of city and freeway driving. We love the style and the handling. The power is OK.",3.875

Each day of the working week the car travels at least 130 km or around 82 miles each way to work and back, over 800 miles a week! The car is flawless in its reliability, performance and features. It's great to look at & has plenty of personality like its predecessor (a CE Lancer which we traded after a problem free 5 years and 200,000 miles / 320,000 km). We travel fairly large distances every year and appreciate the equipment, reliability & refinement that is found in these vehicles!",5

The suspension huges each turn. It doesn't have a lot of tunk space, however the rear seat is larger than other compacts I've been in. At first sight of the dash you think that its plain, but it works well and is easy to read (no hunting through 50+ buttoms). The seats look great and also are very comfortable. The ratings I have seen on gas mileage have been 23 (city) and 28 (highway) yet I have been recording between 25-28 (city); I even like to race to every once in a while and still get these results.",4.625

Using a G-force meter my best 0-60 time was 6.6  I just test drove a Chevrolet Cobalt SS and the best run I could get out of that pos was 6.7. if only more people knew about this amazing little car!

She's an immigrant who has never owned a car before.  So, I wanted her first car to be a special one.  Safety, ease of handling and parking, roominess, having good power but not too overwhelming, overall value, powered features like keyless entry, remote mirrors and such were very important features.  The Lancer LS beat the Civics, Corollas, Mazdas, Ions, Neons and Ford competitors hands down in cost, value for the buck and in standard equipment!  The competitors charge $1,000's more in options for what the Lancer LS offers as standard.  My wife loves her car and I drive it often too.

I was in the market to buy a compact car and this one is the best of its class. I can't help but smile every time I get behind the wheel. Allthough I think red is the best color to get because of the interior the black one that I got is equally as good. I love how it picks up on the freeway and how it eats up the Civic SI on the road and at top end.  The best investment I ever made.

I opted for the base ES, 5 speed, no options, but got most of the features I wanted anyway.  This car handles very well and is a joy on mountain roads; however, the base 14-inch tires are much to small and the Yokohama rubber offers no grip in the wet.

3652, on 07/11/15 21:39 PM (PDT),Mitsu63 ,2002 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),I wish I still had my Lancer!," I bought a used '02 Lancer ES in 2005 for $8k. It already had almost 100k miles on it and had evidently seen some use, as there was wear on both the steering wheel and headrests. I was looking for something to drive for a couple of years and then trade up. I am so grateful I didn't get around to carrying out that plan before the crash in 2008, because after that I was stuck with every item of value I already had due to not being able to buy new ones. My Lancer came through for me in a big way! I hardly did any maintenance on it at all, spent the bare minimum, yet it lasted me until 2014 and I racked up almost 250,000 miles on it. Towards the end things started breaking and that was why I ended up selling it - if I had been able to afford the new clutch it needed, I would probably still be driving it. Things I loved about my Lancer:Gas mileage! I was getting 33 mpg in mixed driving, I swear to god. Roomy and versatile - I used it to haul firewood, used it to move with (crammed all kinds of furniture into it), drove down dirt roads, up mountains and on freeways, spent inordinate amounts of time traveling in it, and plenty of time with the seat reclined taking naps at rest stops. Ease of driving - the clutch pedal is very light and took a minute to get used to, but once I adjusted to that it was easy to drive, very forgiving. Road feel was good, handled well, and a great turning radius. Safety - as much time as I spent on the road (I travel for my job) I had to make several panic stops and the car did great, kept me safe and unharmed. Bells and whistles - the Lancer had exactly the right combination of conveniences and simplicity for my taste. It had electric windows and mirror adjustments (not bad for a base model), a/c that worked great, a decent stereo with CD player, but none of the more fancy features such as headlights that turn themselves on and off, bluetooth, etc. that I personally have no use for anyway and find aggravating.Ergonomics - the seat adjusts in several directions and the steering wheel adjusts as well. Everything is within reach and convenient. The seats recline all the way back for those rest stop naps. My only complaint is the resistance on the heat/cold adjustment knob - it was a bit tight and the knob eventually broke. Power - for a little econo-sedan, it actually had a reasonable amount of get-up-and-go, and I could pull away from stop lights quickly if I needed to, pass people, and keep up with people in bigger cars when needed. I had it up above 100 mph on more than one occasion, although I wasn't really comfortable taking it much above that. Value - let's face it, these cars don't hold a lot of value but that means you can pick up a used one cheap like I did. Expenditure-wise, mostly all I ever did was put gas and oil in it, brakes a couple of times, timing belt at 150k, and some new tires every couple of years. I think I had to buy a set of windshield wipers once. Towards the end, it needed more done to it but it was up over 200,000 miles by that point. I loved my Lancer and would buy another one.",5
3653, on 07/24/14 01:50 AM (PDT),crazehen ,2002 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan O-Z Rally 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Brilliant little car," To be a successful economy car, the vehicle in question has to have two things going for it; reliability and fuel economy. With that said, the Lancer is by far the best car I've ever owned. It's been reliable as a rock and the engine can take a serious beating. It'll get 26 miles per gallon with your foot welded to the floor, and 35 while driving Miss Daisy across the country. Need I say more? Why not. On top of those things, it's also roomy, comfortable, the stereo sounds great, the A/C will freeze your hands off and the heater makes Hell seem cold. I took this car on a 3,500 mile journey across the country and it didn't give me any trouble. A bold claim for a 12 year old 165k mile car.",4.375
3654, on 06/29/13 13:09 PM (PDT),rod_1 ,2002 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 4A),Amazing car!!!, This car is overall an amazing car. We bought it in 2004 with 58k on the odometer. We used it for trips and put a heavily amount of miles on the car. This car has lasted us a long while until the radiator busted a hole due to the fan going out. The car had too many miles on it to even bother putting money into it but the car now has 275k on the odometer last time we looked and has lasted a very long while.

Eight years later, I have had no major problems with the car. I am currently at 145,000 miles and the car still retains the original timing belt!  Other than the timing belt, I've kept to the suggested maintenance schedule and have had no problems. With a regular waxing, twice a year, the car also has no rust. I would recommend for higher mileage cars ""Mobile Synthetic Oil- High Mileage"". I noticed that you get more power than other oils.  This is a low maintenance car, and I plan on having this as my daily driver for a good 200k-400k more miles. I believe this is doable with the lack of problems I have had with this car.

The gas mileage both in town and on the highway is great, but the best thing about the car is that the only maintenance it has required has been regular oil changes and new tires.

Only basic maintenance has been done because that's all it ever needed. I am quite surprised since it is a first year model. I have never had to doubt my safety in it and have off roaded in it despite the fact that its a sedan. I don't even avoid pot holes and after five years, still great suspension!

I'm a little different: Bought my '05 O-Z Rally used in 2012 with nearly 160,000 miles on it.  Knew very little about Mits cars and sort of held my breath because, well, it had 160K miles on it.  Five years and 55,000 more miles later, I've never breathed easier with a car.  Just passed 215K and it still runs almost flawlessly.  Not as powerful as a Ralliart, apparently, but I DID hit 108 MPH shortly after buying it and could've gone faster.  Gets about 31 MPG on highways, 25 MPG in town.  Engine's a little noisy, but not bad for a 4-banger.  Good stereo system, better after I put a Pioneer deck on.  Lots of interior room, especially in front, with comfy seats.  I've never had a real problem with it and it's a nice LOOKING car on top of that.  Considering how I was sort of rolling the dice when I bought it, I'm not sure I've ever had a better, more reliable car (and believe me, I've had quite a few).  I've been holding off on buying a truck simply because I can't imagine any of them will run better than this one.  Why try fixing something that isn't broken?",5
3721, on 05/10/16 15:21 PM (PDT),Cokey ,2005 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),Great Value Japanese Quality at Korean Prices," A nice alternative to the run of the mill Civic, Corolla, Sentra.  Much better car than the Korean ""run em' til they die"" Hyundai and Kia's.  A quality made in Japan vehicle.  And yes, sorry America, they do build better cars than us.  This is our 3rd Mitsubishi, my wife has had a Mirage and a Outlander Sport, I got this one for our daughter who's  in the military and then off to college.  I owned a 2002 Hyundai that I drove for work, and will never own another Korean car, they're fine new cars when they are under warranty; in the case of this Lancer I shopped for a used one with around 100k on it so I knew I wanted Japanese.  When you buy one with 100k miles on it get it for a price that will allow your budget to pay for a new Timing Belt and Water Pump Kit($600 at most shops) and replace the Spark Plugs and put a new Valve Cover Gasket on it($150).  People get rid of their cars at 100,000 and they hardly ever pay out for a Timing Belt Replacement(manual states 100k), if they break your engine is totalled(interference engine = valves and pistons collide).  And if you cant afford OEM Mitsu parts, get a GMB brand kit.Good acceleration, handling, braking; at least for an economical 4 door basic sedan.  Engine design is proven and somewhat simple.  The biggest complaint with this car, as with most ""Mitsu's"", is the interior controls are fairly cheap and break easily.  Don't worry, you can find replacements on Ebay or at your local salvage yards.  Overall, I consider the 02 to 07 Lancer's a 4 out of 5 star car.  I bought mine for $3600, put $800 into it, now have a $4400 car that my daughter informs she likes driving.",4

I went into the dealership to get my Eclipse's dashboard fixed, and while waiting I just started browsing the Lancer's and decided to take one for a test drive.  What a difference between the Lancer and my Eclipse (GS 2000).  The Ralliart has a nice stiff suspension that feels great going into curves, as well as the steering feels extremely direct.

The power steering is making an unpleasant noise now as well. The headliner makes a buzzing noise when the road is smooth, worse when there are bumps in the road. We have noticed from A-holes in parking lots that there are no protective side moldings on the doors so we have a couple nasty dings in them now. There is a huge delay when operating the HVAC controls, dangerous when you are trying to clear the fog from the windshield.

It lurches about dramatically especially when cold. Taking foot off accelerator produces sudden jolts, sometimes quite violently, and it then seems to want to brake on its own and slows down rapidly while coasting. Braking often produces a sensation like the car is fighting against the braking and wanting to surge forward. This is the weirdest drive I've ever had and have had no support from Mistubishi - the first 1500km service last week I gave the dealer a very concise report on this problem, and they had the car for TWO DAYS.

3774, on 07/02/17 13:51 PM (PDT),Rob ,2016 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan ES 4dr Sedan AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Great Car- Easily Overlooked," Lets be real about this review.  This is a compact AWD car for around $20k.  This is an all-around excellent, fun to drive car.  For what you pay and what you get there is no equal. This car is easily overlooked in favor of other small foreign cars and this includes the Subaru.  So far no mechanical issues  (40,000 miles).  I have a 2016 ES, AWD with the 2.4 CVT.  I love that the technology in the car (or lack of). It's simple and in some ways , ""old school"".  Controls are laid out well and easy to use.  Visibility is excellent!!  I am a smaller person and never have an issue checking my blind spots or backing the car.  The 2.4 engine delivers very nice power especially at highway speeds.  I personally find the fuel-economy to be very good.  If you put things into perspective and consider the following;  2.4, CVT (automatic) with A/C and AWD. Then I think 30 MPG is outstanding!! I don't know why other reviews on this car suggest fuel-economy is sub-par.  I find it, in fact, to be rather good.  I don't care for the CVT automatic.  I think it holds the engine performance back too much and it never allows the engine to happily-rev to the red line, instead it allows for a leisurely stroll around the tach.  Also, the engine tends to operate in the same range of about 1500-2500 rpm for almost every driving condition.  I find myself forcing higher rpm from the engine, just to get it out of that operating range.  By the time I can get to the extra power it's no longer needed.  So I find this to be pretty disappointing.  For lack of better wording, I also find the engine trying to ""lug"" from time to time, especially if climbing a grade after starting from a stop.  This is among the worst CVT transmissions I have ever used.  It is far from smooth and VERY slow to respond to throttle changes.  Mine does tend to ""jerk"" from time to time, and has no problems letting you know it's unrefined.  For the AWD system:  I have yet to encounter any serious snow conditions. Most of the time it's the usual 2-3"" of snow/slush on most main roads and a few secondary roads and the AWD system is flawless.  However, I did have the opportunity to drive the car in approx 6"" of snow on secondary roads during the past winter.  The car performed well but there is room for improvement.  I did notice a bit of wheel spin from the rear wheels under the worst conditions.  This is more than I would like for an AWD car.  it slips and spins in deeper snow but it did not get stuck and seems capable.  I'm not sure I would take this car off road either.  Also to note -my car came with ridiculous ""traction B"" tires that I quickly replaced to a more appropriate tire for my area.  (be VERY careful in the rain with these OE tires).  Overall, I'm very pleased with my car. I purchased mine brand new and so far no serious problems. It fits my budget, seems reliable and meets my needs.",5

I don't like the new front bumper design but can live with that. Paint with Mitsubishi has always been an issue so you must stay on top of the waxing. If you step up and pay a little more from the 5spd stick you get lots of extras. I really liked my wifes 2015 but I love my 2016. We will drive these for 10 yrs and then pass them to the grandkids.

3777, on 09/12/16 13:55 PM (PDT),Allen ,2016 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan SEL 4dr Sedan AWD (2.4L 4cyl CVT),Big Mistake," I was excited to purchase the Lancer because it offered a sporty styling with AWC at a reasonable price. After owning a 2016 Lancer SEL for a little over a month I hate the car. Driver ergonomics are deplorable: - Leather seats that are uncomfortable (I feel like I've been sitting on a metal folding chair after a 20-30 minute drive. Lower back support and seating side support is almost non-existent. - A dead pedal foot rest gives no room to stretch out my left leg. The only way to extend my left leg is to put my foot under the brake pedal - not a safe thing to do - or keep my leg bent in a very unnatural position. The alternative is to move the seat back which then leads to over extending to reach the steering wheel. - Move the seat forward, and the center console arm rest no longer exists. - Without a telescoping steering wheel, arms must be almost straight to reach the wheel. (Note: I am an average size, 5'9"" male driver) - The clock is so tiny and so far away from the driver, it can barely be seen. Put on polarized sunglasses and the display screen for the clock, back-up camera, and entertainment system become almost impossible to see in daylight. - Move the tilt steering wheel down, and it covers a good part of the speedometer. - A tiny collection of icons between the tach and speedometer are busy and difficult to decipher at a quick glance. The fact that the outside temperature is part of this tiny display clutters the display and is not convenient for any passengers to view. - The self-dimming mirror is a joke. Street lights ""trick"" the sensors into thinking it's daylight and the result is blinding glare from the rear view mirror. - The sunvisors are extremely flimsy. They seem to be nothing more that plastic covered card board. And there is no extender on the flimsy visors for when the sun hits at just that annoying ""over the shoulder"" angle through the side window. - Significant lack of storage space and small cup holders are major inconveniences. - Leather seats and steering wheel are made of a rough texture leather - not supple or smooth. - At highway speeds, road noise is quite loud. - Headlights also seem dim compared to my previous two cars. Added to these horrible ergonomics, my car features a ""thump"" in the trunk when going over some bumps. The car was ""delivered"" with 17 miles on the odometer - dirty on the inside and outside, including pine sap blobs that ate through the clear coat. The dealer's fix was to have the finish ""wet sanded"". After 3 weeks I had a loud thumping in the driver's side rear quarter panel. Had to schedule an appointment with service department. The back-up sensor was banging around inside. They ""fixed"" it with double-sided tape. Only one ""outlet"" in the entire car; no usb port. Radio/entertainment center sounds very tinny and cheap. And the horn sounds like something that comes from a child's tricycle. I am SO sorry that I purchased this vehicle.",2
3778, on 10/03/17 04:20 AM (PDT),Justin Greer ,2017 Mitsubishi Lancer Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl 5M),So far I am happy with the purchase," I picked a black pearl sedan right off the semi truck's trailer. The first thing you may notice is the seats. Mitsubishi did nothing to the comfort of their seats on this one. I would not say they are uncomfortable, but it is something that you get used to. My biggest grip about this car (any other mitsubishi's) is the paint durability. I have a 2011 lancer as well and the paint just chips so easy from road debris. I recommend getting a touch up pen in your purchase. The car runs great (just as my 2011 with CVT) but mine is a 5 speed and the shifting sync must be out our not broken in yet. Shifting into gear sometimes can be sticky and be jammed completely.  I will be making an appointment to see if the dealer can have a look just to be sure. Overall, I am happy with the car. I got a great deal on it and the manufacture warranty is crazy good.",4

It has a cushy ""Cadillac like"" ride from the air shocks (pillowy I call it) and is surprisingly quick when you punch the throttle. Excellent brakes have saved my ass numerous times. A good looking truck though the bulging fenders get you dirty if you're leaning in to put something in the bed. Sometimes there's a ghost in the machine's electronics (cruise control sometimes works, sometimes doesn't). It has that annoying steering column problem these models have ($1300 to fix it, no thanks) that squeaks and clunks. The company should do a recall as I refuse to pay that much to fix it. Visibility is poor as the A, B and C pillars are thick (due to the 4 door cab plus configuration). It gets crappy mpg which is weird as the engine purrs along at only 2500 rpm on the highway (16-18mpg highway, 8-12 city). Quiet and easy to drive. I'd buy another because of the excellent used pricing and it has held its value since I purchased it in 2012. Well my dept is paid off so we'll see if I decide to keep it. Looking at Honda Ridgelines but boy are they pricey. I'd recommend the Duro Cross model, which is what I have.",4

The handling has been improved vastly, and the new version is even lighter then my previous.  1997 Dakota weighed in at 5,480 lbs w/ V-8 & std. cab and Raider is 4,287 lbs w/ V-6 and extended cab.  Being 1,200 lbs lighter and only 20 HP short of my last, it accelerated very nice, and the economy is better, although like all of us I'd like to see it a little better.

My husband is long waisted. The Montero has tons of headroom and legroom in the front and back. The back door opens and closes like a car door - we'll never hassle with a hatch opening again.  Our friends & family are sold on it as well.  The back seats fold down for lots of storage.  The 3rd row seat is handy for kids. Its gas mileage is decent.  It is not cavernous like the Chevrolet Trailblazer though.  It has good visibility. It is better looking than the ""dog"" Durango, but not as expensive as the Toyota Land Cruiser.  One bad thing about this truck is that we have spent thousands of dollars on regular maintenance. We'll consider that next time.",5

In 2003, I purchased the 20th Anniversary Edition and have not regretted it.  I get better gas mileage than the sticker that was on it said I would.  My co-workers love to have me drive for lunches as they have so much room.  Due to my lower back problems, many of the SUV's were too bouncy for me.

The exterior styling is attractive and the interior is just plain beautiful with high quality materials and design layout.  It will haul a ton of gear with the back seats down and go almost anywhere.  I am pleased with the acceleration, braking, handling and fuel economy (about 21 mpg on long trips).  Check it on Edmunds.com against the other 2003 competition, like the Ford Explorer, Dodge Durango, Chevy (any of their SUVs), Nissan Pathfinder and even Toyota 4Runner.

I've had great experiences on hwy, beach, back roads and fields. Only thing I'd change would be the alarm system. Buying another brand SUV tonight but if I can find a way to fix my old dog for a few $ I would love to keep her around- I like the look and the ride. ",4.875

The 24 valve engine still has a lot of life left in it.  Like all Mitsubishis, it smokes from its seals, but with a quart of that stuff Pep Boys sells, the smoke goes away. I put a slightly higher tires, 265/70/15, on it and it drives better. I am so happy with my Montero I bought a second one (a 2006 Limited).  It is a great vehicle for the money.  I paid $26,000 for mine in 1997.  My other choice would be a Toyota 4Runner, but the price was around $5,000 more.",4.75

The track record of the Montero speaks for itself when it comes to reliability. I traded a Land Rover Discovery for it and the Montero is by far a better SUV, inside and out. The 4 wheel drive is similar to LR with the locking differential, but much easier to engage and disengage than the LR. The exterior design of the 2000 year is a unique one-of-a- kind and a cross between the old and new style (2001+). It is still truck like, but is one of the most capable SUV's off road and on.

It's quite on the freeway, it has plenty of power to merge on the freeway, viability is also really good. The seats are comfortable too, and best of all the family is happy, my wife wants to steal it from me. It did have 2 manufacture recalls, one on the headlights and one for the gas tank if the vehicle should roll over. Both fixed by the dealer, I had them check out the suspension, shocks and everything else, they said it was all original but that everything was in perfect working order. I just put new brakes, tires and hose's and drove it to Santa Fe New Mexico from Phx, it was a nice 1400 mi round trip for our family of 4. A lot of people complain about milage, and I will say it's not the best, but I'm good with it. This SUV is better than my 98"" Expedition when it comes to milage and it's easy to maneuver. I'd buy it again.",4

He really enjoys driving this car because it was his favorite car when he did his research. For me I love this SUV. If Mitsubishi would add a V8 then the gas mileage would be much worse. But since it's a V6 you can actually add parts to the engine to make it faster. The best thing about this Montero is the moonroof it has. It's very big and stylish. You can also add stepbars to make it better looking and much easier to get in. No problems. Mitsubishi did a nice job on the Montero. But the 2003 and newer look uglier now. Also you can and I recommend install an alarm with car starter.,4.875

Since then it has had: a blown head gasket, 5 alternators, 3 batteries, a water pump, and camshaft seals.

The front end tends to shift back and forth as if there are aerodynamics & traction control issues. Electrical system does crazy things. For example, doors lock by themselves.

The car looks good to me and its engine, drivetrain and handling are very smooth and predictable. I have not experienced any mechanical problems so far after 15,000 miles. The car has an adaptive transmission feature where if you hop on the gas, it downshifts quickly and holds the shift point to a higher rpm.

The car is roomy, even fora big guy like me, very spacious.  It'snot as fast as I'd like it to be but thelooks cover that.  The car looks great. I like the light-up dash speedometerthing.  Back passenger windows go downall the way.  I also like the mirrorsattached to doors, something differentfrom other cars.  Another thing I likeabout this car is it does have windowframes, it may be a bad thing after awhile but I love it.  Thing I dont likeabout it, it's kinda slow at 200hp andback seat doesnt go down.  Overall, thisis a great car.",4.625

The Diamante has surpassed all my expectations, the car is luxurious, lots of standard extras  sometimes I need some engine power to get out of difficult road situations. This car has all the power needed and then some. The traction control has saved me a couple of times also. ABS is also there. The gets 20.5 mpg average. And this is a luxury full size sedan with 3.5 liter engine.  I got it with all extras for less money than the added cost for the same extras alone in another brand. Go figure.

Priced well below its competitors.  LS loaded with features.  Great engine.  Interior ergonomics are comical.  Surprisingly little thought put into switchology.  Can't see speedo behind wheel. I just can't get comfortable in this car, as nice as it appears.  Poor city  mileage.  Troublesome brakes.  Have redone front brakes twice in 20,000 miles.

The car is very reliable, inexpensive to own, gets great mileage (20-24 city and 32-38 highway depending on my lead foot). The engine has a lot of power if you need it to. Taking turns sharp will automatically throttle the engine to keep you from losing control (did I mention my lead foot?).  Interior comfort has really spoiled me on other cars. I have recently car shopped with a friend and wasn't happy with the interiors of newer cars in comparison. My only complaint is the leather is Black.

If you buy after 8-1-04 the second owner gets the balance of the 5 year or 60,000 mile coverage.  I also like the way it looks.  It has all the features of a more expensive car.

It has problems starting even after i replaced the starter but she runs. Smooth riding car. I used to have a 2011 Kia soul and my Diamante handles a lot better. I wasn't expecting a nice engine but I'm amazed at how nice it is. One big problem i have with it is 3 of my door handles are broken. I know someone who had the same problem with theirs. Another small problem i have with this car is it feels a little cramped on the inside. My knees want to rest on the wheel. She's old and needs some more work done but for a $1200 car with 125,000 miles on it I'm very happy with it. ",3.25

I love its look, the way it (used to) drive, and the driver comfort.  As the years went on & I put more miles on it, of course, more went wrong with it.  It's down right now, needing its third alternator.  It has over 197,000 miles on it, though, and overall, I'm pleased with its life performance.  It has a power steering problem (seems like fluid leak) that neither of my mechanics can fix.  In the last 3 months, the steering has also become a bit less reliable - you have to turn the wheel more if you round a curve at over 35 mph.  ",3.5

So far I've had it for few months and no problem at all as far as maintenance. The only issue I have is the antenna makes this weird noise when I turn the radio on and it doesn't want to go down when I turn the radio off. The paint in the back if oxidizing but I think the previous owner really never took care of the waxing part. It's a fun car to drive with the luxury feel to it. I recommend buying one.,4.75

My car went into a spin and hit a concrete sidewall at about 35-40 MPH. It bounced off the front and back left bumpers before stopping. The only damage is to the bumpers and lights.

I live in Colorado and the 210 HP engine will keep the car accellerating all the way to the top of the Rockies on I-70. The digital climate control works great, the factory stereo sounds awesome and the only thing I've had to replace on the car is the brake pads. Mileage I get is about 20 cty,  30 hwy.

I still think it looks very sexy and up to date looking at it from the front / front quarter. it has always shimmied a little and the air conditioning makes a little more noise than I like when at a stop.  No one notices this but me and the dealership says both issues are common for the car.  At 85,000 miles I began noticing the transmission sometimes slips.

Once I got into college I took more interest in the car since I knew I needed a car that would last me into the beginning of my career.  With a nice wash and wax, this car gets me compliments everywhere I go.  Take care of this car and it will take care of you.

4276, on 09/26/06 06:55 AM (PDT),MarkPenner ,2000 Mitsubishi Diamante Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,Happy with my Diamante," I purchased my 2000 Mitsubishi Diamante in Dec. 2003. I did a lot of online research before purchasing and found that most of the people complain about its fast depreciation, but praise reliability of the car. I was looking for a good used car, so fast depreciation was a good news.  Why pay $36,000 for a new, when you can get a great used car for $12,000? So, I found a Diamante with 55,000 miles online and drove it home. For two years that I owned this car I just did regular maitainance (oil, transmission fluid, brakes, put new set of tires). I had no problem with transmission, it shifts perfectly. I didn't have any problems with the heat-core either. I spent only $480 in maintainance to keep this car in excellent shape for two years.",5

I couldn't find a similarly equipped toyota Camry or Honda Accord for my $9,500 budget. A few months later, the heater core O-ring failed and coolant started leaking into the vent system. The fix was costly, about $1,100 but the car has been running without a problem since. The Diamante has lots of power under the hood, the acceleration is good but the transmission gets confused sometimes i.e. downshift may not happen immediately when you need a quick boast.  The interior is quiet and its ride quality is somewhere between good and excellent. The Diamante is clearly more biased towards comfort and doesn't handle as well as my previous Mazda Millenia ",4.375

I've always liked the styling of the Diamantes, and you get a really nice car for a reasonable price.  The only disadvantages I've observed are their poor resale value, and some components could be of higher quality.  For example, I was told at 38,000 miles that my struts were going to need to be replaced soon.  (However, I haven't replaced them, and it still rides fine.)  The other quality issues were more cosmetic in nature, like a trim piece that peeled.",4.5

The last one is the famous heater core leakage problem.  Just google for ""Diamante heatercore"" and you will see It is a known problem and Mitsubishi knows about it but is not doing anything. This problem costs $700 - $900 to repair or you will be poisoned inhaling antifreeze.  Also, the 60,000 mile service costs $1,500 for a car not worth even $9,000.

4405, on 09/01/18 01:50 AM (PDT),Brian ,2018 Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross SUV LE 4dr SUV AWD (1.5L 4cyl Turbo CVT),Mitsubishi is back!," I just bought this SUV in the beginning of July so I had it for about 2 months now. The first thing your gonna notice is how sexy this thing looks depending on the color you get. I have the metallic gray and is shines just like the diamond red. The vehicle has nice black accents and black 18” alloy wheels. It also has tinted privacy glass on the back passenger windows. The performance is really good and the engine is pretty powerful together with the CVT transmission. The interior looks very nice and the seats are comfortable enough for longer trips. The back passenger seats recline and can be adjusted just right for child seats. They also fold down to the point you can put boxes and other wide items through the back and sides. All doors open wide and you get a lot of standard safety features that other expensive SUVs don’t. Apple car play and Android Auto is nice including a trackpad for navigating the 7” display up front. My only complaints is the way the vehicle turns sharp corners which has a little more lean then what I’m used to. Maybe it’s just me coming from a Lancer, but I would take it easy on the turns. The back window is split which gets in the way when you look through the rear view mirror, but you do get a backup camera so thank Mitsubishi for that! I would have liked some buttons for navigating the touchscreen but I guess that’s where these companies are going. I got used to it but I don’t know how old school people will react to it. There are 2 more trims levels above the LE but I feel for the price that I paid, I should have gotten heated seats and a sunroof. Other than that it’s very sporty, roomy, and good on gas so I feel like a made a good decision overall. I will do another updated review in the coming months if anything changes.

I needed and wanted a car that got good Gas Mileage.  I was not looking at a mirage G4 at first, I thought I wanted a Hatchback or small SUV, I was looking at the outlander, then i tried the Mirage HAtchback, it was ok i was impressed by the gas mileage numbers, but thought it was a bit small for what i needed, so then I was shown the Mirage G4, I looked at many models before settling on a ES with several options, I wanted entertainment and comfort and great gas mileage. Thats exactly what it offers, great leg room and you sit up higher than you think you would, getting in out is a breeze. It has apple car play, android auto, bluetooth, DVD, HD Radio. I have gotten as good as 49 Miles per gallon, and average around 43, I mostly drive the interstate back and forth to work. I also Coach Soccer and trunk space is exceptional in this car. I have cut my gas bill in half and i really enjoy driving this car.",4

It is a great little car gets amazing gas mileage has lots of room and is really comfortable the front seats are very supportive. All the passengers I have been surprised by how much room and how comfortable the rear seats are. The 3 cylinder does a good job getting the car around and I can easily pull 44 on a long trip. It is a very solid feeling well built car.,4
4409, on 05/25/18 12:18 PM (PDT),Nikki ,2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (1.2L 3cyl CVT),"Great for first time purchase, not for comfort"," As a young adult buying my first brand new car, I was attracted to this car solely for its price tag. It's super affordable, both in terms of buying brand new and in gas savings, but definitely nothing special. For a tiny 3 cylinder engine, it accelerates pretty well. For being so light, it definitely doesn't get blown around quite as much as the comparable hatchbacks. However, the interior is very cheap and far from stylish. Lots of space between the seats, and the center console is in a very awkward place and might as well be nonexistent. The touch screen radio isn't very bright, so it is difficult to see even when turned up all the way during the day. Eco boost kicks on at the most random times and makes the car feel as though acceleration is slipping. A decent purchase for first time new car owners, but probably not the best investment if you're looking for a car you'll love driving for many, many years.",3
4410, on 02/11/17 18:31 PM (PST),CEM ,2018 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 Sedan SE 4dr Sedan (1.2L 3cyl CVT),2018 Mirage SE," After owning 4 of these, 2 hatchbacks and 2 sedans, One was a 5 speed manual, rest were the CVT. The only warranty claim on any of them was a cracked armrest on the door. The manual is more fun to drive and get more MPG. Only problem is if you want a loaded car you are forced to get the CVT. Reviewers online hate the car ( Consumer Reports, Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, ect) but owner give it one of highest consumer satisfaction ratings among its class. Why is this? Well, Mirage owners get what this car is about, great MPG without dealing with the  expense of buying a hybrid, Great warranty, Above average reliability, Great safety ratings, Cheap car to insure and maintain. Smooth ride, VALUE FOR THE MONEY. No other car manufacturer could come close on price. Example was the Nissan Versa, its was 3645.00 more money, had half the warranty. Don't pay attention to the sticker price, find out what the dealer is willing to sell it FOR! If your main concern  is going from point A to point B no one can do it cheaper than a Mirage.  My big concern now for Mitsubishi is Nissan owns the majority share now, Hopefully Nissan leaves Mitsubishi alone !",4
4411, on 04/03/18 09:21 AM (PDT),Lamar ,2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (1.2L 3cyl CVT),A Certified Bucket," Maybe because the particular car I was given had sat in a warehouse for an undetermined amount of time, but I am not thrilled with this car in the least. It is LOUD, the engine, however good on gas mileage it is, makes noise - a lot. All the time. It feels like the car is going to explode when you accelerate. It has some pep to it once you've reached freeway speeds but don't attempt to perform any overtaking maneuvers or creep onto the freeway - this car cannot handle it. The engine is so loud that you have to drive around with the volume pretty high on your stereo just to drown it out. Speaking of the radio - it turns off without warning. Having the car for 7 months, I've figured out that it doesn't like being hot - you can't park it somewhere on a warm day or in direct sunlight and expect the radio to turn on when you return to your car. If you are out running errands - let's say you go to the gas station, then the grocery store, then pick up your kids, then go to a park...by the 3rd time you turn the ignition, the radio will not come on. It's dead for HOURS. I've done this several times and sat in traffic for up to 90 minutes with no radio. In addition to that, the gas gauge isn't accurate. I've filled the tank up on numerous occasions and watched 20-40 miles disappear on the digital display after driving less than ten miles total. I don't feel safe in this car, it's like driving a soda can. There are better cars available for the money.",1
4412, on 01/12/18 14:47 PM (PST),Val B. ,2017 Mitsubishi Mirage G4 Sedan ES 4dr Sedan (1.2L 3cyl CVT),My little Blueberry," I purchased this car because I passed on my 07 Endeavor to my teenager, and it was time for a gas saver.  I fell in love with the Sapphire Blue, and the model already came with the smartphone display package installed.  I do all of my travelling in this car.  I wish it had an arm rest, but I can survive.  It does get a little shaky in high winds, I just decrease my speed some.  Acceleration isn't the best either.  It is big enough for four people without being cramped in. The trunk is huge for the car.  We had our first wintry mix and I decided to take the car instead of the Endeavor.  It handled better than the SUV.  The traction light never came on and it braked so easily.  No spinning or sliding when I took off.  I love my G4 even more!!",5

The milage is unreal... coming from a Nissan truck... I filled up after 300 miles with $19.75 of gas.. and ran it all the way down to see what would happen.. the gas gauge (whole thing) flashes in its final gasps.  I didn't run out of gas though.. and think I had a gallon left.  Road noise a little loud.. drives like a very small car but still.. for my new commuter it's GREAT!  Again, coming from a truck, it handles very nicely.. agile.. and I love the reliable BT connection and it DOES play my podcasts on Audio Blu-Ray disk format (or through phone).  It remembers where I left off!  Other cars do NOT.   I average 38mpg.  38mpg x 9 gallons = 342 miles.  More than my 21 gallon truck that's for sure!  Roomy and spacious.. like the Tardis.. it just looks so SMALL from the outside.  Trunk huge too.  Super happy.  Time will tell on reliability but I have a lifetime powertrain warranty.  Bought it at 8000 miles.",5

I traded my 2015 Mitsubishi Mirage ES CVT with Navigation and the updates are extensive.  The interior on the 2017s has so many upgrades such as seat fabric material, interior piano trim, seat support, sound insulation, new gauge cluster, new steering wheel, new audio unit with apple car play and android auto, 4 more horsepower and a new roller cam shaft, new suspension updates, smoother idle, fender insulation, heated seats, auto dimming rear view mirror, wide angle rear view camera (G4), rear fold down arm rest with cup holders and even the way the shifter feels going into gear is much smoother.  The updates are amazing in making this car feel more substantial.I got the Light Gray interior which adds a level of class to the interior.  I added a center console arm rest, color keyed bodyside moldings, side fender turn signals to go with side mirror turn signals, chrome exhaust tip, extra piano black trim around center console and air vents, chrome trim mind you all Mitsubishi Parts.  I also added weather tech mats and got my windows tinted 20% and it looks so nice.  The room inside the G4 is unreal, its huge and the trunk is cavernous!!!  I also love the dark chrome alloy wheels and matching front grill.  This paint color (Wine Red) is so unique and classy looking.  I had no issues with my 2015 and only traded for the upgrades and the deal I got on this 2017 Top Trim G4 SE.  It was $18,115.00 and I got it for $12,714.00 at Renn Kirby Mitsubishi in Frederick MD.  My sales guy was Tommy Moberly and he was awsome!  He responded to all my text and email fast and even after hours.  If you do stop in to Renn Kirby you need see him.  We purchased 2 vehicles from him and could not be happier!  We absolutely love our 2016 Outlander Sport GT and 2017 Mirage G4 SE!!! While driving in town the ride is much more quiet and takes bumps with less of a thud and the idle is 50% smoother and quieter.  The seats feel extra stuffed and the material is for sure much more premium feeling.  The Apple Car Play alone is one of my favorite features and props to Mitsubishi for incorporating that!!!Keep up the good work Mitsubishi because I am impressed with the updated 2017 model!!!  I will not drive anything but a Mitsubishi and will only purchase it from Tommy Moverly at Renn Kirby!!!

There are 3 good things about this car, the price, the gas mileage, and the warranty, that's it. It's better than walking, taking the bus, or calling Uber or Lyft to get around, but something tells me I should have saved more money or waited until tax return time to get a better car, but for my situation, it's what I had to get.

One winter (I run studded Nokians), it made it up the last 600' of my very steep driveway with 22"" of unplowed snow!  It took about four passes, but did it.  My driving is split between city and highway.  For mileage, I usually get 21 mpg in the summer and slightly less in the winter (studded tires).  This is not bad for a big SUV.  Of course, if you want to go 75 mph all day you won't get the same results.

The guy lied about some things, but I can't complain. And it was probably overpriced. It only had 156,000 on it and I've put about 600 on it.

I was upset to find out that this one doesn't have 4 wheel drive, but it did pretty well in snow and does great in rain. The only time I got stuck was in mud next to a drive way. The gas mileage is great compared to the smaller jeep I used to drive. It fits a car seat pretty well. It's hard for me to put him in just because it's a smaller space putting him in than it is in a car with bigger doors. Storage is great. Suspension is pretty good. Overall fantastic SUV.

It's been an extremely dependable and reliable vehicle for 15 years and 130,000 miles. Rarely has it been garaged or babied. It's driven 20-40 miles most days in all weather and is rarely off road. I keep up on basic maintenance and service like tune ups, oil, tires, brakes, etc but have let all the dings, scratches go. The transfer case shifts in and out just fine after 15 years of trouble free 4x4 snow and rain. Sunroof sometimes leaks if debris clogs the drip path. Engine still runs well without a noticeable decline in performance.  The only trouble under the hood was the A/C compressor went out in August 2014 during Indiana's hottest time of year -- I had heard it for weeks before it quit.  I finally had to replace the brakes rotors and calipers in 2014. The door lights don't turn on every time when you open the door and it doesn't always ding when you leave the headlights on or the keys in the ignition.  The Infinity CD player quit but the radio still works even though my wife broke the antenna years ago. It's getting rusty spots behind the wheel well corners. So far no wrecks. My 3 kids and I have spilled tons of drinks and food, but the interior is fine -- no rips in the leather. The back seat is a bit narrow for three car seats so and I had to buy Euro-designed car seats to fit three across. This was getting hard on the back and then we got a minivan. I still drive it anywhere like across the state line or farmers field and I plan to drive it a few more years. No regrets, I love it.",5

I've had a large number of problems with this vehicle. Initially it was a little oil leak, which always seem to take a while to fix.  After it was repaired, some lifters were getting stuck.  After several failed attempts to get this fixed, I ended up getting a new short block.  With that repair, they damaged the bolt that one of the tension pulleys is mounted to, causing it to shear off a month or so later.  Now I have additionaloil leaks, from the head gasket to the cam plug o-rigns.  Other issues include poor shifiting from 3rd to 4th when accelerating quickly.",2.875

It has now become my favorite car ever. It looks great, performs well, and my brother, a professional mechanic, said that it is in amazing shape for a vehicle of its age. It is probably underpowered for towing, but that's not what I wanted it for. It has about the same pickup as my old 4 cylinder Outback, but with the increased size of the car and the 6 cylinder standard, I'd say that's pretty good. ",4.375

That was the golden era of SUV's, so I was surprised he picked the Montero Sport. Since the beginning, it's never been a ""wow"" car. The interior is extraordinarily basic. Looks very outdated now. The exterior looks cool, but not as cool as other SUV's from the same time. We took trips across country with it and it never gave us major issues. He passed it down to me two years ago with 147k miles. He never did major work on it. Routine stuff like brakes and fluids. But I think he replaced the entire rear axel because it went out. In the past two years I've replaced the thermostat, valve cover gasket, alternator, battery, struts, tires and spark plugs. After 150k miles that kind of stuff is to be expected. Never had major issues with the engine or transmission. Mitsubishi reliability is pretty good. The ride height compared to the wheel base is a little off. It's tall and narrow so it gets sketchy at high speeds. They come with a torsion bar suspension so I raised the front 1.5"". It sits much better and even fits 31"" all terrain tires. It's pretty reliable and has nostalgia to me because of the road trips we took with it. I even named mine ""Monty."" I've contemplated selling it but the resale value is atrocious. It's worth it to me to keep it. Most of the ones you see on the road are beat to hell. So find one that's been taken care of and has low miles. This is a basic SUV so don't expect luxury or anything over the top. But if you're looking for a good budget SUV, a Montero Sport is a decent choice. It would also make a great first car.",4

Having just turned 140,000 miles, I can honestly say nothing has gone wrong with the car, it still gets around 19 MPG combined, and I've only done the recommended maintenance.
