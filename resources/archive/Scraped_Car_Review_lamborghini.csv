We have a Ferrari La Ferrari and a BMW i8, but this car beats both of them by far! Super fun to ride and show off in BV Hills. Not for everyone, but the acceleration is insane! Although it is expensive for the average buyer, if you are into super cars and have the budget to afford it it's totally worth the price.",5

The extra money spent on the Murcielago is really worth it!! The Gallardo (baby Lambo) is nice and performs well but feels like the cheap version. The Murcielago is something they went the extra mile in! The quality, fit and finish and fun factor are a few that makes it #1.",5

The engine has had a few thousand dollars worth the problems in the last few months, the exterior design is a little boxy, riding comfort isn't spectacular. The performance is amazing obviously, really throws you back in your seat. Paint chips kind of easily. The shift is smooth but my tranny has already gone once. Gears wear down a little fast. Needs better brake pads, I've been replacing them every few thousand miles. Gas is horrible, but I couldn't give it a 1 because it IS a 12 cylinder.",3.75

The first week I had it I was dissapointed to find out that my neighbors EVO Lancer could keep pace.

This car is defintely a cross between the countach and the diablo but with nextgenration styling. many features like the headlights being higher then the center hood and the fold out ""batwings"" come from the Countach. I don't give it a high rating in fuel economy (DUH) but who cares! This car is so fun to drive I have tried to keep it in show room condition but it's too hard to resist driving!

But of course it's worth it when you press the gas and your at 60 mph instantly.

The huge tires and all wheel drive ensures that this car sticks to the ground in every situation.  But probably the must understated feature of this car is that it is very easy to drive in everyday situations, and is not only intended for performance car use like prior Lambos.  That is the key difference between this car and many other exotics I have driven or owned.  I am very, very happy with my purchase.",4.625

33, on 02/28/05 19:28 PM (PST),Dominic ,2005 Lamborghini Murcielago Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.2L 12cyl 6M),MURCIELAGO LACKS COMFORT & FUEL ECONOMY!," The Murcielago is without doubt one of the most aggressive and entertaining prestige vehicles out there in the market today, but like most genuine sports cars, needs improvement on its fuel economy and interior comfort. However, unlike the Enzo or Carrera GT, both of which are both just  as pricey, the Murcielago holds true to its Lamborghini heritage and power. Personally, having driven this car for nine months, I feel that it has strong thoroughbred performance, sleek styling and comes equipped with race-quality Pirelli P Zero ROSSO tires. On the downside, the seats are a bit too hard, the center console proves to be difficult to operate at times and the steering gets twitchy. ",3.75

I almost got into an accident because the car just swerved to the right by itself.   I took it to the carshop, and they said there was nothing wrong with it.   The next day it wouldn't turn on.   I kept trying for hours, and it still wouldn't turn on.   The next day, it turned on and drove for a couple of miles, then it broke down, and I had to get it a new motor.   What kind of car would need a new motor, 5 days after you got it brand new.   If you want to get this car DON'T DRIVE IT.",5

Let's face it, many people can't afford these cars. In all seriousness, this car is fun to drive and the exterior looks are awe inspiring. Interior, on the other hand, is very tight and uncomfortable. Again, if your looking for comfort buy a Mercedes. This car was designed for sheer speed.

There were only 30 manufactured in year 2000 and 10 sent to the US. The Lamborghini exterior color is Titanium Metallic finish, but the biggest difference on the inside is the two tone leather interior with a mix of grey and black leather. Another feature is the use of a clear carbon fiber rear spoiler mounted on this Millennium Metallic Roadster it looks great. The drivetrain was coupled to a SV-type Bevel gear type differential with a 1 to 2.53 ratio giving a phenomenal driving experience.

Improved horsepower, AWD and very exotic lines--a real head turner. Frankly, more fun to drive and the e-gear is a must! Design allows to be a daily driver if that's what you want. And last...the sound--there is nothing else like it and you'll have to hear it to understand.",5
62, on 05/30/09 13:05 PM (PDT),Bonvillain ,2008 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (5.0L 10cyl 6AM),Wonderful Car," The 2008 is the last year of the original Gallardo, several deficiencies from earlier years were addressed and overall it is the greatest car I have ever owned. The e-gear is great (although not quite as good as the 09 560-4 that i recently drove) and I was always a 6-speed guy. Only real issue I have is all the attention it draws....but it's a Lamborghini, so I suppose it comes with the territory. I am surprised by the one negative review, cause ultimately calling a 200k car a 'good deal' seems flawed from the start...gas mileage stinks, they are largely impractical and wicked extreme in nearly every way...but it's a Lamborghini!!! and it's wonderful.",4.625

Lamborghini did not change anything.... The shifter gets stuck sometimes, which gets me very frustrated.",2.125

65, on 12/11/06 11:46 AM (PST),lotus ,2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe SE 2dr Coupe AWD (5.0L 10cyl 6M),Kristen's pride," This car is the best car ive ever driven its fun, fast, and handles like its on rails. not to mention the reaction it provokes amongst onlookers.  Audis design of the interior makes this car a lot more driver friendly. Be prepared for the extra money for proper maintenance and VIP parking.",4.375

I've owned this for 2 weeks and am extremly satisfied with this car. The handling is great, the power is awesome, this car is flaw less. I highly recommend that this be a car of your choice. ",5
67, on 02/18/06 12:35 PM (PST),dte23 ,2006 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (5.0L 10cyl 6M),bat out of hell," What can I say but, it's a Lambo! This machine handles like it's nobody's business, and don't get me started on the acceleration. The Egear is very responsive. You get an adrenaline rush just from starting it up. The styling makes it look like it flying down the road when it's just sitting there.",4.75
68, on 05/27/08 11:21 AM (PDT),Exotic driver ,2004 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),An excellent machine!," This has been the best handling car I've ever driven. It is amazing in corners, in the rain, and on the track. Nothing significant has gone wrong in 10,000 miles except for the A/C. People love to see the car out and always compliment it and ask about it.",4.375
69, on 02/17/08 09:11 AM (PST),recon40 ,2004 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),Supercar," My car had 6800 miles on it when I took delivery. It was a one-owner car. I've yet to put a thousand miles on it but I already know what I like and dislike. Hitting bumps and even road seams is like being inside a drum, and it feels like there are no springs or shocks whatsoever. Also, in slow, tight turns such as in parking or turning into and out of my garage or driveway, the car makes a grinding noise and actually shudders. It feels horrible --like the transmission is going to fall out, yet everyone -- dealers and other owners -- say that all Gallardos do that. It's hard to believe a car of this quality can have such a worrisome, annoying characteristic. ",4.25
70, on 12/28/04 21:13 PM (PST),David Cabrera ,2004 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),Best Car ever, The Lamborghini Gallardo is about the best car Lamborghini designed. It's performance is great and I love the 0-60mph and topspeed that this baby could achieve. For the price of this Lambo I think it's just right compared to the Ferrari 360. I like its sleek lines .,5
71, on 08/15/04 00:00 AM (PDT),Mr. Q ,2004 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),Value for money," If you are looking for great value for money then look no further. The surefootedness of AWD coupled with side & head airbags makes this a safe year-round supercar. Not quite as refined as a Porsche Turbo or on par with the superb handling, sound, excitement and outright dazzling performance of the 360 CS, this still is a quite capable machine for all four seasons.

I, myself am a Lamborghini collector, and love this new sporty Gallardo! It may not be as fast or as expensive as the Murcielago but is still one of the best cars around. You might compare this to a Ferrari 360 or a Porsche 911! It is deffinatley up in the rankings! Trust me... you will not be disapointed with this new Bull!",5

76, on 05/07/08 22:40 PM (PDT),Nera 78 ,2007 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (5.0L 10cyl 6M),Italian bull, I bought the Nera Gallardo. Changed exhaust but now its too loud for any phone conversation inside! Goes over 150mph effortlessly. Brakes are amazing at high speeds but too hard at low speed. Ride is not harsh even for long drives. Not an everyday drive as one gets tired of all the attention and everyone from sports motorcycles to trucks want to race it. Gets around 12- 14 mpg (who cares). Corvette may be cheaper and numbers may be superior but how many of those do you see in a day?,4.625
77, on 11/23/05 21:33 PM (PST),Gallardoguy1 ,2005 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),Gallardo Ultimate Practical Exotic," Have owned every brand of exotic car available. Many are more expensive than Gallardo, but I have never experienced a car that was so much fun to drive and so responsive!  Acceleration figures in the press must be off. Gallardo definitely out accelerates anything in it's class.  Heard all wheel drive gave the car a strange feel. To the contrary, it makes the car more stable and able to handle turns far better.  Put approximately 1500 miles on the car in less than a month, including track time, driving to grocery store, to dinner, and anywhere else I find excuse to drive it.  First exotic I am comfortable using as every day car! German quality, Italian style - unbeatable combination!",4.75
78, on 08/20/05 18:52 PM (PDT),Tifoso ,2005 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),Don't buy a Ferrari," This vehicle is an awesome driving experience everyday in all traffic conditions. It has so much more power and responsive handling characteristics over a 360 or 430 Ferrari. The car is a wonderfully reliable every day driver. Rear vision is a minor problem when backing up, but is easily fixed with a rear camera installation. It outperforms every Ferrari I have ever owned and has spent NO TIME in the shop other than for regular scheduled service. It is a BLAST!!!!!!!!!",4.75
79, on 06/17/05 10:40 AM (PDT),alex allan ,2005 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),My car of my dreams," When driving this car there is not another thing you can think about apart from pure driving pleasure. If you have got the money to afford a car like this there is not anything to compare it with. If you want a pure sports car with pure power, this is the one you are looking for. The lamborghini gallardo is the best thing that has ever happened to me. ",5
80, on 02/17/05 21:16 PM (PST),Giovanni ,2005 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.0L 10cyl 6M),A Beautiful Execution," This is the best car I have ever owned. In the past, I have owned and driven many cars, but it had always been my dream to own a Lamborghini, and now I can drive it. Incredible handling, tight steering, and the interior is as nice as any other car Audi has built- not something you see very often in a car of this prestige. No doubt, it's an expensive toy, but for a car enthusiast it is easily worth it, even if you are concerned you can't afford it. The design is beautiful... the trasmission is perfect... honestly, there is nothing else like it.",4.5

From R8's to M3's to 911's to XKR's. I couldn't imagine what i was in for when I test drove this car. There was no chance I couldn't buy it. The looks. What more can I say. It is a piece of art that you get to drive. The looks you get are priceless. It is definitely an attention getter - which isn't great sometimes. With Audi designing the interior of the car it is finally up to 2012 technological standards. Great audio system. Great shift and accelerator response. Fun to drive. Permanent smile for the rest of the day if you get a drive in with the top down.",5

Fast enough to bring to a race track. Fun enough to make you feel like you're on a roller coaster. Sexy enough to turn heads everywhere. Expensive enough to make it unique without making you question its value. This is the car that people dream of owning.,5

85, on 05/25/08 02:52 AM (PDT),Lamborghini Owner ,2009 Lamborghini Gallardo Coupe LP560-4 2dr Coupe AWD (5.2L 10cyl 6AM),The Perfect Vehicle," The Lamborghini Gallardo LP560/4 is the perfect automobile in every way! It runs great, and is significantly quieter than the previous Gallardo. The car also accelerates astoundingally, as the 552 hp powerplant is amazing. All in all, it is the perfect exotic vehicle in every sense!",5
