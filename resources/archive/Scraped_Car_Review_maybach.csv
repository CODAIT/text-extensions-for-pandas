I still have not figured out how to use the navigation system.  But despite the quality problems this car has great power and a blast to drive! ",3.375

Maybe it could use a more agressive look, but apart from that everything in it is just delightful",4.75

I have owned a 2005 fully loaded Maybach 57 since 7/2014 and I am parting ways with it today 8/31/2016. The car was mostly reliable, however when issues did occur do not be surprised with bills exceeding $5,000.00. A new alternator is $11,000.00 just the price NOT including installation. I used this car mostly for business purposes and closing deals on my business ventures, this car consistently blew executives and high net worth individuals away with its amenities dispute the age of the vehicle. Very high technology considering the year, however electronics were buggy during my ownership period. I would have several error codes and lights and then after some driving they would disappear but then randomly reappear mid-drive. Being driven in the vehicle provides a heaven on Earth sense of opulence unmatched by any other experience I have had. Beware of insurance, very expensive to own, operate and insure this vehicle. All in all I highly recommend this vehicle, stay ahead of the maintenance as I did during my ownership, baby the car and it will keep you cocooned in his luxurious trim. Have deep pockets for the upkeep and insurance costs, find a Mercedes expert outside of the dealership which will charge you triple the amount as a reasonable mechanic who knows what he or she is doing. I quickly stopped going to the stealership and opted for finding a Mercedes guru to take care of my vehicle. Today is one of the saddest days in vehicle ownership for me...I have to say goodbye, wife is pregnant with our first child and I simply have too many high end vehicles, this being the oldest I made the strategic decision to part ways... Goodbye Maybach, I will be repurchasing again within 5 years!!",5
7, on 05/18/07 13:28 PM (PDT),Owner ,2005 Maybach 57 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),Maybach 57," I have owned this car for nearly two years and it still performs as it did out of the showroom.  Excellent acceleration, excellent handling (for a 6000 pound, 20 foot long vehicle). It cruises the highway at over 100 mph with no wafting.  It feels as solid as a rock at any speed.  It is the best luxury sedan in the world.",5
8, on 02/18/05 01:19 AM (PST),Sergio Calderon ,2005 Maybach 57 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),stunning," My first trip was from Redlands, Ca to Las Vegas Nevada after deciding I would drive it seemed the car grew on to me like my s600 but in a larger version. It was truely an experience;  after the trip home the only work incurred to the vehicle was some good bug remover for the collection of bugs on the front end and a refill of waters and sodas to the fridge. It is most truely the flagship vehicle known to both man and Mercedes .The Maybach serves to be quite the coach with its asserting power of the V12 and ammenities to the executive or entertainer on the go it truly is great from its power and to its design.

This car is not the most fun to drive, but it is the most fun to sit in the back seats. If you can afford one, this is an amazing car to own",4.625
10, on 05/25/08 17:45 PM (PDT),Mike Bahss ,2008 Maybach 62 Sedan S 4dr Sedan (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 5A),Great Drive, The car overall is okay but I would just recommend a Honda Accord instead. The backseat does not have as much leg room but it will do. ,4.625
11, on 06/20/07 23:23 PM (PDT),Chauffeur ,2004 Maybach 62 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),Overrated, Most people will never get the opportunity to drive this car. It is best off being admired from a distance. This vehicle has spent considerable time being fixed under warranty. The 62 is designed as a chauffeured vehicle but lacks the care and consideration that should be paid to such a vehicle. It is a very nice car but not worth the money. Resale on it is horrible so if you buy one get ready to lose a lot of money. And look out for when the vehicle comes out of warranty. Those computers will wreak havoc on your checking account! Fuel economy stinks.,2.625
12, on 06/15/05 12:12 PM (PDT),Actual Maybach owner ,2004 Maybach 62 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),From an actual owner," I've never contributed to one of these pages, but after reading the reviews posted here by supposed Maybach owners, I had to take the time to do this.  My 62 is an '05, and it is the second one I've had.  The first one, an '04, was plagued by so many problems that Maybach bought it back from me after finally admitting they could not fix the numerous problems (too many to list here, but think of something a car has and it broke -- multiple times).  I made the mistake of purchasing another, hoping for a different experience.  Let's just say when I called the dealer to trade this car on something else, it was worth $120k less than I had paid 4 months earlier.  ",3.5
13, on 02/03/05 11:45 AM (PST),FootDoctor ,2004 Maybach 62 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),It's OK," My Maybach is okay.  I've got too many cars anyway.  It's not the ""Crown Jewel"" I thought it would be.  Unfortunately, I still prefer my convertable Mondial (1992) to this car.  I probably will keep it though - I do like rolling up to places in it, though the only people impressed are the people who know what it is (and they are usually guys, not girls).  Maybach gets the nod, but I probable will not get another one.  My S600 is equal in ride and speed.  My SL55 is also just as nice a ride for a third of the cost.  Still a ""Mac Ride"" though.",4.25
14, on 11/15/04 07:41 AM (PST),DHarrisOrl ,2004 Maybach 62 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),Top of the line," With this vehicle, the designers thought of every imaginable luxury possible and than some.  The exterior design is very modest and somewhat down plays to what's hidden inside and under the hood.  The makers of this vehicle (a joint venture between Daimler Benz - Chrysler) created new auto-technology, leading the way in vehicle innovation from pre-crash technology to translucent material that illuminates by running a weak electrical current through it.  The seating is spacious and the control of the rear environment is unsurpassed by any other luxury vehicle offered.  You will NOT find another vehicle that offers what the Maybach offers.  This vehicle renders all others, OBSOLETE... Derek :)",5
15, on 11/14/04 15:47 PM (PST),Truthful ,2004 Maybach 62 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),From my point of view," I love my Maybach but, this is my business car, I used to own a Mercedes Benz 500 sel and to me they feel like almost the same car. Although the maybach is better it does burn a lot of gas compared to my other cars. It is not really that much fun to drive. It feels safe inside and handles like a limo. This a very good car, but not for someone who like the real driving experience.",4.625
16, on 08/16/04 00:00 AM (PDT),wonderful car ,2004 Maybach 62 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),Quite Amazing," This is the most wonderful car i haveever purchased. The inside is a dream,confortable leather seats providing alarge amount of leg room. Althogh thecar is driven by my driver the ridefeels smooth and the acceleration is adream. The sound system offers topquality sound and the Tele's placed inthe back of the seats make that 6 hourride even shorter!! i would recommmedthis car to anyone that is if you canafford its price tag.. however it ismoney well spent",5

22, on 04/23/05 12:06 PM (PDT),Charles ,2005 Maybach 62 Sedan 4dr Sedan (5.5L 12cyl Turbo 5A),Better than my primary car,"  My wife had just recently purchased a S600 and i loved it more than my bentley, so I went to the dealership to buy a S600 and the dealer told me about the mayabch. So I went back to look at the 57, I was ready to sign the paperwork when he mentioned to me that there was a 62, frustrated by his lack of information, I went back into the studio to look, I was in love. The drive home was the best drive I have ever tooken. The performance is better than a corvette, I love the rear seat features when I am chauferred. It is a great all around car.",4.875
