The Macan provides the best driving experience of any car I have ever owned.  The 3.6 L turbo and the standard adaptive suspension make the ride like no other SUV and many 2-door sports cars can’t touch.  The 0-60 in ~4.2 seconds and the ability to masterfully handle curves at higher speeds than you can imagine possible makes every drive an experience.  Beautiful styling in both the interior and exterior.  Porsche has built an amazing high performance vehicle in the Macan Turbo",5

Could use a little more highway refinement and in my opinion more pickup.  For the cost, I would also like auto braking and better technology",4

I also had to replace the valve cover gaskets,at this time. I normally try to drive my Porsche vehicles 150000 to 160000 miles before I sell it or trade it ;however I'm a little nervous about the future dependability of this one;therefore I ordered a 2018 Macon GTS and will off this one at 85000 miles.",5
5, on 09/12/16 19:03 PM (PDT),Michele ,2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Forgot I am driving an SUV," The performance and handling are the obvious reasons for why I got the Macan. But now, after 1300 miles, the experience keeps getting better.  Being 4'11"" is always a challenge but the seat and steering wheel easily accomodate me.  And the side mirror doesn't block my view when making left turns - that is not the case in the Audi Q5 which I also considered. I can see all around which was a problem in the BMW X6 which has a rear window that left me with huge blind spots. The best comfort feature is the vented seats.  In a black with black interior, the vented seats cool quickly and keep me cool on hot summer days. The only nit I have is that the Apple Car Play doesnt always turn on when I plug in my iPhone 6. Although it isnt an issue if my husband plugs in his iPhone 6S. I have one warning, it is easy to go very fast and not realize it. 50 feels like 35. 90 feels like 70.  So newbies need to get used to the handling to control themselves...or not!  Took a ride in my friend's Tesla and while the 400hp could do 0-60 in 4 seconds and make. you feel like you sere on a roller coaster, you felt the curves and the car feels looser. My Macan is much better and hugs the curves for better control.     ----having trouble adding in the purchase date so adding it hear: August 2016 bought a 2017.",5
6, on 06/12/16 18:15 PM (PDT),Sam Suen ,2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Best handling SUV on the market still going strong," It might cost a bit more than the competition but its worth every penny.  My wife thinks it is luxurious and quiet. My kids think its the most comfortable car we owned and my main attraction to the car is its performance and handling.  What kind of black magic is this?!  Porsche tunes their base suspension so well that you will be wasting money on PASM or air suspension.  You won't need it unless you are chasing seconds on a race track.  The S makes plenty power so I wouldn't bother going with the TURBO unless you want to drag race someone all the time.  I would recommend getting at least the BOSE stereo upgrade as the base unit sounds horrible.  I would also recommend getting the sport seat for its superior support and comfort.  If you keep disciplined and not get tempted by all those other options, you can get it at a reasonable price.  I have achieved 29 MPG on the highway at 65 MPH for a 30 minutes stretch.  But it is so much fun getting on the gas and listen to the exhaust pop with the gear change.  The PDK is nothing short of phenomenal.   Your real life mileage will be closer to 20 MPG. Three years in, the car is still a delight. A few recalls have not made any difference to my enjoyment. No unbecoming rattles and shakes. Still have plenty treads on tires and brakes are good for more miles. The Porsche dealers’ pricing for service has gone off the deep end, going from a reasonable $300 for the first service to $1600 for the 30k service. That is basically an oil change and new plugs. Thankfully nothing a local garage cannot handle for a fraction of the cost.  The only dilemma I face is what to replace it with when I sell it.  June 2018 update.  Dealer has learned the errors of its ways.  Whole Service department has be reorganized.  Offering service specials to get its customers back.  Front tires still have 4/32 and rears 6/32.  Will replace after the summer.  Everything still working well.  Still don't see anything in the market which could be a worthwhile replacement.",5

9, on 01/13/16 12:18 PM (PST),Tom ,2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Sport Sedan in an SUV Body," I had mixed feelings about buying this car because I had a Lexus RX400h with 105,000 miles on it that was still a perfectly good car. I didn't need a new car, however I was so tired of driving the Lexus. And the difference in driving pleasure of the Porsche vs. Lexus is night and day. The Porsche is an SUV that is actually fun to drive. Great handling and acceleration. And while the Lexus was comfortable, the Porsche feels much more special with higher quality fit and finish. I'm partial to Porsche's based on currently owning a Boxster S and having 911's in the past. The Macan is very bit a Porsche. I also test drove the new Volvo XC90 and BMW X5 before deciding on the Macan S. Both have interiors just as nice as the Macan, and in fact I liked the Volvo interior the best. However neither came close to the driving performance and feel of the Macan S.",5

12, on 10/02/15 14:41 PM (PDT),Robliski ,2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Best of Both Worlds: Sports Car and Space," After owning a Mercedes Benz ML 500 for 6 years, I decided it was time to change. Since we were sort of out of the woods (no more strollers and other junk that the parent of a baby or toddler has to carry around), we were willing to downsize a little bit. We test drove the new ML which was more of the same with a few more bells and whistles and knew that we wanted something different. Something unique. Test drove the Maserati Ghibli and it was very nice but we did not consider buying it; it would have to have been a lease. Considered buying a Porsche Panamera. Test drove the Panamera and I loved the PDK (Porsche Dupple Kupplung; double clutch) transmission. Very smooth, quick, and responsive gear changes. But the Panamera felt like a boat and the standard 6 cylinder did not have enough juice. I read about Macan and began to really research it and decided to take one for a test drive at work and I was sold on the spot. I had just bought a 911 at that time and the Macan felt like a 4 door 911. Took the wife to the dealership for a test drive and she loved it as well. I also test drove the Cayenne. The Cayenne felt more like the ML - felt heavy and wasn't peppy. We ordered the Macan around Holloween and got it March of this year.After 6 months of ownership I cannot find a single flaw with the car. It is amazing in every way. It is very responsive and agile. It handles really well. The PDK transmission is very smooth and shifts great and has real paddle shifters instead of those terrible buttons. Switch it into sport mode and the transmission shifts are even quicker and the entire responsiveness of the car is even better. I truely feel like this car is a 4 door 911. There is also plenty of space for luggage for those trips to the beach and/or for going out of town. I've heard some complaints about the rear seat knee room, but everything has a price in my opinion and there has to be a compromise somewhere between sportiness and space which in concept are opposing principles.",5

Less than a mile from the house, we were hit on the driver side by a PU that was going about 45-50mph.  He never touched his brakes from what I can tell.  My view was block by another vehicle but I did see catch him out of the side of my eye right before impact and was able to swerve a little.  Both side impact bags deployed and surprisingly, no glass was broken.  It spun us in a complete 360.  The vehicle did what it was design to do and there was no intrusion into the passenger cabin however the truck did do a number on the left rear tire and wheel. The only injury was to the occupant in the rear passenger seat suffering 6 fractured ribs from the seat belt, but I'll take that any day.  I haven't inspected the vehicle but I'll bet that it's totaled.  This accident happened so fast that none of the passengers were able to brace.  I  am very pleased with how it did with this impact to the driver's side passenger door albeit not a Tbone.  I understand from the Euro safety test that the Macan got good grades and that was proved up this Sept 5th.  If anyone wants pictures, I have some.",5

It was what I was looking for in the way of  sportiness and practicality after having a Mercedes CLS that couldn't handle the bad roads of Houston. In sport mode it is engaging and quick but in traffic I just drive in comfort mode. Perfect size and easy to park.   Only problem so far is my Sat radio function stopped working after 4 days and I have been waiting over 2 months for a replacement. Pretty disappointed that Porsche has not fixed this yet but hopefully soon.  Getting about 21MPG combined so far. ,4.5
17, on 08/13/14 06:30 AM (PDT),gtfranklin ,2015 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),My 22nd new vehicle," My Macan S is by far the most enjoyable new car in my long car-buying history. I have purchased Ford, Olds, Nissan, Toyotas, Honda, Acuras, Infiniti, BMWs, but not since my '98 E36 M3 have I been so thoroughly impressed with a car. Great handling PLUS great ride, solid, quiet (almost too quiet), fast, plus much better mpg than I expected (23.8 @ 2600 miles)...I make up excuses to go places just to drive this car. Didn't rate reliability because it's new & my 1st Porsche. Came from '08 and '10 MDX, & was going to try X-3 35i until the Macan info came out in January. Picked mine up in May.8/16 Update:Still love this car at 2+ years and 27K miles. 100% trouble-free (only few software updates). Got over 25mpg on recent road trip. Still solid and rattle-free. Only ""negatives"" would be reg maintenance cost (i.g. oil changes) overpriced. And the sun visors could be a little larger.Update:At 40 months, still my favorite new purchase. Had 2 recalls handled with a morning visit, but zero problems to date. Still drives like new. Great exhaust sound.  Usually get ""new car bug"" at 3 years. Recent test drives of new competition leave me unimpressed (except for new Panamera 4S which is out of my $ range). I check trade-in value every year (avg. of KBB, Black book, Edmunds, NADA), and residuals are extremely high. $about $14.5K depreciation for 36 mos, 35K miles. Outstanding.",5

19, on 09/03/18 12:03 PM (PDT),Steve Morley ,2018 Porsche Macan SUV Sport Edition 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Great SUV but it’s not perfect," The good:Great performance, good handling and very comfortable. The 18 way adjustable seats are excellent. Interior leather overall is high quality. Heated and cooled seats work great. Very low road noise and excellent sound system (I have the premium audio option). The interactive cruise control is a great option. Of course it looks great!The bad: The infotainment interface is poor. Just getting it registered with Porsche is a major headache. The navigation system data entry is useless. It seems the database is not fully updated. Difficult to find addresses and forget searching by point of interest. My 2011 BMW X5 was much better. No real time traffic information even thought it’s supposed to have this feature.The control switches for the info system are more VW than Porsche. Does not feel like it’s high quality.Air con is working OK but does not seem as powerful (cool down) as other cars I have owned. Just about good enough.The ugly: The layout of the switches and in the centre consul is confusing. Forget the buttons in the overhead consul while driving. Just can’t see them. The garage opener is hard to program. I managed to get it working but the instructions are poor. The dealer also tried but it did not work first time.The external temperature sensor is never accurate. Porsche say it’s something to do with the sensor location and you need to drive at least three miles for it to read properly. Never had a car like that!The parking system is very limited. Just a rear camera and audible sensors front and rear. No 360 degree camera. Last but not least the service cost. First service is just an oil change $800!. 2nd service (20,000) is an oil change and some filters $1,200. In three years normal service >$2,400. Since the motor is same as Audi and VW this is just over charging. I got my services included free of charge in the lease.Apple car play is included in the connect services. So to keep it after the first year it will cost $400 per year. Unfortunately more Porsche greed. Do I like the car. No. I love it. Best SUV from a drivers view point and it looks fantastic.",4
20, on 08/18/18 16:16 PM (PDT),mark ,2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Just crossed 40k miles," Purchased this vehicle 10/15 and have primarily used it for Hwy driving and touring with a couple of golden retrievers. The Macan is a sports car with a hatch, its not really a family car but can easily handle a girlfriend (if she's low maintenance) and a couple of 70lb pups.  The interior is top notch, the base hi-fi is just fine, bluetooth and music (IPOD) connectivity are flawless. Seats (Porsche can rip you off here) need to be the middle package (Premium package) and stick with 19 tires... the 20's may look cool but wear faster and frankly just add to the cost IMO. I chose the sunroof and rails too... The ride: The car handles like a well behaved sports car (I also have a 997 C2S and 996 GT3) and can get you in trouble when going from 70 to 100 in a flash... its effortless.  I also have an X5 and two X3's in the stable (kids and dog/beach mobile)... they're great trucks... the Macan ain't that.  I'll buy again when this hits 150k and I give it to my daughter...",5
21, on 08/18/18 11:29 AM (PDT),Nick ,2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),All around great vehicle," Owned the Macan for 6 months and just finished a 2500 mile West Coast road trip.  Winding 2 lane roads thru the redwoods were as much fun as long, flat, ‘see for 50 miles in all directions’, desert roads. The vehicle is a blast to drive. Average speed was 70 MPH. The biggest problem was keeping the speed below 110 while passing 18 wheelers - it quickly accumulates speed. Fuel mileage averaged 22 MPG for the trip. The Macan replaced a Cayenne S with 120,000 miles. While the Macan has a much smaller storage capacity, it is 100% more fun to drive. The fit and finish of the vehicle is of the highest quality.",5

We purchased the car in Florida where roads are fairly smooth and there the car rode smoothly. In May we returned to Wisconsin where roads are very rough. Our car has 20"" Spider wheels with Pirelli tires. The ride of the car in Wisconsin is very rough and quite noisy, as the road imperfections are transferred sharply through the suspension. Not very forgiving and very sport car like. Our second car is a BMW X3, 2018 as well. Day to night difference in the ride and smoothness on the road. Not totally dissatisfied with the Mecan S  however I prefer to drive the Bimmer 10 out of 10 times.",3
25, on 05/01/18 08:22 AM (PDT),Dave ,2018 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),You get what you pay for," OK, other SUVs get slightly better gas mileage and a bit more cargo space. But, no SUV can touch the Macan S in drivability. It's very fast. Never any lean or lag. Great smooth ride, not bouncy. The steering is just right in effort and road hold and feedback. Braking is strong. Love the dry sump oil pumps that make the car quieter and accelerate better. Two turbos for extra torque and agility. I tested all the luxury SUVs and the Macan S immediately stood out. I was blown away when I drove it.",5

The drive and handling are typical Porsche; the more and the harder you drive it, the more confidence it instills. It's simply unflappable. It doesn't handling quite at the level of a 911 or a Boxster, but no other SUV even comes close, the aforementioned bimmers included. It even gets better mileage than either the X5 or the X3's. The Macan's styling is superb, and although it is built on the same platform as the Audi Q5, compared side-by-side it makes the Q5 look like a soap box. Admittedly the Macan S runs a few grands higher than all the other mentioned vehicles, but don't let that deter you from a test drive. It might just change your mind. It did mine.",5

Curtain airbags did not deploy.," We were T-boned in an intersection spinning our car sideways towards where the other car is coming from. The curtain airbags did not deploy. The passenger door where my 10 year old daughter was sitting twisted that both doors on the right side cannot be opened.Porsche claimed that it has to be at a certain speed and angle for it to deploy. Seriously? It would have been a different story if we were injured. Luckily, we were ok. What is sad is porsche stated that there is no need for further investigation since the technician claimed that it did not meet the threshold. Well how do I know if the sensors are working ok if they dont test it? If you care for safety, I don’t recommend porsche cars.

Hopefully this is ending in february od 2018 and we can rid of it ! Lot of problems , too often in the car dealer . We had problems with steering wheel and transmition once, have several issues with brakes noises,  problems with stero/radio not working properly.... That it was not expecting when choosing a Porsche.   Even though when big issues happened we didnt have any support from Atlanta headquarters and Miami dealer.  A deep disapointment overall.

Soft close doors, heads up display, just the roomy feel in general.  I love, love, love the Macan, however, being in my 50's now and not in my 20's, I enjoy the ease of getting in a vehicle as well as getting out, and that is very tight in this beauty.

Comfort is fantastic.  Performance is perfect, this ole goat can run with any of them!  The Macan is easy to maneuver and park.

What I hate about this Macan: Maintenance is really expensive. In 40K miles I have spent $2250 versus Audi Q5 $1100 which I owned before. Audi's brakes need replacement every 25K. The dealer also was very stubborn on taking anything off the MSRP. Would I repeat this purchase? Probably not, you can save a few bucks buying the maintenance contract ahead which they didn't even offer me.",4

Loved that car but needed something with just a bit more practicality.  I looked at these on a whim and fell in love with the styling both inside and out.  As soon as my wife sat in it she said....I want this car.   Opted for the base with the premium plus package and 20"" wheels plus a couple other options.  Bought it for $52k net.   I feel that it's actually a great value for what you get and there isn't another compact crossover that can touch it in the driving dynamics department.  Handles like a 911.  Average mid 20s on the highway on premium fuel.  No complaints so far.  The back seat could be a bit bigger,  but it suits my 12 year old just fine.",5
43, on 07/21/17 00:15 AM (PDT),Roger Peng ,2017 Porsche Macan SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7AM),Nothing spectacular," I should start off by saying I am a Cayenne owner who got the chance to drive the Macan S as a loaner car for 4 days. I was generally quite disappointed. I've driven many kinds of cars, and the Macan simply does not stand out. I'm surprised by the overwhelmingly positive reviews, as the car does not live up to it. It is a rather average ride dressed up with a somewhat fancy interior that isn't particularly spacious or functional. Porsche has a way of making cars that are large on the outside and small on the inside (this complaint applies to the Cayenne as well). The rows of buttons in the center console is getting old, and the entertainment console is a joke compared to what you'd find in a Tesla. The exhaust note is a gimmick aimed at impressing new-to-Porsche owners, as the car is not particularly fast. A small capacity engine aided by turbo charger just doesn't cut it. After you spend some time with the car, you really start to feel like ""Hey, this drives like any other car!"". After my short stint with the Macan, I couldn't be happier to return the loaner.",3

This Macan GTS is my first Porsche and it is great. It needs two things 1) to be available in a manual transmission (I know I can't shift as well as this transimission but It's more fun) and 2) to have a day time backlit tach when the lights are off (even paddle shifting needs a visible tach). I offered to buy a second Macan for my wife, but she won't give up her Mini because she loves a manual transimission too. I still have my BMW stick, as well. Our left feet are so bored with no clutch to operate. Having said all that, the Macan is still kick to drive. Love the way it sounds in Sport and Sport + mode.",5

What a great decision I made....smile.......... Powerful and my Macan S 2017 is a sports car acting machine outdoing most of the bmw's I have owned..........with the possible exception of my 3 series M convertible. It is a truly great combination of practicality and driving excitement. This is a Porsche, no doubt about it, from the sound of the engine to going around 35mph corners at 60...........its a Porsche! The ride and noise in the cabin are muted and comfortable, bumps are a little harsh, but the other attributes of the vehicle are well worth the small aggravation of the semi stiff ride. After all this is not a Lexus RX. Cabin is done very well with great materials and is big enough for me, 6'3"", 260lbs. I am not sure what I would do to improve this vehicle, not anything I can come up with right now. 5 stars for sure...........................yippee!!!! UPDATE: 6mo owning the vehicle, 7000 miles. double down on all statements previous. nothing about the vehicle that I can complain about. it is really a blast to drive, so much in fact I find myself taking the long way to almost everywhere I go and going for joyrides very often. I have not had my first ticket yet as I am a careful driver, but the car is so responsive it is hard to drive the speed limits. Whatever speed you are going seems to slow. Get one or test drive one, until you do, you can not possibly know what I know. It is driving heaven. UPDATE, one year later.......... all review items remain at same high levels. I find myself driving places I don't need to go just to be driving. This is truly a great vehicle and it seems priced correctly for the quality and image that you get driving a Porsche. I am very pleased with this vehicle and it will be hard to drive anything else after this experience. update: 18 months owned, 18k miles. no further comments, all of my previous comments stand as written. Great Vehicle. Update, 23k miles. No change, 5+ stars! Yippee!!",5

From day one this car has been a pleasure to drive, my 997 spends most of its time resting in the garage. Also in the stable (kids & dog car) are a BMW X5 and two BMW X3's. The Porsche is a sports car with a hatch that you can drive comfortably for eight hours without fatigue... the BMW's are older, well made and are not as fast or handle as well. The M series may be different. The Porsche excels with handling speed and comfort. The car has been in for service due to brake booster issues (vacuum leak) at 30k miles and routine maintenance. Tire wear has been surprisingly little... I owned a Cayenne that ate tires, so having great Michelin tires that look and drive new with 32k miles on them is a bonus.

Performance wise, it feels like you driving an larger sports car. Acceleration is on point, and handling is very tight for a car this size. When you hit the brakes you feel it.  Aesthetically the outside of the car is beautiful, with curves and design that make it look very elegant and sporty. It looks like a traditional Porsche. Personally I'm not a fan of the interior, the cockpit layout of the buttons is too much for me and makes it feel like your in a 747. Also not a fan of the navigation system, but if Porsche is able to incorporate the new nav systems they have for the 718 for newer editions then that problem is solved.

The Macan lets those of us with kids still in car seats have the opportunity to enjoy Porsche's legendary performance in a vehicle that is at home at the mall as it is on the track. The highest levels of performance come on the GTS model, but the ""S"" model offers plenty of acceleration and more capability than most drivers will ever exploit. The 18 way power seats are phenomenal and a worthwhile upgrade. The ""premium plus"" option includes keyless entry and ignition as well an upgraded sound system and ventilated/ heated seats. The 2017 model year has an upgraded touch screen navigation that is better than previous models, but not nearly as user friendly as some of the competitions.

This stereo was state of the art in 1970, and I figured I could upgrade it with aftermarket equipment, but at $2200 just for new speakers and amps, I decided to just live with it.  If you get a Cayman, be sure to order the Bose upgrade.",4.75

I use it as my daily driver. I now look forward to driving to and from work and on date nights with my wife. The performance is great and I many times take the long way home to spend a little more time in it. I recommend the Bose stereo upgrade for more low end punch, but many times I find myself listening to the engine sounds more than the radio/cd. Be careful with your customization as it can be expensive. Choose wisely. I am very happy with the standard leather interior and dash. A little more durable than having the full leather interior.

This is one of those.  With the sharp snarl of lighting up the 6-cylinders that share the mid-chassis location giving perfect balance, you know this is a drivers' car.  Spartan but comfortable, the interior is well laid out and gadget free. Lots of leg and head room, and excellent views without blind spots.  Until you've driven a Porsche, you'll not appreciate the torque that makes the 6-speed transmission more than enough to zing to 60 mph in under 5 seconds, and brakes to stop as quick.",4.875

Some complaints I have about this car are body integrity, stereo and Tiptronic buttons. Its rear-end produces rattle noises.

The comfort is excellent, especially in the lower back area. I have been envying Porsches ever since I was in high-school. As another Porsche owner told me, this is a sports car not a luxury car masquerading as a sports car. After I drove it I could clearly see what she meant.   The swaying factor around curves is for the most part non-existent.  The bottom line is this car is the best choice in its class.",5

The exhaust is so sweet and the comfort of the interior is awesome. I am 5/9"" and have driven passenger as tall as 6'3"" and they all are in awe at that space and the drive.

I purchased a basic model (non-s, 5 speed, 19 inch wheels, bose, heated seats) which was actually hard to find.  If you want to pay for all the other goodies go for it, but they are expensive and some add quite a bit of weight. Trust me, you won't miss them and you can save 25 grand.

Everything about this car keeps a smile on my face... handling, performance, exhaust note, comfort.  Even in traffic it is a delight to drive.  Word of warning that a Cayman can get expensive with the 'a la carte' approach to options... I kept mine pretty simple.  Key options I think are a must are 20"" wheels, Sport Chrono Package, Bose stereo, and get the 'clear bra' to protect the nose from stones which will damage the paint.  With those, you will not be disappointed.  The only trick which takes a few days to master is getting in if you are a big guy (I'm 6'3"" 220 lbs) but once I did, simple!  One surprise is that Porsche does not offer any extended warranty in the US.  Will have to see if that is an issue once factory warranty is up.  Expect $300 / oil change.",5

I've owned other sports cars, yet none has come close to given me such driving bliss. My car has the PDK, and the 18"" wheels, both are concessions to  stop and go traffic and poorly maintained roads, yet it's still fantastically engaging. I recommend PASM, it improves ride on poor surfaces, yet on better roads improves handling. Although, I have the sport chrono package, I'm not sure it's worth it. I highly recommend upgrading to the Xenon lights. The heated seats are awesome and surprisingly in the winter you'll love the heated steering wheel. The Bose system is a must have if you like music.

It replaced my Z3 BMW, and while both are really nice cars the Cayman S seems like a star ship, while the Z3 is more of a classic from the 50's. I have yet to find any major issues with the Cayman and hope that it runs as good 10 years from now as it does today. The Navigation system is difficult to figure out the first few times of using it so wish they would team up with Garmin and keep thing simple but it works well once you get it set up. ",5

Sometimes I just wish it had a backseat so I could share the experience w/ more than 1 other person at a time. I have the Carmon Red and it's a beauty but I'm actually surprised at the smiles I get.

The combination of chassis, steering, transmission and engine are the best I have ever experienced.  It is an easy car to drive around town, but one time on a twisty mountain road is all it takes to feel the superlative power and handling.  It is also the best-looking car I've ever owned.

While the car can be comfortably driven in the city, it is a delight on the back roads where traffic is not an issue. The high power-to-low weight ratio and the mid-engine layout make the car nimble and well-balanced with loads of torque. I have owned several coupes and this is the best one by far.

I used to race a fully track prepared EVO VIII and the Cayman S is as close as cars come to that.  Very exciting over 5200 RPM, plenty of torque and engine sound is aggressive, yet more refined than some kid with a coffee can import.  Better yet, it's a great daily driver with plenty of room for groceries, luggage and whatever else you could want (that was the tipping point for me between the Cayman and the 911).",4.75

I really like the basic sport feel, almost like a vintage car, with not too much electronic stuff, and not so much glossy plastic trim.  As a designer, this car really appeals to me from an aesthetic view. Compared to the Mercedes I was using for a daily driver, this is way more fun, and I love to make 90 degree turns going 45 mph. Now have about 18K miles. Sits in a nice large garage, like a sculpture.

Tall passenger seat totally obscures the small window behind the door creating a blind spot. They can also hit and damage the headliner if not careful. Bose system has too much bass but a satisfactory adjustment can be made. The wheel size makes a huge difference in ride quality and the larger wheels will probably lead to more rattles with time.

Its sound is intoxicating as is its performance and handling, and brakes.  It works well as a daily driver, too.  It has very satisfactory storage space and holds my golf clubs in the rear trunk with a little juggling.  It is just a great car that Porsche is holding back on to keep the iconic 911 on top.",4.875

Have had for 2 months, have about 3000 miles on it, highlight was a drive up and back on back roads including Highway 1 LA to Monterey for MotoGP a few weeks ago. Handling, shifting, road feel superb, I spent a lot of time going through the twisties and laughing out loud with pleasure.  Has plenty of power on the street to get you tickets even if it does not have 911 hp.  And it is not even broken in yet.  Car gets a lot of looks, and I love the look of it (and I hate the Boxster.) Yes the car is noisy and a very firm ride (19 inch wheels), stereo is so so but listening to the engine is the real musical experience!",4.625

Of the Porsches I have owned and driven, this is by far and away the best handling and best looking. The husky exhaust note and power @ 4500 rpms and above is incredible. The Cayman S is 100% pure sports car. With a few tweaks to the 3.4 ltr. engine, suspension and exhaust coupled with the mid engine platform, the Cayman S's performance is as good if not better than the 997 for a lot less money. ",5

No, it's not the fastest, but straight-line speed is only a part of the equation.  This car handles like no  other I've owned, including a multitude of Benzes, BMWs, Miatas and an RX-8.  To add to its value, it is a useful sports car with decent storage and trunk space for its two passengers.  And it works as a daily driver with decent gas mileage and comfort.

I think it is a real stunner in sheet metal, prettiest car on the road.  I am starting to find the interior noise and the rough ride wearing on my nerves, especially if the pavement is rough. I came out of a 330ci that was a nice car and almost as peppy, but not as much fun to drive.  The dealer suggested I change out the tires to a non performance model but that is a bit costly so I guess I'll just deal with the road noise.

Sure, there are times when I think I could use the extra hp but those times have been seldom.  Although some will tell you that they prefer the more ""classic"" line of the 911, I think the Cayman is in a style class by itself.  Just hand the key to any valet if you need confirmation.

Long bends where previous cars would go light at speed are no problem at all.  The only drawback so far are the chips from small stones on the bonnet - well you can't have everything.

Compared to BMWs and the Corvette, which both cost same amount, this Cayman is way more fun to drive and it has better handling.  But 245HP is way to weak for a $55,000 car.  Porsche also needs to stop jacking people on the options which can easily add $10,000 - $20,00 more to the car's price.  Skip the Cayman and get the Cayman S or 911.

It looks gorgeous at any angle with beautiful lines and dimensions. The 3.4L engine is powerful and sounds amazing (I would definitely recommend the Sport Exhaust!) all the way to its redline! Handling is second to none with so much grip and the feedback from the steering wheel is perfect. With a low curb weight and a stiff chassis, the Cayman does a wonderful job of carving through winding roads all day long. Braking is superb and constant. While not necessarily the import factor in buying a sports car, the gas mileage is pretty good in my opinion for what the car has to offer. I can get in the low 30's on the highway and average about 24 mpg combined (not far off from other 6 cylinder vehicles I have driven). The interior is well laid out  and has plenty of room for occupants (I'm 6'5"" and by no means uncomfortable) though egress in and out can take a little getting used to if you are tall, but this is true of most smaller sport cars.

Some of the climate controls don't work as I'd like; always turning on when the car is started even if it was off when the car was stopped, no way to just use the fan without it trying to match the temperature settings.  Nav is less intuitive to use than a Garmin.  I'd prefer less technology overall, less complexity.  A design issue is that they use gravel on the roads here when there's ice and the brakes are susceptible to gravel getting stuck in them causing a scraping sound and possibly need an expensive fix by the dealer, so I find myself limiting my winter driving.

The car is agile and accurate, moving perfectly in response to a tight steering ratio, and great road feel transmitted to me while underway.  The 2016 has a little more leg room inside for taller drivers. My fuel consumption is not as good as advertised, but that is because when I drive the car I usually am in Sport Mode and maximizing the ""fun"" that I bought the car for. If there is anything to complain about, it is that I sometimes get carried away with the amount of fun that I am having while running faster than the posted limits! I don't do lots of boring expressway driving, which would greatly improve the average fuel economy.

What a low cost pleasure it has been.  Still on all four original 20"" Pirellis with 5/32+ tread left and brakes are like new (8/32+)......notwithstanding two half day auto cross events.  Tight as a drum and not a rattle to be found.  The Cayman is a better daily driver than my previous 911/997 S.  Which, BTW, handled spectacularly as well, but the 911 is 300+ lbs heavier, not as nimble and a rougher ride  around town.  I've averaged 21 mpg since new, with 30 mpg at 75+ on highway.  Golf clubs fit in the hatch, the ""frunk"" handles the luggage; I've been on several weekend roundtrips of 600-800+ miles with my wife.  Handling and steering  are truly exceptional - equal or better, IMO, than my buddy's Ferrari 430.  Straight line acceleration isn't head-snapping spectacular, but still very good and better than ""only"" 325 hp suggests; thanks to the 2,900 lb curb weight.  Short throw 6 speed makes rowing your own a true pleasure on this car (notwithstanding that the PDK is the best dual clutch transmission on the planet, for anybody that is uneducatedly concerned about being a namby-pamby)   Overall, the Cayman S is the most enjoyable sports car I've owned.

Although I come from a Lexus family (5 cars, 48 total ownership years), I'm not accustomed to the design and build quality that Cayman gives.  It is rock solid and is a pleasure to drive.  The gas mileage is much better than my last Lexus sports car, and its performance, as expected, blows it away.  I specially ordered a manual transmission and have no regrets--why would anyone want automatic transmission on a sports car?  It's not that easy to get in and out of, but that's the sacrifice you have to make to own a car that catches your eye every time you're near it.  A friend was torn between buying a Corvette or a Porsche, to which my response was ""Why would you consider buying the best hamburger McDonald's makes over a steak at a steak house?""  Corvettes are beautiful cars, but buying one over a Porsche?  No rational person could make that choice.

This all started with a 2007 Cayman. In 56000 miles the car never broke once, nothing. One headlight bulb burned out and the batteries in the wheel sensors went to sleep. No leaks, no oil consumption, original brakes, 1.5 sets of tires. The car kept running while driving through the full force of a hurricane in Texas. Tractor trailers pulling doubles, carrying giant windmill blades totally buried the car with tire wash several times, the car never noticed, it managed ""as bad as it gets"" with grace and control, flawless. My faith in Porsche is rock solid. The 2014 Cayman; driving back from Lake Tahoe, pull off into a Porsche dealer and sit in a 2016 Cayman, it has me at Hello. Can't afford new, but CPO solves the problem with an anthracite brown, base 2014, with tan interior and 9600 miles on the odometer. Dealer research (not CARFAX) shows 3 software updates, no service problems, wrote a check, car is mine. This car is unbelievable, not an engineering term. It spent 2 winters in New York State. The car is flawless. Handling, motor, PCM, comfort, climate control, lighting, PDK etc., flawless. I learned to fly years ago, this is better. History puts 7 BMW sedans in my driveway, so far this is better. The car knows what I expect from it, before I ask. Not a car word, but the experience is ""personal"", balanced, involving. It's more like you wear the car then drive the car. My hope is the 2014 can live up to the delivery of the 2007. Time will tell the story, but for now ""remarkable"" fits best.In the end I sold this remarkable car. The emotional burden every time I left the car parked somewhere and the thought of something happening to it was not worth it. I know of more than one person who has taken the same path. The car was resold in less than 12 hours. I wanted to purchase a Porsche SUV, but could not afford it.As a final comment, I believe Porsche will live to regret moving the Cayman to 4 cylinders.",5
165, on 10/15/16 18:49 PM (PDT),Don ,2014 Porsche Cayman Coupe 2dr Coupe (2.7L 6cyl 6M),Base PDK is the daily driver king," My 2016  base model Cayman has the PDK transmission. This is my daily drive, as such, economy & reliability were important considerations. I constantly  obtain 31/32 MPG at 80+ MPH. In spite of  consistent reviews that claim the base engine lacks power, I find the 275 HP adequate and the base Cayman a blast to drive on open roads. The base engine would most likely lack required power to be competitive in a high performance track race, especially when powering out of turns for maximum lap times, but since I'll never get it on a race track, shes plenty fast. The PDK  transmission maximizes the cars performance, it's split second shifts can't be matched by man. I got the standard 18"" wheels & passed on every other option other than navigation, comfort pkg & sport steering wheel. After adding transportation fees and a clear bra I wangled a deal of $56,000 plus tax&license. I've had the car 7 months & 5,000 miles with no issues or regrets.  If your thinking about a sports car, I would strongly recommend the base Cayman with PDK as a consideration. As of mid April 2017, I  have nearly 8,000 trouble free miles on my base Cayman. On my latest weekend trip it got a whooping 33.6 MPG at 80/85 MPH!! The only negative is the cost of maintenance, the 1st oil change ran nearly $350!!! I'm told the 2nd service will be nearly $750.00 AND the 4th or 40,000 service is an astronomical $1500!! These are little mentioned details not provided by Porsche dealers during the buying experience. I do love the car, so I'll pay  & hopefully keep it 10 years. Just a reminder, mine is a 2016 model with the 2.7 liter six cylinder. The new  2017 Porsche Cayman's are now designated 718 models and have new 4 cylinder turbo charged engines, a design that's yet to be proven.It's now April 2018, I have 11,000 miles on the odometer without a hitch. All the hype about the base model with 275 HP being slow, is strictly MFG spin to get  buyers into high end models for more profit with a chance to visit your local jail. My battery was marginal so the dealer installed a new one under warranty. The car is all I expected EXCEPT for the cost of maintenance. The 10,000 mile service did cost $350.00, & the 2 yr (or  20,000 mi) service cost me over a grand and now I understand the 40,000 mi service is nearly TWO GRAND!!! I also head from Porsche service reps that the 718 Turbo Cayman is even more!! So be prepared to take out a 2nd on your house  once a year.",5

Although this car is no dragster (275 hp vs 600+), it is unmatched by most cars in turns and is extremely well balanced. (thank you blue flag) If a driver can smoothly carry momentum they will be tough to hang with.After 9000 miles and over $30,000 in repairs and very long waits for parts (nothing seems to be stocked and takes a boat from Germany after being custom made - it is not unusual for the car to be in the shop for 3-5 months) I would say that after owning it for 2.5 years it has spent close to a year in the shop.

Due to the unique hatchback design, I can pack my golf clubs, suitcases & accessories with more room available in the forward trunk compartment. German design shares this idea with it's cousin, the VW. Comfort, handling and performance will get you to where you need to go in record time, if you so choose. Shifting & speed gets you around slow traffic & into the clear in a breeze. Gas mileage is excellent & style points off the charts.

206, on 07/27/06 05:18 AM (PDT),dacrunk ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Two Cars in One," I purchased my Cayman S 2 1/2 weeks ago and have driven 2,150 miles to date. What an awesome machine!  Putt around town, in traffic and keep the rpm below 4,000 rpm and you have a very docile, easy to drive pussy cat...put your foot into it and it becomes a TIGER above 4,500 rpm. I chose the car for it's styling, handling and engineering and it has far surpassed any expectations I had! To me this machine is a culmination of the very best of every Porsche ever made! Next time I'll pass on the Bose system, as I find the bass a bit too flabby for my taste. For those who want more power, try the driving school, as the race track is the ONLY place you might need more power.",5

I've driven all these cars on the Sebring race track and I was completely blown away by the Cayman S.  The handling, power (especially in low gears), the clutch/gearbox, and brakes are phenominal.   I was convinced that I was getting the new Z4 M Coupe, but I was lucky enough to have a dealership that had both cars to drive.  I drove them 30 minutes apart and the Cayman S was beyond better in every area (except cup holder).  I found the car with the options I wanted and had it home one week later.",4.75
208, on 07/24/06 09:55 AM (PDT),JM ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Fabulous Driver's Car, This is the best driver's Porsche south of a 911 RS. The mid-engined layout offers balance and feedback to the driver which is matched only by a Lotus Exige (the difference being that you can get in and out of the Cayman without being a contortionist). It looks much better in the metal than in photographs and the looks grow on you too. Buy it in red or black - rather spend your money on the PASM active suspension option than pay for metallic paint. If you see someone driving a 911 you're never sure if they have bought it for the image - you can be sure the Cayman owner bought it for sheer thrill of driving. ,4.625
209, on 07/21/06 10:13 AM (PDT),Memo ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Best of the Best," This is my third Porsche after a Boxster and a 911. This is the best performer and most stylish Porsche ever built. It is fun and powerful. If you are not a porfessional driver with access to a speedway, this is the best Porsche you can get and enjoy every single drive. ",4.875

The Cayman is not the fastest Porsche out there, but it is the most balanced Porsche out there. Its handling combined with it's 295HP motor makes it the best driving Porsche to date. Its fit and finish is right up there with the 997s, and it is likely better looking than the 997. I added the Short Shift Kit from Porsche after delivery made and that made it even sweeter to drive.  I can say there isn't a better sports car out there for under $120,000 that can touch it.",4.75

212, on 06/13/06 11:36 AM (PDT),Scott  ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Cayman is Superb," The Cayman's gorgeous exterior and interior have drawn more appreciative comments than any car I've owned.  The optional leather interior is worth the (high) price, as are the more attractive 19"" wheels and the sport seats and steering wheel.  The chrono looks good, but like the Sport package is worthwhile only if you plan for track use.  Its power is especially good at high RPM, ok at low RPM too but not like my Z06 Corvette.  The engine sound is exhilarating but can get tiring on the highway.  The optional stereo is excellent. ",4.875

I do not have anything more to add other than this is an incredible handling car for the money.  The 10-11 pm side profile is absolutely gorgeous!  The 12 noon (head on) profile is stunning!  My Boxster S' 18"" wheels look great against basalt black.",5

There is no comparison between the Boxster S and Cayman S....the Cayman blows it away,  It has much better performance and handling and a sleeker style.  The styling is so incredible that everywhere I go I get compliments on the car.  ",4.875

The car is an excellent combination of power, agility and engineering.  Pictures don't do it justice, you really need to drive this car to appreciate it.  I have done several track days with this car and it far and away exceeds my expectations every time.  Porsche - There is no substitute!",5

It has a completely different feel that the Boxster S (the car I traded in) and in my opinion more fun than a 911 and more forgiving to drive.  The Bose stereo, xenon, heated seats, 19"" etc are musts - I had to settle for no nav as this was an unplanned purchase.  I was stuck in traffic by the dealership and they let me test drive the car / fall in love / have to have it / drive it home scenario.",4.875

It has fabulous looks and handling and it is very comfortable with lots of room for a 2 seater. The brakes are wonderful, shifter like butter, and the engine sounds are awesome. I don't mind a long drive in this car, and everyone loves it wherever you go. The car has no bad habits.",4.75
218, on 05/03/06 18:52 PM (PDT),A.Naik ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),better than 911!," The Cayman is one great coupe! I was going to order a MZ4 Coupe, but after seeing it at the auto show, no way. The Cayman S is way better looking and if you can afford one this is the best sports coupe for the buck!  This is my second Porsche, it is far superior to the base 911.",5

The car is a dream all the way around - loaded with PASM, Navigation, Bose stereo, heated seats, xeon, 19"", sport chrono pack +, etc.  Get the Nav and the CD can play MP3s, although just in a single drive.  The Bose upgrade is worth every penny.  It sounds better than my Bose system in the house.  It's quick and sticks to the ground so well.  Plus it is a true head turner!!  The cup holders require fully covered lids and ""small"" sizes, unless you want to spill on your beautiful leather seats.  I wish the steering wheel were just a bit smaller (probably an option).  But all in all, I'd buy this car all over again.  Oh what fun.  And that engine sound - WOW!",4.875
221, on 04/12/06 15:12 PM (PDT),Porsche For Life ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),More Fun than any other Car Owned," I recently purchased a Cayman S after reading many reviews.  I considered a 911 but test drove this car and was sold instantly. Just last night another driver pulled up besides to give me a thumbs up. Its so much fun to drive that I have to wipe the smile on my face after each drive.  I have driven it about 2,000 miles in all conditions. I just returned from a weekend road trip and it performed flawlessly.  Its handling and control were awesome at all speeds!  It had enough room for luggage and packages purchased with room to spare.",4.875
222, on 04/06/06 23:01 PM (PDT),Aaron Sprague ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),A Love Affair," A car that is the essential sports coupe, its more nimble than a ballet dancer and hotter than a super model. This car is balanced to perfection. On short rides in traffic you feel like a jockey on a race horse surrounded by mules, on long rides where you can really open the car up. Turn off the radio and enjoy the music of the 295hp engine singing to you... It says go! Go Faster! Take the long way home!!!",4.875

Lets see, I have put 1,000 miles on it in a couple of days.  The Cayman is fast and handles well. I bought it with Tiptronic. It is mainly used in a manual mode and it goes!

This car is like a second skin and performs like a dream.  I am 6'1"", 220 and the seats are so well designed that you just settle in and enjoy.  The exterior design is the best I have seen and the throwback style is very distinctive.  The handling on small country roads, with tight turns is superb and on the highway the car is a beast!  I will enjoy this car for many years.  I understand now why so many 911 fans like the Cayman S more.  It is pure fun!  Now, if only I can get the tires to last beyond 5,000 miles...",5
225, on 03/28/06 12:35 PM (PST),Alexk ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Surprisingly Quiet and Smooth Ride, I was very surprised to find that this car is very quiet (for a sports car).

226, on 03/25/06 22:07 PM (PST),Michael ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),Only Minor Complaints," Buy this car.  It's awesome.  It's the only car that I have purchased in my life with NO regrets.  I would buy it again today without hesitation, but these need to be fixed for 2007 / 2008:  Interior cabin noise is loud.  When driving on the weekends that's great (it's a sports car afterall), but Wednesday afternoon with a client on the phone ain't so cool!  Callers often ask if I'm in a convertable.  No audible horn or noise when locking and unlocking the vechicle from the exterior with the fob.  You have to watch for two blicks of the lights when locking which can be difficult to see in the sun.  Rear hatchback button on fob is TOO big.  I accidently open the rear hatch a lot!",4.75

There is so many good things about this car. Terrific handling, to die for cockpit, intoxicating sound and performance, gorgeous looks. My first drive was a 650 mile drive through the mountain west and was as much fun as humans should be allowed to have.  This car, dollar for dollar is just about the best thing going.  I would love to have a 911 some day, but it may be a while because I love this Cayman.",4.625

For most of you, this is all the performance you need.  I am not sure I can drive it to its full capabilities.  Fun, good looking, a dream to drive and a lot less than a 911. Amazingly good ride for a short wheel base. Very cool cockpit and an intoxicating engine sound.  Great value dollar for dollar.",4.5

Had a minor computer error relating to the passenger airbag, but it cleared up by wiggling the seat around.  I chose a pretty plain package- wanted it for performance vs. bells and whistles.  The car definitely will get looks- even had someone snap a picture from their phone at a stoplight.   I am 6'1"" and legroom is a little tight if driving for much more than 1 hour.

There is no waiting for the power to come. At 4,000 rpm and onward, it's just an animal.  Porsche provides any exterior and interior color combinations one would possibly want. This is a good thing and a bad thing. It may be too hard to commit to just one. The view of the rear end is just captivating, the car shows different lines at every angle. There'll always be someone calling it ""Boxster Coupe."" Don't let that get to you, if you're going to get one, because it is and it isn't. It's so much tighter and sportier than the Boxster, let alone the practicality aspect.",4.625

233, on 02/09/06 11:46 AM (PST),CMM ,2006 Porsche Cayman S Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.4L 6cyl 6M),It's a Sweet Ride," I've had my Porsche Cayman for three weeks now.  It's physically a very beautiful car that was designed by engineers.  I think the most outstanding aspect is that it is so well balanced.  Having the sweet sounding engine mounted aft of your head provides music to the ears (it is not overbearing at all).  I chose a lighter paint job (silver) so one can appreciate the beautiful lines.  I saw a medium seal grey metallic type paint at the dealer that I thought looked even better than mine.  I'd venture that the most common color chosen is silver.  The car turns heads, but that isn't why I got it (I'd actually prefer an invisible car).  I got it because it appeared to be the best sports car for less than $100,000.",5

I almost didn't get it because when I called the dealer they said that all there cars were spoken for. Anyway I went into the dealer on the first day and they actually had a car the way I wanted, without all the extra bells and whistles. This car has muscle, it's been 20 years since my last Porsche and this car sets the standard. It handles great, its mileage is decent, and the comfort is good. The Cayman gets a lot of looks.  I've gotten many of nods of approval, and best of all I feel great. I finally know what it's like to be in the garage at night, washing the windows and dusting it off. ",5

The RS has the 303hp engine and it goes like a scalded cat.  Passed my wife on the interstate at xxx mph and she said it sounded like we were at the racetrack. Handling is scarcely believable, especially in sport mode.  Acceleration is unexpectedly strong, like being tied to the space shuttle.

And the driving experience will make you want to reach that number sooner versus later! Be careful. Changing oil and filter on schedule is an absolute necessity. And the dreaded intermediate shaft bearing (IMSB) failure is a remote but real issue with older Boxsters (not so much the 2006 MY, which features a larger, more heavy-duty sealed IMS bearing).

Maintenance costs on this care are NOT trivial (oil change with filter about $ 200).  There is no navigation unit or bluetooth in the car, so you will need to use your cellphone or buy a new unit ($ 800 to 1500) if you want these things.  Trunks are very spacious.

So far, I have finally had the Porsche experience but miss some of the 986 raw elements.  The new '06 is more refined and had the gadgets but lacks some of the 986 prowlness and agility.

Car is not a daily driver for me so miles are limited.  Car drives very well, not as harsh as you might think.  I have the 17"" wheels which may add to that.  To me, the 17s offer a more ""big rubber"" back tire look as opposed to the 18"" wheels with a short sidewall.  Handling difference is negligible.  Build quality has been very good, no problems, no squeaks / rattles just like you would expect with a new car!  Long maintenance terms, factory says first oil change at 20K miles so even if you chicken out and go 15K it's still a long time.  Car gets a lot of looks - hopefully resale will be good as well.

The two trunks are still small, but I find that, with creativity, all needed items can be stored.  The two coat hooks on the back of the seats let me store my suit coat.  The seating positioning is comfortable, but only for those who are 6 feet tell and under.  I suggest adding protective coating (option) to protect front and wheel areas from nicks from stones, etc..

The cost of options is ridiculous. Plus there is a long wait time for ""exclusive"" options. Beware that options don't appreciably improve resale value so select them carefully. Some options should have been standard such as automatic climate control. The second generation Boxsters (Starting with the'05 model) are greatly improved in almost all ways. I wasn't expecting much difference from my '01 S but was amazed how much improved the '06 S was - certainly enough to compel me to pay the cost of upgrading.

Its quality has been excellent, service is reasonable...but buy it for the pure sports car driving experience.

This car is way faster than most people need and handles like it is on the proverbial rails. The quality of the fit and finish is very high. I'm posting here mainly to advise folks considering one to remember the reason they have depreciated so much from their original price: a successful class action lawsuit against Porsche. The mechanical failure rate of the engine in this model may be as high as 8%. The main thing that causes the engine to be destroyed is the Intermediate Shaft Bearing, which has several design flaws. It frequently fails without warning. The cost of a rebuilt motor, installed, is between $15,000 and $19,000; equal to or more than the car is worth. Fortunately, the bearing can be replaced for about $1,600, or about $2,600 with a new clutch at the same time.

Can’t tell you how impressed I am with this car is so many ways. I never liked the look of the boxster and always owned 911’s. That mindset started to change with the redesign in 2013. Every time I would see one on the road or parked, I found myself admiring the new design with the huge air intake ducts that gave it a Porsche GT, Audi R8 and Lamborghini look. I like how they brought the duct shape into the doors too. I never ever thought to look at how refined and classy the interior was when gawking at the exterior. Fast forward a few years and I finally added a 2014 Boxster S to my stable and I am extremely impressed with this car. The sound of the engine is amazing and while it could be a tad quicker, it’s still pretty fast and with the excellent gas mileage it’s just perfect. The interior is also a high point. The design is intuitive and the fit, finish and materials used are top notch. Driving it is a blast and the handling is much better that any of my 911’s hand down. It feels one in its own on the road. I wanted a manual transmission but settled on the PDK and am super impressed with that too which I never thought would be possible. It’s an incredible transmission with a lot of options for driving style. Bottom line:  It’s a lot of car, look and performance for the money.

The Boxster is head and tails ahead of the 911 in fit, finish, interior quality, handling, and interior noise. The PCM (entertainment, communication, nav) system on the Boxster is several steps ahead of what what was in the 911. While the 911 is iconic and has a sex appeal superior to the Boxster, the Boxster shines in performance over the 911. This is my third Boxster, and I am of the opinion that the Boxster S is a better balanced car with its mid-engine and weight distribution than the 911, and the power to weight ratio is well within anyone's power requirements.Update: Two years owning this car, and everything in my review is still valid.

I traded in my 2001 for this current model. I love driving the car, I like the exhaust note a lot more than my previous one, it handles great etc. Funny thing just happened, I started to notice a clanking sound from the front left. I took it to the dealer twice and apparently there is a problem with some sort of pressure line in the power steering system. It apparently is a problem that Porsche has been aware of on these new models as well as the Caymans, but there is no repair solution. Because it is apparently not a safety concern I can't lemon the car. So now I have a car that is fun to drive except for that hideous noise from the front... go figure.",4.125

'06 and have been able to use it more than I'd expected with this mild winter. It has been a great all around experience so far, from the dealership to Porsche follow ups after sale. The car itself is fantastic to drive. It is not as powerful as my Audi S4 or the Corvette, but I have had a much more thrilling driving experience. The 245 HP is plenty powerful enough and the handling is first class.  The engine note is great, the cars a real head turner and the fit and finish are everything you'd expect in a Porsche. The other, less obvious plus for me, is the cargo space. I can get a golf bag in the rear trunk and two airline overhead compartment sized cases in the front trunk. ",4.75

I recently went looking to buy a fun ragtop and was planning to spend $40,000 - $50,000 to buy a used 911 Cab, SL500, SLK, or a new Vette (go figure, I liked the look). I reviewed them and threw out the SL500 for being too expensive (I wanted an '03 or newer).  I did not like how the SLK350 drive felt.  A 911 Cab for $50,000 meant a '91 - '92 model, so for fun I drove a new Boxster. It was faster than my 911 and it drove much better. The Vette was  nice but just wasn't my style and I can't explain that. The Boxster drives great and the Bose stereo is a must.

After 2 years & less than 57,000 miles, the engine self-destructed due to a design flaw - a GM alternator bearing used on the intermediate shaft failed and completely trashed the engine. Of course, Porsche lawyers admitted no fault on court documents when they settled, but somehow agreed to pay about 25% of owners' expenses totaling millions. I fell outside the terms of the settlement, so it's tough luck and $0. The repair will cost at least $7K, up to $12K with used parts. This flaw affects 911's also. Because this is a possible outcome, I will never buy another Porsche. Buy a Honda!Upadate 7/16: I wonder what a lawyer would be able to do with this.

It's not the fastest of two seat roadsters (even in S form), but it is surely the most fun to drive. The car's handling instills confidence in even the most tenuous of drivers. Cornering is effortless; the car's center of gravity feels like it is located under your seat. The the suspension communicates precisely what you need to know and it transmits your steering and throttle inputs with a smooth competency. The engine sings at higher RPM and begs to be revved to its limits, that's where the power band is and that's where the whole driving experience comes together, putting a big, goofy grin on your face.

I also own a 996 coupe, which I absolutely love driving, however when I have a choice of which key to grab, the Boxster wins out.  The Boxster is a great daily driver.  With the top down, the car is perfection!  The Boxster also handles better than our 996.  Mid engine design helps keep the car pointed in the right direction at insane speeds.

It sounds great, has good power, handles fine, and has been a joy to own. It has the sports chrono package and an upgraded six speed manual so it is a little more peppy than cars without those options. The engine sounds like a symphony when driven hard - especially when the exhaust echoes off tunnels and wall. Basically, the whole car just feels like a well engineered piece of fun. The car is fairly comfortable also.  However, the car loses some points when the top is up for some annoying transmission noise and loss of exhaust sound and interior noise.

The S model Boxster is even faster! Also insurance premiums are much better than the vette which has a high theft rate.

The balance and handling of this car is spectacular. Although horsepower is lower than some rivals (i.e a Corvette), the engine is super smooth and pulls really well through most of the rpm range, doing 0-60 in 5.0 seconds. The interior finishing is much better, and the exterior makes the car look a lot more muscular. If I lived in an area with lots of straight, open roads, I might be tempted by a 400+ horsepower car.  However, I live in an area with lots of winding mountain roads and wouldn't choose anything different.  The Elise would handle as well but is too unrefined to drive every day.",4.75

The interior is dramatically improved and much more comfortable.  I traded an Audi A8L which had comfortable seats, but to be honest, the Boxster's fit my bottom much better with less lateral pinch from the lower seat sides.

I would recommend definitely getting the car checked out by an independent (not affiliated with the dealer/seller) mechanic before you buy. Although the Boxster is a great car, it's not cheap to own, and you want to make sure the one that you buy is in good shape.

Unfortunately, most people who drive these cars aren't mechanically inclined and actually believe Porsche and then wait 15,000 miles.

People say that  the trunk space is limited, but honestly, I have done a couple of Costco runs, and trips to the airport with luggage, without too much of a problem.   The top goes up and down in a matter of seconds -- and on the go when you are pulling out -- easy and convenient.  One thing -- at least in LA -- the car gets a lot of attention.

The only issue I have is that I am very long from the waist down and the boxter is a little hard to get in, although the 2014 I sat in had added about 3"" of leg room and that solved the issue, not ready to give up this one, I just drove it coast to coast in less than 3 days and it was very comfortable. 2nd/3rd gears are out standing, the others are very good.

The 1999 year is among the best for engine reliability and Consumer Reports agrees with that in years past.  What a value for the dollar.  It loses only about $3,200 dollars per year in value.

What I can say is that this is one fine, well-built, high performing vehicle. This car simply attracted me, especially after I couldn't find much else that appealed to me. Several makes and models seemed to be going for luxury at the expense of performance. I've always preferred cars that I drove, rather than ones that drove me. And those were getting increasingly difficult to find. I've always driven manual transmissions, and several ""sport sedans"" and even ""sport cars"" were abandoning them. So I plunked down a deposit in mid-July, knowing I wouldn't get it until around the first of December. It was worth the wait. Is the Porsche 718 Cayman inexpensive? No. But it's also not cheap, either. This is a well put together car with very good materials. It has an intelligent layout that is pretty darn intuitive and easy to understand. It has the smoothest shifting of any of my previous ten cars. I'd always wondered if a car can really feel like ""it corners on rails""; now I know one can. The handling of this car, and its responsiveness, is what I'd dream about if I dreamed about ""the ultimate car."" I wanted a car that would be just plain fun to drive on meandering country roads, and now I've got it. We've all had that one car we felt connected to - I had mine in my late 20s. But this Cayman looks like it will rival, and likely surpass, that connection. I suspect that in a very short time I will know what the car will do, and it will know what I'm up to. I've only had that one other car that generated that level of trust. And the look of this car is stunning (and with better lines than the previous Caymans). Also, a plug for Sun Motor Cars in Pennsylvania, an excellent dealership, is in order.

I finally got the chance to drive one (a base Boxster) about a month ago, and I was very impressed: it was superior in every respect to the 2014 Boxster S that I was driving. After thinking it over for a while, I returned to my dealer last week, and drove the base car again, followed by an S. I was again impressed by the base car, but the S clearly had higher performance. Having had a Boxster, I decided to buy a Cayman this time: better visibility, the ability to take it through a car wash, getting away from troublesome sun glare with the top down and less expensive. My dealer (Checkered Flag in Virginia Beach) gave me an outstanding deal, and I bought my new Cayman S on 11-29-16. If you have read reviews that whine about the noise of the new engines, ignore them: the new engines have a bass note that is very satisfying. The 718 is also superior to its predecessor in every respect - better steering, better ride, better handling, better acceleration. I am very pleased, as anyone will be who is looking for the quintessential sports car.",5

In fact, the bluetooth function is absent altogether, and interfacing mobile electronics or other devices is not possible without a significant aftermarket appliance cost. Additionally, the CD changer has known problems that are not able to be repaired inexpensively.

The extra power in the new S (extra 45hp) makes a big difference. If you want you can drive in sports mode (change gears at 6k) and acceleration and smoothness of change is noticable.

High performance, fast, corners well, luxurious and well built.  Excellent performance on the highway but this vehicle has one major problem- the tranny.  In the city, it is not nimble enough to weave in and out of traffic.  It is hard to control.  Too fast or your punching it to switch gears. The acceleration is inconsistent. (I understand they changed this in the 08) The tranny takes forever to decide which gear it should go into and this creates lag.  If you are accustomed to high performance cars in the city, you will feel this. Likely to save gas, the tranny shifts up too quickly and down late in normal slow city driving.

I have also had to replace the rear cup holders twice which inexplicably jammed in the console. If you are thinking of the 6 cylinder, then buy an Acura. Porsches are meant to have 8 cylinders.

Strong, powerful & fast, the Cayenne S combines good steering feedback with excellent (sometimes squeaky) brakes. At 5300 lbs having all these benefits is fairly amazing. The ride is stiff, but that is a trade-off for exceptional cornering. The tiptronic is the best auto-manual tranny I have used. I really enjoy making the gear changes myself. If you want the best acceleration out of this car, changing manually is a must. I have already added precat bypass pipes, giving 17hp over stock.

The Cayenne S is the best balance of the 3. The Turbo is just unbelivably fast, but the suspension seems to have a difficult time handling all that power; even feeling a little torque steer. The V6 is just that, a V6. Go for the S. It is plenty fast for US market, and affordable when you run the numbers on a lease.

I like driving the car, but I've had a lemon and after wrestling with it for three years, I'm giving up.  Three Porsche dealers within 1 hr and I'm on a first name basis with each.  I've read other posts and it would appear that '05 or newer might be the fix, but this vehicle has been a nightmare from day one.  Fun to drive, and GREAT control in winter weather.  Also I would be remiss if I didn't say, I was disappointed in the 6 cyl.  I went that way for fuel efficiency and it does well.  It's just to much of a sacrifice to give up the 8 cyl.",3.25

For its size, it should not be possible to move as efficiently when prompted by the right, or even the left, pedal. Interior is beautiful. Nice lines and great color of black with aluminum accents, very sporting. Really do enjoy driving this car every day. Often take this car out on trips over the 996, and not due to the weather. So glad that we decided on Porsche over the VW. Extra payment well worth knowing I'm driving the best of the best. No regrets. Great handling in wet weather. ",4.875

I also have it's baby sister in a 2004 911, 996 cabriolet turbo.  They both have great handling in all situations. The power of the Cayenne is remarkable and it is a joy to drive at high speeds. The Cayenne Turbo ""eats"" rubber with tires, all four lasting only about 6,000 miles. This appears to be typical of this model and it doesn't matter whether it has winter or summer tires - they all get eaten up by just cruising. I've tried Pirelli, Michelin, Continental and all the same wear problem - they wear out far too soon.

It probably can out run 70% of the sports car on the road and at the same time, I have carried 8 tires (255/55 18) with the rear seats folded down.  I have had no problems at all with the snow tires and winter driving / skiing trips, etc.  Theh Cayenne is the king of SUV hands down!

In my opinion, for an oil change to take over an hour (resulting in a bill of over $200) is unacceptable. This problem could be fixed by better design of the underbody allowing for easier basic maintnence. In addition, Tiptronic system sometimes kicks in at random.

The maintenance costs are very high ($400 for an oil change for example) because it is a ""performance vehicle"" when in fact it is slower than a Jeep Grand Cherokee.   Another disappointment was when using Apple Carplay, the controls on the steering wheel for skipping to the next song (if you configure the spare button for that) do not work.  Neither does making phone calls - you have to use Apple Carplay via the touch screen unless you unplug the iPhone and it falls back to bluetooth.  There is also NO place on the center console to put stuff like your phone (and my iPhone Plus doesn't even fit in the center console compartment so I have to just put it on the passenger seat when I have it plugged in for Apple Carplay.)",3

There are many problems highlighted online that the paid test drivers won't tell you. Driver controls and gauges are very poorly placed and designed.  Passenger side dash is an  obnoxious protrusion and hazardous in even medium sunlight. Engine and drive line require software updates that customer service and most dealers don't want you to know about.  They are covered under warranty but very expensive out of warranty.  Transfer case issues are common. PCM issues are mysterious. Tire and brake wear are far worse than competition.  STAY AWAY from the 17 and 18 Cayenne.,2

Figured I'd get all the important stuff, and thought I did.  Guess you have to ask every question.  Just because the button in the car says it has voice control doesn't mean it does.  Found out the hard way.  Very difficult to operate all the technology, like hands free phone calls and navigation with the car moving if you don't have the voice control.  Can't turn off the navigation once it has started.  No on/off button for the heat/AC system.  You have to click the fan up or down multiple times to turn off.  Annoying!  In such a high-end car, I'm VERY disappointed by the controls and lack of inclusion of the Voice Control.  AND, it can't be retrofitted after the fact.  I do like the keyless entry/start, the headlights that turn when you turn the wheel, the shades on the back windows, the extra side shades on the front windows, and the backup camera and front parking warning systems.",4

For interior, Cayenne hybrid build quality is great. The car had practicality in mind without overdone and over engineering. I would consider MB interior are overdone with too much distraction, Tesla features are over-engineering. I am OK with some of the plastic on the switches. That's how you keep the weight down. It is not Rolls or Bentley nonetheless. For performance, the acceleration is good(about 5.4s from 0-60). Brake is very sensitive. For reliability, I expect Porsche reliability is great. So far, no problem what-so-ever from my car. So, I will consider it excellent. This car has a very steep learning curve, it can achieve most of the stuff it promised, but you just need to take some time to learn and understand how this machine work. For example, one reviewer complain that the in-car navigation cannot be cancelled. Actually, it can be cancelled pretty easily. just wave you hand in front of the navigation. The proximity sensor will bring up optional choice to cancel the current destination. Climate control is automatic. you can turn off the AC with the AC button. Heat will come-in automatically once you set the temperature. So, I am very pleased with its comfort during the harsh winter. Fuel economy is also great if you know how to use it, cruise control on high speed can save you a lot of fuel, especially during downhill and soft braking. I only refilled my tank 6 times from initial 100 miles in odometer(I admit I charge my car a lot). 1 tank of fuel supposed to last for 400 miles only. I especially like the full electric mode that is literally like a second set of engine that you can use in most light weight short distant city driving.  With my current driving habit, I expect this car to last for a long time. Porsche engineering is up there, you got what you pay for, for such powerful and complicated machine, you have got to take some time to learn how to use it properly. One last thing I want to say is, Cayenne hybrid is like having an option to drive a hybrid or a Porsche. If you drive like a hybrid, it delivers great fuel economy and quiet comfort, don't expect super fast acceleration and exciting throttle noise in this mode. If you drive like a Porsche under sport plus mode, it deliver great handling and good acceleration, but the fuel economy will not be good(~23mpg in pure gas engine). With Porsche, you are the driver with options.",5

Brakes cost $1400 every year. The 60K mile service costs $2500. Things start to break that are not covered by 100k Porsche maintenance warranty at average of $1800.

Thank goodness for the Cayenne. It has plenty of room for the field hocky sticks and gear, yet when Dad wants to recall his younger years, the performance is great.  The styling is sophisticated for a night on the town but not over done.  The acceleration and handling are truly like a sports car with the practicality and benifits of an SUV thrown in.

I put 20"" technos with 275 Michelins on mine for non-winter driving (which are specifically designed for this vehicle's suspension and rated at 186 mph) and the Cayenne is transformed to near 911 handling - what a difference, not that the 18"" 255's are bad.  These tires are a must have for the true performance seeker with $5,000 to spend on great fun.  It is hard to get my PSM to kick on, wet or dry, with these on!

I have had absolutely no problems except that the navigation system stopped working right after purchase, the dealer replaced entire PCM system. It is the best handling vehicle that I have ever owned, although ride is a little stiff for touring.  I wish I got the adjustable air suspenson option.  The V8 engine is fabulous, smooth, and has excellent acceration. It gets acceptable gas mileage. The PCM system with navigation, satellite radio, and Bose sound system are all top notch, although the navigation system is more difficult to use than Acura system. I am happy that I purchased mine with the smooth leather and burl wood options.  It has beautiful fit and finish. All in all - this is an excellent vehicle!",5

Have had the Yukon, Acura MDX, Lexus LX 470, Cadillac Escalade and desired something sporty with SUV traits.  I test drove an S but wanted the extra punch of the Turbo.  The dealership worked hard to meet my price demands and satisfaction.  This truck is very controllable at all speeds (even at 120).  Its engine begs to cowl for you and to be driven fast.   I would not advise the Turbo for my wife or a soccer Mom...stick with the S or V6.

Mostly small warning light problems but also an amazing number of recalls - I think 6 to date, mostly software upgrades.  We now have a home in the Canadian boonies and unreliability plus no spare means this car is to be changed for a Lexus LX 470  To be fair the Toronto service shop has been well above average in looking after us but at the end of the day I want the car on the road, not in the shop.

Not to take anything away from the Tiptronic, but this is a drivers car, shift it yourself. Not that my wife minds being a passenger - she definitely doesn't. Firm, stable, & comfortable, not floatly; just what I expected. Good hauling capacity - not the biggest in the SUV world, but just fine for our needs.

Had a radar detector installed so I have only had her up to 120 but she still had power to spare.  Love the interior, I opted for the exterior mounted tire which I think makes her sportier. Gas mileage is around 13 mpg but didn't buy her for the gas mileage but still gets more than an excursion.  Handles every bit as well as a Porsche should especially since its an SUV.

Researched local mechanics to see if I could purchase my own parts for installation and there are many former dealer mechanics that understand the logic.  Have replaced all filters, and front pads with rotors just to be sure.  Change my own oil (you tube).  Still running orig. plugs at 66k, it's normally aspirated and the mpg (17.5 overall) suggests the logic holds, esp. with a smooth idle.  Had an X5 for a decade and averaged 16.5 with 225hp and a six, this 400hp eight screams, you can toss your blue pills.  I drove the six but a buddy told me to drive the eight before pulling the trigger and I'm still thanking him two years later, for a one mpg difference this bad boy is oh so light it's feet.  (n.b. i'm running regular gas only)  The Bose is more than you need, you may hurt yourself with it but Floyd never sounded so good.  At night on the interstate at 80 with the stereo tuned to your liking you are there, where there is, is your own personal choice but it's probably near your glory days.  I have never spent as much time in the 90's inadvertently, you'd best set the cruise.  Fit and finish is boffo, rubbed this out with Meguiars compound and waxed it and the metal flake gray is an inch deep, like nothing I've ever owned.  I'm a big guy and this thing swallows me whole, don't know about the back seats but my passengers are all smiling.  Paid 36k, bought a 4 year bumper to bumper for 3600, piece of mind baby!

With 500 hp, it accelerates 0-60 in about 4.4 seconds and there is zero turbo lag at any time.

The 16.35 mpg over the 22K miles I've been tracking it on a spreadsheet is 0.45 mpg less than what the trip computer has calculated. It requires 93 octane like all Porsches, so if you live in an area where 91 octane is the highest available, the ECU will not nearly give you the acceleration performance that this car could give you. Reliability has been relatively poor. At 35K, it needed a driveline transfer case and controller as well as a sunroof controller. Having the front brakes (rotors and pads) replaced was around $1950 - whoa! There is no oil dipstick; once the car has been driven a little while, a dash view of oil level can be seen in a submenu.

With 520 hp, it accelerates 0-60 in about 4.2 seconds and there is zero turbo lag at any time. One big advantage of this model is the buttons on the console that allow the climate for driver or passenger to have air flow exactly as they wish in any combination of air flow outlets. The Bose sound is very good, way better than the Harmon Kardon in our two Mercedes cars (wagon and CLS) that have the weakest bass sound ever. The navigation system works well - this car doesn't have voice control (Mercedes nav is horrible). Heated steering wheel is very comfortable in the winter. The 15.6 mpg over the 8900 miles I've been tracking it on a spreadsheet is 0.3 mpg less than what the trip computer has calculated. The EPA, which always overstates mpg, has it rated as 14/21 for city/hwy. It requires 93 octane like all Porsches, so if you live in an area where 91 octane is the highest available, the ECU will not nearly give you the acceleration performance that this car could give you. Reliability has been fine so far (expect to pay about $2K when the front brakes (rotors and pads) are replaced). There is no oil dipstick; once the car has been driven around 10 miles, a dash view of oil level can be seen in a submenu. This has averaged needing a half-quart of Mobil 1 5w-40 added every 870 miles, which is about normal for their twin turbo V-8. Cargo space in the rear is fine for us - it carries a few golf bags, etc. and has WAY more trunk capacity than the Macan or Audi Q5. While I'd love a Macan, they're just too small in the cargo area and the front leg area is too short for me. One problem with Cayennes is removing the retractable cargo cover shade entirely out of the bracket that holds it in place. It is a ridiculously tough chore! This '16 has the sport exhaust option and the sound is quite exciting outside the vehicle, but you barely hear it inside - it sounds much more thrilling on this V-8 than on the Cayenne V-6 loaner I got. While we have a locking differential control, we've only used it a couple of times while clambering up a snowy, pine-covered trail to a camp. If you really need that go anywhere capability, I'd guess the Range Rover would be the one to get. This came with summer tires - as soon as it got cold I took them off and put on all-season tires on the 21 inch wheels. The ride would be a bit more comfortable on rougher roads with smaller wheels. The LED low beam headlights have a sharp cutoff - I'd prefer them to light up more of the road in front of us. There is an extremely annoying start/stop function - even though we turn it off, the '16 resets itself to ""on"" each time the engine is turned off. That split second, when you don't realize the start/stop is functioning and you're turning left while seeing oncoming traffic, and you'll understand what I mean. You're saving a few cents a week in gas but the starter is being used 20 times a day - what'll that Porsche starter cost to replace after the warranty is up? This has parking sensors front and rear that work very well (those in our Mercedes are useless), and the blind spot monitors are good too. Fortunately, the cruise control is NOT the adaptive option - I do not like those. Heated and ventilated seats work very well in front - the rear only has the base heated seats. Transmission has worked flawlessly so far.",5

The breaking system is unbelievable precise (also very expensive to replace via the dealer) the infotainment and interior design is that of airplane if your familiar Porsche then its pretty easy if not it could get confusing. Sometimes I wish the in dash screen could be a little bigger. For the size of the Cayenne the trunk space is kind of disappointing barely can hold anything . I was so use to my range rover being a rough off road vehicle so nyc potholes didnt really bother as the air suspension would absorb the bulk of it in the Porsche the suspension is more tuned for performance so I feel more of the road while driving.The handling on this vehicle decent its not better than BMW around corners but does a good job  All in all its a great performance SUV for a good price just a little pricey on maintenance if I were to do it all over again I probably would go up a model to the S or GTS thats just the inner speed demon in me though,4

This car has so many design flaws that a light hit to the rear end and the car should be totaled.  It's engineering is so poor that they put the battery under the seat and access to exhaust required too much labor to include removal of a body panel.  The seat just from a mediocre accident caused the rear passenger seats bolt that secures them to the floor break.  Mind you the airbags did not even go off in this accident.  That same tap to the rear caused a total of 4700.00 worth of mechanical damage due to the horror story of engineering.  Take a pass on buying this it is going to be a Fix or Repair Daily vehicle.

The results with the Cayenne can be fantastic.  The Cayenne handles unbelievably well for an SUV/CUV.  The turning radius is likely the tightest I've ever experienced for a car, truck, or SUV.  We ended up purchasing the e-hybrid because most of our driving is local (less than 50 miles) and the hybrid offers excellent overall MPG (~45 to 50 MPG) while still providing enough power and torque (along with the legendary Porsche handling) to make driving fun.  This is our first hybrid and having previously owned a Tesla Model S, I can honestly say that the instrumentation in the e-hybrid Cayenne is comprehensive, logical, and very well thought out.",5

Ordered exactly what I wanted and was able to track on the boat from the factory. The first 5 months of ownership was great. The lime green brakes were very eye-catching. The mileage was great.. Based on my driving pattern, was able to get about 50mpg. The only complaint was a noticeable lag on acceleration when going from electric to gas when the battery was drained but that was not a big deal. Then at about month 6, the engine light came on for no reason. All the other gauges were fine and the car ran well. Brought it into the dealership for servicing. They ran their diagnostics and said that there was a valve that had to be tightened. They did that and the car ran ok for about a week then the engine light went on again. Brought it back in and they had to change out the valve. Got it back and then a week later, same thing again. Brought it back in again. This time, they had to change out the whole system there. So far, no problem there. However, tire got slashed one day at office by bored high schoolers walking through parking lot on way home from school. Called AAA. Come to find out that the hybrid do not have spare tire because there is no space secondary to battery. Then had to wait for flat-bed tow truck in deserted parking lot at night. Just something to keep in mind if you are researching cars these days. Porsche hybrids and their sport cars will not have spare tires. I have owned lexus, audi, mercedes...never have had this much trouble with a new car!!After having the car for a year, I have had no further problems. I plug in pretty consistently and, based on my driving habits, still get about 45-50mpg. There is a definite lag going from electric to gas. Knowing that, I turn off the electric mode purposefully when I know that I have to accelerate fast. It does not accelerate like my husband's Tesla but overall nice ride.",3

Bought new Aug 2014 4 weeks later left me stranded 150 miles from home (bad computer connector) Terrible and expensive dealer service. I've had it to 3 different dealers, all pretty much the same. $300. for an oil change, $300 for wheel alignment. Porsche requires oil changes every 5,000 miles but Audi requires oil changes every 10,000 mile on the same engine which Audi makes.My Cayenne has the Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS). The system has great features but are dangerous on hilly terrain. The headlights have a sharp cutoff at the top of the beam so when you approach a hill, you can't see beyond the base of the hill. I drive in an area with a lot of wildlife and I have to drive slowly, that's not what I bought a Porsche for. Dealer says the lights are per factory specs and they can't do anything about them. Porsche refuses to do anything. Another issue Porsche refuses to do anything about, the speedometer reads high, between 6% and 8%. The dealers tell me all Cayennes read the same as mine. Quite a scam, people think they are getting much better gas mileage and everyone gets shorted on their warranty (odometer shows over 50,000 miles but you actually only have 47,000 miles.On the plus side, it rides and handles great and has the best seats I've ever had. It pulls my 6,000+ pound boat with ease. Mileage on the diesel is great (I get around 30 mpg highway factoring in the odometer error but $600. in oil changes in 10,000 miles more than negates the advantage over the gas engine. They have not corrected the pollution issue with my diesel yet so I don't know what affect it will have on my mileage or use of adblue.Update, they have performed the Diesel fix to make the vehicle compliant with emission standards. The engine still runs well but the transmission is not as responsive as it was so you don't get the instant surge of power as before. The vehicle has been 100% reliable since it stranded me a month after purchase. Porsche still refuses to do anything about the unsafe headlights and the grossly inaccurate odometer and speedometer. Porsche got caught in one scam (Dieselgate) but is still getting away with the inaccurate speedometers and odometers so people think they are going faster and getting better mileage than they really are.",3

Cayenne obviously much more sporty.  Ride on stock 21"" wheels/tires pretty stiff, even with diminished tire pressure. I sprang for 19"" winter wheels/tires (Blizzaks) and ride much smoother.  Acceleration, braking, handling are all insane--hard to believe you're driving a 2.5 ton SUV.  What's not to like?  Not much.  Rear visibility stinks (but Lane Change Assist is nice).  Ambient interior lighting OK for city but need to turn off on lonely highway at night.  Seat memory function on key kind of finicky--need to insert key, wait for seat to adjust, then start, otherwise seat will stop adjusting when you turn ignition.  Girlfriend complains about difficulty getting out but when I help her exit I get a nice view, and get to act like a gentleman in the process.  Fuel economy stinks, if it's anything like the GL550, it's gonna eat tires every 20K or so and I'm sure repair bills will be breathtaking.  If you get a Porsche and then complain about things like that, well, might be time to trade it in.Update:  Took a 2000 mile road trip and performed well. Nice cruiser when suspension set to ""comfort"" mode. On a long highway cruise with speedo set @ 78mph, got 22 MPG.  Could use more storage/cupholders in the center console and less switches.  Some of the metallic trim on the dash, vent covers, etc. can reflect sunlight and be irritating.  Wish the sun visor extended so that when it's moved to cover the driver side window there wasn't a 2"" gap that the sun *always* seems to find.  Minor issues but other manufacturers have figured out ergonomics.Update: Just turned 30K. Changed spark plugs, cabin & engine air filters, and transfer case fluid myself. Have not had any transfer case issues. Installed secondary cat bypasses... nice sound! Summer tires replaced at about 18K, with Michelin, didn't like OEM PZeroes.

I'm not a huge fan of the orange wheels or sticker, but lucky for me those wheels and stickers were long gone when I got the car last year.  I had it checked out prior by Porsche service and their comment was that the mechanics of the car were spot on.  The odometer had just tripped 150k and this thing drives like new.  Sport mode is so much fun and sounds great.  This car gets a lot of compliments and I've enjoyed every minute with it.  The interior with the Alcantara is sporty but luxurious.  Passengers say it is very comfortable, in the back as well.  The interior is tastefully accented with the orange on the dials, floormat trim, door trim, and seatbelts.  My personal favorite is the panoramic roof and shade.  The interior noise is what you would expect from a sports car, even as an SUV.  It's relatively quiet but under throttle and at speed there is a small amount of noise.  The Tiptronic is easy to use on the steering wheel or by using the shifter.

This is not my first purchase.  They build a top quality car. The comfort, fit and finish on this car are all outstanding.  However, the enormous disappointment is the performance as a energy efficient hybrid vehicle.  While the press and Porsche engineers report up to 22 miles of pure electric range, driving as carefully as is possible and using hybrid 'sailing' practices and light regenerative braking techniques, I am only getting a range of 11-12 miles of all electric operation on flat roads.  This is by far the biggest disappointment of this car.  Porsche dealer technicians admit it is on the low end but still assert the battery performance is ""within range.""   I have since read that performance on hilly terrain can be as low as 9 miles of all electric range.  Porsche should not have released a hybrid until they were able to deliver better performance metrics.  While, I realize that it may be unreasonable to expect an all electric range of 40 miles for a 4600lb car, their suggested top end range of 22 miles is the performance that should be delivered  consistently.  In this respect, the Panamera Hybrid falls far short of delivering value and the desired effect of a sustainable driving experience for the normal local short driving distances.  Historically, the mantra and philosophy of this Company and its founder was to deliver best in class, but they have clearly missed the mark on this car. Hopefully it is not a sign of things to come for a great legacy brand.",3

1146, on 07/24/18 18:41 PM (PDT),David Chen ,2018 Porsche Panamera Sedan 4S Sport Turismo 4dr Sedan AWD (2.9L 6cyl Turbo 8AM),Personal review of the 4S Sport Turismo," Starting off, the looks on this car are gorgeous. It stands out from the crowd of ""boring"" looking cars and can give you some unwarranted attention on the road or driving in town. Most people won't know that the car is a Porsche however they'll know when they hear it. So my car: a Panamera 4S Sport Turismo (a mouthful to say haha) is Volcano Grey Metallic with the 21 inch high gloss black rims. It has the standard interior in black (enough for me as there's still leather everywhere in the car), Surround View Camera (360 degree camera system that I highly recommend getting if you don't want to scrape your front bumper or expensive rims), Sport Package (which includes the sports exhaust system in black **when put into sport or sport + the car pops and crackles on each up shift and downshift, sport chrono pack **makes the car faster with a faster 0-60 and higher top speed @180mph, and rear axle steering **a must for such a large car like this). I recently picked up the car this month of July 2018 and have already driven nearly 800 miles on it. Talking about the driving dynamics, the car handles so smoothly and there is no transmission out there that shifts as quick or as smoothly as the PDK. The Sport Turismo (fun fact) comes standard with a 3 level air suspension. If you're wondering how much of a lift the car can get, it is approx 0.5 inch or more. With the sport chrono option, you're also able to do launch control (and don't worry, you can do this an unlimited amount of times) which is an exhilarating experience. Moving onto the interior and daily usability of the technology inside. At first, all this tech can seem daunting and confusing at times. However, it took me personally around 20-25 min playing around with all the settings to fully understand the car (it's basically a giant iPad). One of the cool things about the navigation is that it can be put into 3D Google Earth mode. It's very easy to input destinations or look for certain places without putting in the destination. For the media, you have Bluetooth, jukebox, aux, Sirius XM, and more.  My car does not have the extra $5k Burmester Speaker system but has the standard Bose system which still sounds fantastic. In regards to daily driveability and interior space, the sport turismo offers a little bit of more room than the standard panamera but has a lower loading height (if you want a more detailed video, I'd recommend watching Doug Demuro's review of the car on YouTube). The car in normal mode is alright and what I would consider to be the ""boring"" mode. The air suspension soaks up bumps very well even with my car's 21 inch rims. In sport or sport plus the chassis and suspension become more stiff and the engine becomes more responsive and ""alive"". I was surprised that even in the most stiff, most fun mode (sport +) that the car still rode very smoothly (props to Porsche engineering). Overall, if you're in the market for a wagon for the family but you still want it to drive like a sports car, the Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo satisfies both aspects.

The car grips the road, including corners, like no sedan I have ever driven. The seats are ultra-comfortable, front and rear.

All the people that said it was so ugly came around when it pinned them back in their seats.  It had the growl, it had the moves, it had the Panache.  So after 8 years and I wanted to trade in my convertible for a Targa I never even envisioned parting with my Panny.  So after not getting to a deal, the sales guy said “if you really want a deal my sales manager is trying to get rid of a new 2017 Panamera”. Now, the 2018’s have been out over six months, I’m thinking who wants some 2017 demo ride.  Well it turns out this 2017 black with all black smoked out accessories had exactly 22 miles on it.  I had to admit it looked go but I tried to fight it.  I thought...my 2010 cockpit would never be matched.  Sliding in, she felt strange.  She turn quicker due to the rear wheel steering.  She felt like a smaller car driving but did not feel small space wise from the inside.  Then she growled when I hit the throttle...they are now piping the growl through the speakers....how sweet.  Oh I miss my cockpit still, my lighted door sills, the window shades I never used, and even that thermal tinting that fails to allow my EZpass toll transmitter but a small cut out to function.  Yea all those little things you love and hate after eight years of a marriage, but they all went poof when while sitting at a light on a gorgeous spring day with the windows down, a guy turning the corner leans his head out the window and says “Boss Car!”  Yes it is and I punch it.",5
1152, on 12/02/17 13:15 PM (PST),AB ,2017 Porsche Panamera Sedan 4S 4dr Sedan AWD (2.9L 6cyl Turbo 8AM),The 4S is marred by a lousy engine, Just replaced my 2017 Panamera 4S for a Panamera turbo. The 2017 and later 4S engine is definitely a disappointment compared to the naturally aspirated V8 of the 2010-2013 model. It is a tiny 2.9 L V6 with twin turbos and has a horrible engine sound and feels very weak until the turbos kick in. It does perform when revved hard but lacks instant throttle response. It let down the whole experience of driving what would otherwise be a good car. The worst aspect is that it is not any more economical than the old V8  and in my experience is a lot thirstier.DONT be fooled by the mpg figures quoted on the sticker. It does NOTHING alike the 21-28mpg quoted. I almost never got over 13 mpg in urban driving and rarely more than 20 mpg on the highway. IN fact many times I got 10 mpg. The problem is that to get any performance from the car you have to rev the engine so hard that the mpg becomes lousy. The small V6 twin turbo is designed to provide great numbers on the govt tests but NOT under normal driving ( remember the VW diesel scandal anyone?- this is similar from the same company!). What a difference the Panamera Turbo model. IT is a 4 L V8 and in a differnt league in terms of engine sound and responsiveness.PLus it gives much better mileage than the 4Sengine despite being more powerful. DO yourself a favor and DONT buy the 4S. You will be throwing a lot of money on a crap engine - not what you want from a Porsche,3

After less than a year of ownership, I had buyer's remorse. The transmission switching gears is prominent both in acceleration and braking. In comparison, the Mercedes-Benz and BMWs I've owned in the past have been silky smooth. Like both Volkswagens I owned during my youth, this car has electronic gremlins. Upon starting the vehicle, the climate control changes its settings at will about once a month.  Every three months or so, the radio will not work until you turn the car off and start it again. As of 2017, my car only has 25,000 miles, yet things are breaking left and right. The horn stopped working after four years. The trim on the driver's window switch broke off.

I know this is the end of the model year, and the 2017s will be out in about 5-6 months.  The 2017s are gorgeous and undoubtedly will sell at pretty much close to retail. Since I lease for business purposes, a 39 mon lease will go by quickly. I never considered a hybrid, but the deal I was given was less expensive than my 2014 Bmw 640i, a car $25000 cheaper on MSRP!  It was a better deal than an M5, S7, and other models in that range. Are the M5 and S7 great cars also? Absolutely!  Either cars will be suitable. However, as much as I think I drive on racetracks , sporty mountain curves, and drag race stoplight to stoplight, I don't, except in my dreams, as I lust over a Ferrari or Lamborghini.  So, to get a car, that easily fits my family of four, without being frumpy, or a luxury barge, this fit the bill. I was even considering an M3, as those cars are affordable and amazing. Sorry, still got a better deal on the S E Hybrid. The gas mileage is in the high 20s around town, and low 30s on the highway.

I have had mine for a little over a month and love it.  I have not driven my faithful 993 (a 1996 Carrera that I bought new) and do feel a bit neglectful about that. The GTS has a naturally aspirated V-8 so there is NO lag at all when you want to go it just takes off.  My wife likes that the back view is similar to a Jensen.  It does have really good headroom and the rear controls are better than other cars I have owned. If you want a terrific toy then NOW is the time to go to your local Porsche dealer and make a deal.  They really need to sell the remaining 2016 and will drop $20,000 to $30,000 off the MSRP.

The interior is reminicent of a jet cockpit.There are many ""hard buttons"" to access features which may seem daunting at first. However, everything is logically placed and easily learned, and makes feature selection much easier than drilling down through computer menus.I have a mixed review on performance. Once the car is rolling, it is superb. However, there is a big catch in my opinion.When pulling away from a standing stop there is a sort of stall/lunge sequence that almost throws you forward then back in the seat. My dealer tells me this is a known issue and likely not resolvable. If so, this is a deal killer.",3.5

Oh, and the gas mileage is great, when you set the cruise.Now, I use it in PCA's autocrosses. Talking about the best of both worlds, WOW. SO glad I choose this model. This is my 14th PORSCHE, I also have a 87' 911 cabrio.It's going on four years now since I purchase this car. There have been absolutely (NO) issues with it, major or minor. I did the 80k and the 100k services on it in December of 2014, and since then I have had the brake fluid changed at Porsche where I live and a wheel alignment did after installing new front & rear tires. I also installed myself, a third center radiator, and the front bumper vent screen kit to keep heavy debris out of the left and right radiators. Then I installed a 2.5 quart deep oil sump to help with the lubrication here in HOT, Arizona! As for running auto X here in HOT Arizona, I can tell you that these two things are needed, to help keep the temps down in the water cooling department as well as the engine oil lubrication department. Other than that, I'm just enjoying it!!!It is Aug 2018 now and I am in the process of replacing the Optima yellow top that's 7 years and 2 months old with a new Optima Blue top marine style battery. The heat here in Arizona continues to eat batteries of any type or sort alive! Also, if you have more than one car in your garage then it is absolutely imperative that you drive all of them as often as you can! Just leaving them on a digital battery maintainer is NOT enough. I also have 3 motorcycles, and recently had a BMW s1000RR cafe bike and a Harley Davidson 1200 Sportster that I got rid of because I didn't ride them enough, but I kept the Harley Davidson soft tail, of which the battery is also going slowly dead because of the heat here in the desert state. The heat just killed the batteries on the other 2 bikes, how much more the Porsche's. What I'm saying is, the 2008 997S is yet still an excellent deal when looking to purchase a used Porsche. My car has no leaks and no problems other that the battery issue which is normal for the number of years since the date on the battery was purchased, June 2011. I highly recommend a Cabrio 997.",5

I feel my 996 is definitely superior to the 993 Porsche I owned previously but its value is about half.  Comparing my 993 with my 996 is like comparing a high school baseball player with a MLB player.  I feel the 996 is superior in every aspect- comfort, performance, reliability, etc.  I've had the IMS bearing upgraded so I have no worries about the car's reliability.  I intend to keep it serviced and enjoy it for many years to come.  Perhaps the same story will be written in years to come like the sudden increase in prices of turbos over the last few years.  The second generation 996's certainly deserve more respect.  During the last year, I've replaced some normally serviced components (spark plugs, ignition coils, oil, coolant) but other than that, just gas.  I found the more I drive it, the better it looks.  Just my opinion.",5
1320, on 12/05/15 09:10 AM (PST),Jeff w. ,2004 Porsche 911 Coupe Carrera 4S AWD 2dr Coupe (3.6L 6cyl 6M),"Best Porsche despite what ""purists"" say"," Internet says these cars blow up but it's just not the issue the purists would have you believe.  Stories stem from early IMS history, but failure rate is really much lower than Toyota and other ""reliable"" manufacturers. This is the car that saved Porsche in 1999. I've owned 2 other Toyotas and have never really had a sports car- Im 60 years old now, not a wealthy person, but mostly been on the conservative side of family car type ownership.I love this car because it is an icon, beautiful, comfortable and untouchable from a performance and racing legacy point of view. I would buy another.Buyer beware however, these cars are often abused, but they can take it like no other make. Personally I think the 996s are one of the best 911 designs, because it was the first  thoughtful departure from the old VW bug aesthetic...from the 1998 models forward, the Porsche became a modern car. Porsche sold more of this 996 series than all other series prior, so they did something very right. Just look at the brand new ones 991 model, they are very similar to the innovative design of Pinky Lai and that design language is carried on today. The 996 headlights were a style complaint from many of the owners of the 1999 model - but Porsche fixed that the following year of the new 911- the design is not ugly (subjective), but again innovative for the time. In fact, the lights came directly from the GT1 high performance exotic Porsche. Then the lights were moved to the Boxster - which preceded the new 996 911 and was considered a good thing. Owners of the pricier 911 didn't want their ride to look like the cheaper Boxster from a distance. Water cooled is a more reliable than the air cooled and interior comfort is on par with modern vehicles. The interior is very comfortable. I drove from Boston to Hershey Pennsylvania - 7 hours and didn't feel stiff or achy at all. Very surprised, but pleased. Only real complaint is that cabin noise had a lot of engine and wheel/ tire noise and can be tiresome after many miles of highway driving. On the flip side it's sound is intoxicating when accelerating and cornering, giving occupants the visceral feeling of driving in a true race car legend. I now have 94,000 miles on this car and this is my daily driver- 90 miles per day all year round. We live in New England where snow and ice is a regular occurrence. Super stable in the snow and wet for such a light car.After all these years, I still get thumbs up from all age drivers and pedestrians. The 4S model (mine) is the Turbo look style so it has all of the great wide body wheel wells, has Turbo (large) brake discs, Turbo clutch, sits very low and was like that stock in 2004. All the rage these days , racer boys slam their rides to the ground for the right stance. Porsche figured that out ages ago and the car still looks and performs better than any modern car today.I've had two main problems though: a torn CV boot on the front wheel viscous drive transmission, caused a bearing to fail and killed my FWD. I replaced that with a used unit for $3K. A recurring thing has been the power steering fluid seems to get low every few months. There are no leaks, but the fluid is cheap enough to replace at every oil change.I love this car. After changing away from the summer sticky tires to all weather radials, the noise in the car is now very tolerable by -10dB from before and the tire wear is superb. Finding replacement parts has been easy for plastic, light bulbs and small parts. Transmissions, glass and remarkably, carpet is hard to impossible to find. Gas mileage is very good at 31 mpg with Premium, and about 23 with middle grade unleaded (89 octane).I frequent PCA club events and car shows as a spectator, but people ALWAYS say you should be showing that car, because it is extraordinary in its lines, color (Midnight blue metallic-special order color and Natural All leather interior) and sound. If you can get one, do it. The 996 is an incredible deal right now because the purists are poo-pooing the water cooled machines driving the price down. Btw: air cooled may be interesting from a design point of view but the reason Porsche is still in business and still the king of racing is because the water cooling allowed more horsepower in a smaller engine size which translates to a better power to weight ratio. Interestingly, new 911's have a smaller block, with turbo and automatic transmissions - because they are faster and again lower power to weight ratio. Still water cooled, just like all other cars on the planet. Whats the point in having a great car and keeping it in the garage? I say get one of these, get a boost to your street cred, have FUN driving EVERY day and enjoy that rush acceleration and flat hard cornering gives you. No one drives this car without finishing the ride with a big grin on their face.  I think that if a car makes you smile after every drive, many years of ownership, many miles, it is a very good value indeed.",5

It has the most bang for the buck without all the added expenses of a turbo which will be my next Porsche, a 993TT. Maintenance has been marginal and fuel economy exceptional for a sports car. Heads turn wherever I go, including from other Porsche drivers trying to fiqure out what type of Porsche I'm driving.  It's a novelity Porsche that packs plenty of horsepower.

I'm trying to convince my wife into getting the Panamera as a ""family car"" :). I average only 18 MPG mainly because the exhaust note is intoxicating above 4000 rpms that you repeatedly max out revs before each shift change.

Most 911s sold are 911S models of one kind or another, which adds $7-8K to the car.  Having come from a 1997 E36 BMW M3, this is a huge change.  You sit lower, steering and suspension are excellent.  The torque is impressive and the engine sound - look out.  It's a daily-driver style car; don't expect it to feel like a WRX with a lowered suspension.  But when you let out the throttle it's fantastic, especially while cornering.  It's a classic design and very comfortable to sit in.

The break-in period is 2k miles and the car has to be driven lightly (under 4K RPM). You'll find yourself parking it at the back of the parking lot to keep poeple from denting the doors. We got one transferred from a different dealer that had Xenon, Bose, heated seats, and a few small options.

The PDK is superb; better than the M DCT on the M4. No lag or transmission issues at all. Beautiful interior—very good 18-way cooled seats. Excellent soft top operation and quality. Excellent room for tall (6’ 3”) and broad men. Engine sound and power on the S model are fantastic. I drove the C4S and didn’t like the “plowing” / handling. Visibility is great too down and not bad at all with the top up provided the mirrors are properly positioned. Maintenance is on you—but oil changes are convenient—air filter change is cumbersome and requires rear fender removal. Driving with the top down is pleasant with great aerodynamics. Top up driving has some road noise but very livable. I enjoy driving in the manual shift mode. The central displays are nice but there is no HUD option as with the BMWs.

The new turbo motor actually gives better low-end power than previous 911s, allowing one to exit corners swiftly.

It is definitely a love-in-or-hate-it  proposition.  The car is powerful, fast, and handles very well.  It is well built and solid — with the possible exception of the materials used on the interior.  However, a small percentage of these cars have experienced catastrophic breakdowns resulting from a failure of its intermediate shaft bearing.  Porsche has settled a class-action brought on behalf of Porsche owners of the affected cars, but some people complain that not all affected Porsches were included in the class.  In any event, a person planning to purchase this car should determine whether or not the car has had remedial action taken with the intermediate shaft bearing and, if not, factor that into the price.  There are fixes for the IMS issue and, indeed, cars that are run regularly and do not sit don’t seem as likely to experience the problem.

One guy I know has an airplane hanger where he stores his numerous cars.  He told me his two favorites were Ferrari 458 and Porsche 911 Turbo S.  So off to Porsche I went.  Drove a base 911 and thought it handled really well but didn't blow me away.  Was told I needed to try Turbo or Turbo S.  Which I did.  I was blown away.  Perfect gestalt of a driving experience.  Bought the Turbo S.  Scary fast.  Like a rocketship.  Have since bought two (one for my wife) Targa 4 GTS 911s.  Not a rocket but plenty fast -- extra 30hp and torque does make a significant difference, and suspension, height, and other tuning make for thrilling ride.

The ride is terrific with sharp handling that is not too hard. The drive feels just like my 2015 Audi S4 with a manual transmission. Turn the stop start function off. It makes for a jerky ride. If you are already spending this kind of money on a Carrera, just spend the extra bucks for an S with a larger engine and more torque. In fact, the S pretty much drives the same as a GTS. I see no real advantage of the GTS except that it will probably maintain its value better. Technology is poor for these cars. Value is all in the engineering and the drive. It is not in the technology or the interior.",3

I bought my 1997 993 C2S, 6-speed air conditioned garage queen from another Porschephile (its an emotional problem).  This is a car that has been truly loved since day one, no rain, minimal sun...presents as new.   I am at 40K miles now, and have had to do a few things like cooling fan items ($1200) and surprisingly an alternator replacement (my first in a 911@ $1300) and updated shocks ($3200), but this is a 21 year old automobile, so what the hell?  Overall, these are exceptional automobiles in every way.  My opinion comes from over a million miles of driving my various 911's of every utility (daily drivers, concours, new purchases, used purchases and racing).  The 993 series 911 are exceptional vehicles of the entire 911 range (1964-present) the 993 have had the benefit of evolving over the prior 3+ decades (1964-1997) and that evolution is to your benefit on almost every angle.   If your concerns are cupholders and such, I think you are looking in the wrong box....these are a drivers' automobile. These automobiles are meant to be driven and enjoyed...(all the while paying close attention!).  I have read where some say the interior is ""dated"",  I think that depends on your perspective.  When I slide into my 993,  I fall back into my late teens, to my 67 911-S, the seats are familiar; the panoramic five instruments present themselves as ""ready"", the gear lever falls to my hand like an old friend and the ignition key is exactly where it has always been... and should be...on the left.  A twist of the key and a marvel of machinery instantly bursts to life and I am off on another soul satisfying rolling adventure.  Life should be so good for all!  I think a 993 which has been properly maintained/serviced and inspected will provide you with the most satisfying and fun automotive experience of your lifetime.  As for expense: ""the only thing more expensive than a NEW Porsche, is a CHEAP OLD Porsche"".  That is a personal quote based upon decades of experience and personal observation. Go forth and DRIVE a 993, you will wonder why it took you so long to do so.",5

(1)Annual inspections by a competent 911 technician are very important for spotting oil leaks, etc., in the early stages. (2)Avoid cars that have been tracked or modified...these can be a money pit for subsequent owners. Otherwise, the type 993s represent the best sports car for the dollar available.    ",4.75

This car is the most fun, best handling and best looking of all of them. The Turbo-look version (C2S) has all the appearance attributes without the high cost of purchase. Being one of less than 2000 made worldwide makes it desireable and consequently is holding it's value better than standard models, which doesn't hurt either. If  this car has a fault, it resides in the difficulty in changing oil filters.

I own a Porsche for its racing history, performance, and responsiveness. The 991 handles as superbly on a road trip at 100 mph as it does on the streets in traffic. The acceleration for this base model is more than enough for where I live in the suburbs. I would recommend the S or Turbo if you need more speed or want to impress your friends.

It's an expensive car that costs a lot for parts, service, etc.  I've had 2, both 2014 a CarerraS and a Turbo S.  I have never had 1 problem!!  I was sent to the Porsche drivers school and found out the cars were all brand new (when I was there) and here's the break in:  turn them over to student drivers who don't know proper track driving and drive the cr@p out of them.  I was told they sell them to selected dealers with full warranty/extended if the buyer purchases it, and all they do is change the oil and tires.   Their purchasers know of this arrangement and there is apparently a waiting list for these cars.  To me that spoke volumes.  My turbo at the track had 139 miles on it (I could be confusing models) and there was not 1 issue the entire day I was there.  If you can afford the price and the prices that go along with such a car, IMHO you can't beat the experience if you like German sports cars.

But unbeknownst to all your daily consumers, The 911's that are worth looking into are ones that are unaffordable to your typical middle class business man such as myself. My particular car was packaged with 20 inch S wheels, 14 way seats, bose, and sunroof. Being a BMW person, I wanted to try something different. After test driving the base 911, it seemed more than adequate. But what I learned later on was this car absolutely sucked!This car was absolutely the worst purchase ever. The lack of TECH, Comfort, Service, and Performance made me dread the payment and the drive every single day.Here's the breakdown:TECH: The car has none. The user interface is so outdated that it made my sister's entry level Lexus look like a futuristic car. Navigation is useless, all buttons are very small and hard to identify, front gauges are blocked by the steering wheel, making it difficult to see how much gas you have and such. Automatic Start stop actually eats more gas then it saves,  and for such an expensive car, you would think that at least parking sensors would come standard.Comfort: NONE. It would be idiotic to take this on a long distance trip. You will find your lower back and legs feeling very sore. Getting out of the vehicle is straining and frustrating.Service: NONE. There is no complimentary service whatsoever, and warranty only lasts for two years. Also car requires service every 10k miles so you will find yourself visiting the stealership or mechanic quite often, spending a lot of money.Performance: The base 911 is not what it claims. at 350 HP and a light body weight, it is underachieving. I went head on with a BMW 335i Coupe and got burned. Literally. Gas consumption is worse then my SUV. No need to elaborate there.Don't get me wrong, if you're in the market for a Porsche 911, its a fantastic car. But just be sure not to get brand new base model. It is way smarter to purchase a pre-owned S or Turbo.Nowadays, the competition eats base 911's for breakfast. Other factory tuned cars come  Cheaper,smarter, faster, comfortable, and nicer looking. Final thoughts, buy used. Do not lease or purchase new. And be sure to test drive the competition.",2

But for $18-$20k you can own an amazing world class sports car by getting a 996.  Other than the controversial headlights and the need to replace the IMS bearing, there is nothing above this car to debate.  These cars will hold their value, and as the rest of the collector car world continues to go up and up in price, chances are good that a welll cared for 996 will go up in the coming years too.",5

Average cost of maintaining it is relative to my 2007 Cayman S, around $1,200 a year. INTERIOR: The refinement of the interior is stunning over the 997 generation. Controls in the cockpit are well laid-out minus the Navigation address input which sucks stupid like a 2005 Infiniti. Aside from that, I found the cabin to be luxurious, stylish, crisp and refined to the highest standard. 14 way seats, cooled seats and the amazing cabin audio from the engine's ""symposer"" system is an orgasmic combination!!! Add the ""Sport Exhaust"" option with the top down and you'll never look at your 'love life' the same again.Transmission?The PDK is what I own.. with Sport Chrono (sport plus) 'paddle shifters'. If you don't have sport chrono on your 991 build then just get a 350Z and give it to your wife. Kidding aside, the difference between Sport Chrono and ""sport"" mode is ridiculously evident. It's like pouring gasoline on a birthday cake... spectacular! The PDK is faster than any manual shifter on the planet, more reliable and unless you're a heel-toe rock star on the track it's just common sense.Cabriolet or Coupe'?The looks are stunning on both. Thanx to the cabrio's magnesium panelled convertible top the continuity of the 991 lines are preserved in rigid form. The available color contrast of body and canvas top can make your 911 stand out drastically. I would suggest dumping the plain fence board wing for ducktail (sport design tail) on the cabrio... it looks much more aggressive.But, no matter what you decide, the cabriolet is an entirely different creature under the sun. It simply screams FREEDOM! You can't beat that no matter what hardtop Porsche you have. Summary:Everyday under a blue sky with a hardtop is another day you wished you had a cabriolet. I know because I've had BOTH. I will never go back to a hardtop and I live in Washington State! The 991/911 is a dream no matter what configuration you get. You're just getting another option of 'awesome' with the cabrio'.",5

Never had these issues with numerous other convertibles. The trim is cheap and the the lether just wears off from low use (I have less than 20K miles on it). Now the latest: my tail light went out.

The 2009 Carerra S is fast as you want it to be and a thrill to drive. The handling is superb and you get the choice of three settings for power and suspension-normal, sport and sport plus. Each one has its individual benefits. The '09 car represents a 'mid-cycle refresh' as they say in the auto business. It is quicker than the 07-08 car and it has direct fuel injection, with 385 horsepower, versus 355 in the earlier car. I can feel the difference, having owned both. I have the optional PDK transmission. Porschephiles can debate auto vs stick for hours on end, but the simple fact is the PDK is faster. If you want fast, it's PDK. If you like the feel, the 'involvement' of the manual, then that's the way to go. I go back and forth on this question, but the PDK with the car in sport plus is in no way a non-involved experience.
