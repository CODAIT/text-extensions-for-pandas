0, on 02/13/18 20:14 PM (PST),BVA ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Very Good SUV," This is an execellent SUV, but you have to know what you are buying. This is not a large car, and it has quirks like all Landrover Vehicles I have had before. The most glaring positives are a very refined interior finish and quality. Very nice use of leather and other materials. On the outside styling is better than any other SUV on the road. The negatives are that the new flashy plastic panels used on the exterior are prone to scratching very easily and they should really be tougher. Even the car wash scratches them without the use of brushes. The tires are prone to quick replacement but have Porche type grip so no complaining here. Braking is excellent, better than any Range Rover before as well as gas mileage. Car, feels like it is supercharged. There is a need for improvement, the leather does not look like it will hold up like previous Range Rovers, and the car needs a bigger cargo area. Options add up quick and this SUV should come in under 49k with options in the next generation, as without doing so really makes the value proposition hard to support.  Note the car should be broken so that it is reliable. You can't drive very agressive for the first 1500 miles. The brakes and engine will not then be smooth.",4

The dealership that I went to was excellent. I went out of state, more than an hour and a half from where I live. I cannot tell you the difference in treatment I was afforded.  The vehicle itself is overall a great vehicle to drive. I previously owned a lr2 before I purchased my evoque.  I have not had any serious issues. My 2 wheel traction lights has come a couple of times while I was driving and has caused the vehicle to slow down to a stop. So far Land Rover dealership, near me, has not been able to find out what the issue is. I think it is a nice vehicle overall.",5
2, on 01/20/17 16:41 PM (PST),Kerry ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus Santorini Black Special Value Edition 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Don't buy this car!!!," This car is a death trap. It has been in the shop more than in my driveway. Too many electrical issues to speak of. Bluetooth replaced and still works when it wants to. Navigation is by far the worst I have ever seen. Oh yeah and the whole shutting down while you are driving on a major highway and locking up for no reason thing. I took it in for the same issue with wanting to stall since the first week I drive it off the lot. I was given the car back numerous times with the ""We couldn't find anything"" speel every single time. It has now been put back in the shop after the 5th or 6th time only now it completely shut off while driving. Then there's the random throwing itself into park and shutting down while trying to pull into my driveway as well. I can go on all day with what a piece of garbage this almost $50,000 vehicle is. The customer service is a joke as well. You will bring it in and won't see it sometimes for weeks. They will lie about not having a replacement vehicle for you to drive and whether you have an appointment or not you will spend a minimum of 4 hrs there. However if for some insane reason you do buy this joke of an suv, when you bring it in take a look around and watch how many cars get pulled up to service while you are there. Some with 13 miles on them not 13000 but 13!!! Too many to count came through and when speaking to the valet they said more cars in service than on the lot. So there ya go. I hope whoever is thinking about buying this pos looks at all the horrible reviews and goes to toyota and gets a real suv.",1

I have had the Evoque to the dealer more than once. I have also changed out my phone thinking it was the phone. The dealership told me they can't find anything wrong yet I have read all over the internet I am not alone. I do a large part of my business on the phone and this is truly unacceptable.,3

I've had no issues or complaints, drives great, feels great, looks great and so far I love it. Brought it in for oil change and they did a s/w upgrade. No issues will keep you posted",5
5, on 09/11/16 14:05 PM (PDT),Mrs. M ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Do not buy!!," I bought the Evoque in a bit of a hurry because we were moving to the mountains and I needed a four wheel drive. I am so sorry that I didn't do any research! I hope these reviews save someone else. We bought the Evoque used with 20,000 miles and a 50,000 warranty thank God. Long story short...at 36,000 miles it had to have front and rear brakes replaced, a new battery and then after I had had it home only ONE week I also had the gear box fault another reviewer mentioned.  It had to be towed!! Thankfully I was not in traffic like the other reviewer!! They said they can't get the part for a month, I still don't have it back. I am really in disbelief over the whole thing. I thought Land Rover was a good brand. I see them everywhere!!?? So if I ever get it back, I am getting rid of it right away of course and at a BIG LOSS!",1

7, on 03/02/16 21:14 PM (PST),Joseph Teyssandier ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),A Ford Escape wearing a dinner jacket.," All looks and no actions. A brand that I always admired Land Rover. My dream SUV turned out to be my worst nightmare and biggest disappointment in the automobile industry. As an avid car fanatic. I've had the pleasure of owning and leasing most of the high end vehicles in the market. From Mercedes Benz to BMW to Lexus both in sedans and SUV's. Until I decided that I was able and comfortable enough to finally afford my first Land Rover product. The 2015 Range Rover Evoque Pure Plus (5door). Well, my biggest mistake. I purchased the entity on 2/26/2015 as a Certified Pre Owned with barely 17K miles on the odometer. The vehicle looked show room condition inside, outside and under the hood. Rich leather scent inside gorgeous full glass roof and one of the most impressive infotainment systems I've ever seen. After driving it home and four days into my purchase I decided to google reliability of said vehicle and under Consumer Reports all reviews were one star and the horror stories were too much to mention from all over the world from the UK to Minnesota all over the US. People just devastated with their experiences A TRUE CAR BUYERS NIGHTMARE. Everything from engine stallings to sudden braking at high speeds causing driver and passengers injuries. To constant Check Engine lights and other notifications of malfunctioning all over the cluster. Repeated visits to the dealership days and weeks without their cars then getting back and the next day the same issues arising and the worst thing was the treatments by the dealer's disconcerting attitude. To the point they said to a particular owner. WELL WE CANT DO ANYTHING ELSE FOR YOU .... CONTACT LAND ROVER. After coming across this unexpected and disappointing horror stories I decided to return the Evoque just today 3/2/2016 on the fifth day and I was fortunate enough that the dealership has a FIVE DAY Return/Cancel or Exchange Policy. So I got my 2014 Mercedes Benz E350 back (Luckily again it had not been sold yet) got my title back and PUSHED THE PEDAL TO THE MEDAL. Like a bat outta hell I rushed home. I was one of the lucky ones. Shame on you LAND ROVER and JAGUAR brand. You're selling RATS WRAPPED IN MINKS. Disappointed.",1
8, on 10/19/15 02:32 AM (PDT),Melissa ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Hands Down Safest SUV," I leased a 2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque (Pure plus with options) in February 2015. It had some software issues during the first month (key was locked inside vehicle so that was an issue that needed to be addressed early on) but the dealership was very accommodating. I never had an issue with the Evoque after that. I do find that a bigger engine would be better because it is a big sluggish to take off. It handled the road very well and it was a very smooth ride as well. It had very good gas mileage especially on long drives. Entertainment system is great!****The most important thing that I will tell you is that 2 weeks ago, this truck was involved in a rollover accident and it was considered a total loss. Injuries to myself and the driver were very minimal as we walked away from the scene with minor injuries (cuts and scratches). For that very reason, I am going to get another one. I deem this to be a very safe vehicle. Don't take for granted the safety features in the truck. They work!",5
9, on 10/01/15 16:13 PM (PDT),Lynn C ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),I expected so much more!," First the good:  This is a great looking car and there are so few on the road I feel special driving it.  Also, it handles quite well in snow and ice.The bad:  It's small, you can't close the trunk from the inside of the car, the navigation system is horrible (I've been routed to dead ends more times than I care to recall), the front seats have no lumbar support, the rear window is way too small and the transmission is jerky.  The front console is too small and there are too many controls on the steering wheel that could adversely affect driving.  The ugly:  New front and rear brakes and tires required after only 25k miles!   Cost of routine maintenance is ridiculous, and the excessive number of software updates required is unheard of and take FOREVER. Unless you like spending time at the service center and wasting money, move on to something else.",3

11, on 09/02/15 18:43 PM (PDT),Wakes ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus Fuji White Special Value Edition 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Unreliable Slug," I purchased my Evoque new in February 2015.  Since the vehicle was purchased it has had a software update (at 1200 miles) for the transmission to improve performance.  Then the check engine light came on at approximately 2K miles.  Turned out to be a faulty sensor that took several days to repair, due to part being unavailable.  On August 1st, while in traffic the transmission froze up and the vehicle rapidly decelerated with the dashboard warning indicating ""Gear Box Failure"", resulting in the vehicle being towed.  Land Rover corporate claims they have since resolved the problem with another software update, however I have not had the opportunity to drive the car yet-33 days later.  While the dealership was addressing another issue- freeze up problem with the touch screen interface; the computer module blew out.  After 33 days the part has finally come in.  The transmission on this vehicle is very sluggish in the lower gears, and power is very limited from a stop position, which makes pulling out into traffic a challenge.  I really would love to recommend this vehicle, but the amount of problems and poor transmission and acceleration make this a poor and hazardous vehicle to own.  It does get good mileage, when working. I have never experienced a new vehicle with so many issues in such a short period. Land Rover Corporate's attitude has been less than overwhelming. Extremely disappointed in the vehicle and the corporation.",1
12, on 08/22/15 16:28 PM (PDT),Cliff ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Stylish SUV," The Evoque is a fun car drive.  It looks great inside and out.  The ride is comfortable most of the time, although larger bumps are not suppressed.  It is a great handling SUV.  My gas mileage is about 21 in mixed driving, although the Evoque on board computer says its 23.  The transmission has 9 speeds, and it can take a second for it to find the gear you want in comfort mode, it reacts faster in sport mode.  The paddle shifters work well.  I would not recommend this as a family SUV it's too small, but if it's just you or just you and a friend or spouse, it's a great size.  The panoramic sun roof is a great feature at night or when it's not too hot out.  The stereo and navigation controls can use some improvement, they are slow to react to touch.  The climate system is excellent.  Overall, after one month and a thousand miles, I'm happy with the Evoque, it could use some updating in the electronics, and the gas mileage could be better, but I just enjoy driving it.",4
13, on 08/04/15 20:23 PM (PDT),James ,2015 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV Pure Plus 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Not that impressed ! 11 month update!," Okay, never wrote a review before so here it goes, I hope this helps others.I'm comparing our new 2015 Range Rover to our 2013  GLK 350. They both costs us about the same. We wanted to try the new Range Rover this time around. Let's start with the outside, we love the look however, no roof racks. You have to buy them at about $1400. The GLK looks like a family car while the Rovers lines look clean and stylish.The cargo door opens with the remote however, you have to push the button on the tailgate to make it close. The GLK you can just use the remote to open or close. The interior, the cargo bay is a lot smaller then the GLK. The driver seat feels okay not great. The finish work inside compared to the GLK , the GLK wins hands down. The steering wheel feels off, not sure why just yet. I can't put it into words, it just feels off. The sound system lacks just about everything, don't plan on rocking out while driving.The take off is good for a 4 banger, yet the transmission shifts hard in and out of gear at times. The interior noise level is a lot louder then the GLK. The GLK has a nice wood finish while the rover is plastic. The backup camera sucks! seriously guys you need to give this some real attention. The ride? This is where the rover is really lacking when comparing it to the GLK. If you hit a good size dip in the road plan on losing your back molars, felt more like a tank then a luxury rover. I'll update this after I take it off road. The rover feels light and you feel more of the road while the GLK is a much smoother ride. The navigation? This is a 50/50 the GLK navigation has no clue what I'm saying and there has been more then one time when I wanted to tear it out of the car over frustration. The rover map it tough to follow because it show you going north, south, east or west and you can get spun around looking at the map. The controls on the steering wheel are terrible on the rover. Don't push too hard on the volume or you will change the radio station, very frustrating, and no mute button. The back window is tough to see out of. The lane assist is on the weak side. The GLK makes a noise inside if you try to change lanes with a car in the blindspot, the rover just blinks,,the GLK one has saved my bacon more then once. The rover does have sensors that let you know you are too close in the front and rear while parking. The GLK does not, if it did my wife would not have backed into another car! The Bluetooth for your phone. Your really going to have to have some patients with the rover, you say a command, the command comes up on the screen and it ask you is this the correct command, it takes forever to get though the commands to make one call. The GLK just say a name and it makes the call. Feels like talking to a 5 year old with the rover, don't have too much coffee when asking the rover to make a call or you may end up losing it? this clearly needs some work.So why did we buy the rover? I lease a new car every 30 months and we really wanted to try the new rover. The new GLK won't be out until 2016 and I never want the first year of a completely new car. Just from the two weeks having the new rover and driving both side by side I'll most likely go back to another GLK after this lease is up. Glad this is my wife's car!Update after 11 months. Off road? It is very capable, my only complaint was all the cameras coming on, this is a great feature I'm just not sure how to use it yet. We were having a warning message coming saying all wheel drive not working, after four times in the dealership they got it fixed.The key fob stop working one day and I was stranded with no way to start the car. They sent a tow truck, at least their services department is on it and will take good care of you.As I mention previously the GPS in the rover sucks! I cannot tell you how many times it has taken me the long way or in the wrong direction completely. Rover services said there is nothing they can do to fix it. Rattles? This thing has on and off rattles that are driving me crazy. And I mean crazy! I take it in for them to find and fix and it won't do it for the dealership. It sucks gas likes it's free. Other then the cool factor of the body I'll be leasing another Mercedes-Benz once our lease is up.  Sorry rover, you guys need to work on your finished product a little better. For the same price I can get a better product. I feel if they make some corrections this could be a great SUV.Hope this helps others",3

My only real issue is that after an hour the seats cause some real sciatica issues.  My previous cars never did that but there is not much padding or cushion in the Evoque seats.  Also, dealership sales person was the worst, minimal knowledge about the vehicle.",4
15, on 03/03/18 07:03 AM (PST),Emily ,2017 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV SE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Really Love My RR!!!," I read another review the really throws this RR under the bus.  To be honest, there are a few quirks that need to be ironed out, but in general I LOVE my SUV.  It feels so solid and stable when you drive it, I do not worry about safety at all.  I live in a cold climate and heated seats are a must, but having a heated steering wheel and heated windshield - OMG! Love. Can't live without. It's true the app for the remote starts is pretty much junk, if they could work on that or offer an alternate remote start - it would go a long way.  Do my tires lose air, yep.  But that is very common in cold climates with this type of wheel.  Just pop into the dealer - they will fix it.  If the brakes get a little salt in them, they are quite squeaky and howly - again very common for colder climates albeit in super annoying.  In the last few sentences, I've told you all my complaints.  That's it. (Except that it does not have a garage door opener in  the mirror and also does not pop up text messages on the monitor - 3rd world problems.)  This SUV is the perfect height off the ground.  Not too low, not too high.  Friends with arthritis cannot say enough about the ease of access.  Winter driving?  Does anyone compare?  It was awesome. Easy. Safe. I would not have a problem lettting my kids drive the RR in a snow storm!   The 11 speaker Meridian sound system is amazing.  The back row seat are FULL SIZE!  Not a little kiddy bench.  Full size means a little bit less leg room, but just pull the front seat up.  My 2 boys, both over 6 feet tall, sit tandem all the time w/o complaints.  Plus the back seats are heated!  Cargo is limited, but still more space than a car. You feel like you are driving a car and not a school bus.  I really appreciate that because 90% of the time it is just me in the car.  I really can't say enough about my RR.  It was my first RR and I have been pleasant surprised.  I guess I thought it was a glorified name, but I was wrong!",5
16, on 01/06/18 22:14 PM (PST),Rick ,2017 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV SE Premium 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Shame on Land Rover," 10 months owned, only 4500 miles, wife does not feel safe transporting grand children to nursery school, truly hates This vehicle.The ‘remote start’ feature is not on the key, ‘remote start’ Only works by iPhone app, has only a 25 percent reliability, and when it does start it does not turn on the climate control; so the vehicle is hot on warm days but more uncomfortably, it is very cold on cold days. A premium ‘cloth’ seat package would be helpful.The seat belts are difficult to reach between the seat and the door; also they are very difficult to get down to the latch/receptacle between the center console and the seat.There is a bright metal strip along the dashboard that reflects sun into the eyes of the front passenger.The tires need to be refilled every 60 days, the wheels are easily damaged due to a poor choice of tires, those wheels will collect snow/ice and will cause a very unsafe ‘bounce’ at 25 mph as they rotate out of balance.Shopping packages and contents will fall out of the vehicle as the lift gate opens.Front brakes are making a medium-pitched ‘howl’ sound, or is it from the back brakes?The value of this 2017 Land Rover Evoque has dropped $14,000 after only 4480 miles on the odometer.  Have been asking Land Rover for help pleasantly,  do not want to be put on a “forum” to evaluate future Land Rover vehicles, would like to receive a proper response from Land Rover … WTF !!    Where is the customer service?“Happy Wife Happy Life”  is not working here.Update:    Two visits back to salesperson, three service department visits ( loaner car given), at least 40 Emails and verbal communications with Land Rover Corporate  about the continued problems  ...  Then, the wonderful and persistent “customer care representative” from Land Rover corporate” made good.        A total of 15 months passed  … received a call from the Land Rover dealership General Manager, had a brief discussion to confirm the dissatisfaction and unresolved problems with the 2017 Evoque vehicle, two weeks later a refund check was issued less a prorated use cost (which was reasonable). The vehicle was turned back to that Dealer and the check was received.    The “experience”  has come to an end. .",1

I know it looks great but don't be fooled. It will not last. In 23 months of ownership the car was in the shop 10 times for repairs. The last repair was replacing the fuel pump and the dealership telling us there were no parts available. Our car sat for almost a week before they could locate the parts. Not only that the dealership advised us is was okay to keep driving it with the check engine light illuminated....can I say daah! Believe us do not buy this car.,2.375

I absolutely love it. I lookd at all the other Compact Lux-Suv's and sure they start at a lower price but once you add comparable options they're all in the same ballpark. This thing is gorgeous,sexy,efficient,roomy and surprisingly peppy. Great for the major city I live in perfect size, but very roomy and luxurious interior. The 2 DR looks sexier but the 4 DR was more practical for me. It's fun and gets looks everywhere it goes. I couldn't be happier, I couldn't wait so I got one off directly off the showroom floor.

32, on 03/16/17 21:23 PM (PDT),Jezabel ,2016 Land Rover Range Rover Evoque SUV SE w/Premium Package 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),"After much deliberation, I'm happy with my Evoque!"," I was looking at waiting for a 2018 Q5 or going back to a BMW X3 (I had had a 2011 and loved it) or an Evoque.  I decided the X3 needs a refreshed look.  The Evoque appealed to me because I wanted 4x4 to drive on the beach.   I was a little skeptical about the mixed reviews I read, but I still wanted it.  So I bought a 2016 with 12k on it that had been part of the dealers loaner fleet.  I didn't want to pay full price for a new one in case I ended up not liking it.  I've had it for three weeks and I am enjoying it.  I don't have any kids and it's usually just me in the car.  The back seat is tight, so it's not so conducive to car seats.  After having the BMW X3 with tech package, I don't know that any car's navigation/entertainment will impress me.  The way it operated with the joy stick was seemless and intuitive.  The cockpit in the Evoque is uncluttered and easy to figure out.  The response on the screen could be a little faster, but I am knit picking.  It works fine.  The navigation sometimes gets you very close to your destination but not quite there and says ""you have arrived, navigation ended"".  But again, it's usually close enough to figure it out.  I would not buy the car without blind spot detection (drivers assistance package) and any camera/parking sensors available.  I had a hard time finding a 2016 preowned with it, but I was determined.  Apparently the way it was packaged in that model year, a lot of people didn't get it.  The blind spot from the rear pillars is significant so you need it.   I didn't get the pano roof just because I was tired of looking and this car had everything else I wanted.  I don't really miss it.  I think passengers enjoy it more as it makes the back feel less clousterphobic.   Pano roof was optional on the SE Premium for the 2016 model.  It comes standard on the 2017 SE Premium.  I did not like the standard wheel, I got the 19"" split spoke.   I got white with the lunar/ivory two tone seat and I love it.  I had thought I wanted almond interior, but I love this.  Gas mileage is poor.  The gauge tells me i am getting 15-16 miles a gallon.  Seats are super comfortable.  Remote start from your iPhone is a cool feature.  Takes a little more time than from a key fob, but it's fine.  There is not a ton of room in the hatchback.  They purposely have a bump out in the interior lining of the hatch to accommodate golf clubs.  If you carry two sets of clubs, you may have to put part of the back seat down.    The engine does shift a little differently than I was used to but it's not bothersome.  The ""waistline"" on the car is high which is another reason cameras come in handy.  I'm enjoying the car.  I like that it's unique looking.  Everything is starting to look the same.  I test drove Mercedes GLC, Acura RDX, Lincoln MKC, Audi Q5.  I did love the Q5, it was very fun to drive; but I wanted to get the Evoque out of my system.",4

Where do I start. If you buy this expensive ""Ford Escape"" be prepared for poor reliability. Really, read the reviews! This poor excuse for an expensive SUV is riddled with quality issues.I wish I had driven it more than a couple of miles on my test drive. It rides as an off roader, it is NOT a cruiser. The lane assistdoesn't work half the time and there is no beep if someone is in your blind spot while using your signal...worthless.The hands free rear hatch requires several off balance swings of your foot before it decides to open.The car has a very heavy understeer. The ride quality is the worst excuse for a 50k SUV. The throttle response is pathetic, because of the worst turbo lag I've ever experienced. The transmission shift points are onlyprecise if you floor it, but why would you....after just 150 miles I achieved a whopping 17 mpg! The manufacturer says 24 combined. Why do you think it comes with an 18 gal. tank?. I returned it and traded in for an Audi. Stupid is what stupid does.That cost me thousands!...its that bad.",2

It took a very long time to get there, but the car now appears to be reliable. It continues to be a pleasure to drive now that it is working properly. I really love my Evoque. Super comfortable and so many hi tech features that put this car in a class by itself. The high beams turn in and off by themselves when they sense a dark road.  The connectivity to my iPhone is amazing and my music effortlessly plays thorough the radio. The rear window is small, but better than you'd have in a convertible and you get used to it right away. Overall, a great vehicle. But the shoddy build really makes one rethink this purchase. My car came with a leak in the AC and spent 10 days in the shop. Then, the entire radio system went out. Got that fixed, too. Then, the map in the nav screen disappeared and it seemed that the car was incorrectly wired. When fixing that, we discovered that half the speakers were not connected. The sound was always terrible and suddenly it was like a symphony. Then the AC lost power (on a 110 degree day of course). More wiring issues. Kudos to my dealer who essentially rebuilt my car. Since then, it has worked like a dream but I have never had such a poorly built car. The factory in England where this vehicle is assembled should,d be ashamed of themselves. I suppose if yours is built right, you'll have a worry free ownership experience but I was not so lucky. They do give you a Land Rover or Jaguar loaner so it could be worse, but I'd much prefer they learn how to build a better vehicle. In balance I love my Evoque so that says something considering my repair history.",4

I couldn't justify paying 10K extra for the Porsche Macan. Sure the Porsche's engine was strong and had better pick up and felt expensive but was it worth 10K more.  I really like my red Eovque and it gets a lot of great looks and compliments.  I would like the pick up to be a little faster in the Evouqe but given the recent news about VW, I would give up power for better emissions. The interior is very nice and feels classy.  i acutally had to read the owner's manual from almost front to back to understand all the features.  The SUV looks comparably small compared to other SUVs and lack of trunk space is noticable (i had a Audi Q5 before).  Overall I am very satisfy with this purchase. i probably paid too much for it but oh well.",4

Please Read.," I purchased a brand new vehicle from this dealership, and unbeknownst to me, the vehicle has a faulty, defective and unsafe transmission.  The vehicle is a Range Rover, Evoque.  The dealership replaced the transmission with less than 10,000 miles on the vehicle.  I wish this was where the story ends.   The problem was not resolved.  The same issues of jerking into gear persisted.  This is scary!!  After the vehicle was returned to me on a couple of occasions, the problem was even worse!! While under warranty, this dealership told me there was nothing else they could do to repair the vehicle, knowing the problem was unresolved.  I was given no recourse on what could be done to rectify the problem.  Unbelievable!Update: 05/27/18I reached out to the CEO, Ralf Speth, no response from him.  As early as March, 2018, this manufacturer had a rating of ‘No Rating’ by the Better Business Bureau.  This business is not BBB accredited.  As in my case, the company did not respond and my case was closed and noted as such.  And at that time in March, it was posted that the business was in the process of responding to previously closed cases.  Their rating was changed to ‘B-‘, they were unable to resolve issues and did not respond in others.  In my opinion, do not be misled by the shiny object and purported reputation.  In my experience, this is a very unethical company.  Yes, things may go wrong with a vehicle.  But be advised, you may not receive the expected treatment that is comparable to the situation with this company.  I have a useless vehicle and the only way to get only part of my money back is to sign a falsely stated proposed settlement that was offered.  If you would like to follow this true story, you can check out my blog at: https://myvehicleexperience.com.  I recently discovered that this company sold over 22,000 vehicles with a defective transmission.  It is outlined in the aforementioned blog.  However, they do not participate in the Consumer Report Annual Customer Satisfaction Survey.  I will cover their response as to why they do not participate in a later blog post.A car purchase is one of the primary purchases one will make in this lifetime.  Please, please do your research.  Days later, I contacted the dealership to ask what could be done, since the problem still existed and the vehicle is under warranty.  With my persistence, I was told that I need to contact the corporate office.  Even though later I learned that this is not their normal protocol.  Normally when they cannot resolve an issue, the dealership will contact the corporate office for guidance.  That did not happen in my case.Long story short, the corporate office has offered nothing but a proposed agreement that does not address the issues they promised to address.  So I am still in possession of a defective vehicle which is still under warranty.I would not recommend purchasing a vehicle from this dealership or company.  I would have never in a million years expected this type of situation, dealing with a luxury car dealership or company.  It’s not only that the vehicle is defective, it’s the process that is being used to resolve this issue.  This nightmare could happen to you.  Don’t take any chances.  Use your power of choice and do your research to support your choice.  A vehicle is one of the largest purchases one makes, and you do not want to have it coupled with such an unpleasant experience.",1

That did it for me! In 2 years time the car stayed in the shop for 45 days. I opened up a claim through the manufacturer and the best they could come up with was we will compensate two months of payments and did not approve a buy back. That is not good enough.

I liked the taller rear window in the Discovery and the cargo area better than the Evoque.  My first test drive I was unimpressed by the car's acceleration. However, after about 30 minutes on the test drive, I noticed the vehicle seemed responsive to my lead-foot antics. At the end of the test drive for the Discovery, I realized it was a very good value for a Land Rover family of cars vehicle.  I purchased my Discovery HSE Sport and have enjoyed it very much. According to the Land Rover Service Manager the vehicle is fitted with ""adaptive driving"" function with the transmission which I believe has caused my Discovery to be much quicker in starting off-the-line acceleration.  The only thing I don't like is the ECO feature which you must turn off to keep the vehicle running at a long stop light.  Otherwise, all is good. I found out the vehicle doesn't come with a cargo cover which is about $400. Nevertheless, I'm impressed overall and now realize I had saved a bundle of cash buying the Discovery over the Evoque. I highly recommend this vehicle.",4

We were going to lease the SE version(lowest end version).  We ended up getting another vehicle because most of the safety features and driver assist technology was absent on the SE model without spending very much more money to have them on this model.  Even the interior was sub par unless we jumped up to the HSE model.  We eventually decided against this vehicle because we would have paid as if we were driving a Land Rover while essentially getting a shell of a Land Rover.  One would expect a vehicle priced around 40K would be equipped with at least as many safety and driver assist features as a vehicle costing 10-15K less.  However, my wife's Mazda CX5 Touring has far more safety/driver assist features and drives just as nicely.

I have taken it to the dealership many times, but to no avail. The other issue with the car is that the inside technology seems dated. The GPS  looks and feels archaic and is full of bugs.

I fell in love with the way the car looks, its road presence and general cache. That is where the love affair ends. Actual gas mileage is abysmal, about 15mpg mixed driving. An NA V6 would get better mileage on a car of this size. The engine does have good torque and get up when the transmission is not getting in its own way so that you can merge or fight to the death on the 405 in intermittent traffic. The interior is very clean and no fuss, which I like, but it is a bit annoying. Since most things are digital, you have to pull your eyes off of the road to get anything done on the screen. I realize this is a trend going forward, but it is making people worse drivers, including myself in this confounded thing. The interior quality is appalling for a car of this price. Its on the level of older Korean cars, no joke. EVERYTHING squeaks, rattles or bangs. The center console creaks every time I accelerate, the rear bench rattles and squeaks on everything but the absolute smoothest road and the tailgate creaks over every speed bump or small rock.

All around visibility is very good. Side mirrors are the best I ever had. Seats feel firm and nice. Feels very spacious inside.  Overall material quality has the luxury feel. I drive to work 16 miles each way - 8 miles highway and 8 miles local. Getting 30-34 MPG combined without A/C. 27-30 MPG average running a/c. 25-28 MPG with family of 4 and running a/c. So, much better than the 20-26 MPG listed. Engine is very smooth except when accelerating very suddenly. Radio / speakers are fantastic at higher volumes and with HD stations. Things not to like - The rear hatch feels flimsy. The panel below the glass squeaks a bit. No CD player. Radio is just OK at lower volumes. Rides a little truck-like.

There is no compass...for a car designed for off-the-beaten-path driving the only way to know which cardinal direction you are heading is to cue up the navigation.  I  miss the simple N/NE/E/S/SE/W/NW display I had on my rear view mirror in my Nissan.2. The Heads-Up display is not bright enough to be seen on a Sunny day, but you will definitely see the reflection/glare of the screen that is generating it. 3. The left-right arrow buttons on the steering wheel do not chose between the 18 preset radio stations instead they act like a radio tuner. (I.e. you end up going thru every single radio station that comes in, instead of the ones you know you want to listen to)  Kind of undermines the idea of convenience that goes with preprogramming your radio stations or putting buttons on the wheel to control the radio.

Managed 30.9 on a long highway trip thru NC mountains! Haven't taken off road yet, but expect to use the 4WD modes this winter.  Interior gets lots of positive comments, rear seats for tall passengers is great. Looked at the Q5/7, Infinity QX line, Porsche Maycan & Cayenne, found the Discovery to fit all my needs for passenger room, cargo area, and towing, as well as fit and finish. Did not expect it to be a speed demon, but the turbo kicks in nicely when needed. Ride is very comfortable on in-town roads, very smooth on the highway and a delight thru the mountain curves.

I am new to the brand as I have been a BMW customer for 15 years. Strayed away from mass German brand and found the smaller production British car to be what I was looking for.  I test drove: Audi Q5, Porsche Macan S, BMW X3 & X4, Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit, and Mercedes GLE300.  After the test drives, I knew the car that connected me to the road: Land Rover Discovery Sport.  Be aware that JLR dealers outside your ""market area"" may not sell to you so you have to ask before negotiating.  I did all my negotiating between 2 dealers via phone, email and text.  Did not have to step inside the dealer's lot - I had already test drove the 2015 model earlier..  As for the dealer, you have to find the one that matches you - they are all different - just like people.  Some dealers are snobby, snooty, rude, and others are very helpful, professional and patient.If you are financing or leasing, it pays to find out what are the best bank rates before you negotiate  Some dealers are forthcoming and will tell you the finance rate or lease residual/money factors.  I dealt with 2 dealers that were very transparent in their sales approach.The car has a bit stiffer suspension than the other cars I test drove, but the connection to the road is more important and the suspension is not jarring - it has manners....The most important feature standard on this car that makes the drive so good: Torque Vectoring by braking.  Torque vectoring makes high speed turns, power acceleration into turns, and off road handling a must have for confidence if you are the driver type.I love the car - it makes me smile again - like I remember when I had my first 4WD BMW.  The Discovery Sport is definitely for someone or a family that wants to travel almost anywhere safely and comfortably.UPDATE: 2016 - New software loaded for the Powertrain and Infotainment has changed the car entirely.  Engine is now very quick to engage with no more laggy acceleration.  The navigation is reliable 100% of the time.  Fuel tank reading is now accurate.  I LOVE THIS CAR !UPDATE: 2017 - Updates for the seat rattles, In Touch controls, Navigation, Auto Start Stop, and service reminder all done at no cost was EXCELLENT.  Good to see JLR changing their way of listening to customers and addressing issues with factory campaigns.  Service dept was very receptive to customer concerns. Good followup after the service work by JLR in England via written survey returned by post.Since I have less than a year left on my lease, I am considering another JLR product to replace the Discovery Sport.  Whilst at the dealer for service, I had a chance to speak to my sales advisor and he pointed towards the Range Rover Velar or the full sized Discovery that replaced the LR4. Both look very appealing and a great way to step a customer from the Discovery Sport.So far very happy with the Discovery Sport and would highly recommend to anyone looking for a driver's car (not a mushy soft car like everyone else).....",5

While waiting 3 months for delivery I was reading the reviews and frankly had been quite worried by the bad press. We also test drove the full-size Sport before buying the Discovery and found the almost twice as expensive Sport to have clunky breaking, albeit a luxurious interior. I had a Mercedes GL450, which we found too hard to get in and out of and quite a sterile interior, and compared to the Discovery it was not nearly as comfortable and the transmission was more cumbersome/computerized than the Discovery…by far. So I don’t get the bad reviews. The Discovery Sport in sports mode is super smooth in acceleration and I have not experienced any of the down-shifting issues mentioned in the many reviews. Granted I live in a small town and I didn’t buy the car based on its 0-60 rating. When I first test drove the Discovery I was taken a bit back by the sparse interior by Land Rover standards, but all the dealer had was black. One also has to consider this is a low-cost Land Rover product. I ordered an SE with a Glacier Brushed Aluminum interior and it was very nice and the steering wheel is much more comfortable than the $75K GL450 with the premium 2 upgrade package I had. On the SE the two-tone roof option was only $350 which really sets it off from the competition for look and feel. We looked at every car in this price range and would recommend it to anyone in this market. Fingers crossed on maintenance, but my CPO GL450 had to have a leaking shock absorber replaced with only 28,000 miles and it was not covered by the Benz CPO and cost $900, so I don’t think Mercedes offers any better in quality.",5

I bought it with a warranty as well as my mechanic went over it and changed the oil and brakes for me. I have the cold package with heated seats as well as heated windshield. Love how high it sits. The ride is awesome. Not quick as the Beamer but I luv the fact you can go anywhere in Style and safety. The previous owner took very good care of it! was not afraid of the miles. It does burn oil. I had to replace a quart before oil change (synthetic)premium gas.Plan on keeping it for awhile.update 9 months with 121k driver window regulator is going out but the truck is sound. Stay on top of maintenance. I plan on keeping this until the wheels fall off. If you find a well taken care of Rover, you will be fine. Update: 150 k no significant work except oil change. Runs great!!will keep until the wheels fall off!!1/25/18",5

I'm really impressed with the overall quality and craftsmanship.   I do my own maintenance so I can't say the repair cost is out of range.  I would recommend this to a family member.   I'm sure there are better SUV's, but if you don't want to blend into the crowd,  I recommend the Land Rover product.  I did have to have a pulley repaired. It cost $300. I don't necessarily agree with the engineering. It seems to be over complicated. I still love my Land Rover though. Also my starter failed. The engineer is have it right at the bottom of the motor. It took me about 5 minutes to change.",4

I Love this LR2. I am short so as I love a lifted truck I no longer love to climb in or out of any vehicle. This, I just slide in and out with no trouble. Every control is within comfortable reach. Living in Minnesota and as cold as it gets here I was thinking of installing an automatic start to this beauty. I found it heats up so fast I shouldn't even bother, especially with the cold climate package. It picks up speed right away, highway driving is a breeze with lane changing, merging, she gets along great with all weather driving on the hwy too! The Alpine sound system is so clear I often thought I was hearing other noises, nope, was so crisp I never noticed all the sound in a piece of music in another vehicle. Best purchase of this year. Ok, for the tough love, if it is not taken care of properly, it will cost more than other domestic suvs/trucks but with all of the amazing features and feel, to me it is worth it. I will be looking for another when it is time. *****Update **** It has been one year now and I love this LR2 as much as the day I bought it!",4

The Good- This car is my personal listening room; the sound system is incredible, one of the best I've ever heard in a car. I have the cold weather package and the seats warm up so fast and the defroster a for the windshield and rear are quick as well. Off road, this car is a beast! Even without mudding tires I have never had a moments hesitation, from knee deep mud to deep snow to off roaring on the side of a mountain. It's so comfortable and the way it handles has me weary to ever let the car go. The double sun roofs bring tons of natural light into the car and the visibility is excellent. I turn heads when I drive around town. Tons of small perks as well. I really do love this car. Now, The Bad-EXPENSIVE to have worked on. Most mechanics will not work on them as the software required is incredibly expensive for them to purchase. Since I bought the car I have had to replace- Brakes, rotors ($800), new key fob ($425), gear shift spring broken ($800), fob insert detector ($600), rear ball joints ($1200). Also, the spring is broken in my front right; sheared right in half. I'm driving with it now and it's fine: no sounds or decreased performance, but I'm looking at $2200 plus to have it (and the other front) replaced. Yow. That's a lot in 30,000 miles in my experience. Resale is rough on them because of the cost to fix. I love how this car drives and I can haul kayaks, SUPs, my dog, etc.. Without problems. I want to keep fixing it forever, but I will eventually have to make a smart fiscal decision. Oh, and for the gas haters--I get about 17 city and 23-24 highway. Not bad, considering the car weighs 2 tons. You will win if you are in an accident. That alone makes me feel so safe, and if you've ever been in a bad car wreck you know how important it is to feel safe afterwards.Update-car is now at 126,000 miles and the rotors are toast. That's 30,000 miles on them. O2 sensor went out ($500) replacement and the exhaust is getting noisy. Someone also keyed my front right panel, but I'm not even going to try to figure out how much that will cost. Probably going to sell the car soon; cost of fixing everything will total the car out. It still drives nice and is so comfortable. I will miss this car, but not the expense.",4

It will get you from A to B in relative style, and it's easy to park. That's it. It is not a good grocery getter, not a good family car, nothing like that.

However, this is the least utilitarian sport utility ever.  Clearly a vehicle designed as a tall station wagon for soccer moms and was a big let-down as my first Land Rover.  Second sunroof was a cool feature until I discovered that prevented me from having a roof rack, and bumper design made a putting on a hitch a very expensive custom job.  The seat heaters drained the battery if you forgot to turn them off and the crazy windshield wipers are $60 each.

Enough space to carry whatever I need, and compact enought to drive in town every day.  In bad weather, it gets an A+. The snow terrain response setting is phenomenal, as are the headlights and nav.

Overall, it's a great ride for someone who wants a very comfortable plush smaller SUV with eye-catching style and lots of technological bells and whistles without paying a fortune.

The seats are great and the interior is sharp too. Acceleration won't be winning any races, but it's just fine for what it needs, I never feel like the engine is straining at any speed.

Great car with truly unique looks.  Have gone on long trips (500+ miles) to Maine, no problems in cold, ice, snow, the occasional pothole and/or curb, etc.  Load up with surfboard and/or bikes, drives fine.  It's a high sitting SUV so absolutely no quick turning.  Handles very well in small parking lots.  It's a smallish SUV when you sit inside.  I use for myself mostly, but it can handle the family too.  Every time I pack it up, I think the luggage won't fit, but somehow it does.  If you have a few kids to move around a lot, it's probably too small.  We have just one and it works fine.  Would have upgraded to LR4 in a few years, but LR stopped production of that model as well??  Tried the new Discovery Sport, and it's a glorified Honda CR-V.  If you want off-road, fine.  If you want on-road, that's OK too.  But, LR tradition and image is off-road, and the LR 2 & 4 replacement models are just not off road types at all.  Very happy with LR2.  Probably be a collector's item, as it's all steel framed (terrible gas guzzler), and has traditional LR suspension.  The new Discovery Sport is a sedan, so it's a car undercarriage with a bubble on top (like a Subaru Forrester).   I don't know why Tata is degrading/changing the LR brand, but it is doing so drastically.  I love my LR2; I've driven the Discovery Sport and RR Evoke as loaner cars; I would never buy either of them.  Nothing unique; nothing special; nothing rugged about either of them. Those are trying to compete with BMW X series.  As a LR lover, I specifically, deliberately, and consciously want noting to do with a BMW x anything.  So, I'm going to have to look elsewhere when it goes :(  If you get a chance to buy one, they are fun to drive, dependable, and good in congested areas.  If you live in a rural setting, it could feel small very quickly, but for tighter suburban roads, it's great.  Because it's a true LR, it has the traditional stadium or ""dining room chair"" front seats.  This provides unmatched vision for the driver.  The replacement models went with ""cockpit"" seating, which again is OK, but has absolutely nothing, zero, zip to do with LR heritage.  (really, wtf?) Here again, LR just dropped one of it's key signature features to replace it with a run of the mill everyone is doing it type of styling.  Who's running this company???!  LR2 is great car overall.   Shame they are stopping LR models, as LR buyers (like me) won't magically change into Discovery buyers.  They are very different vehicles... So, LR 2/4 buyers, maybe it's hello G-Wagon, Tahoe, Lexus GX, or luxury Wrangler (if they ever build one).  Hey Jeep - there's your goal.  Keep it under G-Wagon pricing and you'll have a winner!  (Also, make it totally dependable and reliable, which I know is a Jeep problem, and hence why I paid double the price of a Jeep for a LR).  Can't break down for any reason, anytime, anywhere.  Indestructible luxury truck like SUV is what we want).",5

This SUV can accelerate when needed even with full-cargo in the back and four occupants; eg, coming out from a Rest Area and into traffic.  The braking is excellent.

161, on 09/06/15 03:11 AM (PDT),Mike D ,2015 Land Rover LR2 SUV HSE 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great Vehicle for Anything," I purchased my LR2 immediately prior to one of the most punishing winters in New England history and put 13,900 miles on it in a year of driving (mixed town/highway use as a daily driver). The all-wheel drive system of this SUV is unmatched by any other SUV in the compact market. When forced to drive in several of the blizzards with 1-2 feet of snow, I simply placed the vehicle into snow mode and had no issues driving on untreated roadways. The climate controls are all control dials, which made it easy to adjust while driving. The voice-activated navigation, heated steering wheel/seats were also incredible. The 4 cylinder turbo engine moves the vehicle, giving it a sporty and fun driving experience when paired with the nimble nature of the steering system. Another cool feature for cold weather drivers is the heated windshield. Land Rover wove miniature wires through the windshield that heats the entire thing when activated (which prevents just a small section defogging and instead rapidly dissipates condensation and ice development).The negatives to the vehicle are its compact cabin (but it is a compact SUV and I am 6' tall), the presence of turbo lag when accelerating, the poor fuel economy when compared to other vehicles in this segment, the lack of a power liftgate (which has now become standard among LR2's competitors), and the small amount of legroom for rear passengers (once again; its a compact SUV).In the 13,900 miles that I drove the vehicle I experienced 2 mechanical issues. The first issue was a ""low coolant"" message that occurred when it was -20 degrees out. The vehicle did not have low coolant however, and the message disappeared after running the engine briefly. The second issue was a ""service required"" message that came on after bringing the vehicle in for its first annual service. I had to bring the light to the dealership three times to stop the message from appearing. All of this was covered under vehicle warranty, however it was an annoyance and the service experience was not what I would have expected from a luxury car brand.All said, this vehicle is incredible if you need to have the confidence to get through anything that nature throws at you (While keeping you extremely comfortable). If you're willing to compromise on that ability, other SUV's offer more technologically advanced features and much better fuel economy ratings.",5

The arm rest is very thin and cuts the circulation no matter what height or arm position. If you put the arm rest up there is no where to put your arm. What is worse is that in the up position, the metal adjustment screw, (about 2"" x 3"")sits inches from the right temple area of your head. Scary.  The seat positions are limited, inability to angle front of drivers seat cuts leg circulation. It rattles alot and ""ka-thunks"" in several areas, over every little bump.

Its tough in the snow and handles it with ease an expertise, easily navigating the accumulated feet of snow and ice collected on our streets here in Buffalo NY. It's got great pick up and can be described as peppy as the engine picks up pretty quickly with pretty good acceleration and passing speed. Everyone who gets inside of it is impressed by its understated class and prestige and its commanding presence. The seats are more similar to the cockpit of an airplane as you sit straight up with armrests that are similar to a planes with great visibility if the road from all windows. Despite its off road credentials, its a really smooth ride. The Bluetooth works great and its awesome not having to fool around with an aux chord. As soon as I get into the truck, it syncs and plays all of my downloaded music. It has heated seats and a heated steering wheel as well as a winter mode which automatically raises your wipers off the ceiling to avoid freezing to the windshield . For someone who doesn't want to dump the cash into a range rover, has a small family and doesn't need the 3rd row seating of the lr4 and if you don't like the newer rounded style that land rover is adopting in contrast to the classic  classy boxy lines still possessed by these, then it might be a great choice.

Thank goodness I rented before I took the plunge (I backed out). The LR2 is under powered and presents a problem when passing on the highway. The body roll is significant, and if you had to swerve to miss and object in the road , it could get dicey. The off-road capability is robust and it does about 90% of what it's larger counter-part can do, so, no complaints there. The seats are small, and hard as a board. The seating position is high and upright. The interior is small, without much cargo space. So forget bringing your buddies and their gear on an outing. The interior is pretty basic.",3.25

The rear brake light had filled with water after it rained so that had to be replaced. The adaptive head-lights that are supposed to turn as you go around a corner they ended up being ""cross eyed"" so they replaced the entire passenger side head-light assembly. The memory functions for the seats, radio and steering wheel have never worked properly.  Search user rover73  on you tube for my video.",2.625

Car is rock-solid - like driving a vault, very BMW-esque.  It feels heavy (and makes my larger GMC Yukon seem flimsy in comparison).  Thought at first that it was underpowered, but at about 500 miles it loosened up - and the mileage got better too.  Suspension sporty but not too rough.  Build quality appears to be excellent.  Things that at first seemed not to work correctly were actually just a lack of knowledge on my part.

215, on 04/08/17 07:38 AM (PDT),mike  Marshall ,2006 Land Rover Range Rover SUV HSE 4dr SUV 4WD (4.4L 8cyl 6A),Bought this junk to prove my daughter wrong 4/8/17," Admittedly bought this 2006 RR with 135K miles in mint condition, 2 owners, proper maintenance ONLY because my 17 year old daughter is a car lover like her dad but knew RR's were horrible in quality and reliability and very expensive to work on. So, against my better judgement bought this RR. Within the first 2 weeks one of the front air suspension struts blew out. Cost $800 to repair. Basic oil change was $150. Front brakes due for replacement but British mechanic says CANNOT TURN RR ROTORS SO ONLY NEW ONES AVAILABLE. Got suspicious of this mechanic so took to my regular mechanic who simply put on after market brake pads, but still cost way less (still $250) than the $800 the ""British Mechanic"" repair shop was trying to soak me for. Rear view camera works about 25% of the time. SUV sits up so high with no running boards or handles on front pillar that very difficult to get in or out for us shorter people and puts heavy wear and tear on sides of both front seats creating upholstry tears and paint wearing off plastic trim parts that are very cheaply made. Even the rubber key was so worn it barely worked=poor design and material usage and they are $400 to buy and have programmed!  After 2 weeks and $1000 in repairs with more to come on those expensive air bags suspension ($800 PER wheel!) I decided to sell it. After driving a 2001 Lincoln Navigator which was of average quality, I would choose the Lincoln for less expensive repairs for both labor and parts. I myself bought a 2008 Infiniti QX56 SUV with 119K miles and cannot say enough good things about this SUV in EVERY category. It is a FAR superior SUV to the RR in EVERY way (and all others that I tested/researched). The RR's are currently the ""cool SUV"" to drive thus my young daughter's lust for it but knew it was going to be a mistake as is the case with most English cars. (owned a 99 Jag XJ8 for 5 years=huge repair bills done all at under 69K miles!) Owned an 86 Bentley Mulsanne for a year just for fun but just after one minor repair it costs $2000, so got that out of my car loving system. English make some beautiful cars but some of the most unreliable and expensive to work on. Got disgusted with American cars as well despite trying to ""be American, buy American"" but quality still not where it should be at any of the Big 3. Finally broke down and bought a Japanese car, something I swore I'd never do as they have always been so UGLY but many have finally figured out how to actually make a car look nice looking. If you want a really nice HUGE comfortable, powerful, high tech SUV. Def. try the Infiniti QX56 with almost 400 ft lbs of torque it does zero to 60 in 7 seconds, rides like a big Cadillac sedan in the comfort area and lots of room for hauling things when needed. Even my 17 year old daughter loves it, esp. with the technology upgrade package (BOSE, Nav, rear view camera, rear entertainment) and the roar of the factory exhaust is quite nice as well. One of the nicest cars I've ever owned and have  had almost 100 cars over the years.  Stay away from RR's unless you want to spend a lot of time at the repair shop spending ungodly amounts of repair money. Heck, I don't even like the looks of it! Too top heavy on windows making it look like a ""green house on wheels"" and interior is  WAY to small for serious Costco trips, minimal storage, many cheap parts at dash/console areas as well, esp for the high price that is charged when new. When driving it, it reminded me of driving something out of the 80's. Very outdated. Power is just average, esp. when compared to my former Lincoln Navigator and ESP. the Infiniti.  And note** your car insurance will increase significantly compared to other same year or older SUV's like Lincoln Navigator being that RR's are so expensive to repair. I got a $600/yr increase in premiums ""just because it was a RR"" according to my AAA rep.  Sold the RR within 3 weeks just to save my money and sanity! ""It pays to be cool"" but I ain't no fool! Sold the RR and got her an 2007 Infiniti FX35 which is also far superior to the RR in every way except the view height of sitting high in the RR.",2

The first had a failed suspension at about 95k mile and that was the worst thing to happen to either. Finding an independent mechanic that understands these cars is key to maintaining them economically ...  I purchased the first off a three year lease with about 25k miles and drove it to 100k. I paid 34,000 and sold it four years later for 19k. The second had 60k miles, paid 21,000 and it currently has 130k miles. If I sell it for 8000.00, and  add all the maintenance cost and depreciation, my total cost of ownership not including fuel and insurance will be under 430.00 per month or .26 per mile.  I think these are great numbers for any car let alone a high end lux mobile... My daughters Prius has not done as well ( but way better on gas).  If I ""just got lucky"", I got lucky twice since my first 06 had similar numbers even with the suspension fix. I also averaged just over 20 mpg on the highway! I love these cars... Ive also owned a 1990, 95  Range Rover (really bad) a 2001 disco and a 2005 sport (both bought new) and I can say that the 06 range rover is by far the best of the lot from my experience, and one of the best  vehicles I've owned (136 and counting).",5

Make sure to get out of this vehicle by the time the warranty is up.  The engine works well but all of the peripherals along with electronics are suspect.  Also the air suspension will fail around 80K miles.  The dealer freely admits to this.  Each corner is $1500 to repair.  So you'll end up spending about $6,000 on all for corners at some point.  Then you will most likely get the dreaded steering column lockout.  This is actually a safety feature that eventually craps out.  Replacing this unit with a new one is $6,000.  If you're smart you can get a salvage unit for around $1200 and then spend another $500-700 on installation or try doing it yourself.  Of course that's if you get one that works to begin with.  The car's electronics are also very temperature dependent.  Here in Chicago it suffers from many cold related ailments.  The rear trunk section will get loose and will need to be rebuilt at some point before 100K miles.",2

But, in specific the leather, info touch screen, Harmon-Kardon stereo, & all options of the luxury interior package (an absolute must).  You will grow to love the driveability, ride, & handling.  If you have the guts to try it, being so expensive, the off road capability of the Range Rover is amazing.  I sell ranches in Texas.  I can sell properties that others can't in my Rover.  Turn the suspension nob & lift the Rover 3 inches. It will now traverse the most challenging terrain with ease, & without feeling like it.  It's the love child of a Jeep & a Mercedes sedan.You will HATE the repair bills!  In 4 years or so, both front airbags failed (although, I love the feature) rendering it undriveable, a door handle broke, sun roof jammed, & the nav map stopped working (I just ejected the disc!).  I suggest finding a expert Land Rover guy near you (NOT THE DEALER!).  The dealer wanted $3k for each airbag, $1k for the door, $1k for Sun roof, & $500 for the nav map, that's $8,500!  It still cost me $3k with my non-dealer guy.The 255 55 R19 tires are very expensive & the selection sucks.  Also, it has the most expensive battery I've ever seen.Overall, the 2006 Range Rover HSE is an awesome vehicle.  Just remember, if you buy one be prepared to drop $5k for repairs at anytime.",4

You can thank our environmental wackos for that as the process for finishing(dyeing) the leather is not what it used to be because of some crazy environmental hazards.

The car always seemed to have ample power and acceleration, no matter where you were in the RPM curve.  The new '06 is based on a Jaguar/Ford V8.  The spec sheet says 305 hp.  Frankly, I don't think the engine puts out half that much.  It feels anemic, has no pull through the gears.

Honestly it was the most exciting car I had driven.  It is fast, handles like it is on rails and is good looking.  So in 2015 I decided to add to my collection with the new HSE.  I decided to go for the supercharged 6 for fuel economy since I live in Los Angeles and I am not towing anything.  The car is very good looking and I have no issues with the interior finish but I did have an annoying rattle that the dealership can't seem to find and stop and the electronics have frozen up several times and I needed to turn off the car to reboot.  Additionally, it takes 1-2 minutes when you start the car to initialize everything so don't try multi-tasking until the car is good and ready.  For example, there is no chance of turning down the volume on the radio while activating your seat heaters while backing up.  By the way you will do that more than you think.But the worst is my transmission has gone out three times and on the cars first birthday it got a brand new transmission.  Isn't that special.  Okay now 10 days after getting the new transmission, I pulled into a restaurant and couldn't get my car out of drive!!  It literally wouldn't shift into any gear except Drive and I had to shut the engine off to put it into Park.  Bravo the new tranny lasted almost 2 weeks.  So ask yourself why are you buying the car??

Buttons connected to computer SLOW. Takes 2-3 seconds every time you press a button to respond.  Navigation takes up to 3 minutes to initialize after starting vehicle. Worst computer integration EVER!  Doors have unlocked and opened while driving!  Wow!Update:  Vehicle has been in service for about 50 days over the past 6 months for a multitude of problems.  The nav screen continues to reboot about every 2 hours of drive time.  They have no idea whats going on.  Have been told by service that this is a common problem.  The computer integration with all of the functions just blows!  To turn on the seat heat and massage, you have to go into the navigation screen!  I do not like my passengers touching my navigation screen.  Same with their climate control.  You can't just put all the functions into the nav screen.  Way too many steps to do much of anything.  I find myself thinking that I would like to do something, but it is just too much of a pain in the butt to do so.  The screens look like they were designed by a 12 year old.  A real pet peeve is that I like to see the navigation FULL SCREEN.  So, I press the screen to put it that way (getting rid of the road exit information).  Then every time I go to a different screen , or the navigation gives a direction, it goes back to showing the road exit information.  Petty?  Yes.  But just shows the lack of detail that went into this vehicle.  On the satellite radio, they put so much worthless info on it, that you don't see the name of the song, just the artist, and the channel number.  Really?  It's a large screen, plenty of room if they did it correctly.  I know that's minor, but, every little detail was ignored in this vehicle.  When you pay this much for a vehicle, it should be easy to use, fun, and informative.  Not at all.  My Hyundai Genesis has a navigation/computer integration that totally blows this away.  At less then half the price.  I prefer to drive the Hyundai!  That's pretty bad.After putting 18,000 miles on this vehicle, I have found this to be the most uncomfortable vehicle I've ever owned.  The seats are HORRID.  Like sitting in the cheapest airline seat.  This is a common comment from many passengers I've had.  It hurts to drive this vehicle for more than 2 hours at a time.  Your butt is just killing you.  There is NO padding in the front or rear seats because they cheapened it up so much to save weight.  My 2012 Range Rover SC was way, way, way better and nicer.  Also, the dashboard, which in my 2012, people used to comment on how nice the leather was, has been replaced with PLASTIC!  The interior looks  and feels cheap when you really get looking at the details.  There are WAY better vehicles for $120,000.  I really feel ripped off.  On the plus side, the acceleration, is outstanding, though and the ride is very nice.Update 4/7/16.  Land Rover has agreed to repurchase this vehicle under the California Lemon Law.  Good Riddance!  Many people have exactly the same issues with this vehicle...",1

It could have been 40 times (electrical issues) but Land Rover does not have a fix for the Navigation Screen that completely shuts down (43 times and counting). Causing a total shut down of any feature you were using until it reboots. Worse off they knew about this issue and sold me the car without disclosing this. But I have several other electrical issues with this vehicle ( radio malfunction, phone issue, but scariest when my distronic did not activate), the list is longer but you get the point. Dont get me wrong, nicest driving car Ive ever owned, but for the price tag you could do so much better. Whats going to happen when this car is out of warranty, SCARY THOUGHT. Plus Land Rover Corporate is the worst company to deal with. The won't even acknowledge my issues or concerns. My dream car that I waited 45 years to buy, has turned into a nightmare.

375, on 03/04/16 09:44 AM (PST),Justin ,2001 Land Rover Range Rover SUV 4.6 SE 4WD 4dr SUV (4.6L 8cyl 4A),BE..............................Aware!!!.......," Possibly......No....... (it is) The worst vehicle I've ever come in contact with (my wife's truck). Thing was a ticking time bomb from the moment we purchased it. Wished I did more research on it before we bought it. She's always loved Range Rovers. I happened to be looking around on craigslist (probably the reason it was such a lemon to begin with) when I came across this nice 2001 HSE in (what seemed to be) good condition, with 110,000 miles on the odometer. Test drive (of course) went good. Truck started right up, shifted smooth, had plenty of power (thanks to that gas guzzling 4.6 V8), rode a little stiff but figured that was do to the air suspension and low profile tires. All seemed well, so we bought it and took it home. Maybe an hour goes by after its been parked from not being registered yet. Come outside and the front driver's side of the truck is dropped to the floor. Low and behold that infamous Range Rover air suspension (that I now know about). I should've been more worried about the up arrow (indicating an issue with the air suspension) on the cluster being illuminated but the fool (me being more of a fool) who sold it to us says ""I think it means its fully lifted"". So I look around online and see that the air bags are pretty cheap and somewhat easy to fix. They also refill and lift the truck after its running so I don't worry too much. I'll just do them myself when I have some time. About two weeks later, we drive the truck up to my father's house for a visit (1h 50m drive). All went well until it was time to go home. Started it up to let it warm up for a few minutes, then it randomly shuts down. Try to start it back up and nothing. It cranks but never fires. A couple minutes go by and it starts, but maybe 30 seconds later it shuts down again. At this point my wife is fed up with this thing since we just got it. I do a quick search on the forums and describe the issue. Crank position sensor is the culprit. We have it towed to a local mechanic my father goes to and luckily it was a pretty easy fix. All seems well again until the following weekend when the Mrs. goes out to the city with some friends. I get a call and she says ""the truck shut down, is in the middle of the street and is smoking very bad"". Now I'm completely pissed and ready to take this truck to a junkyard and get to crush it myself. I asked her if she noticed the temp gauge over in the red zone and she said ""yes"". Now I'm more worried since she doesn't know how long it was overheating before it shut down on her. She rarely pays attention to her gauges while driving. Her mother just so happened to be meeting up with her at the event her and her friends were going to so she wasn't alone since mom was nearby. A gentleman was walking by and helped pushed the truck off to the side of the road. Luckily she wasn't on the highway anymore but on a busy city street. After the smoke somewhat cleared he reveled one of the top radiator hoses came loose and popped off. I'm still home at this point since she said shes going to leave it where it is and her and mom are going to head to the event. Next day comes and we drive to where the truck is. I get the hose back together, fill the radiator with some antifreeze and we start on our way home. Not long after, its starts overheating again. I'll skip ahead since this story is already long enough. We eventually get it home from NY (we're in NJ) after repeatedly pulling over and stopping to let it cool off and refill. First thing I notice after getting it home is there is a huge hole in the Y connector pipe connecting two upper radiator hoses down to the lower radiator hose that also connects to the external thermostat housing (first design I've ever seen like that but whatever). Hole was more than likely a result from overheating. Anyways, get that replaced. Still overheating. Replace the thermostat, still overheating. Replaced the water pump (which was surprisingly easy), still overheating. I even go as far as drilling out the thermostat (from within the ridiculous housing that doesn't let you replace it the normal way) and running it straight open and the b**** is still overheating. All that trial and error and the head gasket was the cause from the beginning (which caused it to initially overheat and pop that hose loose). Antifreeze level was always good and wasn't leaking but hey I guess s*** happens, haha. All in all, maybe we just so happened to get a lemon and you'd never have those same issues. But after owning it and doing some extensive research, the bad faaaaaaaar outweigh the good with this truck. I remember one person even saying ""It should be illegal to sell this thing"". Sorry for the long story. I just wouldn't want anyone else to make the same mistake. If anything, buy one new and get a full lifetime warranty because apparently even the new ones are a big pain in the arse as well. You and your dealer will become very acquainted. Hope this story helps. ~peace~",1

The 2001 Range Rover that I purchased has had way too many problems, but it still has an appeal that makes me continue sinking money into to keep it rolling. The styling has a classic appearance that makes it's age irrelevant. I like to fly fish and this vehicle is a perfect match to my bamboo fly rod and Filson vest and waders. Once I reach 200K miles in this vehicle I will likely buy a newer Range Rover and go through the whole love/hate routine again.--------Several years have gone by and the Range Rover is still on the road.  It is a great off road vehicle and has worked well for our personal interest in Fly Fishing and Snow Skiing. We have given it plenty of chances to get stuck, but it seems to be up for any situation. Reliability is a continuous challenge and the gas mileage is poor. We now have 155,000 miles on the odometer and just got it out of the shop for $1,000.00.  We hope to get to 200,000 miles. Engine and transmission still doing well. A Range Rover is not for everyone. Sometimes I wonder why I still enjoy driving it. I guess it's because there is nothing else on the road like it.",2

Mostly SUVs, but a few sedans.  Hands down, this is the most unreliable car I've ever owned.  I bought it new in 05 and got the longest warranty they had.  I spent roughly 80k buying it, and including warranty work, over the past 13 years and 100,000 miles, this SUV has cost more to maintain than the cost of the car.  Yes, over 80k in service, and I have all the records.    Things started breaking right out of the gate - the nav screen, the air shocks, the waterpump, the transmission (which was fixed under warranty, but would have cost me 16k if it wasn't covered.  Things that had just been fixed broke over and over and over again within a year or two of being replaced.  At one point, the steering ""froze up' while driving, and I almost got in an accident.  I still own it, we use it as a farm car, it needs waaaaayyyyy too much stuff replaced to be worth fixing, but it still drives in 1st gear.  Wish I could tell you just my SUV was bad, two other family and friends had the same car from the 03-05 model years, and they reported almost EXACTLY the same problems.  Avoid one at all costs, unless it's free, and has extensive service records.  This SUV is the biggest piece of junk ever built.",1

I purchased the vehicle with approx. 68K miles and to my surprise it has been one of the most reliable vehicles I've ever purchased! Now I have ~109K miles on it a it runs just like it did the day I purchased it.  The only major cost was the front suspension. This was a 2K+ repair but other than that nothing more than routine maintenance.  I love my RR there is nothing like it on the road or off!

Rear facing sight lines aren't that great due to pillar and head rests, which could be an issue for some.  Awesome stereo.  Plenty of acceleration for my tastes.  Considered a Cayenne S, but decided against it due to rear leg room.  RR is 7"" longer, and is much more comfortable in the back.

It's not for lead foots who increase speed heading into a turn.  This is an adventure hungry, behemoth of a truck, with the DNA to clean up seamlessly for a refined night on the town.  The LR3 is heavy...heavier than the average family adventure car on the road.  It's 2.5 tons of highly engineered assemblies fitting and working together, with sensors to monitor every lean, pull, push, and bump, all fitting into a sturdy, tank-like structure.  There are about 3 miles of wire linking sensors to computer.  And if the factory has a computer update, it's best to plug in at the shop and get the system updgraded.  An upgrade might reboot sensors to communicate more accurately for better driving experience.This is not the kind of car for the kind of owner who takes maintenance lightly.  If you've ever let your car tell YOU when it needs its maintenance service, then this may not be a good match.  Once you've gone that far, there may (or may not) be other related issues effected.  Driving it is fun, responsible ownership is keeps the apprehension for reliability down.Because she's an overly engineered wonder, diagnostics, repair, and maintenance are an involved commitment; read...$$$.  But these can be a minor issue if you look at the big picture:  You're an ordinary Joe who can reach EXTRAordinary locations with a stock Rover.  And stock means leather seats, great sound system, amazing all-terain-response capabilities for height adjustment, clearance, big windows for easy viewing, and an option for 3rd row that capably seats adults.  You can have an all-adult, off-roading excursion.  The cabin is quiet enough for civilized conversations.  And the views and experience are only as limited as your fear of the unknown.  And she can cross a body of water to a depth of the top of the doors with a snorkel...holy bagumba!!!  Did you know you can mod a tent to the top of your Rover?I can head down the highway on a road trip at a comfortable 70 mph, turn onto a rough road for a harrowing climb over a pass, and then ease myself down back to pavement without ever having to worry about ability.  (Note:  always try to travel the rougher passes with friends; they can hop out and spot you through your next move if the road is full of questionable obstacles or too narrow).If you need to clean up for a special event, you're in luck:  the Rover exudes an elegance that no other 4x4 has.  Easily transform her into your personal, high-end private car for a night on the town, or even executive-toting, car-pooling daily driver. No trip is too big or too small.  The key is to play up the variety.  Being able to drive a new Rover off the lot has built-in peace of mind with the extensive warranties.  Buying a used on will require a great deal of leg work to make sure the truck you want has been lovingly cared for.  Don't let the city/hwy mileage scare you.  Always know that it's a combination of factors:  type of tire, breaking and speeding habits, city vs. hwy driving, etc.",5

Haven't had any issues - everything works great as it should.  I have no complaints about this vehicle.  It has been awesome.Another update:  145k on the clock - no issues at all.  Still love this car.  Want a new one because they are shiny but can't justify it with this still looking and running great.  It is a great ride on the highway, and does anything you ever want to do offroad.  Also tows our camper and boat anywhere, anytime.  I strongly recommend this vehicle.

The H20 has no where to go, so it falls inside the car.  She said it is a design flaw for all 3 models. She knew exactly what it was when I called it in. If you garage your LR3, then don't sweat it.

It is everything it is supposed to be, commanding driving position, fantastic view from any seat (the windows are quite large and allow you to look out and down since they go lower than most vehicles.  I'm not tall but some of my friends are and there is so much head room you will never have to recline the seat to avoid hitting your head.  For a 6000 pound vehicle it drives more like a normal sedan, brakes are very strong (I can't even compare them to my old xterra, the LR3 is in another league), the 4.4l jaguar engine is strong and always seems to have a little more power when you need it.  The front and second row seats are large and comfortable, the fold flat third row are probably the best third row seats out there, and adult can use them and they aren't bad... I would compare them to a compact car back seat.  The only down side is repair costs are high and I do repairs myself, but parts can be costly too.  Fuel consumption is whats to be expected for a vehicle of this weight and I am only averaging 9-10 mpg with city driving (we only drive 5 miles a day average with this).

The last time they replace the entire sunroof but it still leaks inside the dome light, right and left posts beside the windshield. Water comes out of the ""airbag"" plug on the sides! It has been a nightmare and Land Rover will do nothing to make this right. I intend to pursue Lemon Law and hopefully get rid of this poor quality vehicle. I will never buy another. ",2.5

I don't care that the sunroof leaks - at least not that much. If you buy one, make sure to buy it during a rain storm and drive it aggressively. That's when you'll notice a leak problem if there is one. Also - look for signs of leakage below the VIN number plate. There is a piece of paper below it (likely from the factory).

Beautiful lux used ca," My search was nationwide and I found one with only 49k miles, one owner, 18 LR service records, in the rare and beautiful Rimini Red (only abou t3-4% of RRS's) on Long Island. I added some aftermarket bling of shiny mirror covers, stainless door handles $79 and pillar covers $69 to really set it off. Just the right amount of bling. also added running boards from eBay for $183. Northeast Rovers have them in the exact same pattern and charge $1150...??? Everyone that sees it loves the color and the added bits really make it stand out. I like the panache of a Range Rover in the Midwest. I drive all over from Madison, WI to Morgantown, WV and in 5,000 miles could count the other RR's I saw on the road on one hand. In SoCal you might see that many parked in one LA city block. The ride is smooth and super comfortable and in a late midwest snowstorm of 8-10"" it handled like a champ. Surefooted and secure. comfort and safety are primary concerns for me and being able to get to my destination. On the highway doing a steady 75 mph my gas mileage has actually been a pleasant surprise of 20.7 mpg. I added and aftermarket electronic module for $69 and my highway mileage is now an incredible 23.8 over 2000 miles. City mileage is 17.4 ! If you take it easy and pretend you are back in the 1980's and drive 55 mph you will find the mileage for the highway actually in the 27.5 to 28.3 range for the car. The sound system HarmonKardon is absolutely incredible and thoroughly enjoyed with my extensive music collection. The NAV system which is DVD based is dated and I do not evne use as I use my smartphone for this purpose. the only complaint that I have is the location of the Aux input is bizarrely and awkwardly placed behind the center console and requires connections to be run from the rear seat area to the front for use of my Ipod. Plan on being a RRS guy for life although the stylistic changes made in the 2014 especially to the front end rear ends and with the lights removed too much from the boxy lines and removed some of the character from the car model appearance.

The touch screen navigation is much better than last year's knob control, and the variable traction settings worked flawlessly on my road trip from Portland down to the OC.

I sometimes have my son's friends in the car and they beg me to step on it for the feeling you get in your stomach. It's absolutely crazy!

Navigation has almost got me fired from my job on multiple occasions (I'm a sales executive for Hilton and work all over Los Angeles and San Diego). It constantly is leading me to dead ends and the wrong locations. The brake dive can just be horrible too. The car lurches, almost unsafely, forward when you slam the brake pedal down. I thought I was going to flip at one point. Those are my only two complaints about my car. I cannot complain about gas mileage as it's a supercharged 5.0 litre V8, and I have a lead foot, haha.

I specifically waited for the 2019 model with the new touchscreen technology throughout, and this vehicle was delivered in May of 2018. It is clear that this tech had not been thoroughly tested. It is slow and VERY buggy. Some screens take a long time to come up and other times the screens are completely blank. I sent to dealer to update to the lasted version, and not much has changed since that update. My prior vehicle was a Tesla, which occasionally had to reboot, but otherwise worked seamlessly. The interior technology and the accompanying mobile apps are so bad, that it almost outweighs how great this car drives.",3

The vehicle looks awesome both inside and out. I test drove the V6 which was pretty unimpressive so I got the V8. Tons of power, fast and the exhaust sounds great. Now for the negatives. Nothing but problems with the electronics and infotainment system. Back-up camera did not work consistently. Visibility when backing up is limited using the mirrors so the camera is pretty much a necessity. It’s very nerve racking backing this thing up when the rear camera doesn’t work. One night the vehicle just would not start for about 20 minutes. A couple of times the Air Conditioner randomly decided to turn itself off. 3G WiFi frequently doesn’t turn on after starting the vehicle. I complained to the dealer and they had me bring it in for repair. They did a software update to the system to address the problems. After the update the back-up camera works most of the time - but still occasionally won’t turn on when I put the vehicle in reverse. After the update some new problems appeared that were not present prior to the update. The interior ambient lighting resets to the highest setting after the ignition is turned off - and sometimes the vehicle will randomly change my color selection to the white light setting. Radio presets on the lower touchscreen also developed a problem where they would appear for about a second and then disappear before I can use them. Other one off random glitches occur every couple of days. I contacted the dealer regarding the new problems and I was told there is currently no fix for them. Some sort of corrupt software problem that they are trying to sort out. The dealer put me on a list with other people having problems and will call when a new software update is available. Everyday is a new adventure in problems and glitches with the electronics. Do a quick search on the internet for 2018 Range Rover Sport Problems and it won’t take you long to see what I am talking about. It’s unbelievable that any brand new car could be sold with so many defects, let alone one in this price range. If I knew then what I know now, I would have bought another Mercedes or BMW. So bottom line, if you really want the vehicle doe to it’s awesome looks and performance, just be prepared to live with some glitchy electronics problems that Land Rover doesn’t know how to fix.",2

Had electronics issues day one.  Within first 24 hours parts started to fall off the vehicle.  Engine issues with warning lights started within a few days of receiving the vehicle. Had 19 return trips for ongoing issues. Trailer package never worked. Park assist never worked. Camera system failed while at the dealer. Touchscreen would not accept touch input.  Cruise control had total failure on the interstate with engine shut down. Engine failed on return trip to dealer.  In 4 months of ownership the dealer had the vehicle for over 3 months.  The engine and cabin were repeatedly torn apart to change out parts and boxes.  Land Rover engineers repeatedly played with software so one time the vehicle was not in English.  All the increasing electronic issues resulted in the dash being torn apart so many times that you could not open the glove compartment.  Filled “lemon law” under state statutes and finally Land Rover USA had to refund my money.  My parting comment is that the vehicle looks great but in my experience it is JUNK.  I personally would avoid Land Rover products.  I had to wait 5 months from time of ordering to receive my junk.  I ordered all the options in the Diesel engine and option packages all for one month of intermittent possession and 3 months at the dealer before got a refund.,1

After having finally received the vehicle, I can say I am truly impressed with the quality, ride, performance and design. Literally my only two minor complaints are that the rear seats are rock hard and after doing a six hour road trip, my back hurt compliments of the front seat. I never had that problem on my 2008 BMW X5. Perhaps the seats will break in over time. The second complaint was that I had to pay $650 to get a black Morzine fabric headliner. You get the same headliner in beige for free. After paying $108,000 for this vehicle, the headliner should have been Alcantara at the very least and preferably leather as on the big Range Rover Autobiography. That kind of short sighted decision by Land Rover to save a few bucks makes you feel a little cheated. You might want to reconsider that one Land Rover.   But in the end, I love everything else about this vehicle and it is truly the best vehicle I've ever owned. It looks fast standing still and people are awed at the perceived and real high-end quality that this vehicle exudes. I never thought I would love the Driving Experience of another vehicle more than my BMW X5. The Range Rover Sport is that vehicle for me. I was a little concerned about what I've heard about supposed reliability issues but I sprung for 3 extra years of the Land Rover extended warranty, and I felt that warranty was a good value.  So I feel confident that my experience with this Range Rover Sport will be a good one over the next seven years. I highly recommend this car.",5

I actually traded the RRS in after 14 months and 17k miles. Overall, I loved the RRS. Incredible performance, handled great, gas milage was 21, seating was great/comfortable, Meridian sound was spectacular and generally speaking, a joy to drive in all types of weather. On longer road trips the RRS was very comfortable. I have a son in college 500 miles away (round trip) who played football, so 10 times (over 2 fall seasons) we did the trip - best ride and the RRS loved to settle in at about 78mph; quiet as a church mouse and stuck to the road like a bad reputation. The only issue I had was squeaky brakes (yes, you read that right); the high pitched everyone looks at you type. After 4 trips to the dealer, they finally got an ""upgraded"" set of pads (at 14k miles) from the motherland that didn't squeak. This was incredibly frustrating experience as RR knows or knew they had this issue, yet made me go through the steps and time for what should have been resolved the first time. My only other gripes (one which was changed for 17's on) was the small infotainment screen and the lack of storage. I can't believe a vehicle of this size has such limited storage up front and the hatch was rather small (my wife's ML350 has more space in the back). The short version of the review - if you want an SUV that handles like a Porsche 911 (well almost), feels incredibly safe/comfortable, accelerates like a rocket ship yet can go anywhere in any weather - get a RRS. Oh and I traded mine in for a GMC Sierra Ultimate Denali - just needed something more capable at hauling stuff (see storage gripe) around yet was great on road trips.",4

Although, there are a few issues that you must contend with before entering into a lease/purchase. I have had an Audi before and I felt its infotainment system was bad. Well, nothing quite prepares you for the system in the current Land Rover/Jaguar range. It is quite simply, the worst I have ever encountered. So bad that the dealership were open about it and didn't even bother to go through it. The in-control offers new potential, but the screen resolution is dire and the traffic overlay in the GPS is simply laughable. I knew more about upcoming apps than the dealership did, and they are still woeful. Why Land Rover decided to do it alone is beyond me. They should have teamed up with apple or android for their far superior app service. I simply use my own maps for long distance driving, which is  a bit of an annoyance since I put out 75k for a car, who's entertainment system is worse than a 2011 Jetta (another car I owned).The app store is a joke, they have nothing in there that people actually use. All the fanfare about an app that allows you to conference call in the car...really? Despite the fact that LR have put a ton of money into a new research facility in Oregon, it couldn't come soon enough. justDrive is a better alternative to using your phone, but it saps data and is clunky. It tires to filter all your functions into one easy application, but fails in poor quality graphics, and bad overlay. It also requires continuous cell coverage, which can be problematic when heading into the tundra. Sadly its inhouse sat nav is just not up to snuff, and has been around for years, but its stubbornly holding on. Last gripe on the tech front, is the screen size, camera quality and safety features. The guys at Land Rover should hire whoever designed the new Volvo XC90. That is what I call a car of the future. Amazing camera quality, and infotainment system. Why my car doesn't have a hotspot connection is beyond me. Most do these days, and its not exactly cutting edge technology. As for the sound system, I also opted for the base, which is piss poor. You have to turn the sound up really high to actually hear it, and there is no bass to speak of. I had the base sound system in the Audi and it was amazing. Onto comfort, it did take a while to break in the seats, but they are lovely now. It is hard to find a comfortable position for my arms, especially when driving longer distances. The door frame is eventually to high, and the door ledge is always to low. They should do away with the arm rest, its tiny, and is just an irritant. I always put it up and don't think I have ever bothered to use it since I got the car. The center bin, although large, is not easy to access, its so deep things get jumbled around. There is no space to put glasses, cell phones and cups in the center console. Space really is a premium up front. Now the first world gripes are out the way, the car is fantastic off the line. No real lag, and you pop it into sport mode if you need a quick entrance into traffic on the freeway, and it just goes like the clap. Worth every penny, and infotainment let down at that point. I have used it for some winter driving, and its 4x4 system is great. I couldn't have felt safer in this car. It just reads every inch of the road. No joke, its constantly adjusting to the conditions, and I was able to blaze past people doing 15 mph when the snow hit. Yes the ride is a little stiff, and you feel every bump, but I think that puts me more onto the road. A great feeling. It is well insulated and easy to reach the important buttons, climate and radio. Now, for reliability, It has been in a few times, but that was down to me thinking it was broken, rather than it actually was. Some concerning issues that Land Rover should fix is the hill roll. Most if not all cars stop the car rolling back on a steep incline. At a stop light or whatever. Not the Range, it slowly releases every 5 seconds. I took it in, and I was told that is how the car works, but ever since it has gone in, it doesn't release on an incline. Very strange. The other issue is with the cruise control. While you can set it, it is slow to adjust and you can get stuck trying to slow down. Best thing to do is to cancel the program and reset it at a slower speed. It is dangerous in its current set up. When going down a hill, on a normal highway I have noticed that the truck speeds up and never holds at a constant. The Audi never did that, and always held the car at the chosen speed. Again, I was told that it is like that and now it seems to have gone away when they had their top tech take a look. Since I have not had a full service, it would be unfair to talk about the price, or issues. I would note that for a car this price, there are a few things lacking. And some areas of real improvement. I would consider a new one in 2 years but I some serious improvements would have to be made for that to happen, from sales to service",4

The cabin has premium materials and the seats are comfortable. The stock sound system is cheap and only good to listen to the news reports and football games (which is what I need it for). If you are an audiophile you should upgrade to the max. The touch screen is at least 2 generations behind and the interface is clunky and poorly designed.

This kind of milage per gallon is the reason why most SUV should be diesel. I do not even use the smart on/off technology because I believe that diesel engines should have a minimum of ON/OFF for engine. Truly for a person to be fully satisfied with this RRS, they have to get all upgrades possible. Audio is garbage for the money you pay if you do not upgrade to the Meridian system. But this is a small sacrifice that is made up by the way it drives even if you are like me, bough the car without upgrading to Meridian System.Overall I could not picked a better SUV.

I was in love with my Porsche Cayenne until electrical problems began after a water leak.  When finally they threw their hands in the air and couldn't get to the bottom of all the shorts that the leak caused we were reluctant to go into another Cayenne.   I set out researching the RR Sport as the looks has always had me captivated since 2002 or so.   This body style is sleek as heck and rivals any X5 I come across.  I have no regrets on our decision to go with the RR.  We went with the V6 and don't miss the V8 we had in the Cayenne at all especially with the nice increase in MPG comparably.   This car in fit and finish surpasses any M class I have owned and we still have our daughter in one, as well as our Porsche!   Total class and sporty looks at the same time.   We have not had ANY issues with the car other than a simple thing like the plastic cover of the keys coming loose, THAT IS IT!

989, on 09/09/16 08:18 AM (PDT),RRS2TSLA ,2014 Land Rover Range Rover Sport SUV Supercharged 4dr SUV 4WD (5.0L 8cyl S/C 8A),RRS Supercharged Dynamic is a lot of hype," I like cars. I've owned some nice ones. I'm particularly fond of Rover since my grandfather owned the British Leland franchise in Victoria, Australia. But I've completely divorced myself of Land Rover after two very unfortunate experiences with an LR4 and a Range Rover Sport V8 Supercharged Dynamic. Here's my summary of main issues with the RRS; I Won't even start with my LR4 needing a new fuel injection system and transmission at 54K miles: The RRS is FAST!!! Like scary fast. And I don't mean that in a good way because the car is scary to drive fast. Edmunds track tested my vehicle at 4.2 seconds 0-60. But what good is a car that can't break quickly, feels like it's ripping itself apart, and can't handle around mild corners while accelerating or going fast. When accelerating in mine, it felt amazing, but I never felt confident that I could turn, swerve or break quickly if needed. So anxiety ensued with most of my opportunities to accelerate during daily driving. Second, the car's build quality is horrible for the price point. My vehicle rattled at the glove box, at the center console, in the driver and passenger seats, at the A pillar of the driver door, in the ceiling somewhere, and worst of all it rattled badly if I turned up the premium stereo. If you like luxury, you'll love how the RRS looks. But take it for a 10 minute drive and you'll be bothered that your nephews Toyota Carolla is quieter and doesn't rattle. Third issues was the breaks squeaked the day I bought the car and through a set of break pads (my wife's LR4 did the same through 3 sets of pads). Near $100K for a vehicle that sounds embarrassing pulling up at a stoplight. Not cool with me. Fourth and maybe most important, the myriad of issues I had with the car were well overshadowed by the HORRIBLE service experience at Land Rover Seattle. I could call about issues and they'd sometimes never follow up. I would complain about issues at multiple meetings and be promised follow up only to have nobody contact me. To be fair, the staff was pleasant. But when I purchase a $70K and a $95K+ vehicle from the same dealership I expect exceptional loyalty and customer service in return and that most certainly did not happen. In the end, I sold both my Rovers in the same month and took a massive loss on the RRS. Then I bought a Model S Tesla. And that car... well let's just say every issue I've pointed out is no longer and issue and I'll never own another vehicle but a Tesla.",2

We were promised that the car had voice activated navigation however very soon after taking delivery it did not have voice activated navigation.  The car is equipped but Land Rover has not provided the software to make it work.  You have to type on a screen in order to hopefully find the address you're looking for.  Finally after two months a new software release was installed which provided ""Go Home"", ""Cancel"", ""Navigate to previous destination"", that's it.  The car is beautiful, it's strong, and with the 380hp engine it really moves.  We are hoping to get voice activated navigation, we use that a lot.

Most recently was a 2015 Range Rover Sport SuperCharged.  The modern look of the Velar appears to have made the other RR's look dated.  I selected the 380 R Dynamic HSE.  Loaded it up like the First Edition - minus the First Edition Wheel since I like the Gray 21 inch wheel more (it shows allot less brake dust in the matte finish).   Performance is good - -and I would have said great - - if not for just having the RR S SC.   Other than that extra oomph of the RR Sport's performance I would say I prefer the Velar in all other ways - - from sound system, electronic interface to the lower access height (previous RR has deployable step but the Velar is still a more convenient access height).   For the technology blunt buyer there will be a learning curve.  Also, having the current MB S class I would actually say I prefer the RR approach on the technology interface - - more intuitive in many ways - - - additionally the customization of the screens and your personalize home screen is nice.  And of course, the humorous graphics are funny (when was the last you saw a iconic British Phone Booth used in a car's graphics).  Lighting at night is great, I was a bit fearful that high noon sun would minimize some of the screens but that has not been the case.  I was not impacted by the defroster recall although it seems like a simple software change (4 zone climate control might not be included in recall).   Now on to what is often the biggest concern of a LR or RR buyer - - - reliability -  - well other than one recall over the years and one dead accessory battery I have NEVER had an issue with any of my RRs.   However there are some things I always mandate - - low miles - - I mean LOW LOW LOW miles (if the vehicle has more than 20 miles) I won't take it.  I fear so many vehicles are abused in their first 100 to 200 miles on a dealer lot - so what should be a break-in period is really a 'ya broke it period'.   And of course, a demo is off the list because there is no luxury in a vehicle that had a hundred unknown butts all over its seats.  Also - - read a bit of the owners manual - - - many people can read countless gossip tweets and boring self absorbed Facebook postings but something you trust with your life,  you don't read.   I would strongly recommend the vehicle to a person who understands exactly what they are looking to purchase.",5

The vehicle’s defrost does not work which is the largest issue.  We’ve been told there is a temporary fix.. so we spent $75k on a car that is completely unsafe to drive.  The thing that upsets me the most is that this was a demo, whoever drove the car that works at the dealership for 3k miles should have known this.  Why wasn’t the issue fixed before selling it?!?  In addition the screens continually stop working while driving so we cannot see any of the necessary items while driving (speed, rpms, etc.).  Now the sunroof is refusing to close.  BUYERS BEWARE.  We will be trading in this car ASAP.  It’s just so unfortunate that we will lose money on it when these should have been non issues.

1029, on 01/02/18 13:39 PM (PST),Glenn H ,2018 Land Rover Range Rover Velar SUV R-Dynamic SE 4dr SUV AWD (2.0 4cyl Turbo 8A),"Velar looks good, feels great"," We were looking for a medium-size SUV with sharp exterior styling and luxurious interior, so settled on the new Velar as the best intersection of those qualities with reasonable cost. It seats five adults fairly comfortably and has enough cargo room for trips. We found a few other purchase options that were somewhat similar, but weighed at least 500 pounds more and cost at least $10K more. Only one option, the Porsche Macan, had a sportier look and drive feel, but it was compromised in terms of rear seat room and cargo space. We also like the bigger Range Rover Sport, but it's interior (at that time), while luxurious, was dated compared to the extremely modern, clean layout of the Velar's. We were reluctant to buy any four-cylinder car, but the surprising torque of the 247-hp Velar 250 won us over in the end. It's no hotrod, but we drove a long trip in it and never felt it was underpowered. We live in a moderate climate, so didn't care much about the Velar's cold weather features (four heated seats, heated steering wheel, remote start/warmup) , but they worked very well when we traveled to a colder area. The electronics may be the best thing about the Velar. The standard sound system is quite adequate and the navigation is good for an automotive system. (No built-in automobile nav is in in the same league as Google Maps on a cell phone.) But the three-section display of the Velar is as good as it gets. Big touchscreens and very configurable. The net result is a non-geek driver can set up the controls so they can actually be used without reading the manual every time you want to do something. Most modern cars have more electronic features than any driver can use, but the Velar's seem intuitive enough that someone can use the important ones. So far, we are getting a little over 21 miles to the gallon of premium gas. That seems subjectively a bit low, but for a 4200 pound car is acceptable. During the first six months of driving the Velar, the only glitch has been a dead battery, which is still somewhat mysterious, but very likely has to do with what I call ""pseudo-shutdown."" When in ""eco"" mode the engine can mimic a shut off when the transmission is placed in Park. The instrument panel does not give a clear indication of a problem (especially with lights in delayed-off auto mode), so it is possible to leave the car's ignition on in the garage. This will drain the battery completely within 36-48 hours. Or so it seems to me and the techs at the Range Rover dealership. The only other unwelcome surprise is the black roof trim of the R-Dynamic package. It looks great, but the pillars are made of plastic so soft that absolutely all brush-type car washes leave noticeable permanent swirl marks.",5

1031, on 10/08/17 09:05 AM (PDT),Blakslee ,2004 Land Rover Discovery SUV SE 4WD 4dr SUV (4.6L 8cyl 4A),You will pray this car from my penny less hands," This car was a ""gift"" from my aunt and uncle. My aunt took very good care of it (dealer took good care of it) but my uncle did not. When my sister was in college they gave her an 04 expedition Eddie Bauer which needed very little work. Fluids, tires, lots of vacuuming and washing. The land rover was given to me by side I'd lusted after it for 9 years...and it needed a transmission for which they were quoted over $4000. So they said if I wanted to fix it up I could have it. So far (first 3 months of ownership)my dad and I have: replaced transmission, transfer case, power steering pump, high pressure power steering pump hose, an a/c line (that we broke), front pads, rotors and calipers, crank sensor position unit, alternator, battery, tires, minor interior trip, full paint restoration and detail, wiper motor, all fluids, abs shuttle valve, electric fan, (radiator not far behind), all the bolts that hold the headlights in because I sheared every single one while replacing the bulbs.                                              However the car was neglected for several years and it is a joy to drive. I can't quite out my finger on it but I absolve driving this car. It handles very well actually (I'm on 18 inch wheels), is quite comfortable (although a bit bouncy. Maybe new shocks) and offers a very commanding view of the road. The car is very tall however the seats aren't that much higher than my zj. Steering feel is great. Forward and side visibility is great but the rear 3/4 blind spot is hard because the rear seats are a bit higher than the fronts. Also because of how hight the rear window is and the spare tire, rear visibility isn't great either. Many things underneath the car are much beefier than they probably need to be. For weighing the same as my zj, the sway bars are MUCH thicker. The best way I could put it is the driving experience is relaxing and very enjoyable.                                                               Now stuff I don't like. Parts can be expensive. Do NOT buy one of these if you can't do the work yourself or have enough money to pay someone else to do the work. Find a local land rover specialist mechanic and make him your best friend. Definitely get a code reader. Because I have 18s, snow tires are expensive so I'm looking as getting some 16s from an S trim level. The location of the window switches in the front makes no sense to me. The wing mirrors don't auto dim and are way to small. There are some features that my two previous cars (both older and less ""high end"" than land rover) have that this car doesn't. The wing mirrors don't dim and they're way to small. The window switches in the front are located in a really weird spot making them hard to operate and identify. The passenger seat only has power forwards, back and recline. No up down, tilt. No driver memory. Cruise control does not have a button to reduce speed and keep it engaged which my 02 Civic does. No CD in dash. Have to load the changer under passenger seat. Also, the car is SO SLOW. It really needs about 50-100 more horsepower.                                         Features I do really like. Heated seats work very well. Car has 2 sliding sunroofs and two curved panes over the rear jump seats (car is a 7 seater). A/c works really well. Heated windshield is a godsend especially when it started to fog up when the a/c is on. It's a little thing but I really like how the doors feel when you open and close them. Car also has Hill descent control and perhaps one if the most sophisticated traction control systems at the time.                                                                    This I think is the best looking land rover discovery generation and perhaps the coolest 7 seat car you can buy. I haven't been through a winter yet or taken it off road but those things are fast approaching. It is a joy to drive and I can't wait to take it on so many adventures.

Yep it requires research and big $$$$ to keep it going.  I bought my Land Rover used in 2008 for $15k with 75k miles on it.  Dumped a ton of money into it in repairs i.e. ($12K, head gasket, suspension airbags, braking system, front drive shaft, tires, steering arm, etc.) and have at least another $2k on the list right now (replace valve lifters and door mechanism and right ABS sensor).  Now it has 82k miles on it.  So if you run the numbers I got 7k (82k - 75k) use out of it and had to spend $14 ($12 + $2) in repairs.  You buy this car and you better be prepared emotionally and financially, because its probably going to get really ugly especially if you are buying this vehicle used unless you are buying it from an owner like me that just didn't mind staying on top of it and dumping tons of money into all the problems.  In that case at least you'd have somewhat of a fighting chance of getting some miles out of it before you have to dump thousands into it.  I am an older guy (54 years old) and I just wanted to own a Land Rover and I enjoy it and its just a toy for me and I anticipated difficulties but to be honest I did not think it could be as bad as it has been nonetheless I am jut at the age where I don't get myself worked up about it and just enjoy taking my family on road trips for with it.  But my sister called me because my nephew (age 18) wanted a Land Rover for his first car.  I said he has to read all the problems and join a forum for Land Rover owners and anticipate all the repairs before they happen and really get into owning a Land Rover and that she should put $15k into an account as a reserve fund for any repairs.  Well that was the end of my nephew getting a Land Rover.",3

First off if you can't work on your own (and I mean not just small stuff but in depth engine work) or can't afford to pay for frequent repair don't drive one.  You may fall in love with it as I did.  The ride (heavy vehicle which lets it ride smooth with a little roll), the 4wd (works great in slick mud/snow as long as sensors are working), the comfort (great interior), stereo, and just general coolness of the vehicle (even though it's kind of ugly in it's own way) will make you love it after driving it.  Take your time looking for one that has been well taken care of inside and out with records and has head gasket issues....yes this way you will get a good deal...you can do the repairs yourself fairly cheap.  Biggest problem is if it is leaking around the sleeve which is a $4k - $6k fix.  The vehicle drives and handles great no issues with braking as others speak of...even at 5,300 lbs it will stop on a dime.  Corners great with no tip over or feel of it as I've heard others mention.  Back doors do seem a bit small for getting in and out of so keep this in mind.  Only complaint I really have is the clock...why would anyone put a clock over by the passenger seat.

At 77,000 the rear main seal leaked like a fountian, the head gasket and a few other seals were leaking. Two door actuators, window crank and front hub went all before 100,000.

If not for the crappy quality of some parts and cheap engine seals this is an awesome vehicle. Land Rover has the reputation of oil leakers and garbage electronics. I bought it new so every mile was mine (110,000 when sold), and I am anal about maintenance but even good maintenance cannot help faulty materials.

This one is #141 of the limited Camel's Cup G4 Series.  The machine shows the influence of the BMW design team; it goes a lot faster, a lot quicker, but seems less stable in snow withstock tires.  The addition of Nokian SUV tires improves the traction markedly.  It was one of the few SUV's that I can put my portable clinic in, and still have room for the kids and their stuff.  The fuel milage is worse this Disco (12.5MPG) vs 15MPG on the prior Disco, but it had a smaller (4.ol) engine. I would look at the LR3 next.",3.75

Right now they are trying to fix: Hood cable is too long and could be a ""very bad situation"" (their words), the infamous infotainment system disaster, no less then 3 warning lights on, windshield washer fluid spilling everywhere and always showing it empty (even though it has not ever been used), and this big one: Twice while driving down the road (not while at a light, etc..) the car randomly shuts off and goes into an idle mode! The service guy today told me that he doesn't know why no one ever called me because it could have been very unsafe and he was sure that it scared me (it did!), and that this ""should""take care of it. Apparently it was something with the ECM and their was a needed update to the engine control unit that is the Powertrain for the vehicle! Hand to God that's what he said!

I traded in my LR3 and kept my LR4 and added this Discovery LUX. Since I wanted all the newest features I went for the LUX model and I am not disappointed. The new technology is excellent. The safety and parking features are a huge plus. The dealership pulled out all the stops when we got it home and found the pump for the windshield washer jets was not working. They drove us a loaner, picked this one up and drove it back to the dealership and fixed it, then brought it back the same day. My only complaint is the activity key. It is not working so the dealer has ordered us a new one and we will try that. I have to admit that having the back hatch open and close by waving my foot under it is a huge plus when my hands are full. And being able to see the car and all it's surroundings on my screen while manuvering the vehicle is a plus. But the best by far is the smart cruise control. No more braking and restarting the cruise when I come up on a vehicle but can't pass yet. The car slows down until I am far enough away and then it speeds right back up.

1106, on 01/17/18 06:30 AM (PST),Babak ,2017 Land Rover Discovery SUV HSE 4dr SUV 4WD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),My first and last Land Rover," I have had my Discovery for 4 months now and have driven it for exactly 4200 miles. I had this car special ordered and had to wait 4 months for it to be delivered. This is not a car that I just picked up off the dealer's lot. I tried to leave a similar post on Land Rover's own website, however they blocked my review twice. So here I'm. The support from Land Rover or the dealership is non existent. They love you up the point that you are purchasing the car. As soon as you pay for it, good luck getting any kind of support from them.  The car now has been sitting at the dealership for the past 10 days, due to TouchPro (infotainment center) issues. Nothing works. From slow boot ups (up to two minutes), to entire system locking up, to USB ports not connecting or rejection an iPhone after 30 seconds. Bluetooth music streaming has poor quality and has connectivity issues. Cameras continue to lock up and not available. The front parking sensors work only when you put on reverse, otherwise they don't work (unless you manually activate them for 2 or 3 mins). Navigation locks up. You cannot receive your listen to your text messages on infotainment system. The Bluetooth cannot support it. I can write a whole book about it. On the 7th day of the ownership a screw fell of the driver's side door. This is the screw that holds the door latch in place. It turned out that the other 3 doors had the same issue. The AEB (autonomous emergency breaking) does not work. I ended up setting up a soft dummy (that did not damage the car) and drove over it at about 10 miles per hour (the system should be active a 3 miles per hour an up). The system never kicked in. The dealer is telling me to continue driving and are telling me that they don't have a way to physically test the system. The only way to remotely start the car is to use the Land Rover app. Good luck getting the app to work. 9 out of 10 tries to get an error message about network congestion or poor cell coverage. The steering is very lose. You need a constantly correct the path even on straight high way stretches. Overall very disappointing ownership experience and would definitely consider off loading the car once it is financially feasible.",2

This is my first land rover discovery and I loved the look and ride. However, poor knowledge of salesman, poor service department support and poor management of the local dealership as well as corporate office is the worst I have experienced in luxury brands. As much as the car cost, you expect the best customer service from luxury brands which I have experienced with other luxury brands. However, Land Rover’s very slow responses from locan and corporate headquarters to their inability to address the problem quickly is making me very frustrated. It has been four months since I bought the car and I still have not able to use the activity key. They are still telling me it is a software issue that has to be addressed from the corporate. My problem is that why did you sell the car and made it sounds like that you only have to set it up to work. Back and forth between the dealership and the lack of knowledge of what is going on is absurd with the company of this size. I am still waiting and no apologies and they are just asking me to wait. What about the unreliability of their phone app. You will be lucky to have their app working once in may be 50 attempts. You constantly gets poor connectivity alert to just not working app. They still have not addressed the issue. I believe this is a false advertisement in their part that they are selling cars that they are advertising as if the activity key of land rover is working but in reality it is not. How long does it take to fix this kind of an issue? How about their service department? It might have been my local dealership but the difficulty of getting in touch with the service managers to lack of reponse from the general manger when you contact them just amazes me. this will be my last Land Rover. I wanted to experience Land Rover and I do like their car but bad customer service is big part of purchasing a car for me, and it is not worthy it in the future.",3

The Discovery ticked all the boxes:  seemingly solid build quality, diesel efficiency, great handling, and plenty of storage space.  Its price was less than that of a comparably equipped BMW X5/Mercedes.  We also considered a Q7, but there is no diesel option.   We have put on just over 2K miles in the month we have had it--fuel economy with 50/50 city/highway is spot on at 25.1mpg.   Can't wait to take it on a road trip and see what it can do.  It is a great riding vehicle, we have taken it off road a few times at our farm and it handled great--looking forward to the snow to see how it does.  Again, this is the most expensive vehicle we have ever purchased, but getting our $ back from VW was a major factor in deciding to purchase it.   Complaints:  the rear driver's side door was not assembled very well-the arm rest is not flush, but the dealer will fix it.  There was also a rattle in the exhaust shield, but that was easily fixed.  Thus far, no leaks or other issues.  The car is very quiet, and handles well for a vehicle of its size/weight.  I would recommend this car.****Update**** We now have nearly 9000 miles on the vehicle.  Here are the highlights:  the vehicle needs snow tires for winter driving in Wisconsin--the OEM tires are horrible in snow and ice.  The 4WD system is great, and the winter driving mode are incredible, but the tires could be improved.  -We had an issue with the DEF sensor in the extreme cold (ewe had a week of -10F)--it was remedied after several days at the dealership.  -Our family appreciated the heated 2nd row seats and heated windshield, washer fluid nozzles, rear camera and headlight washers. -Great on a road trip--got 31mpg @ 73mph on the interstate.  Plenty of room. -The vehicle gobbles up DEF. Have extra on hand, but don't overfill the tank, as it confuses the sensor, which could lead to an engine shutdown. -The navigation system suck-no voice commands-sadly, it is much easier to use Google maps on the iPhone. -The sound is great from the upgraded Meridian entertainment system. The interface through the Land Rover App sucks--it drops connection to the phone, causing the streaming to stop. -I wish it had apple car play. -The bluetooth phone system works great--very little background noise-very clear voice transmission.-There is a voluntary fix for the suspension.  I have to schedule time to take the vehicle in for 45 min installation of a new part. Haven't done so yet. -Got the vehicle stuck in both mud and snow on our farm--but was able to get it unstuck using some the fancy 4wd settings.  Pretty cool. It's a good car, that could be great with a few tech updates and better cold weather tires.",5

Have a Land Rover specialist (preferably not a dealer) do a thorough inspection before you buy. Get a service history.Expect a lot of work to have been done. The only red flag is a history of overheating associated with a very loud engine knock/tap.In the last 10k miles I have replaced the power steering pump and done regular maintenance, about $1200 total.

I have had less problems on this car then my wife's ford over the same period of time.  People often forget that LR have problems because the car will stick around for 15 years.  Other cars aren't even around to have these problems- for example try to find an explorer or even a 4runner 15 years old!  ",4.875

My car now has over 84k on it and all i have had to replace was a window motor, not surprising since it IS a Land Rover, and a gasket. I guess a Land Rover is like a good wine, it improves with age?

Then, they brought out the '99 Series II, and it all fell apart again.  Other than routine maintenance (brake pads), this has been a rock- solid vehicle.  With gasoline prices rising, I decided to drop down to 87 octane fuel instead of 92-93 octane premium, and actually get better gas mileage with the same performance!

The downside? $520.00 to repair the driver side window.  Premium gasoline only. Expensive and almost monthly ""little"" repair issues.  If you have a second vehicle as back up then you're okay. All in all, they are a dream to drive, but definitely a labor of love. Towing our travel trailer is not a problem at all.

They can be fussy, but for very specific reasons.  Let me explain, and perhaps this will help prospective buyers.Land Rover Disovery Series II is a one of a kind car.  You just can't find cars that do what they do anymore.  We looked at purchasing new SUV's, and you'd end up spending 80K vs 4K for a disco to find a car capable of what the disco is.  IMHO, they were bough for soccer moms in the late 90's and early 2000's.  They are not japanese cars.  They need attention.  They need a lot of attention.  It's when you ignore things that sound wrong, or don't pay attention to rattles or leaks that they go do hell.Rather than paying a car note of 600 bucks a month to a bank, we decided to pay a good mechanic a third of that to keep our Disco alive and safe and have some gas money.  It works out.  Assume to pay 3-4K per year in upkeep.  That's just used car 101.  Don't subscribe to ""It's a land rover thing"" when stuff breaks.  All used cars break if not attended too.  Rubber deteriorates, parts go bad, you just need to have a budget for it.Common issues with the Disco:1: ABS - It's a well documented issue and you can fix it for 5 bucks and a half an hour, if you know what you're doing assuming all sensors are ok.  The ABS module has a short, which can be fixed or bypassed with some knowledge.  You can find all the info on land rover forums.2: A/C Parts can go bad, but the main thing is that the fuse box can get corrosion, and there's on bad solder point.  again, some knowledge and you can get this fixed in 1/2 an hour for 10 bucks.  Simple stuff, and well documented. 3: leaks - The head gasket is the big one.  It goes bad.  Most have been replaced by 2015.  I just had mine done a second time.  I don't think the original replacement was done right, but we drive ours everywhere, so who knows.  Rubber goes bad.  Most of the seals should be replaced within 15 years anyway.  Again, not a japanese car. Land rovers are technically somewhat complex in that the have many computers and sensors to manage everything.  But, electrical issues are fairly easy to diagnose with a multimeter.  You have to have some knowhow or interest in learning.  Those electrical issues are the expensive ones because you typically have to go to the dealer to get a good reading, and they will overcharge.  If you can learn the layout, you'll save thousands over time.Here's the thing... now, cars are completely controlled by even more complex computers.  You're always going to have this hurdle unless you're driving a car from the 70's/80s.   MOST IMPORTANT THING : If you're handy, it's fun because it's simple enough that you can fix these cars yourself with some  time and interest.    If you just want a car to go from point a to point b . .. you should get a Hyundai.",4

I came to find out from other freelander owners that the brakes tend to heat up fast and then it set off your traction control warning. it tends to create more of a problem in the summer.The gas mileage for an suv this size is not the greatest.one of the biggest problems is you can only get the filter from a landrover dealer you just cant take it to the nearest jiffy lube to have your oil changed.it  also doesnt have alot of room for car seats .

The seatbelts don't work, and the airbag didn't deploy in a wreck. Also the speakers sound like they are blown and always have.

I find the Freelander to be very capable, comfortable and it does all I ask of it. I like the distinctive exterior style.

I am very happy with my Freelander after owning it for 15 months and 14,000 miles. Frankly, it fits my needs much better than the Discovery did and is far more reliable.

The styling certainly sets it apart from most other vehicles in it's class.  Very unique interior material (Technical Fabric), with excellent seat support and comfort.

Don't listen to people who say this is not a capable car, I had the '03 in mud up to the doorhandles and we made it out fine. Try that in any other SUV for the price.

Been in the dealership for overheating 3X. They tell me the overheating is due to something different each time. so this time it is in a different shop, since it is now not under warranty. I searched for mechanics - no one wants to touch it. I finally found a place to fix it.. & they are charging me $900.00. They say it needs a new water pump and they have to take apart 1/2 the engine to get to it. I owe the dealership that I bought it from $1000.00 for its MANY other repairs. I am a single mom.. & my credit is awful, so I can't trade it in. I am working to pay for my work transportation. ERGH ! frustrating !",3

I am averaging 23 mpg and no mechanical problems. I have read many negative reviews about this vehicle and have figured out why. First, this is not a sports car. I can see why people have to have engines replaced. The engine requires synthetic oil only. It has enough power to do the job but can see people flooring it all the time because it ""just isn't enough"" and that takes it toll on an engine, as is also true for the transmission. The brakes are disc- front/drum back so you cannot stand on the brakes all the time and not expect to replace pads very often. It's a luxury SUV treat it good, it will reciprocate.",4.875

The mechanics of Landrover cannot find the problem by diagnostics alone. They have to open the engine to  find out but not a guarantee that they will find it. How STUPID this Landrover diagnostics is. Landrover should terminate the Engineer who built this STUPID car diagnostics computer.

Most expensive to own with out of pocket expenses ( on a lease), worst dealer support.  I had the engine go at 19,000 miles. Left me stranded two hours from my house. Waited for ever for the right tow truck because the dial shifter won’t move if the car is dead. Took them a month to find out the engine was leaking oil onto the alternator.  Eco Start worked for the first 5,000 miles than stop working. They fixed it when they fixed the engine and the car would randomly shut off when you stopped for a traffic light for example.  They refused to pay for a rent a car until I went to corporate and because I was over 80 miles from my house they payed because it was trip abatement but told me they would of not payed otherwise.  Dealer never returned my calls. I had to stalk them to get any updates. They treated me like pond scum. The dealer also told me to drive it the 80 plus miles home with the engine leaking once they fixed the alternator and put in a new battery I refused because they would of never paid for any additional repairs if something else would of happened. Tire light was always on when there was no tire issues. The car had low miles and was never driven off road and had two sets of breaks, two sets of tires, new struts, the parking break system failed because the parking break is in the center counsel under the cup holders and got moisture in it some how. That was 5 k.  The dealer only paid for engine all the other items were considered normal wear. Thats after they have had the car for 3 days. I get the breaks and tires but struts on a car with 25,000 miles. Also, the car was sitting in my driveway and all the coolant spilled out of it. no warning, no light on. navigation, dont bother. worthless. usb ports are in the glove box, which if you are driving puts them on the opposite side of the car with no where to put  your phone. Sirius Radio would drop out and random points and so would my cell phone I just thought it was a Sirius and a cell phone issue but I actually own a honda now and it never does that in the same areas with the same cell and Sirius. No apple car play , but when you play the music from your cell phone it would not move forward to next song   Random interior plastic pieces would fall off. Valet key is like a barbie butter knife and try as you might you can’t ignore the horrible gas mileage. Ride was great. Everytime you turn on the car your heart drops because half the time there is a warning light. Even if it is door open you are still alarmed because you are so used to seeing warning lights on in this car. Also, you have to always think of wear to park it because of the height",1
1773, on 09/01/15 22:19 PM (PDT),Lmahler ,2015 Land Rover LR4 SUV HSE LUX 4dr SUV 4WD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),2nd Land Rover," We are a household right now with one and another soon-to-be teen driver. I have had a LR3 since 2006. In my mind as a mom it was known as ""the mobile command center"". With 5 seats in the back I could rescue kids at school from the school bus to become ""the Cool Bus"". Fast forward to high school.We were in the market for a used car in a house with two teen drivers. My husband looked up my 2006 LR3 in the Kelly Blue book to find out it was worth about $10-12,000. I thought ""why are we lookig for a decent used car for under $20K when there was fantastic one sitting right in our driveway?"" I had one incident right off the bat with my LR3 with the power steering going out on our first road trip. LR took care of it right away, including the towing. From then on out I had no problems with my car-I loved Land Rover. I came to the conclusion ""why doesn't mom get a new car and let the teens drive my old tank of a car? ""After building the LR4 online at the medium range with all the features we wanted, I tried out the same package at the Lux model range, only to go up $2000. I really didn't want the Lux for some reason but LOVE it and now have had it for 3 months.  Reading the other reviews, I have a few concerns/complaints. The weird whistling noise that to me sounds like it is coming from the stereo system was very prevolent in the first few weeks seems to have disappeared (fingers crossed) because it's annoying. The navigation system is really clunky, this is hands down my biggest question of ""what were they thinking?"". If you are entering an address  you need to start from the bottom of the menu. The keyboard is set-up in alphabetical order which is so counterintuative, who types like that??-NO ONE, LAND ROVER. And who in the world at LR said ""yeah, this is great, let's go with it."". As you are typing in letters the keyboard/screen goes dark for a second or so before the next avilable group of letters is availble, which is so slow!! The last time I used it my daughter and I were instructed to get off at an exit, we were now facing a traffic circle. The Nav system was silent for awhile while we drove in circles, then it instructed us to turn right on a street number that was not even on that traffic circle, it was just silent. We were so frustrated that we pulled into a gas staion, turned off the car, restarted it and reentered our destination. In the mean time we pulled out our Iphones to to direct us and it sent us on a totally different and better direction than the LR nav system.We were lucky enough to have been in Europe this summer and staying at a hotel that had gorgeous BMW loner cars. There is no comparing the BMW nav system (which was all in German) to Land Rover's. BMW's was fast and sleek compared to Land Rover-I hate saying that because I really love my Land Rovers!! If we didn't have teen drivers I would still be driving my LR3-I loved it. I LOVE my LR4, I find myself feeling like a newly licsensed 16 year old  driver looking for a reason to drive my new car. I am so lucky to drive a car like this and my dealership in Portland, Oregon, Rasmussen Land Rover have taken amazing care of me. They were an enormous part of why I bought a second Land Rover and why I will probably buy a third one day.",5

Land Rover USA has admitted that their is a problem in the air conditioning system of the 2015 LR4s, a problem that causes a high pitched whistle to be emitted from the dashboard area whenever the air conditioner is on (as it often is if you live in texas).  Land Rover says this is a ""characteristic"" of the 2015 LR4s, and have offered no fix for the problem.  If you are considering purchasing an LR4, I would seriously reconsider, until Land Rover has a fix for this issue.  Though the dealership has tried, they have been unable to fix the problem, and my car has spent over 40 days in the shop since I purchased it.  Update: car was in shop 100 days in 2 years and I had to hire a lawyer in order to have car declared a lemon.  I will never drive a Land Rover again, and I highly recommend no on else drive one either.  LR was terrible to deal with, was not concerned about me as an owner.",1

The electronics, especially the nav system, is dated, and a little slow.  The fuel mileage is awful (15 MPG average), especially if you drive above 80 MPH.

The interior is a little drab by today's standards, but certainly still luxurious.   2 glove boxes, lots of storage.  You don't get much more car with the  Range Rover - but you do get less seating and storage (!). The air suspension is stupendous - just swallows bumps in roads.  With 75,000 miles, i'm on 3rd set of brakes (city driving), second set of tires (Continentals came stock, were very good, Pirelli's on it now are great), 250th tank of gas (!).

I traded in my full size Supercharged v8 for it almost two years ago because that vehicle did not have enough cargo space. The roof slants downward, which limits what can and cannot be placed into the cargo hold, and the back seats do not fold completely flat, which means that anything that has to slide forward must be picked up and pulled to the front area of the vehicle. My Lr4 has fold-flat rear seats that open the cabin area up to a size large enough to accommodate two sleeping adults! The materials are tough and rugged and ready for heavy-duty use. I drive the LR4 for both around-town, as well as off-road, something you have to do at least once with the Lr4. As for issues, I have encountered a roof  leak that happens in heavy rains, where the waters drips onto the driver's side floorboards. The dealership is aware of the problem and has a fix for it, but don't even think about trying to do it yourself as it's a major bit of work.

Driven 5K miles so far. No issues. Looked at new Q7 and XC90, and Mercedes GLS. Didn't test drive X5. GLS was too expensive and felt like a boat. XC90 had a noisy engine and road noise and marginal 3rd row seat capacity. Q7 was nice but 3rd row was horrible and almost too much tech and we didn't care for styling. Visibility was good in XC90 and marginal in Q7. So why the LR4? Visibility and ride height are awesome, engine quite and transmission super smooth, acceleration surprisingly adequate, road noise and ride comfort superior. Though body roll exists, tires feel planted. 3rd row has great leg room and seat height comfort. 2nd row, though not adjustable, 3 adults can sit shoulder to shoulder and comfortable.

Don't get me wrong, service(Land Rover Huntington) are very professional and are amazing. But....$200 for an oil change, that's out of control. Another issue i also had was the front control arm bushings going bad causing another $1000 deposit to the service dept. Now the good! Again AMAZING to drive. V8 has endless power, active air suspension(when it works) gives a smooth confident feeling.

The LR4 is spacious with an improved engine giving it plenty of torque to both hug and pull the road towards you.  The grill is downright sexy.  I love all the windows and height inside the cabin.  There are sensors for both the front and back of the vehicle.  There are so many places to store things like my sweater for when I go into a restaurant or my gym shoes for walks in the woods or the golf range.

Wish it was offered with a Diesel engine, the V8 gas engine is thirsty (14.5 mpg) but has good pick-up. Off-road performance is second to none.

Two days later the light was on again and before we could get a scheduled appointment another ""impaired performance"" warning light was flashing. 3 WEEKS later the dealership calls to say the backordered injector has been installed.
