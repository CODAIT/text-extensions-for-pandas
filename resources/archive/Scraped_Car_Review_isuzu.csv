The fuel economy is great, the ride is a little bumpy, the only problem is it takes over 5 minutes to take off all of the back windows to lower the top.  Also putting the windows back on is not an easy chore, especially if you are caught in a rain stortm, other than that, I like the vehicle.",4.375

The first and second gear ratios are awefull. You just cant get through them without jerking the car around. Its so cheaply built. I did have fun with it, although it was way underpowered ( I thought I was gonna die going up huge hills.) But then When i was trying to switch lane (with those horrible blind spots) it took me a little too long to make sure it was clear and I ended up REAR ENDING A CAR! THEN THE CAR CAUGHT ON FIRE INSTANTLY AND INCINERATED EVERYTHING WITHIN MINUTES AS IF SOMEONE USED A FLAMETHROWER ON IT FOR 15 MINUTES STRAIGHT. I don't even know what to think of this vehicle.",3.25

The only thing about this truck is the transmission oil has no dipstick. You cannot check the fluid level or color from the under the hood, the truck has to be on a lift. So when we bought it used, about 3 months later the transmission started to jerk and we took it in to get serviced. It had about 55,000 miles on it and the mechanic told us the transmission had never been serviced and needed to be replaced. Of course he was a crook so we took it someplace else. They made repairs on it that cost around $500 so we got away pretty lucky. No problems since and it has been a great car. Just make sure to get the transmission checked out before you buy used!",4.5

Handles great, fun in the sun when the back comes down but you feel the safety with the front being a solid roof.  Gas mileage is a downer.  Blind spots are a problem.  Needs a light near the ignition too.  Have gone off road a few times and have had a blast.  Highly recommend.",4.25

No big deal and no damage incurred after driving it for a week before noticing the leak. Fun to drive. Not bad mileage, for an suv and 4wd. I've had Chevy, Ford, and Chryslers, never go back! Although a bit tight to get in the back seat, very fun to drive in the snow or the twisties on the dry. ",5

For those debating it, I   definitely recommend buying the V6   engine. Changing lanes takes getting   used to (the blind spots are   horrendous,) and with the spare tire and   rear-seat headrests where they are,   reverse is worse. But those are its only   drawbacks - keep them in mind when you   test drive it. I've been very pleased.  ",4.125

In FL we have lots of summer rain storms where having a truck-based SUV comes in handy.  It accelerates like no other SUV I have ever driven (Power speed button at your finger tip).  The HP is amazing.  The removable sunroofs are the best feature.  Don't buy a girly car based SUV like a CR-V.  Buy an Isuzu Rodeo Sport.  I have driven my in laws CR-V several dozen times and it simply does not compare.  I have have done nothing but routine maint. in 3 years of ownership.,4.5

What a difference in foul weather.  With the Jeep, as soon as the snow fell it had to go into 4WD and didn't come out until spring.  With the Isuzu I've only had to use 4WD twice and that was cause I was playing around.  I do miss the manual tranny of the jeep but that's about it.  Otherwise I've had a few minor issues.  On the way to work one day the tranny started slipping and popping.  Luckily it was only a small cracked gasket which puked out all the tranny fluid.  $180 and back on the road.  Otherwise just the driver's side window which likes to rock forward when closing.",3.625

The only mechanical/electrical problem we have experienced is a defective dashboard light dimmer switch which the dealer replaced at no cost and an fuel injection oxygen sensor. The fuel economy is not the greatest for a relatively small vehicle but its truck based construction allows greater towing capacities than similar small sport utilities. I would buy it again. ,4.375

Built very well and feels solid to drive, much more so than the Wrangler I used to own. Sits up high and the two bubble windows allow a good view of cars in the blindspots. The V6 engine is strong and the 4WD is excellent, the moonroofs are fun and add natural light, the 6-speaker stereo is pretty good and all the power options still work well. Good cargo room in the back and places for stuff in the front. It's easy to clean inside, and the outside even looks good dirty. And since it's small there's a lot more room in the garage. Overall a great little SUV for on and off-road. ",4.375

The two sunroofs are conversation starters that's for sure! There weren't a lot of them driving along around here but I've noticed more and more of them this year.

In winter conditions and mud it is great to have 4WD.  It looks nice and the stereo system is awesome.  My dog actually loves to ride in it.  He likes all the windows to look out.

I did not need room for extra passengers. In fact I took the back seat out and cut out plywood to fit and put carpet over it. If you need to use the back seat it night be ok for kids but not adults. Too hard to get in and out of. But it was just what I wanted and needed.

Recently I finally turned over the 36,000 mile mark so thought it was appropriate to write a 36,000 mile review.

I was displeased that the vehicle could not be serviced at the local gm dealer and had to be towed 150 miles away to an isuzu dealer, and i was stuck having to figure a way to go get it when it was fixed.

Much better than my 2.3 liter, I-4 Ford Ranger.  Mileage was better, too.  It handles very well on the road with the exception of body roll on tight turns and has a wider than expected turning radius.  Visibility is very good and gives the feeling of zero blind spots.  All of the controls are easily manipulated and ergonomically placed, plus the instrument panel is logically laid out. The vinyl seat of the base model leaves much to be desired.  Base model appointments are very base model and make the Ranger XL feel almost plush. Mine has been in for a front-end rattle which will require multiple visits.",4.5

It has a very powerful motor that will easily give you 24 mpg. Sometimes up to 28 mpg. The 19 gallon tank will get you anywhere from 300 to 400 miles.

I can't wait to try a distance trip. The little booster seats in the back have wonderful hooks for the child car seat and are safe. The windows are perfect for viewing all around. My little girl loves that she has a back seat speaker for the radio, and a window just the right height to be able to see. The heater does not blast me on the foot as some vehicles do and have louvers that really close. I am long legged and this little truck gives me plenty of leg room.  That is a major plus. Driving it up the mountain to the top of the Sandia's was no problem even though there was plenty of snow and ice to deal with. A plus so far",4.75

With 227,000 miles on it, the only work it has EVER needed was a power-steering pump, rack-and-pinion at 222,000. The all-leather interior with motorized heated seats makes it a dream for long-distance travel. Performance-wise, it got the best gas mileage in its class when I bought it, and I improved that with a straightened tail pipe (to accommodate a full-sized spare) and the addition of a Magna-Flo muffler system ($164) and a K & N air filter ($50). It has better power than a comparable Tacoma and better gas mileage, and the 4WD on the fly system is also great. It is an Isuzu design, with requisite GM features such as automatic on-off lights (interior and exterior) that never let you burn out your battery. I have always run Big-O AT OFF-ROAD radials, and have gotten as much as 90,000 miles out of a set of tires on five-way rotation. The secret to owning this vehicle is regular servicing at a reliable dealer, and a good wash, including undercarriage, every two weeks. The fact that it is a GMC-Canyon/Chevrolet-Colorado clone makes any parts replacement extremely affordable.",5

I will say that I am impressed with the handling it has in the ""Urban Jungle."" The powertrain is average, feels like it could use the Ascender/Trailblazer I-6 engine.  The vehicle could have used a few more hours of development in the interior. The plastics feel unrefined, yet solid. The center console leaves you wanting more. The seating arrangement could use adjustable headrests for better comfort. Compared to the Frontier/Tacoma trucks it feels about a generation behind. Overall, it gets you from A to B, and I would suggest trading up to one of the afore mentioned vehicles when you can.",3.25

As such, resale is lower, which I took full advantage of.  For the money as a basic truck, it's been a great buy.  Interior materials are cheesy but durable.  At 200,000 miles, still runs like a champ, uses no oil, and doesn't show any signs of slowing down.  Other than regular maintenance, only repairs have been for minor things like replacing the tailgate latch.  This engine family was designed for durability and low maintenance, and in my experience this has been proven to be true.",5

This review is after I sold it before I moved overseas. I want people to know how good the truck was when I owned it. I bought it with low miles from a ""stealership."" Despite the goat-rope and lies spilling out of the stealership employees mouths trying to convince me to purchase warranties and other stuff, I managed to escape with a good price after they had me waiting and waiting almost 7 hours to pay cash for it. Idiots.  My experience at the stealership was so bad in fact I will never go back into one to buy a car. My Isuzu was gently owned and had low miles, about 22,000. I paid $11,500 and it was exactly what I wanted. No frills dependable transportation with utility. I hadn't had much luck in the past with power options on other cars so this truck was perfect as it did NOT have power windows or power door locks.  I have to admit the Isuzu front end looks a lot better than the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon. I got a lot of compliments on the truck. It had great storage behind the front row bench seat and it also had the extra side doors and two jumper seats that folded up. I used the truck bed quite a lot to move heavy equipment, large items, and on one occasion I helped a neighbor move a piano that was extremely heavy. It took six people who barely picked up and loaded the piano in the back of the truck. Yeah it was low in the back and probably way over the payload but it had no problem. Acceleration on the truck with the 4cyl was always pretty good. Gas mileage was good too. The interior was really nice and functional. The AC was freezing cold and all the controls and everything worked great. I didn't want to sell the truck but had to when I moved overseas. While I was overseas I saw several Isuzu trucks just like mine that had diesel engines and I wanted one. It amazes me how you see all these great vehicles and fuel efficient engine options while overseas but we don't have them in the US. I can't really fault the truck as it did everything I needed during my ownership minus one small issue that would come up every now and then...The truck sometimes would not start. It would crank and crank but would not start, and the security icon would be illuminated on the gauge cluster. After a few minutes it would start no problem and the security icon would disappear. Only happened a couple times. I had no idea how or why that would happen, and most likely was due to something I was doing with the keys and ignition...who knows. I would buy another one if I saw one with low miles but people don't really sell them. Great truck, very tough, and looked good.",4

Car always sounded like a train coming to a stop. Burned up tires quickly too. Leaked quite a bit of oil. Had quirky electrical problems like windows and door locks not working. At one point the driver had to roll down the window and reach out to open the door from the outside. Used to hit my head on the tailgate when it was open. Road noise was a bit loud.Other than that we had the car for ten years and 152000 miles. Sold it when the exhaust manifold cracked.,3.5

We have enjoyed the features and reliability of this car; in fact, it was never into the dealer until it was 8 years old, and then it was for a recall problem that manifested itself by the car dying rather inconveniently.

Have driven this vehicle from coast to coast, border to border, with minimum concern.  The only problem encountered was a recall on the ignition lock and in this instance found that dealer knowledge of the vehicle was limited.  Honda mechanics were able to recognize it as a twin of the Odyssey.  Nearly every person who serviced it commented on the integrity of the vehicle. Gas mileage was best at Interstate limit without pushing it on hills or passing: 26-28 mpg.  My only complaint was that it did not provide adequate traction on snowy roads when loaded.

We thought it would be a good car for me, just starting to drive... but we couldnt have been more wrong. I had the car less than 3 months and the battery terminals were shot, the window was off track, and the horn didn't work. Later, the check trans light came on so had to change trans fluid. The brakes went out on my dad, driving home from work. The headlight visability at night wasn't all that great. Rear window visability was very limited. It left me stranded a few times. Around a year of having the vx the a/c heat blower motor went out, and we put it up for sale. I just hope that we bought a lemon, and the others are better.",3
245, on 04/29/18 11:20 AM (PDT),Rich ,1999 Isuzu VehiCROSS SUV 2dr SUV 4WD,On my 3rd Vehicross!," I love this vehicle.  Most fun to drive of any car I've ever owned.  But, since Isuzu pulled out of North America, obtaining parts can be a problem.  This is exasperated (or exacerbated... pick your choice of terms) by the fact that the VX was only made for 3 years.  The only saving grace here is that most of the engine and transmission components are the same as the Trooper or, in some cases, the Rodeo.  My first one lasted 11 years until someone crashed into it.  My second was destroyed by hail a year ago.  On my third now.  But, with only 4153 made between 99-01, there are few left and many of those have problems with rust and all of the attendant problems inherent in a nearly 20-year old vehicle.  The most common problems are burning oil and bad window regulators which cause the side windows to go out of the track.  Sadly, I've gotten good at repairing those.  Don't get one unless you plan to be your own mechanic, and check for rust especially in the undercarriage and places hidden by the faux carbon fiber panels).  You will break bolts when doing any significant work... be ready to deal with that.  Also, blue book gives absolutely no credit for being a rare, specialty vehicle.  This can be a problem when dealing with insurance claims as they will want to total it if it gets a hangnail!",5

The seats are Recaro racing seats providing extreme comfort and support on long drives. Ground clearance is excellent as well. I think this is the most reliable vehicle I have owned.

It has character, drives like a sports car, is extremely comfortable, and is a great 4x4 (& in snow).  Minor drawbacks:  rear view (easy fix: get a back up camera and learn to turn your head!), cup holders (replacing 6-disk CD changer with one), head room (due to sunroof; okay with seats leaned back slightly), and front passenger toe room under dash.

The VC is a tank in snow and  is smooth and secure on the road. I put 79K mi of it's 113K without mechanical problems. It has always used oil, though. Keep the fuel system clean to minimize oil consumption. I get 18-20 MPG. The torque on demand 4WD is great but the ability to switch to 2WD would increase gas mileage. Handling is superb and acceleration is very good. Seat comfort is excellent. Access to back seats is inadequate except for children. Even though capable off-road the ride on rough roads is jarring.

It certainly looks different from anything out there. However, it's all style and very little practicality. The cargo area is relatively small, the back seats have been a joke, visibility is downright dangerous (I feel safer on my motorcycle) and I couldn't stand long distance trips - very uncomfortable after a while. Unfortunately the engine started burning oil like there's no tomorrow (2 qts a month) a few months ago, which I've found out is a normal thing for the 3.5L V6. Now I've just been told it's broken a valve and I need a new engine.... JUST outside the powertrain warranty at 69k miles. Bye bye Isuzu..",3

I have a very knowledgeable shop owner with talented techs that maintain it for me and don't drive much more than 5000 miles/year.  Both of those factors help with reliability.

My dad told me I should get a more reliable vehicle and he picked it out and said he would help with the down payment if I got it.  I hated it.  Did not want a stick shift although I did want an SUV. So I bought it.It turned out to be the best purchase of my life.  Watched my son grow up from his car seat to the driver seat in Her, and She carried my second son home from the hospital when he was born in 06. I kept Her up pretty faithfully with my oil changes and tune ups. I have to do a better job with flushing and replacing coolant and transmission fluids; I have done that at about 2x. But  NO MAJOR PROBLEMS.  Just got a new catalytic converter in 2013 costed me $600 just to pass smog.  Other than that I did most of the work myself starter 2x, alternator once, fuel pump, and  brakes once (just the front never had to do the back ones yet).   Had the AC compressor replaced a couple times, after this summer it may need it again.  The fuel gauge had been broken for years but just replaced the fuel pump a couple months ago and it is working now.I have used Her as a commuter from Sacramento to the SF bay area for 6 years.  She is still my commuter but now I only work 30 miles away from home. Thought She was a goner a few days ago; all of a sudden She started smoking on my way to work and heard noise coming from the engine. I was sad. But  turned out to be a broken Idler pulley.

At 25,000 miles, the car died in a car parking lot, could not get it started.  Contacted the Isuzu Customer Service to get Road Side Assistance and waited for more than 2 hours; no more showed up. Eventually managed to start the car myself and drove back home;  gave the car to the dealership to fix the problem, but they could not find the problem. I ended up on telling them how to find the startup problem and they have no clue how to fix it and they ended up erasing the computer system in the car and reprogramming it.  At 52,000 miles, the fuel gauge is gone.  At 56,000 miles, the tires were gone.  At 81,000 miles, the transmission went bad. ",2.125

I currently have 121,000 miles on it and the engine is still as strong as day one.  The vehicle is great for trips due to the size of the seating and cargo area.  Mine has the tow package and the vehicle excels at towing.  My vehicle has never let me down or left me stranded.  The engine is rock solid.  Note, I have always taken my vehicle to the dealership for major maintenance (30K, 60K, and 90K) which has kept the vehicle running in top shape.

I don't see it as an in-town car and don't use it much for that.  I can easily drive it 16 hours straight without discomfort, so not sure why others complain about comfort. Even mountain driving has averaged 20-22 mpg, so again not sure why others get bad mileage.  It's not a love affair, but I've had no repairs and it does what it's supposed to do.  Granted, a set of Michelin cross track tires smoothed and silenced the highway ride like I could not believe.  No rattles yet, and everything works.

This was discovered while in the shop for a new solenoid. Seems like problem after problem. Shame, because it's a roomy, fast ride.

Still using the original engine, transmission, rotors, A/C, heating, power windows, fog lights, suspension.  The shocks will get replaced soon. The fuel gauge/fuel sending unit needs replacing ($300).  Overall a great vehicle.  I have done all of the servicing at the dealership, and they have done a great job maintaining the vehicle.

Especially when I replaced the stock Goodyear tires. It was a deathtrap when it rained.  Unfortunately, I have 81K miles and I am afraid it's nearing the end. Gas millage is going south, gas gauge is on it's way out, seat is breaking down, oil burning, and it was not designed for desert heat. I had some rubber pieces melt and/or break in the last year.

Defrost function works terribly.  Terrible mileage, even by SUV standards.  Burns oil.  Seats are uncomfortable. There are cars much cheaper than this which are much better in quality.

The engine light has come on, and no one can tell me what the code means! The engine also regularly sticks in first gear and the engine whines, then finally engages.

The 3.2L V6 is not an astounding powerplant, but it is lively and reliable;  it makes plenty of torque for light-duty towing and trips up the canyon, but it won't set any speed records.

I love the toughness of the vehicle and the ability to keep running. I maintained the truck with oil changes, belts, tires, etc. I have had a few minor problems, one fan went out that cost me $200, and I have a small coolant leak right now, but what do you expect at 160k miles! I have put nearly 100k miles on the Rodeo since purchasing it, and feel I have more then got my money's worth. My husband and I call it ""Old Faithful""!",4.375

I have maintained it well, and not had any significant problems.  It is a V6 with a manual transmission and 2 wheel drive.  It is a great city car and good in the mountains and dirt roads, fun to drive, has very good power, gets reasonably good mileage (18 city, 22 hwy) and has been very reliable.  Downsides - the seats are a little Spartan, and it does have a truck-like ride (also a positive, since it is one rugged vehicle).  Also, at about 100,000 miles, it did start to use some oil - I have to add a quart about every 2,000 miles, so not quite enough to get by between oil changes.  I am going to miss it.",4.5

I chose it thinking it would be a good, reliable vehicle with low maintenance costs.  I was wrong.  Come to find out, these engines are extremely problematic and I have yet to see a car with this engine over 170,000 miles.  A comparable Toyota 4Runner will run twice as long with no problems.  There is a reason why Isuzu's things depreciate so quickly.  My 150,000 mile Rodeo burns about a quart of oil every 600 miles, so I always have to have some on hand.  And the parts are ridiculously expensive, often higher than comparable parts for a BMW--literally.",2.875

Unfortunately, I'm now stuck with an oil-burning mess that depreciates alarmingly fast.  I'll fix one thing, only to have two more problems emerge.  This car is so frustrating.  I do like the power.  I have to check my speedometer often, because if I don't, I find myself going way too fast.  I also like the manual transmission.  I do enjoy the rarity of a stick shift midsize SUV.

At about 93,000 miles the engine started losing coolant. I could not see it leaking anywhere. I took it to the shop assuming the head gasket was leaking into the cylinder and burning there. If that was the problem, it would have been a $3000.00 dollar fix. The repair shop called with bad news. A head bolt broke in the block and could not be repaired. A second hand engine with 70,000 miles would have been a $5000.00 repair. After paying $3000.00 for AC work I decided not to fix it.

Outside of standard maintenance (changing fluids, brakes, tires, charging the A/C, etc.) and proactively changing both the timing belt and water pump at 60,000 miles (no mechanical problems with them), I have only had to change 3 sensors (drive shaft, power steering and O2).

Lots of Isuzu owners from 1998 to at least 2005 have had to have at least one engine replaced in the vehicle.  It is this V6 engine that has caused Isuzu to close around half of their dealerships and put them very close to just going out of business.  Around 60k miles the engines begin using lots of oil and usually end up with a spun bearing.",3.125

It had 85000 miles on it. We did the regular maintenance. Well when the thing hit 100,000 miles we decided to change the timing belt as recommended; everything went down hill from there. First the belt was done wrong so the valves were smashed. ItÂ’s been 10,000 miles since the belt was changed. We have since replaced the water pump, the thermostat 3 times, the radiator, the drive belt, the belt tensioner, the hoses, we have had the head resurfaced and let me tell you the parts for these things don't come cheap.

The engine is truly incredible.  At 125,000 miles it hasn't leaked oil, lost power or experienced any reduction in the gas mileage.  It just keeps going.  Like any car, you need to perform regular oil changes, and a 100K mileage service check (e.g., to change timing belt, fuel pump etc.), but I've experienced no major problems.  As a used car purchase, it would make a great beater car for an outdoor enthusiest/college student.    ",4.375

Just before the 5 year warranty was about to expire, the engine began burning about 1 to 2 liters of oil every 5000 kms. ISUZU Canada says this is acceptable and will not honor the warranty. This vehicle is noisy with squeaks, etc and if you're looking for a smooth riding vehicle, this isn't it.  My suggestion is to avoid this like the plague and for the cost, buy a Honda!  ",1.5

My Subaru rides great and gets 27 mpg but it couldn't pull the hair off of a wet dog.  That's my two cents. Oh, and with 92,000 miles and 2 trips across the country (loaded down, avg 18mpg), it's still running as strong as ever.  Great truck.",4.75

I can say that, at 80,000+ miles, I've had no problems with my Rodeo.  I have followed all the scheduled maintenance (not cheap), but the only thing I've ever had to replace were the brakes at 4 years and the battery at 5 years.   Prior cars were Ford Thunderbird, Ford Taurus, Ford Festiva, and Pontiac Sunbird.   I love my Rodeo and highly recommend them. ",4.75

The 4WD did not work right off due to a bad actuator that had to be replaced.  About a year later the Transmission Position Sensor went out and had trouble putting in gear.  Ran fine for the following 3 years without one problem.  About 6 months ago the TPS went out again, and fixed it myself by cleaning out the dirt.  About a month later or 5 months ago at 78,000 miles, the transmission had to be replaced at a cost of $2000.00.  Aside from the transmission, can't complain too much.

Speaking of gas mileage, remember, if you live in a cold climate and have a lead foot, every SUV will eat gas, but GM's powerful engine lets you use a light foot and still get sufficient power. I average 19 mpg in everyday driving, 21 on the highway as long as you keep it below 80. That's probably as good as real-world results for most crossovers.

I should of done more research on this SUV. I went to the dealer after the second visit in the first week of owning the SUV and talked to the man and told him if I could have my older car back and he could keep the $3500 I gave them, well I guess you no how that turned out.

It has a very soft ride for city driving.  Highway driving while smooth is a bit choppy.  I think it has to do with aerodynamics and that I'm used to owning a car.  Compared to the Ascender's cousins (Trailblazer, Envoy), it can't be beat for warranty and price.  I bought mine brand new for $19,965.  Apparently, Isuzu was offering quite a bit off of MSRP yet it wasn't advertised.  This is almost $7,000 off of sticker price (I think it's because Isuzu is in big trouble financially).

Cute, compact. Can crawl up some mean inclines. As a first car for a young driver it handled its share of curbs close calls.  Unfortunately, an endless struggle with the transmission and less than favorable gas mileage has caused me to sell my beloved Amigo. Transmission was rebuilt in 2007 months after the purchase, and it's now acting up again. It gets around 16-17 mpg, which simply doesn't cut it for a struggling college student.

I have actually gotten stuck there a time or two. I had the privilege of working on my Amigo in the last few weeks. I had a gas leak, and helped to take off the intake manifold to access the gas line where it was leaking. The thermostat was located there too, making it challenging to replace, but interesting.

The CD changer was intermittently problematic, but with the advent of iPods, ultimately unnecessary.  In cold weather, the alarm system sometimes malfunctions. I disabled the audible alert.

Parts can be pretty cheap if bought online, but the SUV is so compact it makes it hard to work on. It does burn about a quart every 1000 miles or so, but it has superior gas milage to any other SUV of its class.

I don't like how the engine taps loudly when it's cold, over 2000 rpms sound horrible at cold, but sounds fine after heating up. The weathering from typical New England cause the soft top to harden and very difficult to use. The 2WD model is bad in the snow and slides very easily (except I like to slide, its fun).

Quick rundown, transmission went on me exactly 2 months after the 5 yr wrnty expired, no help from isuzu,  Check engine light on since 30k miles, pass window wont roll down, ac went, radio broke, suspension squeaks, rear seat broke, bumper cracked, intake gasket went, o2 sensors went, catalytic converters went. All I can say is the Amigo, is no friend of mine. Nor is Isuzu. ",2.375

1173, on 04/05/03 00:00 AM (PST),desono ,1998 Isuzu Amigo SUV S V6 2dr SUV 4WD w/Soft Top,Burns Oil worse than any car I've owned," While I bought this car because it was one of the few convertible SUV's, I should have waited to see what the long term problems would be. The worst problem is that it burns a quart of oil every thousand miles. That's 3 quarts between oil Changes! If you forget to check the oil between oil changes (and who does) you can be nearly out of oil.  Worse yet, the dealer claims this is NORMAL! I've owned 10 other cars over the years from VW's to Oldsmobiles, BMW's, Hondas and others and NONE blew out oil like this car, except my 1975 rabbit that the dealer finally rebuilt the engine on since it was an engineering defect (soft valve guides).",2.625
1174, on 04/04/03 00:00 AM (PST),roxanne ,1998 Isuzu Amigo SUV S 2dr SUV w/Soft Top,Never been happy," Purchased in '98, very happy with theprice and the dealership.  I loved myAmigo at first, however, the problemsstarted about 6 weeks after I purchasedit.  The starter and ignition have beenreplaced so many times that I cantremember.  Constant humming noise, andmisc. parts have been unresolved since Idrove off the lot with only 3 miles. The starting problem has never beenfixed correctly although I have broughtit to 4 different Isuzu Dealerships.Overall, I loved the look of the vehiclebut I don't like the headaches caused bybeing stranded too many times",3.125
1175, on 03/03/03 00:00 AM (PST),jballer ,1998 Isuzu Amigo SUV S 2dr SUV w/Soft Top,Amigo," This has been a great SUV to date. The timing belt snapped at 56,000 miles, but that was due to the adjuster. Isuzu replaced the engine for free, so can't complain there. Looking forward to driving this truck for many years to come. Great all weather handling; recently got to test it out driving through 2ft of snow, handled like a charm.",4.875
1176, on 12/15/02 00:00 AM (PST),Ryan Wilson ,1998 Isuzu Amigo SUV S 2dr SUV 4WD,The Story of Ryan's Amigo Adventures," The interior is layed out very well, as it basic, yet flawless.  There is room for 6 soda cans and plenty of storage space.  The glove box is generous in size.  The seats are very comfortable, the pedals are sufficient in size. The exterior is very nice.   The drivetrain is excellent.  I purchased this amigo with a 130HP I-4 GM-made 2.2L DOHC engine that is suffuicient in rural Iowa. It is a little slow in large city traffic, such as Dallas or Minneapolis, however, it is a stick and that gives the driver enough control that an I-4 is sufficient in this vehicle.     Great off-road with its full underbody skit plates. Great SUV",4.75

Got into 2 accidents with it. 1 minor, the other not so minor. Few replacements on it but all that just added to greater perfomance.Very good with gas and very effective for long distance trips.",4.625

Timming belt broke due to a problem with the adjuster. Recall was called but after my problem. Isuzu was great they gave me a new engine. Most manufacters would not cover the engine with that many miles. Isuzu states in their powertrain warranty that they do not pay for rentals. They offered I did not even have to ask.",4.875
