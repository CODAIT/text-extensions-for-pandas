Quietly the Best Ferrari Ever!," This car, the 612 Scaglietti,  is overlooked compared to the Spider and Enzo, however it performs better than any Ferrari I have ever owned or driven in.  People go nuts over this car when you ""run it."" It has the comforts of a Cadillac, yet the performance of a Viper.   I am truly extremely satisfied with this Ferrari.",5
5, on 01/02/07 12:40 PM (PST),Don Brodie ,2006 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.7L 12cyl 6M),612 After One Year," The reliability of this car is only fair. I initially had severe computer problems that started the car on 6-cylinders and after two minutes switched to 12 cylinders. The car shook and sputtered for those two minutes. This was corrected after two visits in which a computer re-programming took place. Now I have my check engine light constantly flashing even after being deactivated, twice. It again recently activated, and I have to bring it in again for the third time. ",4.5

I wanted to get an Enzo, but it is too much money. The 612 Scaglietti is nicer and cheaper. I also have a Bentley GT which drives much better.",4.875
7, on 03/29/06 13:42 PM (PST),Mike ,2006 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti Coupe F1 2dr Coupe (5.7L 12cyl 6AM),Not an everyday car," I just purchased this Black on Black with yellow stiching 612 and it is EXCELLENT! Peoples' jaws drop and heads are flying from all directions when I drive by. The exterior is great with side scallops which look great and lines that cut between the headlamps. The rear trunk has two additional storage compartments which is great. The interior is supperb with automatic climate control, automatic headlamps, rain sensing windshield wipers, electric seats, heated seats, electric mirrors, and rear seats are just as comfortable as the front ones. I warn you though this is not an everyday car, considering I payed over $300,000 dollars it. The steering mounted sport button is 10 times better than normal auto.",4.875

Yes it's an incredible vehicle, but performance is nearly identical with 612, and you can bring others with you comfortably.  Extremely happy with the Ferrari, more so than any of the previous ""3"" we owned over an eleven year span.",5
10, on 04/18/07 13:41 PM (PDT),Jacky  ,2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.7L 12cyl 6M),Disappointed!," When I first purchased the car I was extremly thrilled. However, after few days I discovered so many faults in the car. The handling and performance of the car is amazing!! However: 1. The car had very strong smell of fuel inside. 2. Every hole in the road sounds like if the car was going to break down. 3. The handbrake did not stop the car! I sent the car to the Ferrari shop which tried several times to fix it. The service was very good however, the car continued to have the same faults. In my opinion $260,000 car should be perfect. This car is worth only for racing, not for daily use.  Don't buy this car.  Thanks",4

The engine is downright frightening. The F1 shifts are flawless. The interior is not cramped with room in the back for small kids or quick dinner adult trips.  I truly can't get enough of this car.  Yes downright expensive ""close to 300 thousand"". However I am satisfied after purchase.",5

The straight line tracking and solid acceleration on a fairly large body, is almost mind boggling!  When you pull up to valet the 612 Scaglietti, you are swarmed like nothing ever witnessed.  Quality has been good, although a few minor electronic computer gremlins that were fixed with a software update.",5

It is truly everything that a gentleman's GT car should be. Stunning styling, great craftmanship, easy to use controls, and of course great performance. It also has enough room to load up friends and/or luggage and take off ona Grand Tour, something you can't do in a Lambo.",5

Purchased this car for the Speed, Comfort, and ""CLASS"".   Waited nearly Two years, but honestly worth it.    Bentley, Aston, Lambo, no longer carry this type of Ferrari substance, nor its price tag.    Extremely satisfied with this 4.0  0-60 large, safe, comfortable sports car.    Truly in a world of its own. ",5

Its seats are outstanding.  The back seats have enough room.  the car even comes with a full trunk.  It actually gets decent gas mileage.  This is my third Ferrari in nine years and it is truly my favorite to date.",5
18, on 05/07/05 21:27 PM (PDT),John Arnold ,2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti Coupe 2dr Coupe (5.7L 12cyl 6M),Not What it Seems," When I first bought the 2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, I was anticipating the greatest experience of my life.  It was a great car the first couple of days, but it lost its excitement fast.  The lack of a sporty design tends to not turn as many heads, but the power will take you off the line faster than any other car you will find.",3.125
19, on 05/07/05 11:07 AM (PDT),david byer ,2005 Ferrari 612 Scaglietti Coupe F1 2dr Coupe (5.7L 12cyl 6AM),Best Ferrari Ever," After ordering a Ferrari 360 Modeno and finding it too small for my 6'4"" frame, I decided to order the 456GT to be remodeled. Ferrari didn't know exactly when it would be coming in, so I just transfered my deposit and waited over four and a half years.  I recieved all the artists drawings, engineering pictures and eventually the final pictures of the first two cars to be shown at the Detroit auto show. Upon picking up my 612 Scaglietti I was first impressed with how solid it felt and how quiet and comfortable the interior was. Its instrumentation is simple, the stereo is great but what you get from this car mostly is an eye catching exotic car that isn't too exotic. Being over 40 years old it is the best car in the world to me.",4.75

This car is the ultimate in beauty, luxury, performance and adrenaline stimulant.  The car looks gorgeous with the top up or down. It is a shame that it has a great sound system because it stays off so that you can hear the engine.  It is not fussy about usual road dips and driveways.  Room enough for a family of four to sit and enjoy a ride. I even had medium sized adults squeeze in the back for a ride! ",5

It is fast (0-60 in 3.6 seconds) , comfortable as a Mercedes SL 65 and in my opinion the most beautiful modern Ferrari ever built. Top review.",4.5

It's supremely fast but also tame enough to drive anyday. The engine is a 6.0L V12 derived from the Enzo. 611 horsepower is what you can expect. The car can really do anything you want it to and if you make a mistake on the road, it is much more forgiving than the likes of other RWD cars. Performance is amazing and the handling is almost to the level of the Bugatti Veyron. Anybody who has a passion for cars must take this out for a drive. The 599 hits every benchmark of supercar performance. Its a fantastic car that must be experienced first hand to get the most out of it.",4.5

The music of the V-12 along with the incredibly comfortable seats and power to take you anywhere, anytime is beyond compare.  The F-1 is very fast and intuitive.  A very balanced feel of superior steering, brakes and throttle. A much smoother ride than I ever imagined out of a super handling car.",5

The power is great and is so much fun actually putting it down on the road.  Shifting is a bit notchy at anything under 8/10ths pace, but the only complaint is the lack of quality stero to compliment the song of the V8.

After waiting my whole life to buy a Ferrari, it broke down the first weekend I had it. Got it serviced, worked fine for a week and broke down again. Just take a look at the Ferrari forums online and you'll see how unreliable these cars are. It perplexes me that a car as respected as a Ferrari can be so terrible. As with all Ferraris, your mechanic will spend more time worth it than you will. I got rid of mine and will never but a Ferrari (or any Italian car) again.",2

Engine warning light came on second day.

It has been in the service garage longer than my own garage. It's under an extended warranty. It is an absolutely gorgeous piece of art though and it converted me (a Lamborghini enthusiast) to Ferrari when I saw it at the dealership. It is the most beautiful looking Ferrari in my opinion - better looking than the newer F430. The sound is great also. The glass hood over the engine is a nice touch. ",3.375

Its easy to drive and its suspension settings can be changed to suit the driver's needs and the outside conditions.  It is amazing.  Its nearly as fast as an Enzo, it is just a bullet.

I traded my Lamborghini Galardo for the Scuderia and what a difference! The Scuderia comes with no radio, floor mats or any creature comforts. The acceleration is neck snapping and the exhaust note changes loudness depending on the pedal pressure becoming extremely loud at above 5000 RPM. The steering is extremely light (big difference from the Lambo)and controlling this light car in hard acceleration takes a bit of getting used to. The ceramic brakes are extremely touchy and again take a while to get used to. The seats are very hard and even short drives can be hard on the back. Wouldn't recommend this car to first timers",4.5
