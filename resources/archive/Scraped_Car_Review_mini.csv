0, on 07/31/18 17:57 PM (PDT),Lynn ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),TOP GEAR," I got my mini one year ago (2017) as a ""TOY"".  Just for fun, running errands, drive it locally. etc. Keep in mind, the mini was 15yrs old when I got it. The odometer  showed 55,000 but after getting a car-fax, the mini really had 160,000 last time reported in 2015. Now in 2018 I estimate the mini to have close to 200,000.  My mini is still strong, tranny is smooth, changes gears easy, clutch is perfect. I never would have guess the actual mileage to be so high.  It drives so good, I don't use my SUV much any more. I don't know how long it will run without repairs, but for me it's ""TOP GEAR""",4
1, on 07/12/16 08:54 AM (PDT),Barb  Wilcox ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),A very nice SECOND car.," Number one would be the extraordinarily high dealer maintenance costs!  They are about the same across the board as a very high level BMW.  Great handling, but with the basic set-up, very poor acceleration.  Very easy to park.",4
2, on 07/07/10 03:58 AM (PDT),tywashin ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Best small car on the road!," Well, I have only owned it for about two months, so far it has been a great car. It's very fun to drive. And I like how other mini owners wave when ever we see each other. I draw attention wherever I go. It's also the best car I have ever had on gas. The seats could be a little more comfortable for long road trips.",4.5
3, on 06/06/10 23:11 PM (PDT),jennyj ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Stay Away!," I bought this car from the previous owner who babied the car and had virtually no mileage. I argued with my family and friends that if I had to drive a ""fuel economy"" car it would at least not be generic, so I bought the Mini. To say I have been let down with this car and BMW's backing of this car would be the understatement of the millennium! The transmission went at 42,000 miles and the wanted 7,500 to replace it, even though there were hundreds of similar complaints of faulty tranny's, BMW simply turned its head! Next were the window motors, the end caps of the rain gutters, the exhaust (at over a grand), the power steering pump, and more! This car is the biggest pile of garbage around!",2.125
4, on 09/30/08 18:31 PM (PDT),ghost ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Very upset!!," I purchased my 2002 Mini last Aug. 2007.  I have driven it less than 3 thousand miles..if even that much.  I was told today that something called the Final Drive needed to be replaced and the Transmission was messed up.  Being that our economy is so great and I can't get a job- I couldn't afford the thousands it cost to fix it.. and lost over thousands in letting it go for pennies.  I am saddened beyond belief that a car that I thought was so incredible, after all, a BMW etc., turned out to be the biggest lemon that I have ever purchased. OK.. I loved that car for the whole time I had it.. and now.. feel so very let down!",2.5

It has plenty of power to render confidence in passing and on ramp approach, corners on a dime, and has awesome gas milage without performance trade-off.  However, I've experienced way too many costly repairs ie. engine wire harness, intake valve module, cooling fan module, power steering pump etc. It's time to cut my losses. Regretable, I scream uncle.  ",3.875
7, on 04/03/08 20:11 PM (PDT),Fun in Del Mar ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Clutch and Transmission Failure," I have had a lot of trouble initially with the computer system of the car, but the worst is that I had to have the clutch replaced at 75,000. miles and now I need a new transmission at 83,000. miles.  Dealer tells me it's my driving - but I have been driving Beemer stick-shifts my whole life - I never had to have either one of those parts replaced until I got to 175,000. miles.  Furthermore, all maintenance the car needs is very expensive - which may have to do with individual dealerships. Nor am I happy about the acceleration of the car.  It certainly does not compare to any of the 3- series of the BMW's - but then again it's also cheaper.",3.25
8, on 02/08/08 08:33 AM (PST),T Ritchison ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),Mighty," My Mini S, makes me smile. It's everything I ever wanted in a small car. Lots of fun to drive. The 6 speed is awesome. The engine is very reponsive. I've taken many long trips. The hum of the engine & exhaust at 60- 80 MPH, is music. Never had so much fun. I'm a backpacker. The room in the back is perfect for wine, hiking poles, cooler, 1 large suitcase and 2 back packs. My only dislike; the run flat tires. Expensive to replace  and are good for about 25-27 G's. But I can live with that! I believe, its the best reproduction ever. My Mini & Me. My license plate is MIGHTY. Its that and then some. Wow!",4.875
9, on 10/01/07 12:10 PM (PDT),Lisa ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),2002 Mini Cooper S," This car has been a real joy to drive. Not only does it handle exceptionally well in all weather conditions, it gets great mileage and has been very reliable. I replaced the run-flat tires with some wider softer tread tires, and that really made the car ride much more smoothly. I just carry a can of flat fixer in case I ever get a flat, which I have not in all the years I've owned it. I always tell people that the mini is not a luxury car, it drives like a sports car. The design is extremely utilitarian, which I like! I think everyone should own a Mini!",4.875
10, on 06/07/07 10:21 AM (PDT),Drew ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),Best Car. . .Ever," The MINI Cooper S is, without a doubt, one of the greatest autos ever delivered to the masses. It combines just about every ideal for a car, from safety to sporty, economy to performance, capacity to compactness (read ""park it anywhere"").  I've had mine for a year and have literally nothing but praise for it, and can't wait to drive it every time I've got to go somewhere. Now I'm just wondering when the honeymoon will end.",5
11, on 02/15/07 10:28 AM (PST),MILTON ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Fun, This is the most fun car I have ever driven. Its only downfall is that it is a little weak on take off. Its high end speed and gas mileage at the high end are great. There is no way to explain the handling and fun factor.,5
12, on 12/11/06 20:13 PM (PST),AimlssVail ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Can't Wait to Get Another One," We have had this car for 4 1/2 years in the Colorado High country.  Even on a powder day I wouldn't trade it.  It loves the snow and handles awesome.  I average well over 30 miles a gallon around town and 40 on a road trip.  It will wiz up Vail Pass at high speeds (shhhh don't tell).  OK so it can't handle a snowboard over 156cm, I guess that is what the sunroof is for!",5
13, on 11/16/06 08:32 AM (PST),johnnie3 ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Runabout Plus!," This is an amazing automobile for what I got it for. I drive a lot coming and going to work and wanted something other than the traditional Toaster-Box commuter car (PT Cruiser, Toyota Yaris, Ford Focus, etc.) This car has as much equipment as my larger SUV and is just a comfortable and I'm a rather large fellow of 6', 250 lbs. I can still even get four folks in for a run to the movies, mall or what have you. I love it and so far and I'm glad that I bought it. I wish I could have gotten a smarter salesperson at the Mini dealer who told me that there was no certified used program thus causing me to get one someplace else.  Whatever, I do most of my own maintenance anyway.",4.375

It's a bargain to boot.  It is very well designed and constructed.  This car is so much fun one should be issued at birth. ",4.75
15, on 05/31/06 12:51 PM (PDT),steve ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),Love My Mini," I was totally bummed when my Alfa was totaled (pun intended) but owning this Mini has made the passing a positive experience.  This is the most fun car I have driven in a long time.  Even though I didn't get the faster model, it is plenty quick around town.   On a recent 4 hour road trip, we couldn't believe the gas mileage we got on the highway going back and forth from NY to DC in one tank of gas!  The car cruised effortlessly at 80 mph the whole way and was a comfortable ride.  ",5
16, on 05/20/06 23:32 PM (PDT),MonsterMINI ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),"""Monster"""," Monster is the license plate of my 2002 Chili Red Mini Cooper S with black bonnet stripes.  It is BMW technology at its best - an affordable, compact car that people from all walks of life desire.  The history plays a major roll for this car, yet even if this was its first time around, I believe it would be equally as popular simply because of its perfect engineering and carefree lifestyle that it promotes.  Whenever MINI owners pass one anther on the street they most always wave or honk, very unusual in today's world of ""iPods.""",5
17, on 02/02/06 09:49 AM (PST),Holly Bell ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),Mini and Me," Owning a MINI Cooper S is like having a Corvette. Every Mini owner you pass by on the road waves just like the Vette owners. It andles well on the road. I am able to keep up with all the other traffic on the highway. The Cooper S is nimble and quick enough to react in tricky situations, but it is a heavy vehicle that doesn't sway back and forth on the highway when its windy like other vehicles I have owned. this is especially nice when passing tractor trailors.",5
18, on 01/23/06 11:46 AM (PST),Tomas N ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),"Excellent Car, Too Bad..."," Driving the MINI Cooper is the most fun that anybody can have with their pants on; it really is that good.  It's fast (although could be faster), and the phrase ""corners like it's on rails"" is a tremendous understatement.  Unfortunately, the fun can only be had for 4, maybe 5 days a week, as the Cooper will inevitably spend the rest of the week getting fixed.  In the 2+ years that I've had my car, it has been in the shop for a total of about 14-16 times.  Everything has been replaced (from the power steering fan, to the entire transmission, and everything in between). I would estimate that the total cost of repairs (under warranty) has been approximately $10-$12K CDN.",4.125

How is it that MINI (Read BMW) can pack so much stuff into this price point but no one else can? Bi-xenon lamps in a car with a base price of $20,000! This can not be possible. Then you drive the car, its engine is smooth with a very linear feel to the power, especially considering that it is supercharged. Then you take your favorite corner and realize that it is going to be one of the most fun cars you will ever drive. Taking that corner at great speed, I had as big a smile on my face as I did the first time I hammered on a new 911 Turbo S. The moral of the story is stop reading buy a MINI Cooper S.",4.25
20, on 10/06/05 18:33 PM (PDT),CIndy ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),Booo for Mini," My transmission and clutch went out on my car at nearly 68,000 miles. I had to spend $4,000 to have them replaced. I learned how to drive a car with a manual transmission so the problem isn't me riding the clutchor abusing the car. This car is junk.  I'd NEVER tell anybody to buy one again! ",2.625
21, on 09/06/05 16:57 PM (PDT),urbanllc ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl 5M),love it / hate it," I can't think of another car I could want after having a MINI; however, especially for the first two years, I can't think of another car that could have given me so much trouble.  I'll chalk it up to having bought the first model year. The mpg is poor and not nearly as high as represented.  Still, it's a good city car, fun to drive and easy to park. Service at my dealer is superb.   Surprisingly, with the backseats down, it can transport quite a lot of cargo. ",3.5
22, on 05/28/05 14:11 PM (PDT),Nextboat ,2002 MINI Cooper Hatchback S 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl S/C 6M),Big Kids Go Cart," I used to own a 1967 MINI Coooper S. It was great fun, but unreliable, and in the shop constantly. The new MINI Cooper S is everything I could have wanted back then, and more. Handling, Safety, creature comforts, and feels better at 100 miles an hour than most cars. We use this car to move theings when we can't use our 5 series BMW, because we can fit more in with the seats folded down. This is a great car.",5

Don't be deceived by size.Have pictures of car loaded for ski weekend for 2 adults with 3 pairs of boots, 2 pairs of skis, and a snowboard.    Not even packed.  Only thing I've had to borrow a car for was to borrow a ladder.  Both are better borrowed.

The Sport and Premium packages (leather, on board computer, sunroof, cd player etc.) make it feel even more like a luxury car.  But the best part is the feel of this little guy gripping the road.

Tires - Most of these cars require run flat tires, because there is no spare! This will cost you more. O2 Sensors if you do not know what this is DO NOT BUY THIS CAR! 2 of them and 80.00 a pop. Brakes 140.00, Water outlet gasket just the gasket if you can find it 16.00. Plug wire and plugs 120.00. I was a fool for buying this fun car and even dumber to put money into it. What they don't tell you is the added expense if you do not run premium gas. You will eat O2 sensors up all the time. Clutch1. Don't loose the keys this will be spendy2. Repairs - You better have money a clutch is upwards of 1800.003. Only a mini dealer can clear some of the codes this will cost you.4.

I always look forward to driving it, whether on an 800 mile round trip to the mountains, or a 2 mile trip to the store. Acceleration is super, as is braking. Cornering is something to look forward to, as there is no detectable lean, even when pushing what I would call normal ""around town"" driving. I have never had trouble merging onto the freeway, making that last-minute 3-lane lane change if I have to, or parking. My biggest worry is if someone dings one of the doors. I have the GPS system, which is not only hugely useful, but great fun. It gets twice the mileage of my V-8 SUV, which I keep because it's paid off, and sometimes I need to haul wood or dirt - not for a Mini!",4.5

At first the parking garage said there was no room, but when they saw my Mini, they found room for that car!  I have yet to use my husbands truck to go grocery shopping.

I purchased the S model and added the moonroof, fog lamps and DSC.  The moonroof is outstanding, I like the DSC but if I didn't have the fog lamps, I wouldn't notice.  I haven't had any problems, but after 20,000 miles there are a few rattles and squeaks (particularly in the brakes on a cold day - the dealer told me that that was because of the brake pad composition).  Its gas mileage is good, even with having to buy premium gas (I just filled it today and spent $32 in NJ).

Living in the congested Portland, OR metro area, I have to say that it is the right choice. I do use the manual mode at times and can either maximize my fuel economy or power by shifting myself. We got the sport package with the 17"" wheels. The ride is a little rough, but we don't mind and the handling is great. Its fuel economy in mostly city driving has been around 19-21 MPG.

You just never forget that you are driving a special car.  I don't race about, but any time a curve comes along I can't help but raise the revs and enjoy the thrill of this car's cornering.

It is also called upon for long distance travel duty. The build quality is much better than my old '02 MINI Cooper S.

The ECU upgrades have solved several old drivability issues. This is still the most enjoyable vehicle that I have ever owned whether on a 5 hour drive or a weekend at the track.  It makes the everyday commute something to look forward to. I can not get into my car without smiling. But, it is not for everone. Because it is only 2 door it is not a great family car.

The Sport package is a great value and the convertible top with two functions is great.  Finally for the money ($31,000) there better buys out there!",3.5

I have driven the car on long road trips and it has performed well in a number of different areas  with great performance and reliability. Maintenance, other than routine, has been at a minimum until about 6 months ago. Then the computer went, costly repair. Remember, the MINI is a member of the BMW family, and that translates into EXPENSIVE.  Given its pedigree, I expected the quality to be much higher. There is a lot of plastic and rummer that is exceptionally poor in quality. Rubber windshield gasket deteriorated very early in its life but that deterioration did not effect performance (no leaks), it just did not look good.

There are no instructions for owner maintainence and the instructions for resetting the stupid computer for things as simple as inflating the tires are either incomplete or unintelligible. Oil change intervals of 15,000 miles are too long and only contribute to more trips to the dealer in the long run as the engine wears out. Every Mini owner can attest to the utter worthlessness of the run flat tires. Harsh ride and expensive to replace I put conventional radials on and it made big improvement. For a ""sports"" car with all the electronics I""d expect and oil pressure gauge and a temperature gauge at the minimum, but apparently BMW engineers knew better. I bought my Cooper S with 13,000 miles and never got the Email regarding the recall for timing belt tensioner replacement until mine imploded at 30,000 miles. The local dealer was willing to replace mine, but up until that moment I'd never had oil consumption problems. Since then it burned through 2 qts. in 5000 miles. Coincidence? I think the fragments from the tensioner ruined the internal parts of the engine.

Scary as all hell, could have been injured bad, but was lucky that the road I was on was relatively traffic free.  Response from Northwest Mini was too bad for you and it was the same for MINI USA.  Looks like the safety inspections do not include checking the brake lines.  You'd think that would be fundamental.  The Mini is extremely fun to drive but hard to trust to keep you safe.  I really hope my experience is out of the ordinary, but folks should be aware before they buy.  ",3.5

The Lexus was just too 'boring to drive. I wanted something with 'attitude'! With a doubt my MINI Cooper S is it! The only cars I can remember that I've owned that were this much fun and excitng to drive were my 1973 BMW 2002 Tii or my 1972 Capri (from Germany V- 6)!  Yes its ride is a bit 'taut', but if you're looking for a smooth ride, but a Lexus or a Buick. Everyplace I go, people stop to look and ask or compliment me about it. In short, I love my MINI! ",5

I have always liked Minis, and this car fit my personality to a 'T' (or so I thought).  All was well, for about a month.  I took it to the shop after I bought it to have them look over an issue I was having with brakes squeaking.  I need new front brakes; also, there were about $3000 worth of repairs that my car needed because I had holes in my oil line, and all other types of issues.  This took me two trips to the dealership to get all of these taken care of.  We will consider those my fault for buying a lemon, without taking it to the dealership before buying it.  With those repairs out of the way, over the next two years I have taken my Mini to the dealership over a dozen times.  I have had the wiring fixed, I have had a new throttle body installed, I have had to have the entire front end realigned and fixed because rain was just coming right into my convertible top, and had this weird possession episode where my tachometer was telling the rest of my lights and functions to freak out and come on at random.  I breaks down at random, and then will work for a couple of weeks, only for the issue to come up again, or another one to rear its ugly head.  I purchased my car in Jan 2014, it is now Sep 2016, I have paid for my car more than twice now!!!!!  Don't walk, run, run far far far away from this car.  The times it does work, I love it, it is so fun to drive.  But, if you are the type of person that wants to know if you are going to make if from point A to B...ever, don't buy it.",1

So quit being a stiff yourself and just drive the darn thing like its meant to be driven!!!  Moreover this might be a ""mini car"" but its a GIANT KILLER that i feel has fulfilled GIANT aspirations!!!  GREAT CAR!!!

I purchased my 2012 Base Model Mini with manual transmission last Aug. with 31,000 miles.  While driving down to my favorite eatery, shifting from 1st to 2nd shifter know came off in my hand.  I managed to replace it and continued on.  A couple of days later a aprox. 32,000 miles I began to notice a clatter from the engine at first start up in the morning, during the next few weeks it became progressively worse.  I took it to the local Mini dealer and was informed the clatter was the clutch failing.  Being a mechanic for 40 plus years I called BS, told them to keep the car for a cold start test the next day.  Low and behold it was determined the timing chain was at fault, these engines apparently have chain tensioners prone to failure.  The timing chain was replaced along with tensioners and  gears.  The dealer Seattle Mini stuck by their story that my clutch was failing and would be 2400.00 to replace, but offered me an extended warranty that would cover the clutch for 1895.00.  What a way to cover the cost of the warranty work. About 2 weeks after having the work down, the engine began to misfire badly, had it towed to the dealer, they replaced the coil packs for the ignition, and spark plugs and wires.  So here we are today, 41,102 miles, the engine is beginning to clatter again from the exact same location.  Under warranty to 50,000 miles.  Soon as it gets worse to justify the warranty work and before 50,000 miles back in again for another timing chain, followed by a quick trade in for another car, not MINI.  Oh and did I mention that Seattle Mini tried the whole your clutch is failing routine on me a 2nd time with offer of the extended warranty when I took it in for the Misfire problem I mentioned earlier.  By the way the clutch still works perfect, however the manual transmission has always been clunky when shifting, the transition from 1st to 2nd requires a firm pull, it also has no reverse lock out, on 2 separate occasions I have been at a light and forgot to downshift into first, while quickly doing so as to not block traffic, it went into reverse.

It was a good year of ownership but not without it's major hiccups. I, too, was one of the people that thought I would be amongst the ""lucky ones"" and not have any of the issues that the other reviews mentioned. I wish I was wrong. The Mini was not bad at first...I got mine with only 57K miles. It was fun to drive, gripped like a go cart, had decent acceleration, and got okay fuel economy. Just over a year later I am glad it is gone (with 64K miles). I miss it, but it was far too expensive to maintain. Here is my list of the things that went wrong while I owned the car (I kept up on maintenance, or at least tried to): 1. Engine would occasionally randomly have issues idling and sometimes shut down. 2. The A/C is basically non-existent. Even with a fresh re-charge it never blew cold or strong enough to make a difference (say hello to sweaty back on hot days). Also, don't know if it was just mine, but anytime the A/C was on, even on low, the car was much harder to drive and would sometimes stall when idling. Acceleration was also drastically decreased. 3. Everything creaks and rattles from the interior plastics, cheap door sound, etc. 4. Clutch/flywheel started making screeching sounds, come to find out flywheel was burning ($1,800 for clutch and flywheel). The dealer said this is a common issue. 5. A/C compressor went out in the middle of the summer ($900). 6. Two days after the A/C went out, passenger window motor regulator failed, couldn't roll window down or all the way up. 7. Headliner was sagging since the day I got it and got worse on cold days. 8. Power steering fluid reservoir always had a leak no matter how many times it was fixed (common issue). 9. Two weeks after the A/C and window regulator went out, the power steering failed. It was a nice August summer turning around the weight of the car with no A/C or passenger window. Luckily enough that was under recall and got fixed. 10. After the recall got fixed I got a list of $3,600 worth of repairs that the dealer said ""red--required attention soon"". Add on the ""yellow--will soon require attention"" and it was up to about $5,200. I decided to part with my MINI at this point. Needless to say, it was hard to sell with such a long list of issues. If you are a college student or are tight on money, this is probably not the car for you. You can get a similar driving dynamic and performance for other cars that will not cost you as much to maintain.",2

The previous owner had installed 18 inch wheels which allowed the car to corner as if on rails but resulted in a really rough ride. After about a year of this, I changed to 17 inch wheels. Much better.  Any car with over 100,000 miles is going to need a lot of things replaced, and the Mini is no exception.  Maintenance cost can be greatly reduced by not using “genuine Mini” parts. For example, I just had the clutch changed (for the first time) at 160,000 miles.  The dual mass flywheel used as original equipment by Mini is made by Luk in Germany. Buying the replacement genuine Luk part from Rock Auto cost me $254.79 whereas had I bought the same part with a Mini sticker on it, the price would have been $734.75.  I think of this Mini as a two person and a dog sports car that surprises many people with how fast it i",3

I have lived with a stuck driver's side window and a windshield stress crack for many years. When I brought my Mini in for a recent power steering recall, I was informed that coolant and oil was leaking.  It would cost almost $3k at the dealer or $1.5k at an independent shop. There is no shortage of class action lawsuits for various problems that Mini refused to resolve. It's a fun car to drive under the speed limit. I can squeeze a lot of stuff into it. I have been able to transport a folded queen memory foam mattress.I decided to sell my Mini rather than repair everything and risk facing other issues (clutch, transmission, etc.) popping up in the near future. I paid the MSRP of $17k in 2003 and sold it for $3k to the local franchise dealer in 2016 after another mechanic corroborated the repairs that were needed. I was not able to get anyone on Craigslist to pay more than the dealer.",3

But as soon as these Minis get up to 125K - 130K miles, literally EVERYTHING starts failing. And each repair runs $500-$700. In the span of 4 months, I experienced a coolant leak, corrupted crank sensor, busted water pump, and finally a busted head gasket. The last one was the final straw - the mechanic said the repair would cost more than the car's value. And I should also mention, these cars are NOT made to withstand Wisconsin winters. If you live in the Northwest, avoid these cars at all costs.",2

The seller did not do any maintenance to the car since he owned it (for 3 years) and no record of what was done to the car. I could tell there was something going on with the belt at the time I purchased it. (ended up being belt tensioner) We have done tons of maintenance that was overdue along with preventative maintenance to keep it running strong.I literally drove my mini from Florida to California, then from California to Iowa, then from Iowa to Florida and had no issues. Not to mention the little car was weighted down most likely beyond its capacity as I was moving around the country a lot at the time. Here is a list of typical things that need to be replaced for higher mile minis and I highly suggest you look into these parts for replacement if you do own a mini:*Bypass valve*PC Valve*Spark plugs and wires*Coil Pack (usually rusted connection causing acceleration issues)*Map Sensors (preventative not really needed at the time)*Timing chain tensioner*ATI super charger damper crank pulley (highly suggest you go with a higher grade crank pulley- the stock ones are known to not last) *Power steering pump (always known to eventually go bad)Oil pan and seal*replaced belt*fuel filter *Suspension bump stops*Engine Mounts (mine were literally done for falling apart- i went with poly mounts however it will make the car more rigid so more vibration) I am a mother with a 3-year-old son. I have a large Recaro Car seat that fits in my car. I drive my car daily and I make road trips in my car. You have to decide personally why do you want an older R53 mini? My husband and I work on our own cars so we don't pay for a mechanic; We only pay for the parts. I highly suggest Way Motor Works or ECS Tuning they have the best deals on parts from what we have found for my mini.The car is small and rigid so the ride is not as smooth as our 335Xi BMW. If you want something that drives like a Cadillac then think about getting a different car. This is a fun little car that I enjoy modding and driving and I plan on replacing the engine when it comes to that point. I don't plan on ever getting rid of my mini. Is there some maintenance sure what car does not have maintenance especially once you hit 100k miles. Mini coopers are not your Toyota Camry or Honda Civic standard car they are for the unique few who find an interest in the silly character and the up and down pro and cons of what all involves the mini.",4

Clutch? How's $2400? Engine? How's $6,500 on up? Automatic transmission? Don't even ask. Front brakes? $500. Broken AC? $1200 on up. New catalytic? How about $1800?   Broken sunroof glass? Again, don't ask, you'll have a heart attack.Plusses: Fun to drive, great acceleration on the S model, plenty of leg and head room for tall drivers, decent fuel economy, great handling and braking (to a point--a Mini does like to hop around a bit). Minuses: Not a car you want after it ages. Not a car you want out of warranty. Buy the newest one you can afford. Tend to rattle. BMW cheaped out on these cars. I've only driven up to 2014 or so, and therefore cannot comment on newer than that. AC mediocre due to large glass area, punishing hard ride, jittery handling on rough roads, extremely high repair and maintenance costs. In short, if you can't throw $150 a month at  a car to keep it running and safe, then don't buy an R53 or R52 Mini Cooper, or perhaps any Mini Cooper out of warranty. These cars are toys, not everyday drivers.",3

You absolutely cannot equip any other car in this class with features like the Mini.

I've continued to get close to it's EPA rating, especially if you keep the speed below 70 MPH. The car will drive fast, but the tach runs high and eats up gas.

I bought it used from the dealer when it was 6 years old, and it only had 48k miles.  Based on service records and appearance, it had been well cared for by the previous owner.  I bought a warranty at time of purchase because I read online reviews indicating that reliability was spotty.  Sure enough, after I owned the car about a year and maybe 8k miles later, it needed a new engine due to oil starvation (I later learned that the turbo models consume about a quart of oil every 1k miles).  The engine repair was $7.5k, and my warranty covered about $5k.  However, that was after I threatened to sue the dealer and the warranty company for NOT wanting to cover the repair.  The dealer and warranty company initially told me that the warranty was null and void because the car had been modified (lowered a bit and an air intake added).   I then reminded the dealer that the car was exactly as they sold it to me, and it that was going to be an issue, they should have told me before selling me a third party warranty.   About 18 months later, it started making a rattling sound, and I spent over $2k replacing the parts that house the timing belt.   About a month ago, I took it in for an oil change, and to have some warning lights diagnosed (air bag, check engine light). Long story short, they listed another $4.5k in needed repairs, including a new air bag!    By this time, I only had $66k miles on it because it was just a weekend fun car.  I paid for the oil change and told the dealer I was done.   I literally handed the keys back and told them to keep the car and that I'd drop off the title in a few days.   They weren't surprised because this model year is problematic, and they've heard stories similar to mine before.  They did manage to find a wholesaler to buy it from me for $600, and I gladly accepted it.   Had it run properly, it would have sold for closer to $5k, but I just didn't care anymore, and the thought of taking it home that day made me ill.  So I left it and never looked back.",2

A MINI Cooper Convertible 2007 standard version and  I was so excited when I first purchased this car. I felt like a celebrity because kids would run up to it and hug it.  I just loved the way the wind felt against my hair as I drove with the top down. We all know this car kills you with cuteness. Don't be blinded by its adorable exterior its a super sensitive money eating machine. The first year the dash board was lit up with issues. The first two years I drove a loaner and Mini Cooper employees knew my face very well and I should of moved right in. Anyway this car has steering wheel issues that will cost you thousands of dollars to fix it. An airbag recall that Mini will repair but leave you to any other airbag related issue ( dashboard lighting ) that's probably related to the stupid recall but they want you to pay for it. I had plugin problems with the cooling system what ever that means.. The car would be shut off and it would sound like its still on trying to cool off.One issues that drove me crazy was you cant bring this car to any mechanic because this is a foreign car they have no clue what to do with your car. I've had mechanics break parts on the car doing a simple oil change or changing the brake light( broke trunk light by leaning on it during a repair) so I was a slave to MINI cooper. I couldn't take it anywhere else which is super annoying. MINI isn't trustworthy either though. I went in and asked them to check my engine because the light was one. I specifically asked them to check my fluids. They didn't and later my car over heated and was smoking everywhere. They came and served it but I was a scared mess after the experience. They apologize but constantly repeat the same screw-ups due to lack of communication with the mechanics and service reps. Overall I wouldn't recommend this car to anyone and if you want to spend money on two cars to keep one cute one go ahead.. I drove around anxious all the time worrying about what light will come on next and how many thousands of dollars will cost me when the next light comes on. Not away to live,1

I am a bit of a stickler for traffic laws, but there's a large playground between zero and whatever. Even on highways with higher speed limits, the turbo-charged engine has sufficient zip to give the driver an adrenaline rush and cause a passenger to grab for the panic handle. Having said all of that, the potential cost to replace the  high pressure fuel pump (MINI has extended the warranty for this to 100,000 miles.) or the turbo charger gives me chills, but not the good kind.

Cost at an independent mechanic to fix? $650.Another common problem is dirty injectors at this point.Oh, and it needs a full synthetic oil....so, when you were hoping to get the $19.99 oil change at Car-X, it quickly triples that cost. :/And the brakes are about gone now, too, despite mostly highway driving.And the worst part?

I'm glad I got the manual it's a blast to drive even if it's a non turbo. I took a 700 mile trip north and avg 46 mpg on a flat expressway with keeping the speed of 65mph. If you go above that MPG will not be as great. 70 mph not bad and still received 42mpg. Keep your foot out of it and shift easy 32-35mpg in city shouldn't be a problem. I installed a K&N Typhoon kit and sounds great and improved MPG. I looked at many other cars in the same type of class. This one gave me the most personal room. It's bigger than you think on the inside. I can even fit my kids booster seats in. I have a 6 and 8 year old and they can ride in back no problem.,4.875

After driving the standard Cooper hardtop the difference was night and day... if you can't afford the S, don't drive one. I also have a Lotus Elise & have been driving both up the same canyon road to observe the differences. The Lotus corners quicker/flatter, but the Cooper launches you out of a corner with more low end (turbo) thrust. Its power is in the midrange and it flings you forward from around 3,000 RPM. What a blast. It leans a bit while cornering but stays neutral when you hit the gas so you don't need to enter a turn super fast to maintain speed. Great fun, great car. ",5

So expensive to own.  There is ALWAYS SOMETHING going wrong with this thing.  I can't wait to unload it and get something that doesn't cost me an extra $1,000/month in repair bills.10/18/2016 Update:  A Customer Service Tale: So I sent an email to miniusa and a few DAYS later, my wife gets a voicemail on her cell phone from someone named Andrew W. at MINIUSA.  She provides me the number: 866-275-6464.  I call it.  I work my way through their tortuous automated system, that has a hard time understanding what you are saying when it prompts you to say what you need from their list of the menu items.  I leave a message at Andrews extension, 7992.  He doesn't call back.  I call again today.  I get a kind woman who updates my phone information, then sends me along to Andrew W's extension 7992.  Andrew W's voicemail says he is not in (again) and says to leave a message, then tells you his voicemail is full.  But..., if you want to speak to a Customer Service Representative, you can dial ""0"".  So, I press 0 and it tells me that Customer Service is not available (It is 10:30 on a Tuesday morning) AND that their voice mail is full also.  So, I call back again and this time I ask directly for Customer Service Representative.  I tell her what just happened and she tells me that she sees on her screen that Andrew just wants to tell me that he can't do anything for me because I had repairs done at a non-mini dealership.  Why did I do that?  Because my 2011 mini at 34,000 miles is out of warranty anyway and the dealership wanted TWO TIMES the price that the aftermarket auto wanted to do the exact same thermostat repair.  The High Pressure Fuel Pump replacement that the dealership wanted $2,200.00 to replace, was also done at the aftermarket repair shop for $1,200.00.  I do not know who is in charge of MINIUSA, but my friend, if you are reading this..., you have some serious repairs to make of your own..., with your organization.  You may be experiencing records sales and having the best year ever.  I do not know.  But when customer service has no semblance of service to it whatsoever, and even your automated system to handle consumer problems is so ineffective that there is no operator available and everyone's voicemail is ""full"", it will all catch up with MINIUSA sooner or later.  It may take a few years but this kind of terrible reliability problems, terrible customer service problems, outrageous repair costs, and complete lack of attention to detail and even to the customer will catch up with you eventually.  And what about BMW?  I am sure they would be embarrassed and humiliated to read how their American operations are being handled.  So, hello BMW.  Why don't you have some of your Executive officers, board members, and senior staff pretend to have a customer situation and try calling through the automated system under a pseudo name and suffer through the same experience your customers experience every single day.  I am so disappointed.  I loved driving my Mini Cooper S Convertible for some time.  But these recent experiences have completely soured me on the whole Mini experience.  I have had nearly a dozen people ask me how I like my Mini over the past 3 months, and I tell them all the same thing: ""A blast to drive when it is working... a nightmare to have repaired... a money pit... zero customer service... and do yourself a favor and never ever buy one.10/19/17 update.After all of this, and the suggestion that some well-heeled law firm ought to file a class action law suit on behalf of Mini Copper owners for the absolute scalding we take on prices for repairs/parts of known and frequent defects in the Mini, they send me a letter telling me to send in the repair bills and they will consider some form of re-imbursement for some of the repairs.  I do as requested by going to my aftermarket repair shop and getting every single electronic file they have on the repairs, why they were required, and how much parts and labor cost.  Fortunately, European Auto Garage in Knoxville, besides always doing excellent repairs with no drama, also keeps meticulous records electronically.  I explain to the front desk what I need and why I need it and she happily gathers all the files, diagnostic machine reports and much more, all of which their records system keeps track of.  Excellent!  She sends the information for me directly to Mini at the designated Mini USA email.  I few weeks later, I get a check from Mini for the repair reimbursement sans routine maintenance.  Fair enough.  I really didn't think they would do anything about it but they covered the whole cost of the repairs to the defective parts.",1

I did not purchase an extended warrant so this was an out of pocket expense. I was told by the mechanic that everything should be good for awhile.

Before this event it used at least a quart of oil between oil changes, and a good bit more if you took an interstate trip;  and the timing chain noise had been increasing (not yet to the 'death rattle' level).  We babied this car, drove it mildly, and changed the oil early ($90 at dealer).  I'm looking at selling the car for parts (we paid $17,000 used when we bought it) for probably no more than $3000 with bad engine, or a complete engine rebuilt (head gasket, timing chain, and god know what else by a local euro car shop) for about $4500 for a car that now is selling for about $8000 used, in good condition!

The shortest I ever had a vehicle. I bought it used with under 10K miles. Initally I wanted a fuel efficient small fun car. Albeit small this car really had nothing else going for it. The fun factor wore off already on the second month of ownership when the clutch needed replacement. Since I bought the vehicle from a mini dealer they helped a bit with the cost. I paid 1200 vs the 4000 they initially wanted to charge. After some research I realized it takes 20 hrs of labor to do the job. Everything in this car is so compact that you nearly have to take out the engine for major repairs. I replaced the battery myself and ended up removing  windshield trim pieces to access the battery compartmemt. Sorry not very well engineered. The service departmemt told me that the clut h on Minis can easily burn out every 10K to 20K miles. Another weird Mini fault is that for some reason the engines burn oil. Mini service actually recommends that you check the oil monthly or every 1K miles and refill. In terms of ride quality, this car is terrible. I actually started to develop bak pain from the poor seats and stiff suspension combo. The entire quality is cheap for a car in this price range. Performance was fun at first, but I soon realized that there are plenty of other options out there. This car handles like a go cart so you get the illusion of speed. Fun on twisty roads but when you feel every little bump in your lower bak the fun wears out quick. I chose to purchase this car because Mini always intrigued me, now I learned my lesson and will never go back.

He said if we can wait for a few hours they can fix it. We were so stupid and believed his words, and took the car since we run out of the time stay over there.  Now it turns out a very serious problem, after I send the car back for them to fix. They cannot fix the USB port in a few hours but request a few days.",3.5

They did their exploratory diagnosis and informed me that it needed spark plugs- even though the manual says plugs are good for 100,000. After $580.00 the plugs were changed and the light stayed off for 50 klms. Must need injectors was the next diagnosis for $1200.00. the light stayed off for 1 week even though the mini ran like crap in that week. Traded the mini off at a dealer as I could not sell privately.

493, on 08/18/16 12:49 PM (PDT),fchadly ,2016 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.5L 3cyl Turbo 6M),Watch out for MINI customer service," Update 19FEB18I wound up selling the car as it just was not to my practical use of going back and forth to work anymore.  Our family only needs one good vehicle with one payment which our Ram 1500 crew cab serves us very well.  There was no maintenance issues or anything when I got rid of it, but for what I was paying monthly it was just not worth keeping anymore when I can get by with a $2000 car.The car runs drives great and is surprisingly smooth going down the highway at 80mph for a short wheelbase auto.  My problem with MINI is their customer service after the sale.  So my wife and I get 60mi outside the Dallas dealership and decide to set up the Sat radio that supposedly came with the car.  After fumbling with the radio trying to find the ""Sat"" setting, I called my sales person back to ask where the setting was, he said he needed to call me back.  A few minutes later we were informed our car is ""Sat Prep"" which means me as the owner has to take the car in at MY expense, buy a $150 Sat code followed by $700 to install software in my factory NAV headset.  This was not explained to us prior to leaving the dealership.  When we called the sales manager back to get this worked out, it was an instant ""there is nothing we can do, we should have worked it into the original deal"".  So at that point when it came to the survey about the dealership, I wrote what happened and in a couple of days got a call from a Dewey Gatts customer relations supervisor on my voicemail to call him back.  And so I did not once, but three times over the course of three days with no phone call back.  Got a hold of another customer service rep who we again laid out our issue too and she sounded promising of helping out.  She said if you have not heard anything in 24-48hrs call back.  Again I called Dewey Gatts POC, and again straight to voicemail, so I called again, got another rep ""Tara"" who was quick to just say what Sat Prep means and that their is nothing they could do.  I posted on MINI USA the following:   ""so there In addition to our previous post about some misleading advertisement about Sat Radio on our new car, we have been back and forth with MINI customer relations since we have not been able to get a call back from our case manager Dewey Gatts.  We have waited the 48hrs to hear back on our case since Dewey Gatts will not call us despite the 3 different times I left my number on his voicemail to call.  When we asked the customer relations rep named Tara who the relations supervisor was so we could get some resolve on our case (at this point she started telling us there is nothing they could do), she could not tell us who it was, Tara kept telling us the next level are all supervisors.  What?? All departments regardless of business type have ONE person/manager who is in charge and then that Manager has someone s/he has to answer to as well.  You mean to tell me you cannot tell me who your own boss is?  or who your boss' boss is?  MINI you have something seriously wrong in with your customer service reps if they cannot tell me who their direct line of supervisors are much less can provide a phone contact.  MINI has put a huge damper on my ""Motoring"" experience.  This type of customer service shows what MINI USA's true colors are in order to resolve an issue.  If anyone is thinking of buying a MINI, you better have your homework down on what you want because MINI will use any misinterpretations to their advantage and continue to blow you off until you give up.  The absolute worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I so should have bought a Fiat 500 or Chevy Spark that I was looking at in conjunction to this car. I know Ford, Dodge, and Chevy customer relations at least make an effort to right a wrong.  MINI you have just lost a customer, we were planning to trade our Ram 1500 in next year for a Countryman but that will absolutely not happen at this point, I will stick with American or Japanese for next purchase"".",3

497, on 03/11/16 22:41 PM (PST),David ,2016 MINI Cooper Hatchback 4dr Hatchback (1.5L 3cyl Turbo 6M),Cute quirky w some less than ideal attributes," I have my own opinions that sometimes run counter to the popular view. Case in point are some aspects of the 2016 Mini Cooper hard top. We recently bought mostly for its quirky charm unfortunately not because of its handling. We ordered a base cooper with the 15"" wheels but with the default performance tires. The handling isn't as good as I hoped. It has personality like the rest of the car although I'd hoped for it to just work. Steering is responsive, however the car fishtails in quick maneuvers. It fact it's one of the worst I've driven testing by swishing the steering wheel side to side. The rear reacts violently after a long delay like the back is whipping around later. Can be scary on the expressway. We tried 16"" wheels and they're a little better but not great. Many other cars this size do better on this test. The other thing I don't like is the Harmon Kardon upgraded stereo. It has way too much bass. If that all you want to hear, maybe it's fine but I rank it as practically unlistenable even with the bass turned way down. The Fender upgraded stereo in VWs are awesome. Awesome bass yet clarity. We didn't order the upgraded stereo. The base stereo is fine and sounds clearer. The little 1.5 liter 3 cylinder engine is great. Has lots of low end torque, is happy to rev, and is surprisingly quiet. Manual transmission is very good. Nice fairly short throw. Rev matching on downshifts, hill hold. I test drove automatics. It works well in most cases but I got it confused when I jumped out in traffic and it took an eternity (maybe a second or two) to decide what gear to go into, all while cars were bearing down on me. Interior is small but can be comfortable is people aren't too big. Sunroof is amazing. Feels like your in a convertible. Overall ride is very solid. Stiff body, normally few rattles, good at absorbing bumps. Storage space is definitely lacking. Mini went cheap for 2016 and removed the secret compartment on the dashboard reducing storage space that's practically non existent. Who's idea was it to make a four door car and only have one cupboard in the rear seat?Overall a fun cute car but with sometimes poor handling with the base wheels.Update 9/2017The cuteness has worn off. Acceleration, although still good, has lots of hesitation especially in 2nd gear. The car is especially sensitive to bad gas. I have to run the best premium or it drives like a bucking bronco. It is not fun. Even with good premium is still hesitates. It is not possible to smoothly shift this car. The computer is in too much control of the engine RPMs. Rev matching is ok when downshifting, but when upshifting, the engine is VERY slow to rev down. The end result is that the engine is ALWAYS going too fast for the next gear up. Giving it any gas makes it worse. Its simply very hard if not impossible to get a smooth shift especially around 2nd gear. Again the computer software is to blame. They dynamically change the throttle map on each gear. 1st gear is pretty mild. You can give it lots of gas and not go anywhere, but 2nd goes the other way and is very aggressive. Very sensitive to throttle position. 3rd and up and more forgiving.The base radio still sounds awful. Even with the bass turned all the way down there can still be too much booming bass, but its just at one frequency. Frequencies below or above are cut out so you don't hear them at all.The control software of the car drives me crazy. Like its possessed. All sorts of random behavior. My favorite is me having the AC turned off, the button clearly shows the AC is turned off, yet the AC is running and on blowing ice cold air even if I don't want it on. A few minutes later the gremlin lets go and it will silently shut off. This happens at random inconsistent times. I have not been able to find a pattern.I randomly get door unlocks, warnings messages on the screen about start/stop being disabled, persistent chime about passenger not wearing seat belt... when there is no passenger! Which reminds me, start/stop didn't work for me once, just once, leaving me slowly rolling through a downtown busy intersection. Eventually flipped enough buttons it started up again. Thought it was broken, but eventually tried it again and it hasn't recurred. Overall the car is doing ok I guess. But whenever I drive it I'm greatly bothered by the hesitation and rough shifting. Bad stereo doesn't help. In retrospect, I wish I would have bought something less annoying.",2

It accelerates very well and hugs the road better than any other car I've driven. Plus the exhaust from the factory sounds pretty good. I loved the thing very much. Unfortunately those are it's only strong suits. I don't drive it too hard  and if I'm lucky I'll get 28 mpg highway. Combined it gets 25 which is very  disappointing from a small 1.6L engine. For reference I had a 2004 Impala get  better highway mileage and get 25 combined with a 3.8L v6. However very poor reliability is the downfall. In the short time I've owned it I've had coils go out, a water pump failed, and now have a bad lifter. Not only is it unreliable but parts are hard to find and very expensive.

Fortunately, all were covered by the extended Warranty, except the $150 deductible we had to pay out each time. Most recently, 12/23/16, check engine light on again. Stalling out problems & loss of heat from the heater. This time we took it to a Mini dealer in Towson, Md. They were open Xmas eve!! so we dropped it off & got a loaner vehicle.

I have always loved the look and idea of a MINI and I am a small car person.  I bought this mini used 6 years ago with the basic mini with minimum features because it was what I could afford at the time.  It was a stickshift.  I loved driving it, it made driving fun again because I hate to drive at all.  Then I became a mom and decided that I didnt want to buy a new car yet because I didnt want another car payment ( I dont like to drown in car debt).  It was difficult to get my daughter in and out with the car seat but once she was old enough to climb in and was forward facing, it was fine.  Overall very minimal cost as far as repairs, minor maintenance.  The only thing that went wrong was my radiator got a crack because I drove it too rough in the snow and jumped a curb.  I was going to keep it until it died but 2 weeks ago, it drowned.  My car got stuck in a flood and was totaled due to hurricaine Matthew.  Best part is, I got double the amount back for the car from insurance! It was paid off and still held a great value!  Needless to say, Im buying another MINI!

If you're set on a Mini like I was, only buy or lease a new one because when they are close to 100,000 miles they need lots of very expensive work.Minis are super compact which means when a mechanic needs to get to say, the water pump, he has to take out other parts which results in much higher labor costs. Plus, the parts are expensive.Bought it for $7500, put a couple thousand dollars into replacing the water pump, water pipe, radiator, thermostat, AC, brake rotors, and battery...and two years later could only get $1800 after the transmission went out. I had it inspected prior to purchase and pretty much everything checked out, other than the mechanic saying I'd need new brake rotors.Don't make the same mistake.

Maintenance cost are through the roof, parts and labor extremely expensive.  BMW sold the car with a long term KNOWN engineering defect (poor timing chain design) that has motors blowing up all over the world (ck the internet) at between 55k & 65k miles.  While maintained to absolute factory standards, mine blew up at less than 30 mph with 60k.  After fighting with the company for over 9 months (while I made car & insurance payments and had to acquire an additional vehicle) they only agreed to pay for the $11,000.00+ repairs after I recorded a series of conversations which proved I'd repeatedly been lied to and my attorney told them ""fix it today or we file tomorrow!""  The local dealership was super but BMW calls the shots.  Although they finally did agree that it was a design issue in the end they refused to reimburse me for the towing and miscellaneous out of pocket cost which had been promised to me in every single conversation.  BMW Corporation, in my humble opinion, is run by a bunch of crooks who sell cars with known defects and should be jailed.  I will NEVER purchase nor recommend any BMW product.  Also ask about the engine having to be completely torn down and shot sprayed with crushed walnut shells as part of regular maintenance cleaning because it is so poorly designed.

Premium quality gasoline does not mean top tier...there's a mixture in other stations that may destroy your engine. Neither the Mini Cooper website  nor the Consumer's Report website made any mention  at all about this extremely important concern.

I learned to drive on a Buick Park Avenue, so the Mini was a dream. With the back seats down, I can fit my 152cm snowboard. Good cargo space. I autocross with my mini, and it's beyond words. Acceleration is good. The auto-manual is a great option!  Also, the winter package, Harmon/Kardon sound system, and sunroof are definitely worth the extra money!

But there is so little body lean, it corners perfectly, why get an S model if this is enough? The rear seat is surprisingly roomy for a car this small. Most controls are simple to use. The outside is just adorable. The white goes perfectly with the black roof. Driving lamps help at night.

I would suggest the S model for those who drive on the highway. Getting on and off highway ramps gets a bit tricky. As for the interior room, I've taken 3 coworkers of average size to lunch and they seemed comfortable on the short ride.   I enjoy this car because I'm a 5'3 inch female and it fits me.

Its gas mileage - in the highway you can get it up to 30+ miles to the gallon, however, in the city it struggles to keep past 24 mpg -  not bad comparing against the big machines.

I would never buy a used Mini again, because all of the problems came out of nowhere, and my Local Mini Dealership did not have any clue how to fix most of the problems.

Later, there was a recall on said motor mounts); Panel lights that would turn themselves off; Speedo and tach would randomly impersonate windshield wipers; Exterior trunk latch stopped working; fuel pump failure; Steering cooling fan failure; Steering rack needed replacement; Whining transmission.

The first thing people notice is how roomy the interior is for a car that is so small. I love the size, it is just right for me. The Mini S gives you the best of both worlds; it's speedy as heck and rides like a European sportscar but doesn't waste too much fuel. I get an average of 35mpg, but you get a lot less if you drive fast. Main things I like are the interior set-up; the dash is beautifully shaped and covered with nice material that's easy to keep clean. I like how the switches & controls are centralized around the console and steering wheel. The interior is not small compared with the outside, and it gives you that feeling of being safe that only a European car gives. When you drive the Mini, you won't feel like you're in a claustrophobic box but rather a pretty comfy sportscar! I've used it to commute 35 miles each way Monday thru Friday for the past 3 months with no complaints or problems. I found mine at a repo-auction where I got a great price on it, although it had 103K miles, it was a clean Florida car with no issues and a pretty reasonable price for me. I will be investing in a different set of wheels and tires for the winter though, as the 17-inch custom wheels & tires don't like snow at all and I can't drive in the heavy snow.

Great on gas, fast, and is very easy to get around in. It is a tight ride in the seats, so it's not the funnest to drive for long periods of time. NOW! The downfall.  Mini cooper has had problems with the junk transmissions they put into the coopers. Despite being built by BMW, it is not a BMW tranny in the car.  My car has 67000 mile on it and the transmission is acting up in it, the cost to fix it? Try $6000, since mini does not sell parts to fix the bad trannies.

It needed a switch, but then also needed an engine harness and starter.  This work had to be done at a dealership and took one week to complete. I was fortunate that they had a loaner available.

A little later I took it in for a tune-up. The dealer noticed that a seal was leaking and with the tune-up I was out another $1,300. As I was leaving they mentioned that some item in the suspension would need to be replaced soon to the tune of another $1,000.  About two months after that I lost the power steering.

Maybe you buy into Mini's whole ""lifestyle"" and marketing gimmicks. I think you either love this car or hate it. My wife loves it, I hate it.  Its her daily driver, so there you go.  Its a small car. I knew that. Realize you are basically buying a 2 seat micro-car.  I'm 5-8 and skinny and think this car feels cramped, and i grew up driving all models of small air cooled VW's.  You might as well fold the back seats down and use it as trunk space.  My 8 & 10 year olds have no leg room and barely get space to plant their feet when 5'-4"" mom is driving.  Don't tell me adults can fit back there! I *Hate* the Mini-Connected system with it's joystick and horrible look/software. Confusing, not user friendly. In the world of touch screen everywhere, this lack of, is archaic. The seatbelts get caught between the seats and door post. You have to open the door to get your buckle. The seats are hard to adjust to get right and comfortable. Too many confusing dash switches. Hard to get to the back seat. Ugh, glad I leased not bought!!!  If you like the old school, kind of meets the future, this is your car. Mini holds onto stuff like retro toggle switches, the big bezel dial like speedometer, but then puts a tiny digital box on top of the steering column with a digital speedo, outside weather temp, etc, but it takes like 5 different presses of a button to get to different parts of the display and the screen is too small to be useful. Spring for the black wheels. The stock silver are always dirty and a pain to get and keep clean. I gave up.***Update*** 2016: After 3 years, glad I am turning the car back in at the end of the lease. If you really want a mini, test drive an ""S"" and the standard engine. I think the standard is underpowered. The freeway noise (lack of noise insulation throughout the car) and the god awful mini connected interface are the worst things about this car. Don't fall for the sales pitch to buy the extended tire care warranty. The run-flat tires are expensive to replace, but not as fragile as the dealer makes them out to be.

The warranty seemed perfectly acceptable and we were very happy with the purchase. We put about 25,000 miles on this car in one year and we only brought it in for oil changes and recall repairs. So far, so good. The car handles well, gets good MPG, and does what we expect it to do. Then, the car broke down while my wife was driving through town, on her way home from work.The dealer took about one week to diagnose the problem, claiming the service department was short-handed. The following week, I was told that the turbo charger would need to be replaced, and when I checked in two days later, the engine also needed to be replaced. I have owned several new cars, and I have never had a problem with the engine in the first year of driving. In fact, I have never had engine problems within the first 100,000 miles of any engine. Naturally, I was concerned. I asked about replacement parts, and of course, the exact same OEM parts that had failed already were being installed. I tell them that's fine, but I would like to have an extended warranty so that these new parts, including the engine, would be covered for longer in case the same problem repeats. This was also denied. I have spoken to MINI USA several times, and there is nothing they will do that is not already covered. Please understand, the car is well within warranty and I have incurred no additional cost. Not yet, anyway. However, the car has been in the shop for three weeks now, and counting.

And it has a distinct, cute style. So I can forgive many other things that aren't perfect, such as a tight fit getting in and out of the car.  You learn ""how"" to get in and out of the car, so it works.  My husband is 6'2"" and weighs 270lb.  He has learned how to get in and says it is comfortable for him to drive and be a front passenger, but he can't sit in the back seat.  My adult child is not small and she can sit in the back seat comfortably.  The back cargo area has enough space for me to get a weeks worth of groceries in to. If we have other larger things we need to haul, we can put the seats down and it usually works.  It's not an SUV, so doesn't have the room that an SUV has.  We have to have bigger items delivered. My other choice of car was a Subaru Forester XT touring, but it was too expensive to get what I wanted and the navigation and bluetooth on it weren't nearly as good as my mini.   The dealership I bought my mini at only sold their cars with summer tires.  I would have liked all season tires which would be better in the snow.  I love the navigation system, I will upgrade it every other year or so.  I like the bluetooth, the streaming music, the folding mirrors, the acceleration, the handling, The bottom line...When you step on the gas, it goes...fast. And,....I get better gas mileage than was stated on the window sticker.  Update: Dec 2016. We drove to ID. So glad we decided to get snow tires. The handling isn't sporty. But we can drive in snow. We would not have been able to get around without them, even with all season tires. We will have them stored for when we make winter trips.

Other than that the car drives great.  Amazing amount of power in this little guy.  Seats are extremely comfortable.  I love the heated seats during the cold winter days.  Like the added side visor on the driver's side of the car...perfect to keep that sun out of your eyes.  Sound system of Harman Kardon is great! More room than you think in the 4 door once seats are down.  Nice area to hide valuables in the back storage area as well.  Wish the keyless entry was just a simple touch with a finger instead of a push...but not I'm getting picky.  Also wish the fob created a sound from the car when you pressed it...that always helped me find my car.  Not as stiff a ride as I though it would be...big improvements from previous models.  Also, it's getting just ok gas mileage...I was spoiled by a Prius C before though.  This one eats Premium. But all in all, I think it's a very attractive vehicle and once I get this nagging navigation situation resolved will like it even better!  PS Did not like the ""S"" seats...I found them not so great for short people...However, I have heard that taller people really like them.  Glad I had a choice.",4

I bought the 2015 MINI S 4 door with 17in wheels and it is AWESOME. I really enjoy this car, its gets be from point A to point B in a fun, quick and safe. When looking for my first car, I wanted something that was safe, reliable, great on gas, great resale value(even now I wonder why I would ever sale this car). The first time I test drove this car I was hooked, because it is so much fun to drive, I look for curves in the road and hills and valleys, its just fun and even though it is a MINI it has more space then you would think and more room then one would expect. One of my favorite things is that MINI gave creative thought to the small things like where the gas tank is located, the way your MINI will wink at you when you get in, the heartbeat of the car, mood lighting etc. Even though it has all these fun things the car is crazy safe, like the gas tank cut off if you are in an accident to keep from fire, the 8 air bags and so many other things. I would highly recommend this car to anyone because it's more than just cute and fun but safe and reliable.",5

814, on 11/19/15 12:10 PM (PST),Eliot ,2015 MINI Cooper Hatchback 2dr Hatchback (1.5L 3cyl Turbo 6M),Not If You Owned & Liked Previous BMW MINI's," The point of view of this review is from a long time BMW MINI owner who, up until now, loved them.  It probably isn't relevant to those who haven't previously had a MINI.  Back in the '60, Ford had a great, innovative car that was very popular.  Each new version of it became bigger and bigger and sought to reach a wider market.  Eventually, it became a parody of itself, becoming virtually a 2 door family sedan.  Fortunately, Ford saw the light and the car has returned (sort of) to its roots. I am referring to the Mustang.  Well, it seems BMW is following that same sorry route with the MINI.  What was the attraction of the BWM MINI?  It's SMALL size, its uniqueness, its fun to drive-ness. As one local reviewer (in Maryland) wrote, driving a MINI was therapy.  So, what has happened.  To address the ""negatives"" appearing in professional reviews, which value every car against some homogeneous (with the exception, perhaps, of exotics and rockets), BMW is turning the MINI into just another compact car.  They have tried to make up for this by adding high-tech gimmickry, like color-changing LEDs and artificial sound effects, which serve only to make a cartoon out of the car.  The car has gotten huge compared to the previous MINIs. If you are buying this car for rear seat room and a living room on wheels ride, you are in the wrong place.  The 2015/2016 MINI hardtops are almost indistinguishable from the Countryman, both viewed from the outside and when sitting inside. This isn't because the Countryman is tiny.  On the technical side, one could say everything is ""improved"" except for the 3 cylinder engine in the base model. While it is surprisingly peppy, it is noisy and rough-idling.  Yes, there are now many MINIs on the road. So, from BMW's perspective, they are on the right path. But, if you are a Miniac for the initial BMW MINI offerings, you will most likely not be happy driving this one.  Let's hope BMW, like Ford, will come to its senses.  Eventually, Mr./Ms. average driver will tire of the cramped size, the ""hard"" ride and the ""weird"" stuff that might still remain and those who remember what a MINI was will return.  In the meantime, I'll probably be in a Miata or a GTI.",4

Build quality and design make it a great deal to own.It came with 16 inches runflat tires so the ride is on the firm side but more compliant than the previous model I had. I must admit that on deteriorated pavements at low speed it is not where it shines, otherwise the drive is rewarding.The options include most packages except HK radio, connectivity and gps, the leather seats are really nice and comfortable.I used to drive in a more spirited way, the green setting made me zen to some point so I get an average of 35 mpg in mix driving so far.After one year and 10000 miles, I got a real average of 33.6 mpg on a mostly city driving which is impressive, the computer indicates around 35.The sports seats with leather option are comfortable but non tilt adjustable which is a major issue, since leather and sport seats are a 2000$ option.Technology is very basic, there is no back up camera etc, I would have expected more on a car with that price tag.Keep on driving, at the wheel you are in another world.",5

819, on 12/19/15 09:45 AM (PST),Dr. Henry Mullaney ,2015 MINI Cooper John Cooper Works John Cooper Works 2dr Hatchback (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),BMW doesn't honor its warranty," Mini Cooper provides a 3 year warranty on the car, but BMW refuses to honor it.  BMW makes the engine, clutch, and transmission for Mini Cooper.  To simplify logistics, they use the same clutch on all their Mini drive chains.  As an engineer, I know that the first rule for choosing a clutch for a car is that it should be able to handle the torque produced by the engine.  The Mini clutch was designed for the standard 140 HP Mini engine.  The JCW comes with 208 HP.  To make matters worse, the Mini clutch is backwards from standard clutches.  During shifting, the clutch disengages the transmission and not the engine.  That means that the thrust bearing continues to rotate while handling a lot of load.  The standard half inch steel bearing cannot hold up to the 208 HP engine.  There is an easy fix to this problem which engineers know about.  You replace the half inch steel bearing with a three quarter inch ceramic bearing made to handle the horsepower.  To save less that $10 per car, BMW decided not to do this.  Therefore their clutches wear out.  The last time my clutch failed, about 2 years after purchase with a three year warranty, BMW refused to pay for my warranty repair, and I am out about $2000.  I asked my dealer to use a heavy duty clutch which I would buy during this last repair.  But their contract with Mini Cooper doesn't allow them to use any parts but BMW parts.  BMW tells me that I do not know how to drive a clutched car.  I have driven Saabs with standard transmissions and clutches for over 20 years and have never had a clutch failure.  I currently drive a 1999 Saab 9-3 convertible with 150,000 miles on it, with the original clutch still working fine.",4

I have had a alpha romeo spider veloce, honda crv and one other car for over 10 years each with over 150,000 miles on them.  This car is cheaply and poorly made and was more expensive than both of them.  In the first year that I owned it all of the electrical wiring went and I had to have it towed in, less than 7,000 miles.  Covered by the warranty $8,000 plus.  The following winter the water pump went and I had to have it towed in yet again.  In year 3 the drivers seat started to frwy whith less than 20,000 miles.  Last year the brakes were falling apart and they had to be changed when the car only had about 24,000 miles on it.  I am at the dealer yet again 6 months later and although I purchased an extended warranty most of it isn't covered.  $600 plus to have the hood fixed because it won't open because the original cheap parts have rusted in 4 years.  Another $400 plus for new spark plugs and something else because the engine is malfunctioning with only 31,000 miles in the car.  Another oil change because all the oil leaked and I couldn't get to it since the cable broke to open the hood.  Inferior parts and quality.  Run from this vehicle and buy a Honda, Toyota or Subaru.  I can not recommend this car to anyone and will never buy another.  But at least it's paid for!",1

822, on 10/07/15 17:19 PM (PDT),Dr. Henry Mullaney ,2015 MINI Cooper Convertible 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl 6M),BMW does not honor warranty on clutch," The clutch is backwards from most cars.  When you step on the clutch of most cars, the clutch separates from the engine.  In a Mini, it remains attached to the engine, and the thrust bearing rotates with the engine with a lot of force on this half inch steel bearing.  The flywheel is a dual mass, suitable for today's drivers who do not know how to let out a clutch.  Finally, clutches are supposed to match the horsepower of the engine.  The clutch is sized for the standard 124 HP engine.  The JCW has the same engine, but with tuning and turbo puts out 208 HP.  The clutch in my Mini has now been replaced 4 times in 36000 miles of driving.  BMW which owns Mini runs it's warranty program.  95% of their calls involve BMWs.  BMW uses a traditional clutch and its clutches are matched to the engine.  So they do not understand the problems faced by Mini JCW owners.  I have a 4 year 50,000 warranty on my car, purchased in June 2012.  Yet BMW refuses to pay the $1700 bill to replace my clutch.  Heavy duty clutches are available for the Mini because the clutch fails so often.  They cost $1300.  They have a ceramic bearing that won't burn out.  Mini dealers have special equipment to replace clutches because they break so often.  It costs about $5000.  So chances are that your mechanic does not have this equipment.  My Mini dealer refuses to even touch a heavy duty clutch since their agreement with Mini USA requires them to only use Mini parts, which are unreliable.If you buy a Mini JCW, you can expect the clutch to fail about once a year.  It takes 3 days to get a clutch installed.",3

I've got some 6,000 miles on it now.  Combined mileage is 34 mpg.  Freeway driving is a breeze, as long as you, the driver, realized your MINI Cooper (non-turbo) is no race or fast car.  It's a very simple 1600 cc's of raw BMW power.  They should use that line in their advertisements.  The car and its payment went to my ex-husband when I left him.  He wanted it.  He loves it.  At 74"" he is very comfortable in the car with top up or down.  So, the rest of this review is his.   Toby, that is her name, performs exactly the way I had hoped she would perform.  Whether in the city (stop or go traffic) or on the highway, she does an excellent job.  I do not drive her fast.  She simply isn't fast.  I didn't want ""fast"" so, she is perfect.  For me.  At my age.  I got this car because it was a convertible, leather interior, a wonderful color combination for the exterior with a very comfortable ride and superior sound system.  Toby is a Highgate package with the Harmon-Kardon sound system (a 'must-have' in my mind).  I truly cannot think of anything else to say about the car, as it is just a superb automobile in spite of its price tag.  I got what I wanted: A well thought-out, high mileage, comfortable drop-top.

The electronic parking brake fails.  Mini does not take responsibility for this extremely dangerous glitch and says that according to the manual I need to use chock blocks to ""safely"" park my vehicle. This petroleum jelly substance oozes out from under the hood and stains all that it touches.  Mini will not fix this (they say it is common in Minis and BMWs) and says it will happen for 20,000 miles (this is a BRAND NEW CAR).  The car will lock the keys in the car.  I have had friends witness this flabbergasted that the car decided to lock itself in front of us.   The Bluetooth will play music over phone calls.  There is no where to turn the music off since it was never on in the first place.  The only way to remedy the situation is for me to hang up and call the person back.  In general the electronic interface is very glitch and delayed.  I am 5'2"" tall.  The car does not fit me.  The visors are too short, the center controls are too far back.

I knew when I ordered a Mini, it would likely have problems based on Mini's track record.  The sales experience was dysmal; the dealer is 171 miles from my front door.  I asked the salesman to pick us up at the airport nearest the dealer, 20 minutes away.  He refused.  We got lost on the city trolley system and asked the dealer receptionist to have someone pick us up, which they finally did.  The salesman had all the paperwork wrong (after I'd given specific email information), and, after the third try and 1.5 hours we were on our way.  At the first rest stop, my wife opened the passenger door and a trim piece fell in her lap.  The second day, the infotainment system had long delays, there was static in the speakers and the navi froze.  Later, the heads-up display developed a loud clicking noise while retracting, and the rear hatch would come open by itself when nobody was around the car.  Mini USA was more than accommodating by providing a flatbed four two 342-mile round trips from my home to the dealer, one to diagnose the infotainment problem, and a second to make the repairs (after waiting nine weeks to get a new head unit).  The service writer at the dealership who handled everything over this two-month period was also exceptional.  I wanted a Mini Countryman really, really badly, so I have never waivered from loving the car right from the start.  After owning over 35 new cars and reading every review known to man, I knew I wanted and loved the new Countryman.  The car is economical, power is adequate, the paddle shifters are very intuitive to use, and the outstanding 8-speed auto is always in the gear you want.  The steering is exceptional, the brakes very solid, and the sport seats are very comfortable.  The standard sunroof in this car has less draft and minimal buffeting....better tan I've experienced in Mercs and BMW's.  The suspension is very well sorted out, providing an outstanding ride/handling compromise. Overall MP g is 31 in mixed driving and 34 highway on  mid-grade fuel. In spite of my horrific sales experience and all the electronic issues, I still highly recommend this delightful and wonderful car which is now 100% operational with 5,400 miles",5

Mini has done an incredible job at making the cabin feel spacious and functional despite it being much smaller than what I was accustomed. If you are at all familiar with BMW products (X1 in particular) you will notice some striking similarities from the cabin materials to infotainment. Performance is good and it is a blast to drive - however, you can expect ride quality to match the sporty driving characteristics. The cabin certainly gets a shock over potholes - the dynamic damper control is a must if you want an improved ride. I was skeptical of Mini's reliability (which influenced my decision to lease); if you do your research you will see that the new engine and chassis are straight off the BMW X1 and have displayed exceptional reliability so far. Overall, I am highly impressed with new Countryman, a car that was certainly NOT on my radar when I started shopping. If you are looking for a car that is engaging to drive while offering compact SUV capacity and capabilities this is a safe bet.",5

Drive is quiet, trans is smooth, acceleration is excellent.  Love the Mini interior - has much more style than other comps.  Materials are great.  No rattles or squeaks so far.  Roof rails/fold down seats come in handy.  Plug in with 120v is fine for overnight.  Havent needed 240v.  Electric range is adequate, but would be nice to have 20-25 mile range.  Beyond that on a hybrid seems like a waste of money/weight/resources (should be big enough for a round trip commute, road trips will use gas regardless).  Only minor complaint: brakes are a little touchy at slow speed stops - could use a little more give - but can get used to it by feathering the pedal.  Overall - 4.5 Star!  Love this car...",5

The Laguna Green color I have was not in production for long so having a rare color is kind of fun. The MINI Connected system works pretty well even without an iPhone you get a fair amount of functionality and the center screen is very nice. The Bluetooth audio streaming works well with my the phones I've tried it with. The USB input also works well if you put mp3s onto a memory stick. My car has the HK sound system which sounds very good.What I've loved best about this car is parking it in the city. I've squeezed it into some really tiny spots on the street. The handling is great as well and the steering feel is strong. Even the base Cooper Coupe has plenty of power for a normal driver. I've never had any issue with respect to accelerating when necessary. The boot is fairly large for a MINI and there are some interesting little storage areas as well.  The ride can be a little harsh on rough roads given the small wheelbase, but on good roads the ride quality is quite nice. The sport seats are very comfortable and supportive.",4

You can enjoy it in the city, on the open road and on the track. The car is small, quick and most importantly to me, unique. I get people talking to me all the time about it. They think it is a hard top convertible. The good points first: It is uniquely styled, quick at 208hp and fun to drive anywhere. The space is absolutely brilliant. The Coupe is the same body as the 4-seat standard Mini but the back seats are gone and the roof is chopped. What you get is a trunk as big as a small SUV. I know, I have two SUV's. This is great for extended road trips and there is a hatch you can  reach through to the trunk. I have put a cooler there at times, lol. On the track the car is amazing, especially for FWD and short wheelbase. It can get jumpy on hard breaking into a turn but you can roar out. Just keep it straight and steady. On autocross it totally sucks. There is too much pedal lag and I have the automatic. Autocross is hard off and on acceleration and breaking. You need the stick and will probably be all right. Also, the suspension is firm. Because I know Mini's I got standard suspension. You don't need sport. I do track with standard and it's fine. Sport will break your teeth. The minuses are the automatic pedal lag and very limited vision. I expect that in a chop top coupe but you may not. Small convertibles and hard tops like this always have limited vision. It is big fun in a small car. I believe this car will be one of the most collectible Mini's as they ran it only three years in the hard top. I also put winter tires on it (Pirelli Sotozeroes) and it does great in the snow. Perhaps the most cheerful fun car I've owned and I have had a bunch.",5
835, on 10/30/15 18:02 PM (PDT),Ralph Ciccarelli ,2014 MINI Cooper Coupe John Cooper Works John Cooper Works 2dr Hatchback (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Eye Catcher," I got my JCW Coupe for track work. So far I have done only one autocross and no track days. I got the automatic because I wanted the paddle shifters for great up and downshifts. It takes some practice but the shifts are amazing. Let me do the negatives first. First, with the automatic there is a bad peddle lag. Even if you put it in sport mode it is an automatic. It was terrible at autocross. With more practice, I could handle it but for autocross the manual is the way to go. I think the peddle settings are no different than a standard Mini. Also, the JCW does not come with a sport suspension standard even if you thought you were buying the ""M"" or ""AMG"" of Mini's. You need to add that and it can cost a good bit. So, it is not 100% sport. The rest is all great. Acceleration once you start is excellent, handling is excellent and the standard suspension is great for comfort if you want a daily driver. If you put a sport suspension and oversized wheels it is very very hard. You can buy the JCW suspension for $4k more and it might be the best all purpose suspension. Vision is limited but frankly I expect that is a sportscar or convertible. The styling is so unique many people will point and ask you about it. It is perhaps my favorite thing about the car. It looks aggressive, yet friendly. The trunk is to die for in a two-seater. The reason is that the back seats of a regular Mini have been removed and even though the roof is lowered you have a ton of trunk for a little car. It has a reach through that is handy for longer stuff or reaching back to say a small cooler. It is a great road trip car and can handle decent luggage for two people. The car will fly and corner well and to me your big decisions are three if you are looking at one. 1. Automatic or manual. 2. Tech or minimal tech (adds cost). 3. Suspension, stiffer or softer or premium sport. If you max everything out this car will be in the mid $40s, new. Mini stopped making this model so you will have to be on the used car market. I actually like that as it keeps the car an uncommon model amongst and uncommon car. I like unique. Just drive one and see what you think. All of the coupe and roadsters are great but I think the base model sort of misses out with the low power. It is the sportiest of the lineup and also the smallest of the Mini's.",4

I get favorable comments from strangers about the car all the time. It now has 17k miles on it and I have not had any mechanical issues at all. The car as purchased did ride too rough for my taste but switching to Koni FSD struts and non-run flat tires has cured that issue. I have no idea what car I could ever buy to replace this.

The multiple options offered are terrific, the car has been reliable and it is an incredibly fun drive. There are some cons... Backing up with the top up is a gamble at best, there are times I cannot see. The ride is rough, bumpy and loud. The Mini tech center could use a lot of work. For instance your phone is on Bluetooth audio but you want to charge your phine so you plug it in, now the next time you want to use Bluetooth audio you have to go through a maze of menus to re-select Bluetooth for music playback.

The car is fun to drive when there aren't any mechanical issues. Owned by BMW, but shows NONE of the standard quality elements seen in BMI engineering. Fun to drive, but EXPENSIVE and CONSTANT maintenance. Computer is quirky. If the car goes into ""limp mode"". The Transmission is sealed and can only be maintained by the ""dealer"" which ask for leg and arm to service. Chronic alignment issues on the ""rear""? Have notified Mini Of North America of the flaw in the rear control arms. Even had the dealer perform the alignment only to tell me after $350 they were worn out. Computer updates that some how get ""missed"" during service but are found after warranty has expired.Continued issues with random warning lights. Low tire is always on and can't get it off not matter how diligent you are with tire pressure. No spare tire which is fun to find out when you have a FLAT. Run Flat Pirelli tires are not economical at all. $35K for a car no spare tire?? It is slippery in snow and ice with the ALL4. Better all wheel drive vehicles. They make this car almost impossible to service yourself. Better cars for the price UPDATE_ Mini North American is aware of the alignment issues. I have eaten through tires about every 3-5 months. I align and it stays that way for about month and it is back out. The last time I contacted Mini North American. Made them aware of the ""short"" rear control arms. They just glazed over it and said we'll make a note of it. The next time you are out look at the rear camber on a mini. TOE IN. Update again- 120,000 had one dealer tell me engine needed $4000 worth of work and another $1500. I change my oil and am very aware of maintenance. This is getting too much to handle but I can't pass this lemon on to another person. Just got notification of faulty high pressure fuel pump for cars under 10 yo old or 150,000 miles. Have had several young people look at the car- Oh I want one of those or I am thinking of getting one of those. ME- DON""T!

I traded a Clubman S to get this Countryman SALL4. I wanted a little more ground clearance for snow and taking kayaks to the rivers and lakes. I wanted to keep a low throw to the roof because I have to put one or two 45lb kayaks up there. The Countryman had virtually all the right characteristics with AWD, low roof, good clearance and four doors for guests. The car drives great and is very comfortable. I just got vinyl seats because of wet clothes from snow and kayaking. They are surprisingly comfortable and nearly perfect for me. Vision is great, driving is solid and sporty and close to regular Mini's. It has a bit more of a big-car feel at about 3300lb but that's not bad. Here is the significant negative. I just got it back from the shop this week with a new engine at 14200 miles. I have low mileage because I have three cars. one of which is a company-work car. I went in for an oil change and the rear main seal was leaking. They called it ""crank lock"" and I did not go over it in detail with the technician ,although I wanted to. I am fascinated by engineering. In any case the dealership was fantastic. They were courteous and kept me up to speed on the pace of the repairs. I asked if it was a common problem or manufacturer defect and they said it did not seem so. However, I see another review here by another guy who had an engine replaced at low mileage, too. I smell a recall in the future. So, here's the summary. Mini's are fun, sporty, urban-cool and urban-practical to the max. They drive well and do everything just as I would hope. However, they are hit or miss, with a lot of misses on reliability. Understand, I love Mini's. I am in a Mini Cooper club but I have to be straight on the reviews because I use these reviews extensively myself. Not one other thing has gone wrong but the engine is a big deal and I think they said they replaced the water pump at the same time. So, if you consider one of these my best advice is be sure they are under warranty  when you buy.",3

The other 2 issues I had were an oil leak that was manufacturer defect and an AC power cable was freyed that both had to be fixed. Repair takes a while, the MINI service center didn't have anything on hand so each thing that had to be fixed or replaced had to be ordered. I drove this with baby seats in the back and strollers and diaper bags in the boot (trunk). Not a lot of storage space, but that was not something I was concerned about.

I wanted something big enough to carry my drums around so the Countryman seemed like a good balance of performance and practicality. I've had sporty cars before but I've been very happy with the Countryman. That's not to say there isn't any room for improvement. The visibility out of the back isn't great and one of the first things I did I was add a backup camera. Love it... It should be standard equipment on all modern cars. I've put about 14,000 miles on it so far and hasn't been in the shop for anything. The ride is ok with the Countryman but hitting a pothole or rut in the road will rattle your teeth. I know any performance vehicles ride is similar and I'll probably not go with the run flat tires when the time comes to replace them. The instrumentation isn't intuitive and takes a while to figure out, but wasn't a deal breaker for me. It provides info on every part of the car and will let you know if something isn't shut,tire pressure low, gas getting low and how far you can go with the gas you have, it even will let you know when the car needs regular servicing.       I've had the mini now for about 2 years. The car has been my daily driver and has been dependable. The only problem that came up is the sensors on the wheels came on for the right front tire to inform me that the tire pressure was low. I'm still using the run flat tires that came with the car and the ride is still very rough when driving a bumpy road. Still have plenty of rubber left on tires but going to put on regular performance tires in a few more months.UpdateStill problem free. Only in the shop for scheduled maintenance. The rubber on the run flats still good so I'm putting off replacing those for a while longer. Car starts right up every time I push the ignition button and runs smoothly.Update 5/18It will be 4 years in August, that I first drove off the lot. Outside of regular scheduled maintenance the Mini Countryman has been problem free. The ride can be a little rough going over ruts and potholes, but that’s the trade off I guess to achieve the handling that you get with the mini. I’m at 49,000 miles now. It’s my daily driver, and still loving it.",4

After only having the car for 6 months i started having problems starting with my tire pressure monitors. My left tire pressure monitor kept saying that it was low and flat but when i looked at the tire it was fine and the air compressor part said i had fine air pressure. Than my car started having transmission/engine problems at only 8,000 miles as well as my car redlining at 25 mph. My car is now dying when i make sharp left and right hand turns, as well as the car redlining at 25 and finally shifting to a higher gear after i have no choice but to floor it and have the rpms at 8 on the rpm screen on the car than once it finally shift the car knocks you forward with a loud and hard clunking noise. I have had it with this car! Mini and BMW customer relations have been a total pain to deal with saying it hasn't been serviced enough to help me with a problem. NO car should drive like this!! My car is still in the service department currently and the service techs have no idea what is causing the problems or how to fix it saying they feel what I'm talking about but not sure if its a mechanical problem or electronic issue...

The turbo provides enough boost to pass and accelerate at traffic lights.  Takes corners very well.  Gas mileage is pretty decent as long as you don't speed too much.  Still small enough to make parking easy.   I am concerned about its longevity.  My windshield is already pretty pitted up after having the car for a little over a year.  The windshield angle is steep, so it will catch and not deflect road pebbles.  Electric gremlins are already showing up - the door ajar warning light kept coming on while on the highway, even though all doors were shut tight.  Happened on a few occasions.  Some rattling starting to show up near the driver seat, can't tell if it's coming from the seat itself or somewhere else.  Sometimes the idling will dip drastically and takes a few moments for the ECU to regulate the idle.  Seats will cause butt and back aches on road trips.  Center speedometer looks cool at first but the novelty wears off quickly.  I will likely not purchase this car after the lease is up.

903, on 07/27/15 08:43 AM (PDT),DC Mom ,2014 MINI Cooper Countryman Wagon 4dr Wagon (1.6L 4cyl 6M),Cute but clunky driver interface and terrible mpg," I've had this car about a year, standard city driving, with some long highway trips occasionally.  Bought it because I wanted something good for city driving and parking, and carting around a couple kids, but also with a little style and oomph. The model I have is pretty loaded, with the GPS system, leather interior, fancy sound system etc.After a year, pretty disappointed.  It super cute and fairly fun to drive, though a little stiff.  However the navigation system is so counterintuitive that I literally never use it- weird menus, no touch screen, takes forever to input addresses etc.  The sound system interface is similarly unwieldy, the sound is great, but it is much more complicated than it should be to save radio stations, seek channels, switch inputs etc.  All first world problems, admittedly, but it does diminish your enjoyment of the car when it feels designed by people who were trying to drive you crazy.  Similarly, it lacks basic conveniences for the price point, like a back up camera.  Even the fact that it doesn't have a simple clock on the dashboard (you have to toggle three buttons to see the time) is annoying.The worst part of the car is the gas mileage.  With such a little car, you'd think it would be great. Manufacturer says it should be about 25 city, 32 highway.  Hah!  On the back of a tow truck, maybe.  I put only premium unleaded gas in (never had to do that with another car) and still only get about 17 mpg with normal city driving, maybe 23 on the highway. When I took it in to be checked, they said there was nothing they could do, and that they had had a number of people with similar complaints.  Overall, though I like the style and fun, I would not recommend.  And will probably be trading mine in pretty soon.*UPDATE 2 YEARS LATER.  Still not loving the car. Lots of small annoying glitches in the system that have needed fixing in the last few years- warning lights broken, weight sensor in passenger seat malfunctioned etc. Gas mileage continues to be bafflingly bad, have brought it in several times but the dealer says it’s normal/is uninterested in problem. (I average about 17/mpg with normal sedate city driving.). Would trade it in but also not great in resale value, so will ride it out until I can afford a new car.",3

This is perfect example. Had a 2011 with 90K miles, great looking car, fast, but scary fast at times, hit a bump at high rate of speed the car jumps into other lane almost. This one started to smoke once in a while and then Oil pressure light kept popping on & off and no one could say why for sure. So we tried this & that but light always came back. Also alternator went out so had to be towed, $1000 imported alternator, then water pump cracked as well at the same time. Dumped this car ASAP.... mechanic told me they are only good up to say 100K miles and then they start to go, I now believe him. Stay with a Japanese car, at least they last, and hold their value better that this BMW/Cooper did. Only had it for almost 4 full mos and spent well over 2K trying to keep it running, good thing they are so cheap to buy, now we know why.",1

What I don't like is the hesitation when pulling out in traffic especially when cold. The acceleration is also delayed which makes it tough to get used to. My real problem with the car is the dumb design that BMW put into this car. I've owned the car for about 3 years and never had a problem other than brakes which are weak but who needs them it is a go-kart after all. So it sat a lot during the winter which was quite mild. We found about 2 inches of water in the passenger side floor. I evacuated all the water and dried it out. My wife had left the door ajar so I assumed this was the problem. It happened again a few days later. Turns out the sunroof drain came off during the winter while the car was sitting and the water leaked down the front pillar into the electrical junction box and into the passenger compartment. HI BMW a third grader could have figured this out. Audi had already lost millions in a class action for the same thing. So my junction box is all corroded and it's $2300 to fix it. 9 percent of the original sticker to replace a fuse box that some idiot approved as okay to place it under a roof drain that doesn't even have a clamp to hold it on. GENIUS! FYI the drivers side is set up the same way. I also noticed that the screw covers had all been removed prior so the problem obviously had happened before. The dealer offered me 5k for my 11k car so I'm fixing it and trading it. No longer a fan.UPDATE. So I fixed the car and after requesting the repaired parts and  South Shore Mini gave me a bunch of parts that didn't go to the car, I threatened to sue and they dropped the repair to $1400, still high for a 400 part and two wire connections that it turned out was all they replaced. I called Mini Regional and they never called back. Turns out customers are below them. They have a company policy of not calling CUSTOMERS back. "" We handle these internally"" was the response. Mini also does not have any set pricing guides for repairs like most manufacturers have so the dealer can charge you whatever they want. FYI I traded in the repaired Mini for a Volvo C30. Wow what a great car. Faster, quieter, more power and about the same size. Better gas mileage on the highway about the same around town. After adding in the repair cost in I still got $4000 more than the Mini dealership offered.  So look around before you buy a Mini.

Mini's get expensive super fast as you put on options. I waited till end of year clearance and got a $5k discount. That is the way to go. What has surprised me is the little 3-cylinder engine. I got the smaller engine to save money and just the FWD. I was not going to get this car (I have had 5 other Mini's) but I kayak and paddle board and no other vehicles have side open doors any more! All are lift hatches. So, I like the Mini styling and got this one at a discount. The base 3-cylinder is great around town and will even squeak the wheels. Where you lack is the top end. With only 134hp your torque and power run out in about the first third of the acceleration curve. When you are on the highway you won't get a big burst of power to pass. It is great on the low end. The cargo room is super. I love how the back doors open automatically when you put your foot under the bumper and now I don't think I could live without it. I have hands full of gear for work, groceries or kayaking stuff and it comes in handy. I love the low roof for a low throw for the kayaks and boards. The ride is amazing, the best I've experienced in a Mini. Also the sound proofing has improved a lot over earlier models. I got JCW sport seats which I might pass on the next time. I liked the style but they are a bit less comfortable for most. All weather mats, roof rack and folding seats make it a super multi-task vehicle for my outdoor activities, taking friends places and daily errands. Mileage is terrific. I get at least the low 30's on highway and high 20's in the city. My teenage nephew drove it on a family trip with my kayaks and a car full of friends and they loved it, especially the tech. So, I expected a slow 134hp, 3100lb mediocre but practical car and I have come to really enjoy it. If you have the bucks the turbo 2.0l is probably a bit nicer and you can get AWD but don't sneer at the base model. It is a good value and will do the job around town and you save many thousands compared to the top end Clubmans.",5

I looked at other cars such as a Civic, Hyundai Elantra, and Kia Optima and they would not discount their cars nearly as much. For the price I paid the car is a great value. It is a premium car. Come standard with 2 zone climate control, blue tooth, sirius radio, alloy wheels, premium vinyl soft touch materials. I get and average of 38 mpg on a tank with 70% high way driving and 30% city driving. I took a 1700 mile trip and averaged 42 mpg for the trip. On the 1700 mile drive, the seats were very comfortable. Much more so than our Dodge Grand Caravan or the Chrysler 300 premium I recently rented. The bluetooth is very easy to setup and the call sound quality is much better than the VW CC I had prior. The only complaint is the knob control for the radio, bluetooth, etc. is not super intuitive and  takes a little to learn it. Once I learned it, it is great, but my wife, who rarely drives it, is struggling to learn it. The Chrysler 300's interface is outstanding. I am 6'4"" and 300+ pounds an the car is very comfortable, more so than the VW CC or the Chrysler 300. The car is pretty quiet on the road.

All of this and probably a bit more was fixed and my shop says my Turbo will need to be replaced in the next 30k miles....that's another $3k to rebuild.  However, it's fun as [non-permissible content removed] when it drives.  Think I'm having steering/suspension problems with horri ble overseer.  This car will be sold after this summer for sure.",3

Now that we're in the dead of summer, I am noticing a little odor (thought it was my shoes), so they suggest the Evaporator needs to be cleaned out for $120. That's the first service item on the car, with 48,000 miles and nearly 4 years. On the highway, I still get 42 MPG. With the 6 speed, I am never without the power I need.I travel quite a bit and met 2 BMW engineers. Both said the 6 speed base Cooper w/ sport assist is a great car.

Given the Clubby is under warranty but when I learn that brake replacement can approach $1K or higher, that concerns me. IMO, the whole MINI culture/concept not only includes the original purchase price but also the ongoing highly expensive maintenance.

We put the car on the road for a 2500- mile summer road trip; performance was great and mileage was *fantastic* (~41MPG on the highway), but we found that the passenger-side carpets were wet.  We had to diagnose the problem via the MINI discussion boards on the internet, and traced it to a poorly installed gasket in the A/C system.   Other problems included rear-door seals that didn't seal, an inaccurate speedometer, and shut-downs due to bad throttle assemblies.   After ~5 repair trips in 12,000 miles, the dealer replaced the car, so we now own a 2010 - with a gas gauge that doesn't really work.",3.875

The Mini has more noises than I can identify, but that becomes one of it's charm. The clubman is not a ""pretty""car, but I think thats what I like about it.

The automatic tire pressure sensor gives false alarms, so the local dealer wants me to pay to fill the tires with nitrogen.  Don't put barefoot kids or anything delicate in the backseat floor because the runners that slide the seats are incredibly sharp, exposed metal. They punctured a 2L soda bottle recently. It got under the carpet, and the dealer wanted $900 to dry it out, claiming no fault because cargo belongs in the cargo area (duh? but sharp metal is ok for people?) My auto body guy did it for $300.

The service at the dealership is awesome and their customer service is one reason why I purchased another mini.  I gotta admit, I do like the clubman better than the mini...feels more stable.

I haven't had any real problems with the size of the car, it fits anywhere and with the clubman's back doors, everything fits. The clubman S has a lot of power and when I'm not paying attention it surprises me still.

Outfitted with a roof rack system from Mini this car has taken all I can dish out.  Mountain biking, road biking, camping and hauling hockey equipment back and forth to the ice rink has not slowed down this car. In the sport mode the umph is exciting and shifting the gears is fun.

In short, the car is fun to drive.  Handling and braking are outstanding and the base model has enough power for most situations.  Once you commit yourself to revving it higher and downshifting when required, the power is adequate.  It's been reliable through the first 4,000 miles and have averaged 32mpg in traffic.

Steering is heavy. Pedals are heavy. Handbrake is heavy. Gearstick is tight. Worst, the engine is so coarse - my wife initially thought it was a diesel! And too slow for Boston traffic flow. Moving it through stop-start traffic is a pain. Turning circle feels surprisingly large too.  However it all changes once you get above 30mph.

The car has an auto and regular 1.6 L - this is a sluggish combo. The 17"" wheels look fantastic but after a few months of driving with the run-flats made we want to trade the car in. Switched to high performance regular tires and problem was solved. Overall the car is a ten in appearance and interior design. The performance is solid six. The 4spd auto just doesn't translate well with normally aspirated 1.6. I would advise buying the extended maintenance plan because the cost of repairs can be high if you are unaccustomed to german car repair costs.",3

Have been performance car freak since I was finally able to afford the original Datsun Z-car, then a series of Porsche 911's, finally a Boxster.  Just before getting a 2015 PACEMAN demo (2,00 miles on the clock) I was driving a 2012 BMW 330i coupe.  When oil leaks repair estimate came to three times what I had to put down for the 2015 MINI, the deal was made.  Have not been this happy with a car since my last 911 Carrera converatible!  OMG-- everything works! 32-33 mpg highway (lots of highway driving) on 89 octane), and decent, if not sparkling acceleration.  Wanted the 6-speed manual, but spouse insisted on automatic, and of course has driven it exactly once in almost a year.  Here in New England, ""performance driving"" is now gone.  Traffic is simply too heavy, and risk of expensive speeding ticket too big.  But moving along at 75+ with all the other trafic, especially the big semi rigs, no problem.  Dealer support has been the best ever, especially compared to  Porsche and BMW service.  Best of all, have seen maybe three Pacemen and none in the black sparkle of mine.   Love  it!",5

Fun to drive. Fun to look at and so many ways to set it further apart from the crowd. Since my last review I have added painted on racing stripes and am looking forward to further customization. Since buying the car my son has taken an interest in driving he did not have before. It has proven very reliable and is everything I want and need in a vehicle. To date there have been no reliability issues and continues to be a great drivers car. I will be adding more horsepower and exterior customization. This is a car to have fun with.,5

Pros: - Fun to drive: the acceleration is great, and the car hugs the road on sharp curves (especially when SPORT mode is engaged).  - Interior is cool: the classic speedometer and the alternating lights make the interior of the car look pretty cool. The stereo system is okay, and it comes with aux/iPod support. The only downside of this is that the proprietary MINI aux/usb adapter is like $85 to buy, and it's basically a cable that combines a USB charger and the aux cable into 1 unified cable - huge ripoff.  - Sunroof is awesome  - Trunk space is better than expectedCons:  - Gas mileage is extremely deceiving. The advertised MPG is something like 26 / 35. Ha! More like 17 / 23. I suppose most car companies slightly inflate their MPG numbers, but come on MINI....  - Electronics suck pt 1: In hindsight, I should've paid for the premium electronics package - the standard is god awful. There is only 1 knob that controls the entire ""console"" - which is extremely minimal in features. Besides radio, it only has temperature, time, and MPG..  - Electronics suck pt 2: For my MINI, I've had a bunch of small issues with the primary computer of the car. (1) The ""miles remaining"" number is wildly inaccurate. Within 2 minutes of normal city driving, the expected miles remaining dropped from 26 to 0, and then from 0 - 4. (2) The tire pressure lights are constant red-herrings.Overall: fun car to drive on the highways and on open roads. Gas mileage is pretty crappy, and the electronics are really poor quality.",4

If you look around the miniusa website you'll have a hard time finding anything relating to fuel efficiency while it was very proudly displayed among the info for the previous model.  It's a nice car, but one of the few perks it actually had was fuel efficiency. Now it's got a new engine(3 cylinder!) and the MPG is humorously bad. It gets 23 mpg in the city which is on par with some large sport utility vehicles but it's still a tiny car by comparison.  We've had three MINI's so I'm not a MINI basher. We previously had a Clubman that got 32 mpg on the same to work routes the new Clubman gets 23 mpg. What automaker does that?? In sum, you can get far more for far less money with lots of other vehicles.  The only benefits is that it looks different and you can find your car in a parking lot.  We have a ALL4 base model which is not listed among the choices here.",2
1027, on 12/24/16 07:40 AM (PST),John B in LIT ,2017 MINI Clubman Hatchback Cooper S ALL4 4dr Hatchback AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Happier with my MINI than I was with my BMW 328i," The Clubman is about the same exterior and interior dimensions as the 3 series BMW. The S has a bit less BHP than the BMW 328, but this is almost unnoticeable and has plenty of power to spare, so don't be dissuaded by the side-by-side figures. The ALL4 provides superior traction in most conditions, which provides an additional level of confidence and safety on slick roads. Although both the BMW and the MINI have run flat tires as standard equipment, MINI offers a donut spare as an option and BMW does not. I would say that the handling of the Clubman is on an (excellent) par with the 3 series, and I actually prefer the MINI. The Clubman also has a panoramic sunroof as an option. The NAV/Entertainment architecture on the MINI is very similar to the BMW i-Drive, so transitioning from a BMW to a MINI is almost seamless. Interior comfort, in my 6' 1"" opinion, is actually superior in form, fit, and finish to the 3 series Bimmer, and the wagon design with folding rear seats of the Clubman is more practical than a sedan when you have stuff to load (BMW 3 series can be ordered as a wagon, but these are rare on BMW lots in the USA). MINI promotes and lends itself to some very nice individualizations (Stripes, wheels, etc.), so you can easily and economically modify the look of your MINI to make it uniquely ""your own,"" whereas with BMW, you more or less get what you buy/lease. Gas mileage could be better, but these cars inspire sporty driving, so my mileage may be as a result of my own lead foot and not the car. Warranties and maintenance plans are comparable between the MINI brand and the BMW (MINI is owned by BMW), and the MINI service department (at least where I live) is friendly, clean, well stocked, knowledgeable, and first rate with loaner cars available for customers. All this said, I think one of the things I like most about driving a MINI is that they aren't as ubiquitous and as cliche' as the BMW brand, and it's just a hoot to drive at about $8K+ less MSRP than a comparably equipped BMW. If you enjoy driving for the pleasure of driving and don't test drive a MINI Clubman S when considering premium compact cars, then you are shortchanging yourself.",5

We went with the Clubman for the handling, storage capacity in the back, ergonomic rear doors, and the allure of being part of owning a Mini.  Within the first 30 days started feeling buyers remorse due to incredible sluggish acceleration and even in ""sport"" mode the car lacks power (lack of horsepower almost felt dangerous in traffic and especially entering highways), which made us wishing we would've paid more for the S model.  We went back to the dealership to trade it in and they wanted 35% less than what we paid (we knew there would be depreciation), but the dealership elaborated that Mini halted production of the Clubman for several months because they were unsure if they should keep producing the car because customers were veering more towards Mini Coopers or Countryman models.  They also said that the value depreciated because of poor demand & potentially high cost of parts. We walked hoping that we would grow closer to the car. The car has an excellent cabin-feel, handles incredibly well, and the sunroof(s) are an amazing feature that make the cabin feel much bigger.  During a snowstorm the car slid off the road and the suspension got ripped apart... I firmly believe most cars would've survived the wreck, but the tiny parts got mangled from the impact. We purchased a Mini Cooper S for the handling and speed. The regular Clubman is just too boring and doesn't seem like a car that Mini wants to continue making.",2

I bought a JCW and it's clearly a car  for people who love to drive. My previous car was an Audi TDI that was bought back by Audi as part of the diesel gate. I looked into a new GTI but they're made in Mexico, not buying a German car made in Mexico.  I contemplated buying another Audi but wanted to try something completely different this time. There is nothing practical about this car. It's really just a two seater with an average size trunk. Other two seaters are just too small for my height (over6').  It gets good mpg but the tank is too small. The most disappointing thing about the purchase was the buying process.  There is only one MINI dearer in my city and it's either pay their price or don't and  they only had one JCW conv. . I was able to negotiate a little off their price but according to Edmunds  I still paid too much.  I have had the car for three months and have had no problems. Although I am really enjoying this car and have no serious complaints  right now I'm sorry to say but it will probably be my only MINI purchase. Next time I go back to another German car.",5
1036, on 01/13/18 20:19 PM (PST),AK ,2017 MINI Convertible Convertible Cooper 2dr Convertible (1.5L 3cyl Turbo 6M),"Love my MINI, Warranty not meaningful"," I love my MINI convertible. I would prefer it got better gas mileage but I bought it knowing what the mileage would be. It had little issues within 4 months of buying it (last January). For example, on closing the top, I got conflicting messages. On one instrument it said ""retraction complete."" On another instrument (large one where radio , manual etc are) where I never got messages, it said retraction NOT complete.  So, there appeared to be a computer glitch.  When I called the dealer, Seattle MINI by my house, they said if I brought it in, that was my ONE annual visit covered by my warranty.  So, I did not take it in and the issue eventually went away.  But, I only drove 6K miles during this last year, so I assume I still have a computer glitch which I will have them check out when I take it in this month.   You should not get the Bicycle Rack prep unless you verify what bicycle rack is available. For my MINI Cooper convertible, the only bike rack available is sold by MINI for $749.00.  So, with the Rack Preparation, that is $1,000.00 to be able to carry a bike. Unless you are an avid cyclist, probably not a good investment. Its a great car, though. I love it.",5

The attention to detail inside and out is what makes this car worth the extra money compared to the Fiat 500 although the Fiat is a really cool car too.  The convertible top works great.  Loaded with ""features"" many of which I'll provably never use. The interior is roomier than it looks.  Well laid out instruments and cool mood lighting (one of the features I didn't need).  Our kids are grown, so the back seat is mainly for storage and the occasional friend who wants to go motoring. I drove it on vacation this year ... about 700 miles each way.  Handled like a champ.

I bought a 2018 Mini convertible Aqua blue. It has great performance and the color stands out. We have a 2017 Mini Clubman also as it performs great as well. My Mini Convertible top can open halfway like a sunroof. Most convertible vehicles don't open like this. This is a great size for a little car and can fit into small spaces very well. With back up camera and warning signals helps a lot into small spaces. My 2005 Mini Convertible did not have such features. It handles very well with the top open and even when top is down we just love to ride in the country. It is very good on gas mileage. It is hard to decide which mini to drive the next day. The Clubman or the Convertible. Both handles very well.,5
