0, on 05/07/15 14:32 PM (PDT),rick161 ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Coupe XK8 2dr Coupe,Champagne motoring for fish 'n chips money.," My '99 XK8 convertible is my dream car, after 40 years of Jags, BMWs, Mercedes, etc. The key to happy motoring with these cars is 1) inform yourself about the issues, mainly the 4.0 liter's needs re upgraded timing chains, tensioners & water pump, and 2) have a local Jaguar specialist (not dealer) who can bring them up to standard & maintain them there. My XK8 cost me $5800 in 2015 with perfect body & interior, no accidents and with the engine upgrades already done & convertible top hydraulic lines replaced. After new tires, shocks, motor mounts, front brakes, mass airflow meter, valve cover gaskets, plugs & filters, she now runs & drives like new for a total all-in price of around $11k. I couldn't be happier.UPDATE: 15 months into ownership of my '99, I've spent very little on the car except for oil & gas. Classic/specialty auto insurance (Hagerty) has reduced the cost of comprehensive insurance to less than $400 annually on an agreed value of $15k. Costs since the initial review have been limited to a new Jaguar ignition coil ($128) & professionally repainting the front & rear bumpers (approx. $600), a project I intended since purchase. There have been no other costs; everything works great on the car & it runs & drives beautifully. I still marvel at how much car you get with the XK8, compared with much more expensive GTs like an Aston Martin DB7 or (especially now) Porsche 911. It took nearly 20 years for the XK8's predecessor, the XJS, to begin to appreciate in value, so it will be awhile before XK8 values start climbing. In the meantime, buy the best accident-free XK8 you can afford, have a local Jaguar specialist maintain/service it, and take care of it like it deserves. Great value, great motoring, great experience.UPDATE (5/16/17): 30 months in & still loving my XK8 - she's a keeper. A few months ago, I decided to fix some miscellaneous leaks (oil, coolant), a part of owning any British car. My local Jag specialist replaced the coolant bypass hose, water distribution pipe & thermostat housing, plus some o-rings & the coolant cap. The shop also replaced the oil pan gasket & drain plug. The fixes weren't cheap but they worked. Costs: parts ($321.32) & labor ($284.20) totaled $624.80 w. tax. The car is now approaching 130k mi. & drives as sweet as ever. I'm planning some road trips for the summer, including a couple of British car shows. The body & paint is excellent, the black leather interior has that aromatic richness of Connolly leather that I love, and the power top, AC & electricals all work perfectly. It's still a few more years before XK8s start their upswing in value as a modern classic, so find a good 'un now while they're cheap & enjoy!UPDATE (5/17/18): Quick update on my XK8 after 3+ years of ownership - she still looks great, comes out of the garage on sunny days, and runs like a top. No issues at all during the last year - I've added about 2000 miles since the last update. Hard to believe my XK8 is approaching 20 years old, but it's true. I sometimes get a yen to sell it & get something else, but what would take its place? A drive in the country, top up or down, is all it takes to remind me what a great car it really is. She's a keeper.",5
1, on 05/01/08 22:30 PM (PDT),ex-fan ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Coupe XK8 2dr Coupe,Stay away," After 80,000 miles, the timing chains came off.  The engine was destroyed. And the warranty had expired.  Jaguar must have known about this issue -- the issue has been widely written about by other owners on the internet and my dealership stated that chains typically come loose between 80,000 and 100,000 (but a small oil leak usually leads to a repair before all timing chains come off).  But no one warned me.  Not Jaguar, and not my dealership.  Don't be a fool.  Don't buy junk.",3.75
2, on 06/07/11 19:03 PM (PDT),tomeyeman ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,So-So car," I traded a 98 Porsche Boxster for a 99 Jaguar XK8 a few years ago.son I did it was to have a back seat for my kids to ride.Unfortunately the back seat is so small only kids under 5 can fit.Exterior:No complaints. It's a sleek, nice design. Interior:Extremely difficult to enter/exit but once inside is comfortable .The wood interior is nice but the rest is cheap, easily breakable plastic.Mechanical:The well-known cheaply-made plastic timing chain tensioners should have been replaced on all the XK under warranty. Overall by no means a luxury car. Then again, I'm comparing it to an LS Lexus.",2.75
3, on 05/05/11 12:27 PM (PDT),remsenburg ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,"Great value, but requires some patience...."," As someone who has owned two other Jaguars, an XJ6 and an XJ8, that were purchased new and kept for 7 or more years and 100k miles, without any problems, I was optimistic that my purchase of a 1999 XK8 in the spring of 2010 would not present any problems.I researched the car and was aware of the timing chain issue (which I replaced immediately on purchase of the car), but I was unprepared for mysterious ""check engine"" light problems.After several unsuccessful attempts by my repair shop the problem ultimately was the electronic throttle control module (a very expensive part).After replacing the ECM - no problems.All in all still a lot of car for the money!",4
4, on 04/15/10 08:49 AM (PDT),Sutzme ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Worth the headaches," Bought this gem used with 21K miles on it. Good thing I had an extended warranty. Plenty of electrical problem, traction control fail, antilock brake fail, convertible top lines fractured (not covered), fuel pump fail, starter fail, etc. In spite of all that, this car is just fab. It drives like a dream now that everything is fixed. She is a thing of beauty. I never get tired of starting the engine. She handles so well on the road and is great on the highway (gets 26 mpg believe it or not). These cars have lots of computer glitches. You have to get used to them. Thing you need most is a mechanic you trust who can keep your gem running smoothly. Dealerships are not always the best at this.",4.625
5, on 11/23/09 16:46 PM (PST),allen/kym ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Great bang for your buck," I just bought my Jag Xk8 convertible a few months ago. It is black on black with chrome wheels. The car gets plenty of looks. People cannot tell what year or what I paid for this baby. The car is beautiful to look at in motion or while sitting still. Under the hood is a monster. the car has power the run a quarter mile when needed. In short, just buy it. You treat the car good, and she'll treat you real nice.",4.875
6, on 03/27/08 14:31 PM (PDT),One more thought ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Mixed feelings," I love the looks and the ride is exceptional for a sports car.  Long trips are no problem, the car is easy to drive and very responsive on the highway.  It could use more low end torch, and the transmission is a concern sense it is a closed system, unable to change any fluids.  I had to change motor mounts and the safety monitoring system for the transmission is very touchy.  The vehicle brakes very well and stability is exceptional. ",4.5
7, on 10/11/07 11:17 AM (PDT),Markas ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,A great old girl," I have a friend who owned this car and was moving out of the country and couldn't take it.  I have been salivating over it for some time, so buying it was a no-brainer.  I haven't owned a convertible before, so it has been a delight driving around topless this summer.  The interior is comfortable, but those back seats are a bit silly.   The acceleration is good and the hum of the engine is delightful.  I've had quite a few people ask me about the car at stoplights and stop signs.  What a fun car to drive.",4.875
8, on 08/13/07 12:27 PM (PDT),greyfox ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Reality," Great looking but no real substance.  At 65000 miles, I have repaired timing chain guides, motor mounts, tilt wheel electronics, door lock electronics, memory seat electronics, Mass Air flow meter, throttle body module, fuel pump, fuel regulator, plugs and it still is a big question mark.  Can shut down in traffic.  No notice.  Can be hard to start up with shaking for 2 minutes.  Shows failures but the computer reads unrelated problems which if fixed would not make any difference.  Intermittent ability to start up.  Sometimes seems like no starter connected.",3.375
9, on 05/20/05 07:29 AM (PDT),Richard Hill ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,The Brits can still make a great car," I had resisted buying another Jaguar since my bad experiences with the XJ models of the 70/80s. However, since Ford has dragged this famous marque into the 21st century, with good quality control & finish, I decided to give the make another go. I have not regretted it for one moment, because this beautiful lady will make you feel 20 years younger without surgery & hours in the gym  (as did XKE in the 1960s). The performance & endless  power is captivating (forget the nonsense of 0-60 & top speed).The ride is firm, but comfortable & the road holding is like a go-kart. The design team of Jaguar has blended luxury, style, performance & feel good factor in one car, which is hard to beat under $100K.",4.5
10, on 05/02/05 17:54 PM (PDT),wbouton ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Great Car for the Money," When I say money, I don't mean original sticker price, but rather the purchase price of one that is a few years old. Prices drop like a rock on both the XJs and the XKs. The other XJs that I've owned (95' and up) have been dead reliable (one with 186k miles) and we are hoping that the same can be said of this XK, since they share a lot of parts. Much better built car than my Porsche 968 and mostly just as much fun, even without a manual transmission. Old XJS platform has some cowl shake, but it's pretty much kept under control. It's a very nice car to drive to work everyday or take on weekend trips. Luggage space, mileage and noise isolation are decent for a convertible.",4.375
11, on 03/02/05 21:07 PM (PST),JZL ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Pretty good car," Overall good car. It's a kick to drive and it looks great. Put Pirelli tires on it and it really handles. Car was reliable until about 75,000 miles. After that, transmission and instrument pack had to be replaced. Car also jumped timing and timing chain needed to be repaired. Premature in my book. Make sure you purchase the extended warranty. It's worth its weight in gold!",4.25
12, on 08/07/04 00:00 AM (PDT),D.G.W. ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Love everything about this beautiful car," I hate to part with this car as I really do love everthing about it. I have had no trouble with it and I love to drive it. Also , everywhere I go I get complements on it's beauty; however my age tells me that I need a different kind of a car.",4.75
13, on 05/14/04 00:00 AM (PDT),California man ,1999 Jaguar XK-Series Convertible XK8 2dr Convertible,Reliable...but," It is a fun car to drive I even had a police officer stop me to admire the car, honestly no ticket. I had the engine replaced at 34,000 miles because of no oil. I don't know if the servicing dealer didn't put in enough or why or how it lost it. It was covered under warranty after a fight with Jag reps. What I did find out is the gauges are not reliable because prior to dying, the engine temp and oil pressure guages all said normal nor were there any red lights lite on the dash. ",4.5

But for the price it is very cheaply built. A lot of things fall apart, there are plenty of electrical problems, overall you always feel what is gonna go wrong and break next.

43, on 11/10/17 23:22 PM (PST),Rick ,2004 Jaguar XK-Series XKR XKR 2dr Convertible (4.2L 8cyl S/C 6A),"I really, really like this car!!"," I bought this '04 convertible used (in 2017) and to get an $87,000 car with under 40,000 miles for only $17,000, I call that a value - even if it is a few years old. Looks-wise, as far as I'm concerned this is the most beautiful car on the road! Anywhere! Ever! Period! The perfect update in body lines but still reminiscent of the legendary XKE. I can't stop looking at it! You know, anyone can buy a Camaro, Mustang or 'Vette, and they're nice cars and all, but they're a dime a dozen. With the XK, and especially the rare-ness of the ""R"", now you have class. People constantly stop to gawk and often ask me what it is. And it gives you a special feeling when you can reply, not ""Chevy"" or ""Ford""...but ""Jaguar""! The best was when I came out of a restaurant last month to find 6 elderly women ogling over it! Performance wise it's great, it is fast! Fastest on the road? No, not by a long shot, but faster than 95+% of them. There's nothing like leaving the light and being to 60 mph effortlessly (I'm talking only part throttle), looking back and seeing everyone still just getting rolling. And I always have to turn the stereo down when I do because the best music is the sound of that Eaton supercharger whine! Put the transmission in ""Sport"" mode and it snaps through the gears and if you nail it from a stop (before it shifts to 2nd, something it likes to do in short order) and it launches HARD! This car has a nearly perfect combination of looks and performance, it really is as quick as it looks. For a sports car it really rides quite nice considering its handling is so crisp. Another big plus is the gas mileage, I can easily get 28 mpg at 65 mph and that's GPS corrected for mileage over a 620 mile trip. How do you beat a car that looks like this, handles like this, looks like this, rides like this, looks like this and goes like this with nearly 400 supercharged V8 horsepower and gets this kind of mileage? Did I also mention what a looker it is too? The interior is beautiful too with the polished burled walnut and leather even though there's no place to really store anything. My biggest ""gripe"" is probably getting in, or especially, out of it. Tough, I can live with it. A useless ""3 marble"" tray in the console has a small tray and a 4 coin slot, pretty much a joke. I removed it and made a nice polished aluminum plate in which I installed a combination volt meter (because there isn't one), cig lighter socket (that's always powered now) and dual USB port as the only power outlet on the car is the cigarette lighter inside the ashtray which is only hot when the ignition is on. In this day & age you can't have too many charging ports for all your ""stuff"". I also removed the ridiculous nav system from the dash (it's user un-friendly, no touch screen controls, runs off a DVD player in the trunk (!) and the last update was before the car was even built. My 35 year old street wasn't even on it!) and I installed a nice Garmin in its place - and it looks factory. Same for the stereo. The old 2004 stereo has a 6 disc player in the trunk, no aux inputs and a cassette deck. Yeah, a cassette deck! Its did crank pretty well but I put a modern Pioneer in its place, replaced the amp in the trunk (kept the Alpine speakers, they're okay) and now I have a modern stereo that rattles the mirrors and interfaces with my phone. These few simple, cheap updates were all this car needed. Maintenance so far has been good, it's been easier to work on (so far) than I'd expected and so far parts (like brakes, etc.) haven't been out of line either. It really makes all the difference if you can take on repairs like this yourself, normal maintenance on these isn't too far out of reach of the average Joe and you'll save yourself a bundle. This car is a keeper. Did I mention how beautiful it is?",5

I own a 2000 XK8 and let me just say, these cars are even more stunning in person and the coupes are in a league of their own look-wise, even by today standards.  As long as you work out the few little problems the earlier models 97-00 had before they go wrong, in specific, having the cam tensioners upgraded to aluminum which shouldn't cost more than $1k installed or just buying a newer model 01-06, then these cars have have pretty decent reliability.  At least more so than Jaguars reputation of the 80's would suggest, before Ford took over things in I want to say '89? Either way, if your reading this and end up getting one, just be prepared for all the compliments it's going to get.

People often get caught up in statistics when evaluating cars in this category.  The XKR is heavier than other sports cars so it is slower in 0-60 times and around a track.

There are some quirks and design flaws on the XKR that you wouldn't find on a German car but the XKR seethes passion unlike its rivals.

And it runs like it is the last day to get a speeding ticket. However, she needs proper maintenance and a maintenance budget.I simply found a specialty shop and had them replace all the components that usually break after 20 years over time. Upper and lower timing chain tensioners, timing chain guides, all four(!) timing chains, water pump, thermostat, valve cover seals as well as a few hoses. $3,500 later she is ready for the next 20 years.Yes, a reliable Saturn coupe would cost a lot less in maintenance.

The interior quality is not up to what it should be and I would have put some metal in the front where that plastic piece is. I think this is the first year that Ford made the car.

This vehicle has had only a few minor issues, including the CD changer, and requiring an adjustment on the latch mechanism for the convertible top. It still draws many stares and comments even today.

The DNA from the E-Type is much more obvious for this first series of XK8s and XKRs than the 2nd generation XK8s and XKRs, and just like the E-Type, these cars will always look beautiful no matter how old they become. And while they look great in photos, they have a very striking physical presence when seen in the flesh that rivals any exotic from Italy or Germany. I never feel as though I am playing second fiddle when driving this car. If the E-Type is a WWII Spitfire, the XKR is a Lear jet on steroids. It is a superb, outrageously beautiful, classy, and fast GT car with an original 2005 sticker price of just shy of $100,000 that can now be purchased for around a quarter of that price.

It turns heads. The car is very comfortable and fun to drive. Equipped with the 20"" Senta wheels I believe makes the XK comparable to riding on a cloud without losing the driving experience.  The front end is longer and the road clearance is lower as with most performance cars so one needs to be careful not to scrape the bottom of the front end in driveways as well as judging front parking distance. The rear parking is a cinch with the radar assistance.  Based upon performance, appearance, and personal satisfaction, this XK is the best and finest car I'v ever owned or driven.     ",5

Handling and performance are great (a bit underpowered perhaps - although given the aluminium monocoque construction the power/weight is commendable), interior design is outstanding (pitch the back seat!), overall fit and finish are excellent.

Miss it and think about it often.," The base engine is a little light on power compared to other cars in this segment.  If you are looking for super performance look at the XKR.  I am more of a Grand Tourer driver than an all out performance driver.  I think it has something to do with my age now.  The base model had plenty of power for me and from 40mph to 120mph there was never a situation where I needed any more.  In fact I was, ticketed while test driving on a desolate NV highway. I was going 100+ and the cop was nice enough to write the ticket for only 10 over.I have owned numerous high end and luxury cars over the years but none compares to the reactions this car received, especially when the top was down.  BMW 6 series and MB SL are very common but you don't see many XKs which was something I enjoyed about the car.  I bought the car used with 25,000 miles on it when it was 5 yrs old.  The technology was on par and up to date with the newest cars of that time.  Bluetooth and touchscreen navigation, adaptive cruise control and headlamps as examples.  I purchased an extended warranty since the car was 5 years old and there was only one issue with a window that was moving slowly.  I did have to replace the battery which when it was going bad messed with the drivers seat controls and the convertible top which may stop working even if the car has no troubles starting.  The battery was expensive as were oil changes.  I replaced the original tires with Michelin Super Sport that had plenty of tread after 3 years.Fantastic Car that gets tons of compliments, is quiet and very comfortable.  The car handles great and has a great exhaust note which makes it fun to drive.  It is pretty much maintenance and repair free although it is thirsty when it comes to fuel around town.  16-18 mpg city, 26-28 mpg highway",5

Speaker system is crap, and the tweeter grilles have popped out. Bluetooth only recognizes certain frequencies and not all so my phone is not compatible, and when it can work its for calls only no audio or media sharing. As of today ALL 4 RIMS ARE BENT THEY ARE CRAP! Rear glass cover always falls down and then finally the clamps cracked and broke off. the heated seats stopped working. the seat adjustment makes you feel like your in a convertible because they don't go back far enough and I'm only 5""10. On the good side the car looks absolutely stunning in profile it always has people stop and look. The drive and power and sound are exotic at its best. The sound can be heard a block away and is beautiful. But jaguar dealers are horrible in luxury standards in service and repairs are over the top for poor quality. This is a ford product with bells. the newer Jags owned by Tata will definitely be a better buy. I love what this car does... but i hate its quality and reliabilty. I would never recommend purchasing this model. save the headache and buy a CL Mercedes or the new Jaguar FType that's all new built if you have the $$$",2

Also antifreeze was getting low and I was not seeing any puddle under the car, so I took it to a mechanic, after the transmission rebuild. The whole part with the hoses had to be replaced(seal was leaking). so I had to get this replaced.  Now the engine light is on, so back to the shop. The engine is leaking oil, the drive belt needs to be replaced and on top of that I need to do normal maintenance (brakes, rotors, tires). This car is a nightmare. I know that it isn't new, but I take care of it, and only have 78,880 miles on it. I need a car and a new car right now is sort of out of the question.

Many have been fixed just to come back again.  We put on our third set of tires at 55,000 miles.  Remote locks have been fixed 4 times.  Dashboard has popped up 4 times and currently rattling again.

While I hear the BMW's and Acura's are better buys, the Jaguar has a ""je ne sais quoi"" that the others don't and, there is an exclusivity about owning one.

Very comfy, except over bumpy roads I drive, stiff like a Subaru Outback, hopefully means suspension will last longer.  So far (15K) excellent realiability, Ford engine is way better made than Jags used to be reliability-wise (my '79 X-J6 was a mechanical nightmare).

I find nothing ""cheap"" about the interior; the camel interior goes beautifully with the British racing green exterior. Yes, I can't get to 60 mph in 5.5 seconds, but Ford (which has a long tradition in building British cars) has put together just the right package of performance, appearance and creature comforts to make this car worth every dime.

It feels great when friends and strangers recognize the brand and make positive comments about its looks. This is my 5th year of ownership and I still like its looks and feel. I liked it so much I decided to not trade it in when I recently bought a new car. The 3 liter engine feels strong and satisfying in most situations although the automatic transmission loses a second or two when downshifting in sudden acceleration.

Regarding power, it accelerates just fine, I don't need a racecar to go back and forth to work or run errands.

484, on 12/03/15 23:41 PM (PST),Kevin Bowley ,2007 Jaguar X-Type Sedan 3.0L 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl 5A),"Nine years and 111,000 miles; living with the Jaq"," I have owned my 2007 X-type since new, Oct 2006, and it now has 112000 miles and 9 years of relatively aggressive driving in the four seasons in Maine.  The car still gets far more ""looks"" than my wife’s '10 Audi A4 and the chassis and suspension are still very tight, noticeable difference from the day I purchased it.  It rides buttery smooth yet provides excellent feedback, on center feel, no body roll or any floaty feel even driving triple digit speeds.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the car and it has been extremely reliable.  Other than routine maintenance (2 sets of tires, brakes and rotors twice, changed out all driveline fluids once and filled with Mobile one at 75k as well as the transmission flush with Redline D4 Synthetic ATF) I had to replace a brake booster (480 at dealer), a water pump (325.00 at local shop), tie rod ends and a throttle position sensor.  I consider 1200.00 in repairs over 9 years of hard driving and setting outside darn good.  The chassis is completely rust free, paint still looks great, exhaust is still shiny steel and it the engine is very strong.  It feels much stronger than its rated 230 hp albeit rather noisy when pushed to the red line.  The 5-speed auto tranny is eager to upshift when left in normal mode in an effort to achieve good fuel economy.  Placed in sports mode it holds the gears longer, not overly, and seems to be the better overall choice for 2 lane and city driving so I always leave it in sport mode, which it retains when shut down so when you start it after setting for 5 minutes or a week it will retain the mode it was in when you last parked it, nice.  All the interior pieces show no wear, the heated Connolly leather seats are wonderfully comfortable for my 5'7"" frame and show no aging, fading, ripples nor creasing and the fronts are 8 way power.  Rear seat room is fair, fine when setting behind me but tight if the fronts are slid way back, they too are comfortable save for bit short for good thigh support but it works out because your feet rest on the floor just right.  The rear center armrest is nice and wide with two sturdy cup holders.  It has all the right safety features and then some; dual stage front airbags and a drivers knee airbag, side impact bags and overhead full length side impact bags that come out of the roof, passenger side weight sensing front airbag that also compensates for the seat position, anti-lock brakes, emergency brake assist, electronic brake force distribution, all-wheel drive, traction control and stability control (both can be disabled allowing for spinning in heavy snow with cutting power, I find it useful getting up the 30 degree hill in a foot of snow in my 2/10 mile driveway) though I don’t believe the stability control is fully disabled it does allow for aggressive off-ramp fun without interference. If left on it can be a bit overcautious as I have had it cut power during hard acceleration with a tad of oversteer on an uphill reducing radius off ramp a few times right at the apex exit.  Top speed in mine is 145 give or take, which was surprising as I was sure that the computer would intervene as others had said there’s’ would cut out at 125.  It was very stable with no floating and little wind buffeting. The 120-watt stereo sounds decent enough and I like the auto volume adjustment as speed increases.  Reception is exceptional on both AM and FM bands with no electronic interference on the AM side, which I use frequently when commuting.  It also has the Bluetooth phone module, which works without a hitch.  For winter, driving the car has heated outside driver and passenger mirrors that work extremely well as do the heated windshield washer jets.The trunk is surprisingly large and is well fitted but lacks any storage compartments.  I installed a couple of bins at the rear outside edges fastened with some Velcro to store such things as my bottle of fuel stabilizer and Marvel Mystery oil for use when buying fuel for my yard equipment.  I also installed a stretchable net a couple feet from the rear to prevent groceries from sliding forward if a hard stop is required.To sum it up, because of the issues that plaque the early models sales plummeted and never recovered even though 2006+ models are as reliable as expected from any newer car.  It can also be found at very attractive prices in the used car market and you can get a very nice highline car for the price of a Corolla yet is far more enjoyable to own.  The car was also dinged for being a ford Mondeo yet it shares a mere 15 percent of Mondeo parts.  It is fast, comfortable, tight, elegant, attractive, and rare.  It garners attention from onlookers and it has been very reliable.  I would have no reservations jumping in tomorrow and driving it to Salt Lake to visit my brother, cruising in complete comfort and confidence at 85 mph.  With its resale now at about 7500.00, I have no intention nor reason to ""upgrade"" to a newer sports sedan as the Jag has and is a pleasure.  I wis",4

Yet both BMW and Mercedes ship with Leatherette seats (that is vinyl) and the C280 in particular has cheap chrome around the drink holders that flake off.

The the downside of owning a used Jag is that once the warranty runs out (along with the included maintenance), upkeep is costly, especially at the dealership where $500 to $1,000 for scheduled maintenance is normal.

I have had to replace the drive shaft at an expense of $883.00 and now I have to have the power steering hose replaced at a cost of $489.00. The warranty ran out last month and these expenses have been incurred within less than a month of that!!!!   What a piece of junk!!!! Oh I forgot that the vent covers on top of the dash pop up when the temp outside changes and I finally supper glued them down. I will not buy another.,3.5

I go in for regular tune- ups, and oil changes according to scheadule, as I drive about a 100 miles a day. I get really good gas milege 29 mpg, probably because of the manual.

Power is adequate, handling on wet roads is simply unbelievable. I've had 3 BMWs and the X-Type easily, very easily, and I'll say effortlessly, could run off and leave them on a winding road--wet or dry. On the straight interstate above 115 mph handling is about the same as the BMWs I've had, maybe a little better but nothing outstanding. Interior is nice with the VDP package. Interior doors handles are hard to pull to open the door and that is common to all X-Types. Bad design using a cable. Have to remove a lot of stuff to change plugs on the rear cylinder bank. BMW is a lot easier.",4.75

AWD is a huge plus for me and I am surprised how well this car is built and drives like butter.  The feel of it while driving is incredible.  I have ridden in and driven BMW, Mercedes and other luxury cars, Jaguar X-type is the most humble (in a good way) and solid luxury car.  I would buy another X-type in a heart beat.

The whole car just seems cheap to me. The paint work seems to scratch so easy compared to other cars I've owned (I keep really good care of my cars). When washing the roof of the car, the roof panel behind the sunroof gives way / dents in. I don't know if it's justified, but if panels of the car are so weak, it gives me an impression that the car is not safe. Plus I haven't been able to find any safety ratings on this car, which doesn't help. The backseat is not designed for kids at all. The seat belts lock up continuously for no reason, which is a big issue when your kid (who is a highback booster) can't get their belt buckled. The seatbelt won't unlock unless it's fully retracted, which can't happen unless you remove the belt from the belt guide in the booster. Also the boosters overhang the seatbelt receptacle. Long story short don't get the car if you have kids. The leather or pleather on the center console arm rest has big air bubble where the glue is no longer holding the (p)leather to the under-surface.

The styling, handling, overall feel of the entire car is fantastic. I drive between Washington DC, NYC, Philadelphia monthly and has not let me down once. The Diesel engine is totally awesome and I always get fabulous fuel economy. I never have a problem finding diesel fuel anywhere either which is one of the first questions people ask when I tell them that is indeed Diesel. The leather is beautiful and the overall sophistication and look of the cockpit is great too. Im a bit of a car freak and over the past 7 years have owned a Mercedes Benz SL500, Infinity G37x, Audi Q5, Audi A3, as well as a BMW 535I. I had a moment when I wanted to be practical and bought a Toyota but last only lasted 5 months. Anyways its really a terrific car. Now not all cars are perfect... lets talk about some of the things that I don't like about the car and drive me crazy. The sound system is good quality, not the best but its just good at reasonable volumes. When you turn it up some of the speakers don't sound too hot. The plastic bottom door area rattles sometimes depending on the type of music you are playing and drives me nuts. Another thing that happens while listening to music loudly is that the piano black veneer trim I think rattles slightly too off and on depending on the song. I notice this more when the bass is tuned up anymore than half way balanced. The backseat legroom is terrible and always feeling like people are squeezing into the back seat. I am under 6 ft tall so someone sitting beside shouldn't ever be a problem unless they are taller than I am. Also getting in and out of the car is a little difficult. I don't know if its because its very low, or the angle of the drivers seat or what but I feel like an old man getting out of it sometimes and I'm in my late 20's. But really at the end of the day it is a fantastic car. It turns heads and just has such great style thats not overdramatic and in your face like some of the other brands. My sister and her boyfriend both have BMW 3 series and after driving my new Jag they are trading both in and looking at this car and considering the new F PACE. This will not be my last Jag, if this one treats me well for my 3 year lease I will be looking at getting another XE, or perhaps trading up and getting the XJ. I feel that all of the things I don't like about my XE will go away if I get myself into an XJ.",4

Only concern so far is the rear seat latches what were you thinking Jaguar they fall off by just touching them.  My only real concern after a month of driving my new car.Its now been 8 months of driving in all weather conditions including deep snow and ice. The powertrain is excellent still responsive and quiet as when first bought the car. No rattle or speaks observed still enjoy the feeling of driving the car. My only real disappointment is the overall electronic control system. I could be on a phone call in the car and when finished it will not return to radio, another example would be when using my MP3 connected through USB port it suddenly stops and I have to change back to radio. The overall system is slow to power up compared to my previous car a BMW the system is like an old computer booting up sometimes but once going works reasonably well.",5
613, on 02/19/17 07:19 AM (PST),First Time Jag Owner ,2017 Jaguar XE Diesel 20d Premium 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbodiesel 8A),LOVE my Jaguar DIESEL," I only buy diesels because I plan on keeping a car 12  or more years and a diesel is the only way to make that happen.   I had three VWs before the Jag.  Before the VWs I had a 2002 Ford F250 Crew Cab. I started with a 2012 VW Golf TDI.  Had an accident (not my fault) that nearly killed me, literally.  So I upgraded to a 2013 VW Passat TDI.  Got rear ended twice, not my fault.  Car was curse so I got a 2014 VW Passat TDI that VW had to buy back from me.  Used myhopstoch dot com because Edmunds and Truecar told me to pay $1 OVER MSRP.  Auto Trader gave me a cert to pay $700 OVER MSRP.   Hopscotch saved my $8K.   So about the Jaguar, love it!   The Jaguar website is a little misleading.  It says the 20d Premium has everything the 20d has, like SiriusXM.  Mine did not come with, so I have a mess of wires and because the roof is aluminum, the magnet won't stick.  The car halls ass.  I was doing 95 on the highway in the middle of the night and would have sworn I was doing 70.  The car comes with four driving modes, rain/snow (starts in second gear),  Economy, Normal, and Dynamic.  I love Dynamic.  The speedometer and RPM gauge turns red like it is angry.  I'm averaging 42 mpg city and highway. The Jag comes with not only a 5 year/60,000 mile bumper to bumper, but also comes with all scheduled maintenance for 5 year / 60,000 miles.  The free maintenance is a few grand in savings.  I'm not tall, so it gives the back seat more parking room.  If you are tall, that will take away space from the back seat passengers.  As far as the technology, I'm good with it.  Had a great mapping system.  My only complaint is it doesn't like my Texas accent.  If I had to add/change anything, first I would put a place for the keys!  I have lost the keys in the car and had to search around for them!  I'd like something between the inside edges of the front seats to prevent things from falling under the seat.  Jag needs to add a few options to all models, like proximity key entry. I loved walking up to my VW and just opening the door because my keys were in my pocket.   The car has a 12v port in the drivers cubby in the center console.  Since you have to run some wires out of it, it needs notches in the cubby lid for the wires to get through.  The apps are okay.  The remote app is the one I use the most to make sure I locked it and rolled up the windows and start it to pre-cool the car down.  In Texas we don't let them run to heat them up, we run them to cool them down before we get in!  The trunk room is more than adequate.  As far as the apps, you have to run them through your phone into the car.  It is easier to just run any apps thru the blue tooth from the phone.  No sense in running the app through my phone into the car entertainment system.  It just adds a step that isn't necessary.  It should come standard with SiriusXM.  SiriusXM are fools for not allowing that and giving a three month trial.  The vision package is very cool.  I have the cold weather package that I will be able to use a few times a year.   The front seats need some lumbar support adjustment pillows.  I absolutely love the car.  I can tell when I change it to dynamic mode.  The steering tightens up, the suspension gets stiffer and it moves.  I was doing 98mph and getting 57 mpg according to the car computer.  I'm averaging 42 mph in mixed highway and city use.  Jaguar know how to make you feel special.  I got a box from them.  It had all sorts of different little panels on the use of the infotainment system and four tire stem caps with little jaguars on them.  I must admit, it made me feel special and like they cared.  I have breakdown and SOS buttons and I think I have them for at least 5 years.  I wanted a diesel. Chevy couldn't tell me when the Cruze was coming out and now I'm glad.  This may be a sedan, but drop it into dynamic mode and it is a sports car!  Have 2500 miles on it and not a single problem.  I love that there are two 12 volt ports in the rear of the driver cubby for use by the back seaters.  There is also one in the trunk.  I absolutely love this car!",5

The ride is the combination of sport and luxury. You hit the gas and the tubo 4 banger takes off. The design is classy and sporty. Comfortable in the cockpit, Not really  sure   about back seat as we have no children. The interior is laid out for easy access for the driver. I have the basic model so I expected to have some compromise, that being said, I think they cheeped out on some basics. No sat radio that is a standard on even your basic Masda. I don't like the Americanizing of the lights, the do not go off when you turn the car off  like all European cars. There is no garage opener built in. No mute button. The radio could be better quality. I think they are over compensation for the mistakes they made with the xt. They put a lot of luxury things in the xt and sold it at a loss hoping folks would then trade up , but instead, continued with the xt. So this time they left out stuff so you would trade up for more luxury. Don't get me wrong this is a super car and I love it, but the lack of some basics my turn some people away. After almost a year with the car I still basically  love the car, that being said, I still am annoyed about the lack of basic applications that are standard on lesser models by other manufacturers.

Save the higher-rated and, in many ways, more accommodating service of BMW, everything about the XE has given me a newfound appreciation for Jaguar.  The now iconic F-Type put Jaguar back on the map from years of dullness and now the XE (and especially its sportier variants) are breathing life back into the Jaguar brand.  From the sleek and elegant yet sporty design of the XE, there is very little that I don't love about it so far having put about 5k miles on my white knight 2017 35t.  The acceleration and performance is gripping and the handling is on par and, at least in some aspects, even better than German engineering.  Being on top of the game for some many years, it's impossible not to notice a scale back on quality of some German car brands albeit with simultaneous increases.  However, with this price point and a few tweaks on design and technology, I believe Jaguar can make the XE, the most formidable opponent of the 3 series/4 series and A4/S4 and C-Class models that's been seen in many years.   Please keep it up, folks at Jaguar!",5
617, on 10/19/17 20:47 PM (PDT),Dennis B. ,2017 Jaguar XE Sedan 35t R-Sport 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),"I love driving this car, but..."," After many years of BMWs and Mercedes, I wanted a change so I went for this Jaguar XE. A couple of test drives convinced me and I've been thoroughly enjoying it since this past January 2017. I'm leasing the R-Sport, Caesium Blue, black/blue interior, black wheels and detailing. The car is gorgeous! I constantly get compliments and thumbs-up from approaching drivers. I love the exclusivity of the brand as I see all the BMWs and MB on the road around me. I'm 66 and in excellent shape, but the entrance/egress can still be a bit uncomfortable, but once I'm in the car, I don't want to leave. The seating positions are extremely comfortable, fabulous suspension, grabs the road and doesn't let go, and has exceptionally responsive acceleration. Fair gas mileage for a V6 that drives like this, up to around 22.5mpg.   BUT... the interior lacks design and aesthetic ""importance,"" as well as quality materials. One example; the shift levels, mounted on the steering wheel, are thin short black plastic surfaces, as though an afterthought. The very narrow opening of the sliding sunroof was a huge disappointment for me. The biggest problem with this car is side visibility. It's great that the car has signals in the side-view mirrors when a car is approaching, but without it, you're dealing with a death wish. The design of the thick seats and headrests and the wide side pillars make it virtually impossible to peer over your shoulder on either side to see what's around you. Next, small things to me... very little space to store items; the rotary drive knob is too prominent, and eats up too much plastic space; a few electrical glitches that haven't caused any problems (yet). Overall, you wouldn't touch a comparably-equipped or performing BMW, Audi or MB for this price. I have no regrets, and I look forward to my next Jaguar when my lease expires. Hopefully, they'll figure out some of these redesigns.",4

I haven't had this much fun since the 60's when I owned a 65 Shelby Mustang. Lastly, get the HUD because it shows you the speed (as well as other things) and often times you don't realize how fast you are going. One other thing, the price is slightly higher than it's competitors, but it's so worth it, and it's a Jag! Lastly I got 32 MPG on a 150 mile road trip today without babying it when needed.",5

624, on 02/27/17 13:00 PM (PST),kjgood15 ,2017 Jaguar XE Sedan 35t Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Jaguar XE - the modern successor to the 3.8 Mark2," Let’s deal with Edmund’s review first:  “Disappointing interior materials and construction do not stack up to the segment norm.  The 2017 Jaguar XE's cabin features an attractive, uncluttered dashboard with clean lines, but it lacks the sort of visual flair that made the original Jag XF and current XJ so special. Its quality also leaves a lot to be desired. Compared to what's in its German luxury sedan competitors, the door trim looks and feels a bit flimsy, the trim that wraps around the dash is unremarkable, and the dash top itself is shiny and a bit coarse. Our test car also had more squeaks and rattles than usual, and in general, the XE's cabin feels as if it belongs to a nice midsize family sedan rather than an entry-level luxury one.”Let me state that I don’t know what on earth they are talking about – possibly drinking the BMW Kool-Aid too much.  Nothing in the XE interior looks or feels flimsy.  I have driven several current BMW 3-series examples, and also have my wife’s (costly) BMW X-3 as a direct comparison.  To say the XE lacks in quality, assembly, materials or even visual appeal compared to them is absurd.  Frankly, not much to choose from or any significant differences between these models.  Having driven my XE for 3K miles now, on very rough Western PA roads, I have no squeaks or rattles.  Everything seems extremely solid and well-screwed together.  And “dash top itself is shiny”?  What did you guys do – spill a drink on it?  My dash is not the least bit “shiny.”  It makes me wonder if Edmund’s drove some beaten-up early press-car for their test.  In short, I think their interior assessment is hogwash. And BTW, of course the XE’s interior is not as remarkable as the XF or XJ – would you expect it to be, since those cars occupy a much higher price point?      The car is very fast, light on its feet, and with a superior ride/handling combination than the BMW 3 series.  In normal conditions, it performs and handles like a RWD car, and its limits seem very high.  Actually, it is quite tossable, handling with a responsiveness and confidence that is reassuring.  The 8-speed auto transmission is a great one, and paddle shifting is fast and smooth if you want to do things manually.   I appreciate the “Dynamic” and “Sport” modes especially, which make a noticeable difference in shifts and throttle response.  Steering feel is surprisingly communicative for an electric system.  Brakes are strong, as you would expect.  I have driven the XE several times in winter conditions, and the AWD traction system performs flawlessly.  I find the clean and sleek looks, especially with optional 19” wheels, to be compelling. Thankfully, when Jaguar convinced Ian Callum to jump from Aston Martin, he brought his superior design sense with him.  The fact that A-M made some of the most beautiful cars in the world under his guidance, and Jaguar now has adopted a similar understated but handsome design language is not a coincidence.  While BMW pretty much rehashes the same themes year after year (with the exception of the bizarre Chris Bangle era) and other luxury makes like Lexus have just plain lost their minds in overblown design elements, Jaguars look clean, fast, well balanced, and fresh.  The trick of course will be if they can progress in the years to come without being too derivative. Overall, to me the XE is a more appealing car than the 3 series BMW, and unlike  Jag’s previous 3-series contender – the ill-fated X-type – it represents true competition.  One cannot be faulted for picking a BMW 3, since there is much to offer there.  After two BMW 135’s, which I enjoyed, I got spooked off BMW due to the bad electrical gremlins I experienced in both cars.  Yes, Jags had something of a reputation for such issues, but seem to have turned a corner.  I guess I will see.  But in an Jaguar XE to BMW 3 comparison, at the current development of both, the Jag was the clear winner for me.",5

I then did some reading on the new xe. I decided to give it a try. Went in for a test dive and signed the paperwork that same day! I was I impressed by the styling, the handling and most of all the power it offered. The supercharged V6 has tons of it. When pressed, the engine seems like it can pull for days. The handling outclassed the 3 series. Now I must admit that the interior is not up to snuff compared to the compact  luxury sedan class. It leaves a bit to be desired. But then I turn on the car, put it into drive, hit the gas, and I am quickly reminded why I purchased this car. It does not disappoint. Plus did I say how much I like the reaction I get from others when I say I own a jaguar? Love the car. Test drive. I am sure you will too!",5

I enjoy the driving experience. But....Jaguar should be embarrassed to put this techno package into this vehicle.Believe ALL the reviews you read elsewhere about how cumbersome and unreliable the techno package is. Half the time it doesn't recognize my phone so  have to reboot blue tooth while I'm driving? Voice Commands?  HA,HA, HA.   This vehicle is AWD...and HORRIBLE in the snow. I skidded right through the 4 way stop  at the entrance of my neighborhood. I am truly SCARED when driving in the snow. Finally...from day one, I've experienced a noticeable clunking in the suspension when i turn sharply, at low speeds when the car is cold (ex> backing out of my driveway). Dealer claims not aware of any problems...even though my sales person told another  client had the same complaint. Maybe this is why it handles so poorly in the snow?

So far, no regrets. Jag has nailed the balance between athleticism and luxury, despite having 19"" rims. The car is quiet and rides impressively well given the level of handling it offers. Styling, while subjective, is in my opinion above and beyond what the competition is offering. The Cadillac ATS has a better looking interior, but an inferior infotainment system. The Jag might have some cheapened aspects to the interior materials that are a let down, but it's still a very cool and rather unique setup. Passengers take note, and feedback has been very positive. People often comment that it ""looks so luxurious,"" a comment that catches me off guard every time. The brakes have major bite, and the V6 is capable of acceleration that at times is borderline scary. It's as rewarding to drive in the twistiest as any vehicle I've driven. Body lean is non-existent, even when you're pushing traction limits. Quite impressive. I believe this is the best looking, and best performing vehicle in it's class. You can go buy a BMW 340i, get another 1mpg and 0.2 seconds shaved off the run to 60mph. It's a great machine, but you'll also pay about $5k more, and look like every other car on the road. The Jag isn't perfect, but it's a lot of car for the money and backed by the best warranty and best dealership service in the business.",5

Since time began to approach for a replacement I basically assumed I'd just walk into my dealership and pick out my next 3 Series. This was especially true since the wonderful turbo-charged straight-six of the 340i was within my budget. But, here I sit with my new Jaguar XE R-Sport 35t and have no regrets. This car is in an entirely different class from the competition when it comes to driving enjoyment. It's a tight nimble car with great steering feel that is exceptionally fun to drive in all situations. The supercharged 3.0L V6 pushes it's power to the wheels eagerly and immediately at any speed and the 8-speed ZF transmission is wonderfully responsive, especially when the car is in it's Dynamic setting. I drove the BMW 340i with the M-sport package, the new 2017 Audi A4, Cadillac CTS with the twin-turbo V6, and the Lexus IS F-Sport before I made my decision and none of these cars could match the Jag for the overall driving package. Some could best it in one area or another but the overall package of power, precision, fun-to-drive factor, and refinement couldn't be topped. Add to that the fact that the Jaguar is beautiful both inside and out, equipped with enough technology to at least be in the middle of this pack of cars, and rides smooth and quiet and the decision was an easy one.",5

Too bad it is also reminiscent of my wife's old Lexus RX350...great chassis with an interior that made you want to get out of it as quickly as possible. The Good: Acceptable acceleration, excellent steering and braking. A little too much nose dive under severe braking, but everything else works so well it can be forgiven.  This car really holds a line when attacking those beckoning freeway on-ramps. Transmission shifts are buttery smooth and almost imperceptable.   The Bad: Ergonomics & Design. At 6' even, the armrest on the driver door is at least half a foot short of where I need it to be. Totally useless. The shelf on the door with the window, lock and mirror controls is at an odd angle. It causes you to fumble around the buttons, then twist your wrist weirdly to actuate the controls. Very disappointing. The seat was not particularly supportive, nor did I find the seat back comfortable. The seat back angle is such that my shoulders didn't touch at all, just the back of my head and my middle-back on down. Switchgear was also disappointing.... very flimsy. Response time on the touchscreen is outstanding...no delay. Good luck though performing simple tasks like phone pairing or seat heating.... or re-setting your trip odometer. Lastly, road noise intrusion is just too much. Freeway driving at 70mph should not be this loud.",4

The only thing you can do is to press the Start (Engine) button to make it restart. This happened 5 times so far since I have this car. The car was sent to dealer for fix after it happened 4 times. I was told it was fixed after a week and it was safe to drive again. But it happened after a week. Now it is in dealer again. It was very danger when your car was suddenly dead on the road and the car behind you almost hit you. I may need to have life insurance to drive this car!!!

While the turbo 4 was more than adequate, the V6 is incredible in terms of power and sound. This thing sounds wonderful under acceleration. I've owned my F-Pace for a few weeks. It is a blast to drive. It feels like a sports car in terms of steering, acceleration, and feel but the ride is smooth and confident.  It is amazing how Jaguar was able to retain a smooth ride yet deliver this type of performance and handling. You really need to drive it to believe it. The design of this vehicle is gorgeous and you won't see other examples of yourself everywhere you go. The relative exclusivity of the F-Pace was a selling point for me. There are a few negatives with this vehicle however. My biggest complaint is interior quality. My Prestige trim level was $55,000. Other vehicles in this price range far exceed the interior quality of the F-Pace. There is a great deal of hard plastic and I'm concerned about the quality of the leather, but time will tell. In addition, the standard infotainment system is slow to respond and I've had trouble changing channels on the Sirius/XM radio as it often gets locked on one channel. You actually have to turn the car off to reset this. Seriously?  If Jaguar addresses interior quality and the glitchy infotainment system, this vehicle would be unbeatable. My brother's Porsche Macan rides like a washing machine and is tiny compared to my F-Pace.  Overall, this is an incredible SUV.",4

The ""infotainment"" system is from 2009. or earlier. I have owned a lot of cars and never had one (including a Triumph) where the radio could not hold a station. Satellite and FM are both worthless. The dealer seems to think this is acceptable. More importantly, this is the only car I am aware of that allows you to type into the infotainment system while you drive to program the navigation system. You can not speak to the navigation system at all. Apparently this is a feature available in low end Jags but not in the most expensive cars. I got some nonsense about there being two levels of infotainment and I paid more for one that doesn't work. You can buy a car that performs for less money that has a working radio and navi system.2/18 Jaguar finally replaced the shark fin antenna and I have working Satellite radio. FM is still poor.

Recently while walking through a parking garage, my eye caught a very uniquely styled SUV.  I immediately walked over to it to investigate what was it?

I was able to research and compare this car to other competitive models.  Here is what I found.  It is the widest of all SUV's in this category.  The F Pace - ""S"" model has that European interior styling in red and black - with red stitching accenting it's curves; very sharp and appealing.

The Jag's super charged 3.0 6 cyl. 380 HP engine is fabulous and just as fast - however the Challenger is a 6 sp. manual shift for the thrill seeker in me!  (Female - 63 years old!)  The transmission shifts smooth and seamless, unlike my 2014 Cherokee that had a  8 spd. choppy transmission (replaced after 2 years - a known problem with this model year).  ""Highly responsive"" is the way I would describe not only the acceleration but the steering, rode handling, and breaking system in this Jaguar, SUV.  I have encouraged my family members to drive it and give me their critique - all agree - it is: #1 FAST, #2 Very Responsive,  #3 Comfortable,  #4 Smooth ride.    A few reviewers have commented on the placement of the power window buttons, I really don't mind that they are located on the window ledge.  I tend to drive with my left arm on the ledge anyway.  Yes, the 16.6 gallon gas tank could be bigger.  It takes premium gas, not a deal breaker to me as the Challenger does too.  I wish the gas cap was a locking one, instead of spring loaded.  (Hopefully the days of putting sugar in someones gas tank are a thing of the past).  The touch screen is easy to navigate with only one caveat; changing the radio stations from either the steering wheel or the touch screen results in a 2-3 second delay.  In other words, it doesn't immediately switch to another radio station at first touch.  When using the voice command option whether the turn by turn navigation, or voice activated call system- it results in hearing a soothing women's voice, unlike Alexa and Siri.  The navigation system is accurate and easy to use once you adapt to it.  The interior luminescent night lighting is sharp!  The rear camera feature that can be viewed with just a touch of a button at any time, even when the car is in motion - is awesome.  Speaking of the backup camera - it provides a wide view that is extremely clear - seemingly HD quality.  A few things could be improved upon in my opinion; I don't like the position location of the volume/channel control adjacent to the vehicle information section positioned on the left side of the steering wheel.  For some reason when changing the radio station from that location, I end up hitting the middle ""OK"" button which sends you into a menu of car information, such as the lane departure settings, or front collision settings.  I find it a little annoying.   It seems that car manufacturers are compelled to be eco efficient.  When stopped at a light, with your foot on the brake, the car engine shuts off.  Once you lift your foot from the brake the engine restarts immediately.  This takes some getting used to, but the good news is, you can turn it off with a touch of a button, anytime.  I love having the option to turn something off.  There are 3 modes in which to drive this car in; eco (highway, rode trip mode), normal, and sport.  There are some differences when switching from normal to sport - but honestly, this car is so fast in normal mode - I personally don't feel the sport mode is necessary.  If I need anymore speed under my foot, I just switch to my Challenger - 6 spd Manual - Hemi, for that thrill ride ""fix.""   My major dilemma with this car is whether or not I buy it after the 3 year lease is up.  I love it so much, I can't imagine turning it in.  I have never leased a car before.  I never thought I could afford to drive a Jag!  By comparison, a fully loaded Ford Explorer, Lexus, Volvo XC 90, Lincoln MKC, or Lexus - all fall into the range of what this car costs. (65K - fully loaded ""S"" model).  IF you do the research and read the reviews you will hear the common theme, this car out performs the Mercedes, BMW, Porsche, or Lexus, SUV's.  I HIGHLY recommend the Jaguar - F Pace - you won't be sorry!  One last important detail:  The Warranty is the best of all - 6yrs/60K.",5

So far nothing but disappointments, problems, poor craftsmanship and malfunctions. Not kidding in first week it was back in the body shop to try and correct the non inertial engine hood closing... About 1/2 inch on one side and 1/8-1/4 on the other. Then the electronics just don't work consistently... And you must restart the engine to reset! Crazy! Poorly designed and particularly cheap finishes on interior with razor sharp edges in door handle assembly...  Window sills scratch just by looking at them... And now the latest... The entire sunroof and screen mechanizum is defective - Jammed the roof on an angle and broke the track to both on BOTH sides! Where is the quality... The driver seat jolts back about an 1/8 of an inch with every acceleration! And that same seat is hard as a rock and good for maybe 10 min drive before the siatica sets in...  All the fou fou add owns like the bottom door trim is again of cheap quality and an invitation to collecting road grim and water which we all know Jaguars just love.... Remember when they used to rust in the folder?! All in all it looks good and actually drives pretty well although I don't recommend the 22"" rims for everyday driving... Unless jaguar provides a masseuse for afterwards..  Personally I am disappointed and want to rid myself of it.. Don't expect that will be easy as even the dealers don't want them back... After all they have hundreds in inventory - not selling now the words out?",2
647, on 02/24/17 21:07 PM (PST),Retired grandma ,2017 Jaguar F-PACE SUV 35t 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),My new baby," I got my love of cars from my father and keep up with the new models.  I am a female and my husband hates salesmen so I typically test drive by myself.  I have had the new F-Pace in my sights for a while and test drove it and bought it the next day.  I have a heavy foot and have owned a 71 Mercury XR7, 84 Dodge Daytona Turbo, 2000 Mercedes E 430, 2008 Lincoln Navigator and now the Jaguar.  I test drove both the diesel and the 3.V-6 Cvl.  The diesel was a little more than I wanted to spend so I opted for the gasoline engine and I love it!  For some reason the sport mode feels better on the streets in my neighborhood and it purrs on the highway.  I bought the white with black wheels.  The wheels are growing on me but I wanted chrome, which was not offered and the salesman stressed that no wheel swapping was allowed.  The standard wheels looked dull and bland to me. I may switch them out after a couple of years.  I want to see how the long the black holds up. We are tall people and have plenty of room up front.  All I want in a new car is leather seats, a sun roof, satellite radio and some get up and go! I like just about everything about the suv but there are a few things that I feel should have been included on a $50,000 plus vehicle.  1. Why isn't back up sensors standard.  I have the camera but it us useless without the alert from a sensor. 2. The 12 V power socket that located inside the center compartment is useless unless you leave your phone inside the thing. My phone won't fit because I have something else there, no space, and the lid won't close over the cord.  I have to use the rear seat plug.  I do love that the electronics are easy to operate.  I used the remote start twice and it worked fine.  I have only had the car one week.  I am still getting use to all the gadgets and trying to figure out what all I have.  The quick start guide is great and helpful although I have yet to figure out why the car sometimes turns off when I place it in park.  I will make an appointment for someone to come out and go over it all in a few weeks as they offer this as a perk.  I am keeping a running list of questions because they are some options that I can't figure out if I have or not.  Overall, I love the F-Pace.  I wish I could have afforded the Sport  but I am very satisfied.  I have only seen one other F-Pace on the road.  The car gets plenty of looks and I have had people ask me what I am driving.  Love, love it!",5
648, on 01/24/17 06:42 AM (PST),Ed ,2017 Jaguar F-PACE SUV 35t Prestige 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Fantastic car," I traded in my 2008 BMW X5 (owned for 8.5 years). I was very skeptical and nervous about getting into Jaguar due to brand reliability history. However, upon reading more and more about the company and after 2 test drives I realized that this is the only SUV I want! (test drove other models: BMW X3, X5, Audi Q7, Lexus RX, MB GLE).  I am not a lease guy, and with 5 year warranty and scheduled maintenance this was a no brainer for me. The car is great overall.  Being that it's brand new, there are some minor issues: the door speaker makes crackling/resonating sounds only when using the phone (playing radio/ipod is not affected - weird!); second issue is driver seat - recently started making clicking sound when I move around in the seat as something is loose; bluetooth connections sometimes doesn't connect your phone to the car automatically, requiring you to select it manually on the screen.  So far used navigation only once and it gave me a super weird route: took me to the highway they told me to get off and used streets only to get back to the same highway one exit later! ( there was no traffic on highway, so it wasn't done to save time). I was advised from the dealer to download an app for navigation and use it while you connect your phone to car via usb. This way you can have much better navigator on the screen of your car.  One more dissapointment is that there is no CD player in standard tech set, only if you chose to upgrade to Technology package for over 3K.  I specifically didn't want to do that due to fear of glitches in dashboard instrument panel, which is entirely digital in the upgraded options. I also wish that the tank size was 2-3 gallons larger.  Overall the car is great!",5

650, on 12/30/16 23:46 PM (PST),JagFPace17 ,2017 Jaguar F-PACE SUV 35t Premium 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),Sports Car in Jaguar Cat's Clothing...," I was pretty excited at the opportunity to borrow the new F-Pace and managed to log nearly 700 miles in varying road conditions while in my possession for the week. The first thought that came to mind as I initially stepped on the throttle was ""Wow, this is a sports car in Jaguar SUV form!"". The frame/body feels extremely rigid and solid, the grip of the wheels is beyond confidence inspiring and feels firmly planted w/no signs of slip even when making very quick tight turns on damp roads, and the same F-Type engine aggressively launches this performance SUV especially in Dynamic Mode. Gas mileage is excellent for this amount of power in an SUV (23+ mpg in mixed driving). The new generation infotainment system is thankfully much improved, quick, and easy to use and there's tons of room for passengers and cargo alike.Now the minor gripes I can point to, and there are a few, include the rotary gear shift dial is very imprecise and just a poor overall design for shifting to exact gears as it's easy to rotate and overshoot to an unintended gear (R or P). The window controls on the door are oddly and annoyingly switched w/the seat memory controls? The gas tank is small and should ideally hold at least 2 more gallons for long road trips. There's some bit of hard plastic in the Premium model. The most annoying and awkward thing, and I'm not a big person, for some reason no matter how I adjusted the seat or entry, I always had to crane my neck to avoid hitting the top of the roof when entering the vehicle?The following is subjective but overall I generally like the exterior/interior design and finish of my Audi Q5 2.0 T more. Though the Q5 feels more like a quiet luxury SUV, performance-wise the F-Pace makes my Q5 seem like a 'grandpa mobile'! If you consider the minor gripes trivial and you really enjoy performance in your vehicles, Jaguar has successfully produced an SUV to more than compete w/other high performance SUVs along w/the added excitement, style, and drama of a Jaguar!",5

Having driven other performance vehicles, it is truly a sports car in an SUV body. It accelerates incredibly well, handles well on narrow terrains, and the back seats are roomy enough for two six footers in my house. The grunt it lets out on acceleration is absolutely priceless. No mechanical issues so far. A few minor concerns: I am not quite six feet tall but my knee hits the rear door opener sometimes when I enter the car. I am learning to adjust but this has happened a few times. Once seated in the car, my right knee rubs against a bulging trim on the side of the gear compartment. That will give you a bruise on long commutes if you rest on it like i do. As you would expect in most performance cars the suspension is pretty tight, which means you are not pampered on rough surfaces. Otherwise, please test drive other potential competitors before you drive this car. My experience is that there is only one other PERFORMANCE SUV class out there - Porche Macan and Cayenne.",5

The SUV's we have owned include MB ML, BMW X5 and X3 and drove this one - wow!  Good looking. Nice engine, good interior -albeit a bit off perfect ergonomics (the window button is where??  No lumbar unless you get the prestige.  Moon roof has small opening in huge glass).  Specked out a Premium and Prestige to $53k and $59k, not far off some X3's we specked out (within a few hundred $).  X3 lease $600-650.  Jag was $800-925. Seriously?  Not even in the same league!  The money factor is similar, but get this:  the residual value on the BMW is 58-60% and the Jag is 46-52%.",4
654, on 11/15/16 09:21 AM (PST),Val Santana ,2017 Jaguar F-PACE SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),So happy I could purrrrr.," I highly recommend it.  Drives like a car, but higher off the ground.  As of this review, I've owned it for 3 months and 3K miles.  Favorite features:  Remote start & climate via phone app, ventilated/cooled seats, lane keep assist, cavernous trunk, auto-high beams.   Things I hate about it:  Auto start/stop engine is so annoying!  Yes, there's a button to disable it, but it should stay disabled until you enable it manually!  The nav system is straight from 2006, and  the climate control is big f'ing mess of buttons.  Such a hassle to use, especially if you live in a place with large temperature swings.  Want to go from 60F to 77F?  You'll have to press that temp button 17 times!  It would've been better to use knobs like in the XJ or F-Type.    Also, for your inconvenience, there's no ""off"" button for the climate on the console.  Nope - you'll have to use the touch screen to navigate to ""Climate"", where there's an ""on/off"" button.  Genius.  The Tailgate doesn't always work properly.  Sometimes it won't open at all when I use the gesture kick, and sometimes it won't close when I push the button on the tailgate, beeping the horn twice.   I'm also not very happy with the noise from the engine.  It makes an unpleasant thrum when driving at low rpm, and doesn't sound anything like an F-type S at high rpm.  Lastly, there's a creaking sound coming from the rear of the car.  At this price range, it's just unacceptable.  Other than these snags, I love it.",4

Just took delivery of it!!," The Sapphire Blue is beautiful with the all Black trim and Black large rims. Looks amazing and handles better than my 300ZX TT. The technology is also amazing and user friendly. Best features is that the phone voice and microphone are clear and extremely user friendly. The seats, sunroof, trim, mirrors all work naturally in sync and are extremely well done. It's beauty, Sexy, FAST, Handles amazingly well, extremely intelligent and well coordinated. It's the lighted logos, lights, sync of turning the car off and having the car light up and accent the different driving modes. There so much that I love about this car it's truly been exceeding my expectations every day. The extra features such as the G-Meter are fun for my as a Navy Carrier pilot, being able to change the displays like a commercial pilot are super fun and it simply just feels good to drive. EVERYTHING is well built and user friendly and ergonomic. This is truly a revolutionary product. It's a sportscar built to look like an stylish SUV, but also has the added features that exceed Mercedes Luxury cars. It's not just the features that make this car special, it's that they work well together and look good as well. Everything is classy as well as built like a race car. It's raw power, braking and suspension and steering are exciting as well as tame when you want them to be. The Eco feature also enables me to get 25mpg easily during CITY driving, or 12 racing!!

I LOVED the stereo and the ride; the Jag is better at both levels.  I also currently own a 2013 BMW 335XI and I love it.  However, I'm bored with it compared to this Jag.  My wife and I have had the F-Pace for seven weeks and it gets better everyday.  In sport mode it is super aggressive and incredibly responsive.  In standard driving mode it glides along the interstate.  A recent trip to the Gulf from Nashville was nothing short of fantastic.  The front seats are superior to both the Mercedes and the BMW.  The cabin is very quiet with very little wind noise.  This beast will get you in trouble fast-----at 2500 RPM I found us sailing along at 91 MPH (didn't mean to).  I can't get enough of this vehicle; the sound system is superior to anything I've heard; lots of bass and crystal clear mid and high ranges.  I love streaming music from my phone with the easy BlueTooth pairing.  I found myself buying music just to test the bass.  Ours is British Racing Green in color and it is beautiful.  While the cargo space seems a little tight it was more than adequate to stow our luggage as well as my daughter's and her two little girls.  Now, I crave driving it and wonder about the Jaguar sedans----if they're this good then I just might have to get one in pace of the BMW!",5

I have averaged 1058 miles a month and have a much better feel for handling on various road surfaces. It performed extremely well on snowy and icy road surfaces and consistently responds well on the highway. It's almost as easy to maneuver as a small car. I know the grunt it lets out is a little loud for some but it's got the power to match it; think BMW M5. You turn the engine on and the ground trembles. Step on it accidentally in traffic and you will tremble. I did discover that the reason my ezpass device doesn't work is the metal in the windscreen.

The Germans are much more relaxing to drive. The Jag is far more engaging,  with much quicker reflexes and a bit harsher ride (again this is the First Edition with 22 "" tires). So far all is great, the Brembo brakes are superb, the interior is gorgeous,  from the outside,  this car looks like nothing else on the road available today, and all the gadgetry that comes with the First Edition is easy to learn, override and live with.

XE lacked room for a average height personality both in front and in the rear seating and also the head room. But F-Pace though comes under a crossover(SUV) class still surprised me with the new content jaguar had induced into F Pace. I am an employee with average salary between 60K-75K. I have always been planning to own a jaguar as i am towards the style and performance of Jaguars outcome. First thing on my mind would this be a proper investment for me ? is it really worth the money? Can i maintain ? How about resale ? Well the answer is Yes, it is worth it a 101% surely for people who needed an spacious car providing luxury of an world class luxury brand and along with the power and performance. My suggestion is to go for a v6 340hp which balances the value for you put in. I have currently owned a new Jaguar F Pace prestige 35t Ebony Black. 1 week old from now. the moment you drive it out from the showroom it puts a smile on your face and doesnt stop surprising you. Jaguar has done an excellent job at the steering functionality, adaptive dynamics is solely for the riders who can get the most out of the jaguar f pace using all the combinations. Only thing that currently concerns me is the mileage which is around 12 mpg in city and around 17-20 mpg on highways.  Hoping during the course of use of 2-3 months the mileage might increase depending on the the driving style adaptation. Apart form these F-Pace is really an awesome ride filled with attitude and masculine attire without compromising on the style and performance. I am really satisfied with the car. Current booking and delivery dates are around 3 months from the booking dates, may get one earlier that the date expected if you are lucky enough to find a cancelled order of someone.",5

669, on 06/12/16 17:24 PM (PDT),James ,2017 Jaguar F-PACE SUV S 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),An amazing experience so far," Ah, the Jaguar F-Pace... An SUV about 10 years to late. But, better late than never. The F-Pace is an amazingly attractive car and that is what attracted me at first, then they told me about the Elite Maintenance Program (5 Years no cost maintenance) then the fact that the average invoice for a Jaguar hovers on average around $4,000 dollars. The 380 hp V6 equipped on the S trim is much more power than the average F-Pace driver will need, but does come in handy for short passing roads and highway merging etc. Gas mileage is of some concern especially because the fuel tank can only hold 16.6 gallons of gas. A 4,000 pound SUV with a combined average of 20mpg should be equipped with at least a 17.4 gallon gas tank. Again Im sure Jaguar engineers have a reason for such a small gas tank but I wish they would have made it a bit larger. The In Control Touch Pro infotainment system is amazing based solely on it being a touch screen (I do not believe Mercedes, BMW, Lexus or any other luxury brand comes equipped with touch screens anymore). The Brakes don't seem as powerful as they should be but I still have confidence in them. Overall the F-Pace has been an amazing car so far and has definitely gathered some looks especially when I select neutral and push the gas down and everyone hears the engine pop. Definitely worth a look.",4

Test drove one at Jag Dealer in Richmond VA and confirmed that I would buy.  I wanted a specific color and list of options.  Dealer offered to order but decided to see what was available in US. Dealer located 4 in US with my specs and he spent a week negotiating with another dealer to trade. I have only 294 miles so honeymoon not over but so far car is everything I expected and more.

This R-Sport 2.0d has good looks, great torque, fun to drive and awesome gas mileage - 37 mpg in the city. I have not taken it on the highway yet, so I cannot comment on the highway mpg but I am sure it will be in the 40s mpg. The only issue I have with this good looking, nicely designed vehicle is RELIABILITY!! I have owned this vehicle for 2 months and I have already been to the dealership twice for repairs. I had a check engine light 1 month after I got this vehicle with odometer reading of only 560 miles. I took it to the dealership for the CEL warning to be reset. My understanding is that, they could not identify the cause of the problem, so I am not sure if the CEL is not going to appear again soon. At 930 miles, my A/C went out and will not cool, it just blew warm air from outside even though the computer indicated that the system is cooling. I again went in for service and the computer was reset and the A/C started working. Again, the source of the problem was not identified. The A/C has never functioned 100% since I received the vehicle, it will occasionally blow hot air for about 5 -10 seconds in the cooling mode. The service manage advised that I should still bring in the vehicle and leave it with them for a couples of days for them to properly fix the A/C problem. I like the JLR brand but I don't think I will be buying another Jaguar next time, unless if the reliability is significantly improved. For the Jaguar engineering team, I will say Good Looks alone will not make you sell more of these vehicles, you will have to drastically improve on the RELIABILITY. I saw a table of 2017 vehicles and their reliabilities and the Jaguar brand was almost close to the bottom of the list. JLR needs to hire some engineers from KIA to show them how to build reliable vehicles and with the good looks designs, JLR will then be a top class car manufacturing company.",3

I have driven SUVs the past 15 years.  An AWD sedan was at the top of the list for fuel economy and performance.  The FPace stumbled across my research.

679, on 11/30/16 10:21 AM (PST),Rick from Montreal ,2017 Jaguar F-PACE Diesel 20d 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbodiesel 8A),20 D -180 hp much better than you think, we are from Montreal Canada and bought our 20D -R Sport about 3 weeks ago and made our usual drive from Montreal to Phoenix  Arizona to stay the winter home. Having to order this SUV without driving the 20D was a bit scary after test driving the 35T--I thought the 180 HP would be underpowered --noisy and lack acceleration especially uphill. Wow--was I ever surprised with my very first diesel. The torque really does all the work effortlessly. It's plenty fast enough. Driving at speeds of 75-82 mpg---with 600 lbs of luggage in the back for 10-14 hours a day--we were getting 35-41mpg--pretty awesome. One time passing a car at 75 mpg the excelartion was so good that in a matter of seconds I was at 96mpg. Coming from Montreal where gas prices are between $4-5/ Gallon--the gas mileage was a factor in buying this car. I have been a Lexus RX and NX SUV owner for 17 years and needed a change-they were getting a little boring and their Navigation is so bad I carried a Garmin at all times--it would take me either the wrong way or out of my way many times--The Jag Navigation system was awesome and even told you to prepare to exit to the right or left --in 2 miles--giving you plenty of time to get in the proper lane--never missed an exit or panicked to get over quickly to exit. The Seats are so comfortable I would say they are equal to the Lexus RX and superior to the smaller NX--NEVER got a sore back or butt even after being in the car for 14 hours. The 14 ways adjustable seats are worth the option. The car handles flawlessly and you feel like you are driving the car with all 4 PAWS on the road--not driving a car that is on top of 4 wheels. I have seen and read almost every review on this car and the few little complaints that came up are non-issues--the window controls are up on top---not an issue--how often do you roll down your windows?? And it would spoil the design of the inside doors--then they would look like every other car.--The Standard Navigation is great  and easy to use--no need to upgrade there. Plus my wife can use it and look for things while we drive where Lexus and many others block you out--(again the need for a Garmin in my Lexus so you don't have to stop) Base stereo at 380 watts is awesome--you don't need 825 watts. Some said the interior plastics looked cheap--I did not see any difference from Jag and the Lexus that would matter--if so--you cant see them anyway-Haven't tried the voice command yet--but I gave up trying with all my Lexus SUV'S --I have 5 of them over the years and none worked.  The driving position is fantastic--you can see the front and sides of the car--this is the only SUV my wife can drive where she can actually see the front and sides--other SUV's--all she saw was glass out the front which makes it more difficult to judge distances when turning or parking.The 20D is very quiet and after driving Lexus for 17 years with quiet and comfort--you do want that in a Luxury car--so I prefer the 20d over the 35T--which is pretty noisy due to its extra power and exhaust system--it does sound sporty and is faster--but if you drive like that you will pay at the pumps and probably get a few extra tickets as well--we don't drive cars like that in the real world anyway---if you do--try the 20D is Dynamic Sports mode--it gives you plenty of pick up and a sporty drive. I do hope this car is as reliable as Lexus was to me--in 17 years and 5 different SUV's with Lexus--I went to the dealer only Once--for a rattle in the roof---that's why I kept buying them---just couldn't put up with their Navigation system with the Mouse and Finger pad---actually was pretty dangerous to use while driving for anything as it controlled stereo and other things---Touch System is the Jaguar I so much easier and faster-- at least your passenger can use it so you can keep your eyes on the road.   Great job Jaguar---if it's as reliable as I am used to--I will be a customer for a long time.--,5

Right in the middle of the Macan and Cayenne and X3 and X5 which for me was the sweet spot. I regularly tow a 6x12' trailer loaded to about 4000 lbs with this and it has no problems stopping or going whatsoever. I even towed it up a wet grass/mud hill while loaded and I don't even think a single tire slipped. You can nail it full throttle in the rain and it doesn't spin, it just goes like hell. The AWD on this SUV is phenomenal. Is the mileage great, no, but for the power and size of this vehicle there is nothing better out there unless you want to spend $100k on a Model X and have the trim fall off. Since buying this I have duplicated all of it's rational capabilities with other vehicles and it makes no sense for me to keep making payments on it, but I love it too much to get rid of it. It is a great combination of sport, utility and luxury that I feel is just too good to part with. I've had one issue, it wouldn't eject a cd, and the dealership replaced the unit for free, although I've never played another cd since then.",5

Heated and cooled leather seats welcome you.  After a day of driving you feel relaxed and ready to drive some more. This car is a dream to drive.  The full panoramic sun roof is awesome. The car has great visibility and virtual no blind spots. Jaguar uses the meridian sound system that I think  blows away the competition. The navigation system is easy to use and very intuitive.

Smooth until you hit a pothole or uneven pavement, then the impact is harsh enough to knock the fillings out of your teeth. Yes, it's that abrupt and harsh. Very noticeable.

Drove interstate speeds for a long distance and averaged 30mpg in eco mode.  At in town speeds, I sometimes opt for the paddle shifters as the car does hunt for the proper gear on inclines.  The turbo inline 2.0 4 cylinder has not disappointed us in performance and the handling is definitely Jaguar sedan type.  Acceleration is VERY responsive.  The seats hold you firmly on sharp turns and the vehicle holds the road like a sports sedan.  All the cargo room you'd ever want and, while we probably differ from other SUV owners, we like to feel the road and there is just enough with the F-Pace with the 19"" wheels to realize you are on a road and not sitting in your living room on cushy couch.  For us, the amenities and electronics are not distracting and very functional.  We did purchase a set of Worth floor mats to protect the carpeting as we intend on keeping the vehicle for quite awhile and they are well worth the $200.  Jury is still out on cost of ownership but the factory warranty, while not great, is very adequate.  Have had the vehicle less than 30 days and most categories in the rating scheme are N/A at this time.06/05/18...  A few too many little things that don't work as they should (especially for the price you pay) with technology, climate control, remote start app, door locks.  We have found that it's to our benefit to let the engine warm in the winter as you really get turbo lag if you don't.The auto did perform really well on an extended trip and the ride was, in our opinion, more comfortable than a Toyota 4Runner.

Absolutely no technical issues till this day. Vehicle made in Great Britain, engine Great Britain, transmission from Germany. We are in early 40’s, in the garage we also have the 2016 Lexus RX350 made in Canada, and also no majors problems with this vehicle. Wife prefers RX350 because of roomier interior, quieter and softer ride, more luxurious interior feel, high end materials, brave exterior design, best LED headlights in the industry, overall: “women’s car”. l did notice about 80% women are RX’s drivers.I also liked RX350, but absolutely love the F-Pace. Best driving vehicle I have ever owned, pure pleasure on the turns. In my opinion best looking in the segment, handles like a sport sedan due to torque vectoring and sport suspension. Accelerates like another brand's gas V6’s due to turbo charger, and very high torque 318 ft. lbs. Absolutely great all weather performance due to standard Land Rover’s AWD technology (rear axle based!!). Very sensitive steering wheel specially in Sport mode – this vehicle really listens to you and you fully feel the car (Swiss precision). Great navigation system, many great features from 5 year free Jaguar Remote App, panoramic glass roof, large trunk. And absolute segment leader (including Hybrids) 32 mpg city, 38 mpg highway. Very cool movable gear selector knob, and the main thing: British prestige.Yes, there are small issues I did notice: interior should have more high quality (remember, mine is base model...), auto start/stop don’t remember your preferences after engine restart, not too roomie and no reclining rear seats (mine is base...maybe because this is sport not family car),  rear and side visibility not to good, and weak base headlights (mine are not LED), mediocre base sound system, unpainted cheep plastic door handle inside, not very pleasant interior smell (mine is artificial leather, maybe that’s why). Quick conclusion: This vehicle is designed for people who enjoying driving, not for family soft and luxury cruising. It has legendary Land Rover off road roots, and the famous handling from Jaguar's long motor sport history. If you are bored of German or Japanese luxury cars, looking for something not thirsty, unique and prestige, handsome and fresh, sporty performing, handling, steering and accelerating, 5 years free maintenance and 5 years b2b warranty, F-Pace 2.0 Diesel is definitely for you. If you have a family, or looking for softer, quieter and luxurious ride, buy RX350. But please remember one thing: on winding roads driving super comfy RX350 you will be slower at least 30 mph.  And last interesting info I just learned about how “boutique” this brand is: Jaguar sold in the whole USA the same amount of cars as BMW sold just in the Chicagoland in the same period of time. Would you like to drive something unique? Thanks for reading, and good luck with your decision!",5

Otherwise, I bought in September from a dealer that was closed most of the month due top hurricanes, so I got the best deal of my life.  I have to watch it like a hawk, because my wife want to drive it and more than once she got out of the house before I did and it was gone, gone, gone.  Its just that much fun to drive and the styling is the best Jaguar has done since the E-Type.  So far, everything works, no problems with reliability.  Not really impressed with the 9 speaker audio system, it kind of rattles, but who cares, turn on the by-pass for the mufflers and music is made the natural way - with a big powerful supercharged V-8.",5

He is racing ahead, then holding back, then right next to me. At a traffic light, he pulls up next to me and rolls down his window. He apologizes for making an idiot of himself with the photos, but just wants me to know that when he gets home, he is posting the pictures of my car on his Facebook site with the intended caption stating that 'this is my dream car"". That is what it is like to drive a Jaguar F-Type. Oh, and did I mention it has a manual transmission? The color, the wheels, the styling, the butterly smooth action and positive engagement of the clutch and stick...I could go on and on...

Each time you get in the car, you feel like the Pilot of an F15 Fighter Jet.  Putting the car into Dynamic Mode when entering a highway sounds like a Jet taking off with Active Sport Exhaust on. AWD really enables the car to perform at a high level on wet roads.  This is a smart car with Vision package, a little car symbol on the corner of your mirrors lights up when another car is in the nearby lane (prevents any missed blindspots by the driver).  The car has automatic  rain sensors and puts the wipers on at the appropriate speed of the rainfall.  It also has Auto headlights. The car will activate the high beams when needed and senses oncoming traffic from a good distance and shuts them off until the car passes and they are immediate turned back on. Very impressive. Not to mention, this is a very unique car with very few on the road. You will get many, many looks of awe and wonder. People will approach you and want to talk about the car.",5

Rather than that spend our time calling and leaving messages to various people at Jaguar NA and the dealer to check on repair status with no success whatsoever. The car is on its 5th visit to the dealer's service department and every visit is for more than a week. we leased the car less than 4 months ago and it's been nothing but problems. Water leaks, strange smells, check engine light on all the time, reduced performance issues, malfunctioned gas pedal. You can tell they invested the money in making the car look good but underneath that pretty skin it is a terrible turd.

Especially in V8 configuration, you get Corvette-like performance but with classier styling over the track-focused Corvette and more exclusivity over the other usual offerings from Porsche or BMW with similar performance. The F-Type is downright gorgeous with high quality fit and finish. Its 8-speed auto transmission is fast shifting and fun to drive aggressively (you really won't miss a manual) but the real fun is in the sound; everyone who rides with you will be smiling as much as you! Performance is near supercar status (in V8 guise) with the supercharged 5.0L engine rocketing to 0-60 at just under 4 seconds and a top speed north of 180 mph. The V8S RWD is tail-happy so you do have to make sure you are paying attention coming into high speed corners (newer versions like the AWD R help alleviate some of this). Steering response is smooth and immediate. Despite its performance focused suspension, the car still provides a relatively comfortable ride and getting to speed is just plain fun depending on how you want to drive it; think of the F-Type as a cross between a European-muscle car and GT cruiser. Electronics (especially the infotainment system) lags a little behind newer offerings but then I didn't buy the vehicle for infotainment; the real entertainment is in the driving experience as a whole back by the wonderful exhaust symphony. And, if you're patient, low mileage versions can be found at moderate prices (although that is relative too considering sticker prices are typically near or above six figures for a new one with the V8). If you can, find one with the Performance Pack (better seats, 20-inch wheels, bigger brakes with red calipers, etc.) and Vision Pack with Blind Spot Monitoring (to help with cross traffic, parking, and backing up since visibility over and around the car’s sumptuous curves is limited) along with other packs/upgrades that enhance the ownership, driving experience, and resale value. While long term reliability seems to be much improved offer previous Jaguar offerings, the F-Type is still relatively new so I also recommend investing in an extended warranty that can be purchased from your Jaguar dealership.",5

Two weeks ago I flew from Michigan to South Carolina to pick up my brand new 2014  ( yes, I realize the 2016's are coming out very soon ) F-Type Jaguar convertible, V-6 S, in British Racing Green with dark brown leather with light stitching and a black top.  I fit like the car was tailor made just for me.  I can stretch out my left leg fully, the seat holds but does not dig in ( Porsche ), my line of sight is in the middle of the windshield, not at the upper support bar ( Corvette ).  I drove a V-8 S several months ago and fell in love with the car but as hard as it is for a car guy to say, it was too powerful to be fun.  My car can be driven with some gusto and I can enjoy the amazing exhaust sounds without hitting crazy speeds and likely going to jail.  The middle choice in the lineup was the perfect car for me.  Amazing lines, rare color,outstanding build quality and well thought out driving position and dash layout.   Drove my new ""Kitty"" home (830 miles) straight through and I could not get the big smile off my suntanned face.  Got 29.2 mpg if that matters to any potential buyers running 75 to 85 mph.  It took me a long time to finally decide on my special car.  Spending this kind of money should make you think twice. I sometimes call this my anti-Tesla.  There is a great mix of sophisticated aides and functions but enough great old school DNA to make me think that these kinds of cars may not be build forever in an electric, Google computer driver future.   I feel that Jaguar has built a car that will still put a big smile on my face 20 years from now when I press the orange start button and this car roars to life.   You will want to keep the sport exhaust turned ""off"" until you are out of  your neighborhood, trust me.  The trunk is ""soft side"" overnight bags small but this is a weekend or special use car for most owners and the way the lines of the car work so well together I promise you will not care about the small trunk.  Design over function is ""OK"" sometimes.  Could not be happier with my purchase. Note: perhaps in some areas of the country these cars are more plentiful.  Where I live they are ""Blue Moon"" rare.  Be prepared for lot's of attention.A year later and no issues at all.  The more I drive my Jag the more that I appreciate the build quality, the design, and the way this car is sorted out.  We make wonderful drives along the back roads near Lake Michigan visiting the great small  harbor towns with the car and those types of roads are the cars favorite.  Top down driving is something that we thought we would like but actually love.  The sounds and smells along with fantastic views transform a normal ride into an adventure.  One small issue.  For the money a real spare tire should be included with each car sold.  The owner could then decide to carry it or not.  Never once have I thought that I had not purchased the right model F-Type.  The middle one is just so much fun to drive, so balanced, very powerful but in a more useable way than the crazy 8.",5

Perhaps like no other car out there. From 2016 onwards, with the AWD, the R became a car anyone can drive, even on slick roads. Cruising calmly on interstates, it gets upwards of 30 mpg for hours on end. But when provoked by the gas pedal, the R becomes loud, rude, and hilariously explosive.

I am the original owner of the car which was bought new in Greenville, SC. The car was bought back from me by the dealer because it has a defect that can't be fixed. In hot weather only, the dash makes a horrible creaking noise. In cool weather it is quiet. The dealer tried to fix the problem more than once, they even tried replacing the dash, finally they admitted they could not fix it. At that time, the plan was to replace the car. Long story short after six months of stall tactics and excuses, they would not replace the car without me having to spend in excess of $10,000.00. No thanks, I know better than to throw good money after bad. Since I had them dead to rights with a potential lemon law case, they agreed to buy the car back for the entire sales price.After I signed the papers, the sales manager admitted to me that they planned to resell the car as they weren't sure it had a defect. What??? Apparently they are going to claim amnesia when they sell this lemon to an unsuspecting buyer on a cool day when the defect is not evident. Sadly a used car buyer will not have the protection of the lemon law that I had. If you are thinking of buying this car be sure to drive it on a sunny hot day after it has been sitting outside, you will change your mind. If you have bought this car, please contact me (look on Facebook Jaguar F Type fans page for my post). I have the proof you need to get your money back.

Beautiful interior design and aesthetic layout of controls. My first Jag and everything was very intuitive and easy to learn. Very quick and super smooth gear shifts whether in automatic or using manual paddle shifters. Dynamic mode turns this from a civilized luxury sport car to a hilariously fun roaring ""beast"". Trunk space able to fit all road trip essentials including full size cooler and more. Once you find a good fit the sport seats provide excellent support and fits like a glove. Lovely safety features of the Vision Pack (e.g. blind spot monitor, rear camera, front and rear parking sensors, rear cross-traffic warning, etc.).

Exceptional VIP customer service from the dealership.Cons: Technology (e.g. GPS, electronic menu, blue-tooth, etc.) slow and from the stone ages.

Previous cars and trade in. Reasons why.So I have two Jaguar cars. Both 2016 models, one is a XF 35T, and another is an F Type S with automatic transmission and RWD. The cars are stunning on the outside when you compare them with just about anything on the road, south of $150K. As far as interiors go, the F Type I have is fully loaded with their sport seats and extended leather package. It smells great inside, like a leather factory, and the seats and sitting position is spot on for my 6.0’ height. The XF on the other hand has a very plain and unremarkable interior, and I have the version with the vinyl seats, which are horrible and feel like you are sitting on bubble wrap.The infotainment systems on both cars are really crappy when comparing with all major competitors, and even with Jeep or Nissan systems.For the XF we traded in a twelve year old E Class. That car had a more buttoned up interior and nicer overall trim but it was time for a change. BTW it had zero major issues outside of maintenance, some front end ball joints, a fuel tank sender and a brake module (this last one was an expensive repair).As far as the F Type, a 2013 5 Series was traded at 29K miles. That car was completely trouble free. Previous dealer experienceWhen serviced at BMW of Darien in CT, everything was covered, brake pads, tires, wiper blades. The infotainment in the BMW is LEAGUES ABOVE the Jaguar unit, although it was three years older.Mercedes Benz always provided a loaner on the spot, even when they were repairing a ten-year-old car. They really are on point, the dealer always followed up, and the in / out time when bringing in for service can be counted in minutes.Local Jaguar DealerThis local dealer has to be one of their worst dealers although that would be tough to flesh out. When they serviced the XF they left the engine cover just loosely thrown on top of the engine, not pinned down. When the tires got bubbles on the side walls at 12K miles, the dealer said it’s not covered, and the Jaguar Land Rover North America call center pretty much said the same thing, and said you’re on your own. Luckily Good Year the tire manufacturer that Jaguar chose as a supplier, gave us a small credit towards the purchase of three new tires. Now we have a car with one older tire, and the same brand and model installed that previously failed because of supposed pot holes. The same roads and pot holes were driven through by me in my previous Porsche 911 with 305 cross section Pirelli tires that never had a side wall issue.When I brought the f Type for service they said the free included oil change would not be covered this time. They wanted $190 for oil and filter (7 quarts synthetic and a filter).  They said I went over 30 days past the two year mark of the cars’ in service date of June 1st 2016. So, they did the oil change last year (Jaguar Land Rover Freeport) so they knew when the year was up. The car’s computer warned me two weeks ago, and the app on my phone (Jaguar In Control) did the same. We never received any emails or calls from either the dealer or Jaguar Land Rover that the service was due. I proceeded to make the call for service and was told to come in the following week on a Tuesday morning. They also said that no loaners were available but I can wait for 1.5 hours and they would service and wash the car. When I found out about the oil change fee, I refused that service, but mentioned some trim fitting problem in the interior. After waiting in their waiting room for 1.5 hours, they said that a seat would need to come out and they will schedule me to come back a different time. But to sit tight and the service advisor would return with a date and time. Thirty minutes later he returned with a receipt for $0 that also mentioned some 27 point courtesy inspection. No mention of what that entails, and the Jaguar Call Center could not verify either. So I waited two hours there and nothing was done. Not even the follow up appointment. The SERVICE advisor said call next week to get a date to come back, and pointed to my car and said –“ exit is that way”. When I got home I noticed that one of the wipers had broken pieces of rubber hanging out of it. Apparently the 27 point inspection does not include looking at the wiper blades.Selling at a lossI am so angry that all financial rationale is out the window at this point. All major losses on a new car happen the first year or two, and the F Type has 11K mikes on it  now. I was planning on keeping it until the warranty expires, but no way I am doing that now. Found a six month old Porsche 911 dealer demo with Certified Pre Owned. Much better dealer network and cars. They will probably kill me on this trade in, but in all honesty I can’t really blame them. A crap shoot when it comes to the quality or reliability of hat they are taking in when it comes to Jaguar",2
730, on 07/01/17 18:42 PM (PDT),Junk my Jag ,2016 Jaguar F-TYPE Convertible S 2dr Convertible (3.0L 6cyl S/C 6M),Extremely disappoited with the vehicle," I've had the car for 10 weeks and it's been in service for half that time. Yes, my new car has been at the service facility for five weeks....and counting! My problems started the first week I had the car; the engine stalled out at a red light and needed to be re-started, the trip odometer has more mileage than the overall vehicle mileage (Strange. Right?) and the vapor lock on the gas tank makes fueling an effort. Then the sbs system was faulty, as the air-bag light was continuously illuminated and the passenger seat became inoperable. Now the exhaust system does not work properly. Parts have been replaced, wiring checked and diagnosing the issues remain a mystery. The car is fun to drive, looks nice and drives well, but owning the vehicle is a hassle, an inconvenience and the worst new car experience of my life. If I could return it, I would. In fact, I want a refund and will gladly go back to my hassle-free Infiniti Q-60S or my Mercedes. Anything.",1
731, on 09/15/16 13:23 PM (PDT),B ,2016 Jaguar F-TYPE Convertible S 2dr Convertible (3.0L 6cyl S/C 6M),"Don't think twice, think three times BEFORE BUYING"," This is my third F-Type in two months. The first was a ""Certified"" 2014 auto ""S"" with 12k mi., the second was another ""Certified"" 2014 auto base with 40k mi., the third is a previously unregistered 2016 Jaguar executive car with a manual (an ""S"") with 5k miles.   Good:  all three look great. The acceleration with the autos is great...the manual less so.  Bad:  all three had/have defective fuel fillers, defective stereos, squeaks/chirps/rattles/buzzes.  (And the second one had a radiator hose rupture during the test drive...but I still bought it after it was fixed.)  The first two were each in the shop for a week just after purchase due to these KNOWN problems. The dealers admitted they knew there were service bulletins out for these problems, but stated that Jag won't pay them to fix these problems pre-delivery. Each was bought back.  Jag refuses to fix the defective stereos and told me it would void my warranty if I paid the $4k necessary to make it sound good.  No joke:  the $500 Fender stereo in VW's is light years better than the 770W Meridian system, which spews out muffled bass and tinny mids.  The bass is distorted in all of them. Try this:  compare bass at full with sub at zero and vice versa--not much volume from the one at full. Then, put one at full and add some volume from the other:  disproportionate volume increase and muddy distortion.  Then, put them both up high and send the sound to the back:  not much from the subs in back...except for gurgling distortion.  I thought the 2016 models had all of these problems fixed. I was wrong. Shame on me. The present car is a lease and the dealer won't unwind it because the car was never previously registered. I got an amazing lease:  a $96k sticker reduced by $25k, making a first month plus fees drive off with $762/mo. for 33 mo. with 15k mi./year thereafter.  But, if the stereo is so bad, the gas pumps shut off twenty times during fill-ups, and a buzzing erupts when the exhaust button is on loud and the accelerator is depressed between 2,650 rpm and 3,000 rpm, how good a deal is it??  I could go on and on....  Never again an F-Type. Never again a Jaguar.  Just buy a good used 911 and be done with it.",3
732, on 02/20/16 19:04 PM (PST),Mike Marshall ,1999 Jaguar XJ-Series Sedan XJ8 4dr Sedan,Stand out in the Crowd but get credit card ready!," If you can't afford to drive a $70K car then don't and this applies to used/older ones. I'm 55, a car nut since a kid and  buy cars based on looks but that can be expensive. If you want reliability you'll have to buy an ugly Japanese car but if you want something ""cool"" well this Red 1999 Jaguar XJ8 with chrome wheels is gorgeous BUT buy one from someone else who has already spent thousands of dollars on the many repairs that come with ""being cool"". I bought this car around 2012 from Orig owner with 61K miles in San Diego in show room condition but was APPALLED  to see all of the repair receipts from the original owner on a car with only 61K miles. The receipts totaled well over $12,000 and YES you will replace those plastic timing belt tensioners (orig. owner paid for that thankfully!) The only reason I bought this is because I'm retired so don't drive much and have only  put 5,000 miles on it and hoping for now more expensive repairs but have had one of the 8 expensive coils replaced, windshield wiper reservoir leaks, oil pan gasket just replaced, smog issue fixed. Potential head gasket leak as of now. Front shock blown. All that in Just the 5000 miles that I've driven it. SO on the positive side, it is a classic beautiful car, drives and handles like a Corvette, great power esp. when sport mode is set. Quiet and nice to drive, took it  up to 110 mph thru Camp Pendleton one night late with no traffic around and was quiet, felt safe, stable, solid and was very impressed. Interior is nice quality except cheap cup holders and no storage space. Tight back seat on this short wheel base model. If I bought one again I'd def. have gotten the XJR after seeing the almost 400Hp and foot lbs of torque and 0-60 in 5.2 seconds  (better than my former 1999 Mercedes S600 V-12 by a full second!) Those are even worse in reliability/repairs (NEVER touch a Mercedes built after 1991!)  So, like anything in life, ""you get  what you paid for"" and got a great buy at only $5000 BUT can see why these cars are so cheap because of terrible reliability but will enjoy occasionally driving it and it gets TONS of compliments from both old and young people as it really stands out on the road. Ford improved it in 1997 but would not recommend this car to anyone on a ""budget"" as ""it pay$ to be cool"" but for $5K in this mint condition I do love the car and I've owned 60+cars. Remember, if you buy...........look for orig owner WITH ALL REPAIR RECEIPTS AND MAKE SURE TENSIONERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED AS IT IS ""DNA"" DEFECT AND WILL COST YOU SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPAIR. The last receipt I got from the old guy/orig owner was for $4900 for misc stuff that should NOT break! **My mechanic says best to get a 2000+model as it works better with the newer computer analytic repair tools that mechanics use.  Also, helpful hint, if your message center comes up with ""Stability control/ABS"" not working, don't automatically assume you need the expensive main computer module, mechanic says each 4 wheels has a single monitor and even just one going out will give out this message BUT way cheaper to replace just the 1 or 2 individual wheel sensors VS main computer module which may NOT be the problem. Also just disconnecting the battery to ""reset"" it works often. As mentioned, electronic issues are one of the main problems on these cars. ON the good side, car saved my life when I swerved harder than I ever have to avoid a car of the freeway that cut out of bumper to bumper traffic right in front of me as I was going by at approx 50mph, this Jag handled like a ""go cart"" and handled beautifully and went right around that car with no squeeling, leaning, rolling over. IT DID EXACTLY WHAT MY EMERGENCY REFLECTS TOLD IT TO DO AND AVOIDED A HEAD ON COLLISION!! THANK YOU JAGUAR!!  (and I still look cool in it!!!) I get offers to buy this car often!",3
733, on 02/20/15 20:50 PM (PST),sansui ,1999 Jaguar XJ-Series Sedan XJ8 4dr Sedan,Love to drive it," I purchased my Jag in Sept and knew it had problems, but was going to take that in stride.  It had a bad ignition coil and when I got that fixed it purred like a kitten with a power meal.  I still have a couple of problems to take care of then it's off for some long drives. It drives like a luxury vehicle it is, and at 75 it just barely hums along the interstate.  It averaged 23 mph, which I thought was a little poor until I l read the specs.  I don't like the way the brake and gas pedal are so close to each other in that I can't get my right foot in between them while on cruise.  The seat sets a little bit low for me, in that I have to almost pull myself into the seat.  All said, I love it.Now, after more than three years, it is starting to show lots of stuff that are needing repaired.  I am thinking the previous owner(s) only had one thing in mind when they purchased it.  To drive and have fun.  I drove it to British Columbia, 3000 miles plus, having faith it would take me and bring me back.  One small problem came up, but with the help of a repair shop along the way, I made it.  It averaged 24 at interstate speed, and a little better on the highways.  I have replaced the seats, front and back, installed new speakers in the doors, put on Pirelli's, of which I love, and have bought some small items of which I think I can replace. Right now the sunroof went out on me, and along with that, the felt liner has become loose. Also, upon furhter inspection, I was told that the valve cover gasket's are leaking.  So, I have yet another problem. Or two.  I can't seem to find anyone that can tell me if the accessory lights in the luggage compartment are supposed to be there or if someone added them on later.  The lights are just dangling there, and they don't work.  So, as you can read, it's been a very frustrating time for me.  If I had known back then, what I know now, I would have spent that money into a sport, like an XKE.  Well, wish me luck in getting it back on the road...",3

What can I say? It's an absolute amazing car, just got in a wreck with a Jeep and held up like a champ, I felt completely safe and secure in that car and believe me the same can't be said for the Jeep. The car is a tank, I love it, it's peppy and fast and sexy on the inside. So happy with the results of my purchase. I'm sad that the car was hit, but she is being repaired by the best shop I know specializing in British imports. Love my car, she's the best. Never getting rid of her. ",5

Unfortunately financed it (separate issue altogether) and got plates about a week before the temps expired. 26 days later exactly on my Cousins wedding on my way to there a deer was hunting me and ran out in front and messed up the driver side fender and totaling it out. pretty much had a 26 day test drive on the vehicle since I got a check after the deductible and loan paid off lol.Gave me a taste of the big cats and my replacement is going to be another Jag this time paid for with CASH!

Unless you have plenty of money to put into it look elsewhere. You can bet you will need a new timing chain kit somewhere starting at 60,000. Poor, poor design on the chain and guides. This is an expensive fix!! Very!! Fixes...Power antenna (of course), driver seat power switch, rear view mirror, vacuum lines, brakes (warped rotors). The check engine light is always coming on, different problem each time. Transmission fluid is $65.00 a quart. No owner service. The car is good looking and very nice to drive, but the problems with it are horrible. There are a lot of nice looking cars out there...I would choose one of them!!",3.25

I was lucky enough to get a one owner, dealer serviced car that was owned by a single male. The back seat was never even sat in. The power is impressive for a 4,100 pound car, but the biggest surprise was the cornering ability and overall road feel of the car. This is not like my Cadillac of old which was a living room on wheels. This car lets you ""feel"" the driving experience. My friends always want to take my car, despite one owning a 5 series BMW and the other driving a convertible Mustang GT.

The best luxury vehicle I have driven - quiet, smooth & comfortable! I have owned few Cadillac & BMW cars in the past, this Jag is more reliable than either one. Not as fun to drive as BMW, but this VDP gives you a feeling of driving Rolls Royce with its elegance, comfort & smooth ride. 1998-2003 VDP models are the best, when Ford bought them - quality & reliability got worse! I personally would not buy any car new - but even 10 year old, with low miles & well taken care of - Vanden Plas is an awesome car!

The Jaguar dealership in Greenville, SC was a delight to deal with.  I now have 122,000 miles on it and am looking forward to more.

The leather on the driver's seat edge is a bit worn, needs re-dyeing, but that said, the car is gorgeous both outside and inside for such an older one. It drives dead silent at any speed like a Jaguar should. I was impressed by the great gas mileage for a car this large, 24 mpg. Lots of room in the rear as it is a long wheelbase ""L"" version, and I highly recommend buying this model over the standard sedan. It is fun to drive, very comfortable, and has that timeless Jaguar styling. Highly recommended for the money, you simply can't beat it.

My , how i lOVED  that car, always dependable, reliable , incredible gas mileage, comfortable , and so exclusive. But i always wanted a XJR, so i sold my XJ8 and bought my XJR, took me 2 years to find the Jaguar Racing Green / oatmeal interior combination with low miles . Wow, talk about power !!!!!!!! 0-60 in 5 seconds  and 13 second quarter miles times, back in 04 , that was pretty impressive  for a 4 door sedan, even now , that is pretty respectable for a 12 year old car. I want to choke people when they say that Jaguars are not dependable, they have been THE most dependable cars i have ever owned . Yes , i have owned BMW ( the Ultimate maintenance machine ) and Mercedes Benz, ( expensive to repair )  Just look at the reviews of Jaguar owners,  and see what they say about their cars.  I bought mine used with 70K miles, the only  problem was a part in the A/C unit, my mechanic fixed it with a Genuine jaguar part , that cost much less than an after market part. I take mine on long journeys, and get anywhere from 27-29 MPG at 75 MPH, and that is with a 400HP Supercharged V8. In town, typical mileage is 22MPG. Take care of your Jaguar, do the required maintenance , and your jaguar will take care of you for many years, with a wonderful driving experience.

757, on 11/30/15 07:52 AM (PST),Jim K ,2004 Jaguar XJ-Series XJR XJR 4dr Sedan (4.2L 8cyl S/C 6A),Nice Kitty," I have now owned my 2004 XJ8 for 9 years. It has proved to be a very satisfying car to drive and to own. The reliability so far has been excellent. I have presently approximately 90 K miles. I do not drive it in snow as it has very poor traction and I don't want to expose it to salted roads. The comfort on long trips is exemplary except that it is slightly cramped in comparison with other sedans of this level.  Trunk space is also limited-better than the older model but still fairly small.  The gas mileage on highway driving is very, very good.  The seats are very firm which means they are comfortable on long drives. I recently drove mine from New England to South Carolina (about 850 miles) and was impressed with the long haul comfort of this cat. Resale value is unfortunately pretty dismal but if you are buying one you can buy one cheap. They always turn heads with their classic looks. Update: the Kitty is still going strong now in 2016. No major repairs-just routine maintenance-brakes, tires, oil and scheduled adjustments. Update: 12/01/2016-the Cat is still going strong. The only repair since my last post was a blower fan for heat/AC. Reason: mice got in and made nest-and fan got ruined in the process. So still going strong and no reason to change my previous glowing review.",5

Friends thought I was crazy, that it was an old man’s car. So, I would just end up leasing a new BMW 5 Series every 3 years. I got so bored of the 5 and all the other new European sedans I'd see on the road here in LA. Finally, I said 'that's it!', when the next pristine 2004-2007 XJ comes up for sale locally I'm gonna jump on it and throw my 5 Series up on Swap-A-Lease. That day came in August of last year and found myself an 04 Vanden Plas with 41k miles on it. Paid a little over $13k for it. Just like most used cars, especially ones this old, you have to expect to do a little sorting in the beginning. I spent about $1500 in the first few months and it’s been smooth sailing ever since, just routine maintenance. The car is an absolute joy to drive. Quiet, comfortable, plush, luxurious but also light on its feet and handles amazingly well. I thought I would miss all the latest technology and convenience of a new car. I don't at all. Find an awesome independent mechanic that specializes in these cars. The dealers are way overpriced and are used to working on the modern cars. For anybody that's on the fence don't be.

791, on 10/25/15 10:27 AM (PDT),Mark Olsen ,2004 Jaguar XJ-Series Sedan XJ8 4dr Sedan (4.2L 8cyl 6A),Best Luxury Car Value You'll Find," Go to any website and look up the reliability and handling of the 2004+ Jaguar Xj8 and you'll find owners LOVE these cars.  For the money they are the most luxurious, best handling, greatest looking, and distinctive luxury cars on the planet.  The 2004+ models were the result of over a billion dollars spent by FORD in improvements to the Jaguar range.  These cars are never mistaken for anything but a Jaguar.  I have owned two of the 2004 models (and drive one currently) and they both provide outstanding handling, value, and the kind of driving experience that gets your heart beating when you turn the key.  As far as I'm concerned, when friends ask me if I like my Jaguar luxury/performance car, I just say there is NO OTHER CAR.  I just can't say enough about the experience of owning a Jaguar.  It is a singular pleasure unmatched in the motoring world.  Update:  Two years later not a single problem.  Car is a dream.  Buy one.  Update after two years:  Car is fantastic.  Still no issues whatsoever.  Only maintenance is changing fluids.  The 2004-2009 Jaguar XJ8 (350) are the last, repeat last, of the traditional Jaguars in terms of styling and traditional luxury interiors.  I'm convinced these cars will or are becoming modern classics.  A 3004-2006 with under 45000 miles can still be had for under $15k and probably will never depreciate any lower than that.  Care for one and drive it sparingly and you'll probably see an actual increase in what you paid in about 5 years from now.  That fact pales in comparison to the smiles on your face as you turn the key in this magnificent motoring machine...as Sir William Lyons said, ""The closest machine you can get to something that's actually alive.""  The 350's are like rare fine wine, meant to age well and be enjoyed for years to come.",5

All lock mechanism stopped working- found used parts on Ebay for 200 for all 4 doors. New price for each door is 300+.2.	Interior blower motor stop working- found control module on Ebay for 120. New part 300+3.	Trunk latch stopped working- found trunk latch on Ebay for 50. New part 400+4.	Radio amp stopped working- found used part on Ebay for 100.

The exterior is a timeless classic and the aluminum body make the MPG's incredible (18-20 city/28-31 hwy). In fact, I've averaged 27.3 mpg (80% Hwy./20% City) for the first 1,300 miles that I've owned the car!Ridiculous depreciation, based upon sins of the past, make this without question the best value in the used luxury car market.",5

The ride, the quality, the looks, and the performance are unmatchable in this price range. I could not afford a new Jag, and I was hesitant, but couldn't help myself, and my decision to buy this 5-year old was one of the best decisions ever. This car has worked flawlessly in the city (San Francisco) and on long drives. I have the car regularly maintained by a Jag dealer and couldn't be happier. As they say, this car sold for nearly $70,000 new. There's a reason it cost that much. Take care of it, it will take care of you.",5

It had 35,000 miles on it and, yet, it has taken me an additional 50,000 trouble-free, breathtakingly quick miles.  The car is a beauty, British racing green with sand interior.  The normally aspirated engine responds well and the ZF transmission translates that power to the road immediately.   The XJ handles like a much smaller car, dancing over the road rather than crushing it as its German stablemates tend to do.  This is the best, most responsive car I've ever owned.

Only weighs 3800 lbs due to Aluminum structure and ours was the 1st year of release and is short wheel based just as we like it.

Now back to Jags and I have been very pleased.  Six years old and still a head turner getting lots of unsolicited compliments.  No car draws like a Jag.  32 MPG on a 400 mile highway trip (70+MPH).  I use the recommended premium on trips but regular around town.  These are a bargain on the used market.  Paid $18,000 for a beautiful car with only 43,000 miles.

It has a combination of speed, comfort, agility, style, reliability, and economy that makes it the best car on the road in America.  The interior has features similar to the Bentley and Rolls Royce, also designed by Van den Plas, the man who worked on the interior of this Big Cat Jaguar.  The full power of the car is felt in the passing lane acceleration, when it pushes you back into the seat. The eye catching looks when you pull up in front of the  finest hotel in town, or the great admiration of all the people who simply root for Jaguar owners is not to be missed.  ",5

I've owned 12 cars in my driving life and this is by far the nicest.  It's quick and super comfortable.  The ride is on the softer side however for every day driving and some fun on the weekends you can't beat it.  The reliability has been great so far.  Compared to the 745 from 2004 there are some definite differences in size and ride however they cost at least $10,000 more for a comparable car. Not worth it in my mind.

Jag has built a high quality car with personality and every trip seems too short. The power from the V-8 is more than sufficient, with excellent fuel economy for a large luxury car.  You will find it easy to drive the car very fast, with the CATS suspension changing its setting to keep you on an even keel and comfortable.

These are well thought out designs and every component seems to be carefully made...but not the cup holders or the functionality of the CD player. The next time you look at cars have a careful look at a Jaguar instead. You'll notice certain details like the four square jack stands that are in just in the right place and the hood ornament that tells you exactly where the front end is and the silky feel of the steering and controls and the exuberance of the V8 and the solidness of its chassis and structure and its superior lighting.

Two days later, we drove it to Michigan from Virginia Beach.  Again, superb is the word.  We've owned and driven a lot of high end cars, but the XJs are in a class of their own.  The styling is refined from decades of improving on a base design from the late sixties.  The engineering has too.

I got the chance and have been falling in love ever since. I love how this Jag rides, drives and feels oh so solid. The engine took a little getting used to as it is the last of the straight six 4.0 (USA), and feels (and sounds) like you are starting up a WWII warplane. Once running it is pretty smooth but not buttery and revvy like the V8 that replaced it or the other typical competition. Instead is feels solid and reliable, which it happens to be in spades. If you get a chance to pick up one of these gorgeous cars, you will never want to let it go. With the forward hinged hood, single windshield wiper, J-gate shifter, full-sized spare tire, monstrous battery in the trunk, fuel tank behind the back seat, leather everything, real birdseye maple wood coddling you, and a windshield you can actually reach from your seat, this is a unique car to be certain.",5

I drove the 95 for years and it is by far the most reliable car I have ever owned. 6 years and only had to replace the water pump one, which I did myself.  Bottom line is this, I have now owned 2 of these, they both cost less than 6000$ and they have taken me anywhere I wanted to go on the EAST coast very reliably. AT 145000, I am hoping to keep it for another 10 years at least. The car is heavy as a tank, sturdy as a tank, rather frugal on gas, yet provides the smoothest ride you would find in the category.

My previous car was a Chrysler 300C with the 5.7L HEMI.  Look up the specs and compare, they are the same.  You can feel it too.  0-60 in 6.3.  Being an all aluminum car helps too.  It only weighs 3750 lbs.  300 lbs lighter than the 300C.   I'm on the look out for another one, but an '08 or '09 this time.

It went to 140,000 miles before any repair problems.  This new XJ8 is a better automobile in every way.  It retains classic British feng shui with state-of-the art technology.  I also own a Mercedes and Cadillac.  The Jaguar is simply a superior automobile.",5

It gets the best fuel economy in its class, with 18 mpg in the city and 28 mpg on the highway.  It has a plush interior with leather and real wood trim, telescoping and electronic tilting steering, rain-sensing wipers, rear collision avoidance radar, electronically adjustable pedals, and many other luxury accessories and features.  The styling is elegant.  The over-all body length is shorter than previous models, but the wheel base is longer: giving it better handling than previous models.  The weight of the vehicle is about 1,000 pounds less than previous models of XJ series, resulting in better fuel economy.",5

The new Jag is an engineering marvel and it's performance leaves nothing to be desired. Road feel is exceptional, and the 4.2 V8 along with the light aluminum body give it performance second to none. I have found no defects in the car at all. And the smell of that English leather and wood are impossible to duplicate.The fringe benefit of the Jag is that the car park people at the finest restaurants leave your car out in the front to show what kind of clientele they attract. They put those ordinary German and Japaneese cars in the back.",5

I had previously owned a 2002 X type which was so poorly built it made me (a grown man) want to cry. I then was foolish enough to go for an 04 X type on the word of the dealer that the car had been radically improved, which it was, but still shy of acceptable for a ""premium"" automobile, even an entry level one.I managed to convince myself that I had bought the wrong Jag and traded the X for a very svelt looking new XJ in Midnight Metalic Black. All I can say is that the XJ is a truely wonderful automobile in all respects. Day by day it continues to surprise me with it's comfort, cat like agility, outright speed and overall grace. ",5

I had an oil service done the next day and with only 71,000 miles on this ""Killer Kat"" i know i will be leaping onto the highway soon. so if you live on the east coast you are sure to catch me prowling and growling pass all the other so called luxury sport sedans (bmw, lexus, mercedes), they don't compare.

At the same time some people approach me and say, wow that is a great auto, it happens.  I have two 1998 Jags one black and one white, the white one is the ""L"" version. Do not ask me why but the stereo sound is better in the ""L"" version, most likely due to the added interior.",4.125

This is the first Jaguar I have owned and am open to a second Jag, a drop-top XK.  The only precaution for shoppers of 1997-2003 XJ8 models is the requirement for timing chain tensioners at about 75000 miles.  This is a spendy repair that is a must.

I remember going to the dealership and seeing the '98 Vanden Plas in Pewter with oyster interior and thought it was the most beautiful car available at the time. I was fortunate to have some friends in the auto industry that go to auctions regularly and they came across a beauty in the Cabernet color with the oyster interior with all the options that had been immaculately cared for. I bought it from them and have had nothing but PURE enjoyment since. Rolls Royce is the only car that compares to the ride and comfort experience in my mind!  ",4.75

However, in my experience, that has not been the case. I bought my 1998 Jaguar XJ8 as-is for about $11,000 with 72K miles. So far I have not had unexpected mechanichal problems, just routine work. I really enjoy the vehicle. The rapid depreciation of these vehicles, in large part due to Jaguars mechanical problems of the past, makes them very affordable for your average person.  Just a couple of suggestions: 1) Buy 1998 or after- thats when electrical system was replaced by Ford, 2) Make sure to get a pre-purchase inspection, and 3) if you need to buy parts, go on ebay, since the Jaguar dealer markup is huge.",4.375

Really no trouble at all until 110,000 miles. Brake calipers rebuilt, front end balljoints replaced, new belts and hoses (normal after 100,000 miles), new water pump, thermostat replaced. About $4,000 in repairs, however some of this is expected after 100,000 miles. The fit, finish, exterior and interior, electronics, handling, and overall reliability has been good. Super classy car that I will keep for very long time. Will put another 40,000 miles on this car and then put into the garage and buy another everyday car.

1041, on 03/12/15 17:53 PM (PDT),John Mulvihill ,2001 Jaguar XJ-Series XJR XJR 4dr Sedan (4.0L 8cyl S/C 5A),A bargain if you do the preventive maintenance," This car is a bargain in the used marketplace, with excellent performance and reliability. But there are weak areas. Make sure the plastic timing gear has been replaced with factory metal components. And, that the plastic water pump has been replaced with the factory metal unit. Do not buy an XJ that's been through an overheat. Look for sludge on the valve covers. The ZF automatic is ""sealed for life"" and prone to failure over 80K miles unless thoroughly cleaned out.Buy one of these cars only if you know of a non-dealer Jaguar speciality shop that can service it. (Check with your local Jaguar club.)Update: March, 2017 :  I'm not sure when I first posted my original review, but it's been at least a couple of years.Over that interval I've put on a lot of miles, including an extended road trip to Canada. Now at 148K miles and nine years of ownership I have many compliments and only a couple of complaints.On the complaining side I wish the car had better fuel economy. I rarely drive in Sport mode, and I'm not a stop-light drag racer, but my XJR does no better than 16 mpg in around-town driving and 20 or 21 mpg on the highway at 75 mph.One weakness I watch out for: the ZF five-speed automatic. It uses synthetic transmission fluid and supposedly is ""sealed for life."" In other words, you'll never have to change the transmission fluid. That's all well and good it the owner thinks the car's lifespan is over at 80K miles. But this is a 250K mile car. As metal dust circulates through the transmission over the years, it accumulates and clogs the filters and magnets and lodges in nooks and crannies. My expert mechanic went through my transmission at 100K miles and flushed everything, including the torque converter, which is a tricky operation. The result is all I could have hoped for. The fluid is still clean 48K miles after.Today's generation of luxury cars come equipped with V6s for the most part, some with inline fours, all turbocharged. To achieve my car's 400 hp (I've tweaked the Eaton supercharger), they need to boost these small engines mercilessly, and that can't be a good thing. Manufacturers are reducing engine displacement to meet government standards for emissions and fuel economy. and the new generation of luxury cars give 2 or 3 mpg more. I'll gladly keep my 32-valve DOHC V8 with supercharger. Unlike today's turbocharged cars, there's no lag on acceleration and the blower emits an intoxicating whine. This is what a Spitfire must sound like. The car makes power as new and I get a thousand miles out of a quart of Mobil 1.Since I wrote the first review my privately owned (non-dealer) Jag specialist shop has needed only to change the oil and a couple of filters and replace spark plugs. The shop's owner and chief wrench, Juan, tells me this generation XJ-series (1998 - 2003) is setting a new standard for reliability as the cars age. There is a proviso: XJs built before 2002 need their plastic timing gear and water pump replaced with factory metal parts. This is expensive, a couple thousand dollars. But one the metal components are installed, there will never be a need to fix this problem again.In summary, my affection for this car has grown, and I'm obliged to give it five stars over its previous four. Even though it's 16 model years old, the car is holding up superbly. It's still tight, the original Bilstein shocks are still doing their job, and I am no longer worried about unexpected breakdowns. I'm 67 now, and don't see the need for another car: this one will outlive me.Also holding up well are the Connolly leather (with maintenance, and always parking the car indoors, as did the original owner) and the factory-optional Emerald mica paint. Apart from stone chips, the paint looks as new, with the same intense emerald green. As with the interior, the paint's longevity is dependent on the car being parked out of the weather.I've driven the new XJ and am a big fan of Jaguar's new lineup. Finally the Germans have a serious competitor in the sports sedan arena. But without a doubt, my old XJR rides better than the new one. My car is better insulated from the road, and you hardly feel the imperfections you drive over them. By comparison, the new XJ with its 20"" wheels (as opposed to my car's 18"") and rubber-band tires just can't absorb the bumps as capably. There's no doubt it handles better on a twisty road. My XJR doesn't like tight twisties, but put it on a road with long sweepers and it's in its element.You can buy a car like mine privately on Craigs List for around $4,000. (I paid $12,500 for mine nine years ago, when it had 85K miles on the clock.) The trick to buying one of these is to purchase it privately from an enthusiast owner who has maintained it rigorously. Don't buy one from someone who has not kept the service records. And don't buy one if you don't have access to a Jag service shop that is not part of a dealership. Do buy one if you have driven one and love it.",5

I paid $18k used, less than my friend paid for her new VW beetle and i'm driving a gorgeous luxury car. The only visible flaws were cracked walnut paneling and I had the overhead cloth replaced. Then I have proceeded to drive the heck out of this car. I've commuted with it 500 miles/week  for the last 7 years, hauled my scuba gear in the trunk (in a plastic bin), and many road trips with or without camping gear. One reason I bought the XJ8L is the big back seat; at that time anticipating large passengers. As I started doing Triathlons I discovered just taking off the front wheel I can fit my entire racing bike in the back seat easily, quickly, and with little impact to the vehicle. I've had two consistent problems- with coolant sensor light and fuel cap light- that after several fixes I have just decided to ignore. The only problem I ever had driving is when I took an 1500 mile RT drive to Key west; since the car was built for a tall british man (and I'm an average American girl) after 600 miles my back hurt cause I didn't fit right. It's now 13 years old and near retirement at 220k miles; since the right rear wheel bearing gave out, will likely replace vs. repair.",5

This is a touring car and is designed to be driven on the highway for long distances at cruising speeds(within the law, of course).

I love the feeling of driving a car of this class, with its luxurious leather and wood and excellent Alpine sound system(worth the upgrade with the navi). The car feels big and important but at the same time feels very quick and sporty. The acceleration is super quick when merging on interstates and the car feels light when cruising.

This model is an extraordinary improvement. The interior is very spacious. More head room than even my height can use.

The new Jags are spectacular.  The XJR is a completely different machine.  Under the hood is a Supercharged V8 that delivers 370 horse power. It's a 4 door Porsche. In 1998 it was rated as the world's fastest production sedan.  Need I say more.  I will!  The interior is exquisite. Everyone knows that the British make the best interiors.  Rolls Royce, Bentley and Aston Martin.  Just sit in one.  The exterior is SEXY.  The looks from people on the street, especially women, makes it all worth it.

Don't get me wrong, I love this car, but certain items of normal maintenance are expensive:  Catalytic converters: $2400, tires, $1200, cooling system repairs, $$, depending on what you have to do.  Brakes, $1000 unless you have Brembo, then it's double that number.

I've owned both the XKR and XKRS. The XKRS took care of almost all of the handling issues that I had with the XKR. But it is still prone to swapping ends and it gives you almost no notice that it's going to break loose. It sticks really good but when the stick is gone you have to be very good at drifting to catch it. Otherwise it is probably one of the best GT cars ever! Turn-in is great. It would be nice if it had a bit less torque. You have to be very careful with the gas to keep the wheels from spinning. I think most people that buy Jags would be happier with the XKR for that reason.,4.5

Each time was a full day and there is still life in the P zeros! The car loves to be driven on the track hard. No break fade or overheating, it just wants more! On the street it is not high strung or difficult to drive but very smooth and easy. The stability control system in track mode is so liberal that I can't tell the difference from track mode and full off! The car sticks like it has glue on the tires but it does have snap over-steer and needs to be driven with respect if you intend to drive with the traction control in track mode of off (not!). The rear end can be very light and twitchy but that is part of what makes it exciting!A couple of years later:I traded the XKRS in for an F Type R. The F Type R is a far better sports car but the XKRS is a great GT car. I miss the XKRS. The back seats were very convenient. I never had a problem with the car during my 3 years of ownership. The problem with the XKRS is the snap over-steer. If you leave the stability control system on the car is perfectly safe and fun to drive. Jaguar has a way of making their cars feel special. When ever I get in and start getting the car ready to drive I can feel my heart step up a beat with excitement. It's really hard to put your finger on what exactly makes driving a Jaguar exciting. My Father's BMW 740 didn't do that for me and neither has any other car that I have driven. I guess that's why I keep buying Jaguars. A neighbor from down the street asked me if I worked for Jaguar because of all the different Jaguars that he has seen in front of my house. I said no I just like them.",5

No other grand touring sports car comes close to the now discontinued XK or XKR for value.  The new F Type is a great sports car too, but many of us prefer the larger XK for a comfortable daily driver that can still pin you back into the seats with awesome acceleration and great handling.  Very few drivers are skilled enough to take this car to it's limits.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the outdated electronics and navigation program.  Everything else is classic Jaguar grand touring luxury with more room than the new F type.  The XK's went out of production after 2015 and the 2012 through 2015 cars are an exceptional value today compared to anything in it's class.   Find a well cared for, low mileage XK series car and keep it forever.  You will be glad you did.",4

Ride is a bit stiff not silky smooth as the sales brochure implies, but then again it's a sport-touring vehicle. Interior is superb. The car is classed as a Portfolio edition with some extra options. There is no oil dipstick - electronic readout on dash. Trunk is a bit tight, hard to get one set of golf clubs in it. Uses plastic head lamp covers as compared to my '05 XK8 glass ones (tacky plastic that'll likely get yellowed, glazed & scratched in time). No sunglass compartment built into left side of dash as there was in my '05 XK8. Reliable, well built & gorgeous design - a real head turner. Classy car & well balanced simple design. Had local dealer program ""daylight running lights"" on for safety. Now trying to see if a rearview camera can be installed. Overall, I love it even though it has no variable utility other than getting from point A to point B in style...I use my '14 GMC Terrain for grunt duty.

Very stable all the way up to 155 where the speed limiter puts an end to the locomotive pull. It is surprisingly quiet with the top up. With it down, the optional wind screen with the windows rolled up makes for a very calm cabin at speed. Seats are comfortable even on very long trips. Corners great at all speeds. The paddle shifters work well and are quick and responsive. Brakes scrub off big speed nicely. Active exhaust sound cool when bypassing muffler. You can get two kids (probably up to age 14)  in the back but both the driver and passenger need to move the seats up quite a bit. Trunk is one of the smaller I have seen. Back seats make better storage than seats. I've so far put 5K miles on it (in about 3 weeks)and blew out a CV boot ($450 repair).

I chose the coupe over the convertible because quite frankly it has a much better ass.  The convertible is fine if you live in south Florida and have an enlarged prostate, but it just lacks the appeal of the coupe.  This is a true GT give speed and comfort, with a decent amount of rigidity and stability with traction control on.  If you want a wild ride, hold the traction control button for 10 seconds to disengage the control and go easy in the first curve!!!  Acceleration is amazingly quick.  The paddle shift is instantaneous. The huge front discs provide more than adequate braking without any signs of fade, any the new rigid all aluminum frame keeps everything feeling taut.  The interior has the classic Jaguar burled wood and plush supportive leather seats which can be adjusted 12 different way from Sunday to fit most any height and stature.  The back seat, while looking nice serves no real practical purpose.  Space is so limited you couldn't fit a legless dwarf back there.  The coupe does have a usable trunk which will fit a couple of full size luggage or 2 sets of golf clubs.  There are a few things to be concerned with on this vehicle.  They are known to have sticky thermostats which are not difficult to change out yourself.  Mine would generally stick in colder weather if the car wasn't warmed up for a few minutes before taking it out.  This demonstrated a dashboard warning.  After speaking to the dealer he told me to just buy an error code scanner and eliminate the code if it comes up repeatedly.  Also, be careful not to leave this car out in the sun as a habit.  The dashboard leather will shrink and start to pull away!!!  Get a dashboard cover or reflector.  There is no easy fix for this. Your looking at a close to $4000 repair (to have it done right).  All in all this is a fantastic car which was designed by the same person who designed the Aston Martin DB7-9.  They are virtually identical, but i think the Jag has a certain amount of flair and refinement that you won't get in the AM.  I love this XKR and will most probable have it for a very long while.",4

It was a Florida car, subject to the heat, humidity and salt air of the gulf coast... surprisingly, the Jaguar had a perfect interior, despite some minor door dings, the original paint and trim was excellent.  Within two months of the purchase, the ""S"" was driven from FL to California in a 2,900 mile 2.5 day high speed drive on Hwy 10 with no adverse effects and an uncommonly smooth ride over varied terrain, roads and temperatures.  Averaging over 30 miles per gallon, the Jaguar performed faultlessly at all speeds with the air conditioner under continuous use.  Now housed in CA, I had a recent scare when a warning light indicated that the ""S"" had a ""gearbox fault"" and the transmission locked in 5th gear.... imagining the  need for a new transmission, the car was taken to a local Jaguar specialist who spent a shop hour updating the software and I was back on the road for a cost of $125.  Beside oil changes with synthetic blends, new windshield wiper blades, the replacement of the original Continentals with Pirelli P7s, and a K&N air filter, the Jaguar has cost me absolutely nothing in parts and repairs.The classic exterior style of the ""S"", the beauty of the leather interior, the solid, yet comfortable ride of the suspension, and the overall performance of this vehicle demonstrates to me that for its $10K cost this is not only one of the best bargains on the road but also one of the best luxury sport sedans.",5

It just turned 53k and the engine valve covers are leaking oil on the exhaust shields and fills the inside with burnt oil fumes. The dealer said it could also be the intake manifold gasket. In that case about a $2400 repair at least.  The transmission recently started to make noise and it just left on a tow truck because it locked up in park and wouldn't start. If Jaguar rebuilds the transmission it estimated $6000 at least. Which puts the repairs above what the cars value is. Add that to the fact I payed a premium price because it was so pristine makes for a bad Jaguar experience.   Update: Miles 59k. Transmission problem was a bolt that fell out of shift linkage. Valve cover still leaks on exhaust shield just enough to smell bad. Had to replace the transmission pan assy. due to leaking. Trans still make a slight yelp sound when shifting up from 2nd to 3rd after coming out of a turn. And rear drivers side auto door lock stopped working. Just use as a grocery getter.

1238, on 10/12/15 08:24 AM (PDT),Bob Drago ,2004 Jaguar S-Type Sedan 4.2 4dr Sedan (4.2L 8cyl 6A),not a honda nor toyota," I understand those that complain about the repairs and dealer support but this car is no different than a BMW M class or an AMG unless you have money or are willing to turn a wrench you should stick with the Jap cars, this is not a mediocre car and same as any well-above-average vehicles there is a price to owning it. Yes the Jag is nto a very forgiving car (neither are any performance cars) if you don't pay attention to what it needs it will let you down and the cost of fixing everything will pile up quickly BUT if you do fix everything in time and you use good quality parts you will have a reliable superb vehicle. In reviewing vehicles one should stay away from including poor choice repair shops (yes you get what you pay for and more often than not you'll get less than that), for most smart people dealers are the places where you get a OEM screw or a small gasket but you'd do the major repairs at vetted mechanics not at dealers. On the same note it is your choice to go for ASE certified or just crowd vetted professionals (I consider ASE to stand for Ask Someone Else and they will see my money or touch my car in another life). The car... is superb, the engine electrical harness is a bit on the weird side meaning that the wires temp rating was very poorly selected, other than this the wishbone suspension is a great choice for comfort and not so great for repair but it is repairable; IF you are willing to invest either money or your time and effort. Other than the electrical weirdness I can't say anything negative about it, the car is powerful, smooth as a hoover, elegant, classy, refined, great on gas (I get 24mpg on hwy and 19 in the city with normal driving 80-85mph hwy and non aggressive yet not grandma' either for city driving).

I believe it boils down to the attitude of the owner. A 2000 Honda Civic driver says they have the most reliable car ever and they love it ( 2 of the windows don't roll down, interior is falling apart but it still starts stops and gets them places so therefore it's great.) Meanwhile you ask a 2000 jag owner and a window stops rolling down and its the worst car they've ever owned. THE CAR IS 15 YEARS OLD ITS GOING TO HAVE A FEW ISSUES! So far the only thing I've had to do to my S-Type is replace a window regulator ($30) and replace the MAF sensor ($30) both of which I did myself. It is RWD so it absolutely sucks in the snow but I got sedan chains that make it drive great during the winter. I feel that jag owners want to scare people off with expensive repair bills just because they believe they are too good for everyone else to drive one. Obviously if you don't care about the quality and enjoyment of owning a nice car by all means go for the Honda Civic.

Trans doesn't shift correctly. Interior compartment door latch broke. Entire dash taken out to repair freon leak. Total cost has been over 2k in repairs without fixing some of the outstanding problems. Every time I see a car like this I say ""but isn't it pretty"".

At five years of age, window channels and other relatively minor things broke that would never have failed in some other automobiles.  Most recently, with less than 40,000 miles on the odometer, we got to pay $2,400+ for a transmission rebuild.  It was explained that there is a ""braking mechanism"" in the transmission that helped slow the car when the foot was lifted aff of the accelerator.  Ford has improved Jaguar's reputation from their former deplorable reputation up to Ford's mediocre at best reliability.  ",4.5

It is a very comfortable car (my wife reminds me of this regularly) and has lots of bells and whistles. We enjoy the heated front seats this time of year (January) and the moon roof in the summer. The car is plenty fast enought for me and as long as I stay around 75 miles an hour, fuel economy is good.

Thje car is certainly more sedate and refined than the M3, while the M3 is certainly the sportier of the two. The Jaguar has more options, more toys, etc. While the M3 is the better ""race car"" the Jaguar is certainly the choice for long, fast & relaxed cruising; the V8 engine has ample power for spirited driving in traffic.

Been paying $9 per lug nut,  $1000 for a starter w/o installation,  just lose the key, or have the hood ornament taken.  The leather fades in color, the sun roof sticks, and the car only starts when it feels like it.  Doesn't drive well at all in any amount of snow.  It stays at home, it won't move!

If you want to have the most elegant car at the drag strip go for the R model, if you don't like to drive fast a V6 model is the most plentiful and still has 240 HP for passing other cars. Ford has made Jaguar a better car and much more reliable than the ones from the 80's and 90's, going from the bottom of the reliability lists to the top. With the rear seats folded down there is a lot of storage in back, making it practical too. Don't use the car for carrying gravel or firewood though, the car is too dignified for that.

Quality is found inside and out. Mine has the optional navigation system which is simple to use and easy to see from the driver's position.

The reliability is barely good enough to keep me semi-satisfied.  Same for the amount of interioor rattling.

It's smooth and so good looking as well as 7 mpg better on gas. I miss the power and the growl from the V8, but I feel much better in this one.

We had two prior X-Types which were also excellent.  It is a superb car around town and amazing - AMAZING - on the open road. The handling is superb, the 3 liter is remarkably robust, and it gets better mileage even than the X-Type.  We have always liked the old S cars featured on the BBC 'Inspector Morse' series and this is an elegant modern rendition.   The flowing lines are so pretty even as design trends for most cars have become much more angular the past few years. Still rare and unique enough to turn a lot of heads.  Snow tires are absolutely essential in northern climes.  We will keep this one forever! ",5

However, we did notice that it needs work on the sunroof area. There's definitely a vibration, a low rattling sounds coming from the ceiling near the sunroof. We took the car back into the dealer in efforts to fix the sounds but it's still there. Maybe I'm a bit more sensitive to sounds than other people but the sound is still there. Hopefully we'll figure out of a way to get rid of the sound. Other than that, an excellent automobile. ",4.5

I am a long time Jaguar owner/collector, biased to the marque.  We bought this car from a local dealer we know because we temporarily needed another car in the household.  I bought it with 115,000 miles on it and put almost another 10,000 on it over 2+ years of ownership.  I bought this car because it was a one owner, well maintained car.  My advice on buying an older Jag sedan is that if you don't know the service history, assume it's going to need major service, which can be expensive.  Even so, they will require a degree of maintenence as components reach the end of their serviceable life.  During my ownership I replaced the driver sear module, replaced brakes and the ignition switch.  I bought a Sport model with the 3.0 six, a nice engine with great torque and moves this car down the road well.  When I first drove the S-Type in 2000, I thought it was the best handling sedan I had driven.  The Sport model with better suspension and seats didn't disappoint.  A lovely car to drive.  Four of us traveled comfortably on a 1,000 mile road trip.  These cars are now over a decade and a half old.  Great value for money if you get the right one, choose wisely!",4

Nicely laid out inside & out, runs well, but compared to my BMW 528i, the gas mileage on the Jag for a V6 is horrible. Handles well for such a heavy car and picks up nice on the highway. Currently has 85000 miles and looks brand new inside and out! Compliments have been incredible and common. Certainly a car for somebody looking for something different.

Of course the car is out of warranty (ended Nov 2015) and after a very long process with Jaguar USA HQ executive escalations the best they could do is take 50% off the retail cost of the new engine.  I spent over $18,000 to put a new engine on a luxury Jaguar that had just 56K miles on it.  All service records were provided.  It was maintained at the dealer, oil changes which are synthetic done yearly or every 10K miles.  The only thing not done was the 5 year maintenance.  The entire experience dealing with Jaguar USA was terrible.  I felt like I was on trial with them trying to prove I was a negligent owner.  In the end they decided on a ""Goodwill"" benefit of 50% discount of the retail cost of the new engine plus parts needed that were damaged.  I still can not believe that Jaguar was unwilling to stand by their product and cover this issue.  Especially considering that while the car was under warranty in 2014 a similar problem occurred and they repaired and took care of it at 0 cost.  Those records were also provided though completely ignored.  Their conclusion was based on that I was the third owner of the car and that the 5 year maintenance was not done.  Completely unbelievable! In the end we all have to make our choices as consumers.  I own an F150 which has a 130K miles and no issues, had a Benz 150K miles and no issues, currently own a Porsche 30K miles no issues as for Jaguar I will NEVER purchase another no matter how sexy they are!  For those of you reading this post know that Jaguar USA is only interested in lining their pockets with 0 regards for their consumers especially if out of warranty.  My recommendation is don't walk, Run!!!!",1
1668, on 06/11/16 01:12 AM (PDT),GMilliken ,2011 Jaguar XJ Sedan XJL Supercharged 4dr Sedan (5.0L 8cyl S/C 6A),Here kitty kitty.......," This is my second Jag in 3 years.  I bought the XF, which I thought was the cats meow.  It was all good until I took it in for scheduled maintenance and I was given an XJ as a loaner.  Within 2 months I was driving the XJL.  I have had the car about 6 months now. I bought it used with only 11k miles and it has been a joy to drive and a real head turner.  This car is so fast that I have had to se the alarm when I am driving on the Freeway.  I broke down and bought a radar detector after I got stopped by the highway patrol over Memorial Day weekend.  I came over a hill saw him, looked at my speed which was 90 and just started to pull over.  By the time he caught up with me I was pulling onto the shoulder.  Unbelievably he did not give me a ticket.  Complimented the car and told me to watch the speed because of the holiday weekend.  I was shocked.  My insurance went  up when I bought the car and I was dreading what a ticket might do to it.  The car has never denied me the power I have requested.  You press the accelerator and it just keeps going, no lag or hesitation, just pure power.  Oh, and the sound of the engine, lovely.  When the sports mode is engaged it is a completely different driving experience.  Where the car is fast to start with the sport mode ads a bit more edge.  You have the option to use the paddle shifters when in sports mode, but the shifting is so smooth and in tuned with the car that I let it shift itself.  Only complaint is the touch screen interface for the Entertainment System.  It leaves a lot to be desired.  It is not responsive at all unless the heal of your hand accidentally touches the screen and then you usually loose whatever you were doing.  Work around is the voice recognition system. It works like a charm, so I use that when I need to set up Navigation or play with the sound system.  Back seat is unbelievable with the picnic tables and climate controls.  You can actually cross your legs in the back seat.  The fit and finish is second to none and the ride incredible.  It oozes luxury but in a kind of understated way.  Friend just got a new Benz, I have owned them in the past and the new ones seem kind of gimmicky to me.  The Benz logo pops open and a camera comes out when backing  up, when the door is open it shines the words Mercedes Benz on the ground.  Kind of tacky, I thought.  If you are looking for a car that stands out from the usual and has sports car power and awesome luxury this is your car.",5

I love the looks of the car and it’s driving performance and luxury. However the infotainment system is years behind Merecedes, Audi, and BMW. I had an Audi A8L prior to this and this is a step backwards as far as the electronics. The worst part is that The Bluetooth and hands free system have never worked properly since day 1 and are completely unreliable and dealer had not been able to get it resolved. Also my ability to get it to play my music from my phone is equally unreliable. Just way too many electronic glitches with this car. Getting assistance from Jaguar and the dealer has also been a big hassle. I am going to take a hit and get ride of this car in the next few months, tired of the glitches and their inability to get it resolved. As a whole I have been very disappointed with my experience and the quality of the car and Jaguar’s service. I would not recommend getting this car unless you have lots of patience.",3

It looks great and it gets compliments from total strangers. It is fun to drive if you are just driving on a highway. Good value for the price I am paying. However the car is quite long and I have trouble parking it. The park assist is helpful but can not be relied on totally. The car has quite a few glitches, I believe in its computer.  It takes about a minute for the computer to boot up, almost like a PC and not like my Mac Book Air, for comparison. The Park assist is difficult understand. Is it on all the time or does it require manual turn on? However the main issue we have is with the AC. It does not cool as well as the Lexus SUV we are used to. Also the AC sensors may be at times having difficulty figuring out what to do. Even when we turn the temp dial up to 80 to stop the high speed of the fan (in AUTO mode )it keeps going.  The navigation etc and other tech features will take some time to get used to, unless you are familiar with jaguar.  I am probably half way through, that too with the essentials.  Over all it has been a good experience and my brother who drove it a thousand miles to bring it to us enjoyed the drive and did not feel tired, even from the long trip. I may ahve to take it back to my summer home since parking space in the winter place is a tight fit, needing quite a bit of careful maneuvering.

The dealership (Aristocrat Motors, in the Kansas City area) was a world class experience.  Fantastic driving experience, comfort, and economy of fuel.  Far more powerful car than my previous car (2011 Buick LaCrosse), and without changing my driving habits one bit, my gas mileage has increased from around 17 mpg to 21 mpg.  It is, for the most part, everything I'd hoped for in a car of Jaguar's class.

Not at all intuitive, and clunky to operate while driving.  I can't do something as simple as change the radio station easily.  I have Sirius XM radio, and can't just turn a knob to change the channel.  I have to look at something.  That's ridiculous, and borderline dangerous.                                                                                                                                                                                                            2) how does a car of Jaguar's caliber in 2017 not come with standard hands free telephony?

There is a MANDITORY idle engine stall built in, I assume someone thought it would save gas mileage.  It seems that it's always on upon starting the engine.  It is ultra sensitive in that it stalls the engine almost immediately upon coming to a stop at a light or even stop sign. Asside from it being ridiculously annoying, and continual additional strain on systems such as the oill pressure issues upon engine starting and such, and flashes the cigerrete lighter power turning on your hone screen if charging, it also has proven to be a saftey hazzard.   It turns itself off while you are navigating into a tight parkign spot !   So NEVER buy a late model jaguar if you live in a big city where parallel parking is reqqquired !   Several times not, I am using the parking sensors to carefully guy myself into a tight spot, gradually inching a little closer and closer to the another vehicle, such as in front of me, and wala - the darn engine shuts off right in the middle !!    you have to fully remove you foot fromt he break to get it to restart, only, now the a) frontal parking sensor has turned off, and b) by fully removing your foot from the break, and as the car auto restarts, it can jump forward a bit... correct - bumping you right intot he car in front of you that you were carefully inching close to.  Goog God.  How did they mess this up ?  WOuld it be too much to ask that they provide a way to optionally turn and keep it off - for the sake of saftey ?

Then....I drove the Jaguar XF.  I first drove a base XF in premium trim, then I drove XF S AWD.  And wow, does the XF S AWD drive! The steering feel, handling, and responsiveness far exceed the Audi and the BMW 5 series.  If you care about the joy of driving, you owe it to yourself to check out the XF.  It just feels lighter and more responsive.  The XF's interior is simple, elegant, uncluttered, reminicent of a comfortable driver's cockpit, which is what I prefer.  It has all the safety nannies like lane departure, blind spot warning, LED headlights, and parking aides.  If you're looking for a more sophisticated and shiny interior, Audi, BMW, and Mercedes is a better place to look.  Finally, the price. The XF S AWD doesn't come cheap, especially the fully loaded models.  I decided to to pick the right color combination with custom wheel appearance package, and forgo many of the optional packages.  By doing this, the MSRP on my XF S AWD was $7-8K lower than the fully loaded ones.   Some dealers (but not all) are willing negotiate, especially at month's end.  Most dealers are discounting the them 3-4K, but if you're patient and timing is right, you can potentially double those savings.   One more thing, it comes with a 5 year, 60K mile warranty, with prepaid maintenance, something Audi and Mercedes doesn't do and BMW does for 1 year and 10K less.",5

That deficiency is compensated for to some degree by the cars passing vehicle warning system. The Cat's V-6 supercharged engine provides instant acceleration - a true performance pleasure. Unfortunately performance comes at a price - lousy gas mileage in the 14 to 16 mpg range around town. Though the car doesn't need much service the cost of having it done is extortionate- try an oil change in the $200 range!!  On the positive side the Jag dives like its on rails. Its interior is well appointed with quality materials. The controls are logically placed within easy reach. Instrumentation is good, but misses some of the gages you find on older performance cars - but, then, I'm a lover of the old Jags and other British cars. The driver's seat steering wheel combination has more adjustments to it than Carter has little liver pills.  Leg room is abundant.

Lucky me because this happened at 49k miles and it has a 4 year/50k mile warranty. The dealership stood by Jaguar's warranty and helped me. It took 3 trips to the dealer to get it fixed. They ended up replacing the coolant reservoir the first time, the Y pipe the second time, and the 3rd try was the charm having replaced a hose that was leaking. Although frustrating to have those issues and keep having to go back to the dealer, the actual dealership was great to work with and ended up getting it resolved, they gave me a loaner car 2 of the 3 times. That is the type of issue that can happen to any car so I'm not knocking the vehicle TOO much there. The exclusivity, looks, style, used value, etc. on this car are pretty unbeatable. I specifically only looked for 2012's because in 2012 was the first year of the model refresh giving it the unbelievably seductive headlights and tail lights and more refreshes, but 2012 is also the LAST year of the standard 5.0 L V8 motor. Car is great to drive, great to be seen in, comfortable seats, great sound system on the portfolio trim. The brisk, effortless acceleration from the v8 delivers lots of laughs and is high on the giggle meter. Preventative Maintenance costs aren't TOO bad as long as you avoid the dealer for that, I got a full synthetic oil change, fluids topped off, fuel injectors cleaned, 4 wheel-alignment, flat tire repair, different tire installed, and 2 air filters replaced all for $245.  1 problem is the interior build quality has developed a squeak/rattle. I call it an ""expansion and contraction"" rattle because it only rattles/squeaks in hot temperatures or when the car has been in the sun all day..it doesn't rattle at all during the winter or cold mornings. Would I buy a 2012 XF again? Ehh..now that they are out of warranty I'd probably opt for an in-warranty supercharged V6 XF of a later year. Anything major breaking on this Jag out of warranty will be back breaking. Oh one last thing: I don't know if I am idiot...or if this was completely skipped in the building of my spec, but my car does not have child safety anchors. The indicators on the leather seats, that tell you where they should be...point to an area behind the seat that does not have a safety anchor...scratching my head on this one.",4

I've been a die-hard BMW fan for years, and the decision to throw my hat into Jaguar's ring was the product of considerable research and multiple test-drives against the 528i (similar lease rate).

Leaks developed in the car (through the windshield).  For several months Jaguar kept fixing and replacing many parts of the car - claiming 1 thing after another was leaking (I told them i suspected the windshield, but they said that was not possible).  After 6 months of trying to fix the leak, they finally looked at the windshield, and confirmed that the leaks were indeed coming from there.  By then the car had gotten so badly damaged due to water, that my insurance company took the car off our hands, and we didn't have to go through the hassle of selling it.  During all this time, the dealership provided us with a loaner - initially a lousy, small Hyundai, and then after I made some noise, an equivalent Jag.  Often we waited days or weeks to get simple repairs done.  They would give me an appointment, and then take 3 days just to take a look at the car, and then wait weeks for parts to arrive.  In fact our insurance company had better follow ups with us on the repairs than the dealership did.  I finally had to meet with the GM of the dealership to discuss the situation, and even sent them an invoice for MY time lost coming in to the dealership and chasing after them.While we loved driving the Jag, the hassles of owning one were not worth it.  We ended up buying a Porsche and a Tesla and it has been an amazing experience - great customer service, and fantastic drives - Porsche better than the Tesla!, though the Tesla has its plusses.  OLD REVIEW:  We've now owned this car, bought new, for 3.5 yrs, and have under 18,000 miles on it.  By now, a significant portion of the car has been replaced by Jag - including several internal lights, the entire fuel system, parts of the audio system, and most recently all the carpeting and even the front seats.....and they're still not done!!!  There's still more they need to work on.  And even that's not the worst part.What is absolutely the worst is the level of customer service.  Take the car in for work, and then I have to follow up for an update.  It typically takes 6-8 weeks to get replacement parts, and involves several follow ups.  Amazing that they are still in business.",3

Power is awesome, faster than the factory reported 4.9 to 60. Great design and different from BMW/Merc, really gives a sense of luxury and yet is a total sleeper in performance. My only concern in buying the Jaguar was reliability - no problems to report after a month though so maybe the demons are history. Super smooth ride but also handles well. The hockey puck transmission shifter is really a good idea, takes up a lot less room - why do you need a big stick on an automatic? Navigation and touchscreen are a bit slow and dated, but I don't use them much so not bothersome. No buyers remorse here, I'd buy again and recommend  the XF highly.",4.75

The dcs is incredible you cannot feel any of the corrections its making. In all other cars you will hear strange noises when the dcs trying to control the car and you can fill the corrections that made. In jag you do not understand anything at all!

I'm afraid I'm going to have to sell the car and would tell anyone considering purchasing one, to CAREFULLY reconsider.

With big losses in the stock market decided to spend my money rather than watch it diminish through no fault of my own.  Love it.  Love the looks, the interior, performance and the entire start-up display.  Love the sound of the engine, fast runs through sweeping corners and listening to good music in the elegant interior.  Looked at Merc, BMW, Audi, Lexus, Acura and Infiniti.  Only the Jag spoke to me.  Only the gas milage is troubling, but I'm coming out of a Hybrid, so of course, it hurts.  But such a sweet ride.  I only worry that such conspicuous consumption in a prolonged recession is in bad taste. ",4.625

It was a great ride all the way through.  Even without the super charged engine, she managed just fine.  My only gripe about this car is the sunroof continues to squeak even though the dealer has worked on it.  There was a chirping sound at low speeds and the dealer found that to be a cable rubbing against the chassis that connected to the rear seat release to the trunk.  Everything else on the car is A-1. Quite and upgrade from the S-type.  Now, if I can only get those Celena wheels without foreclosing on my house.",4.5

Fixed (I hope). Only major downside: gas consumption which averages between 16 mpg (US) city and 19.3 hwy (14,7-12,2L/100kms). This is the most enjoyable car I've owned (including Mercedes SL450, BMW 735i, Lexus etc.).

Most have very deep buckets for two that makes having 3 kids seats impossible. I went to buy an Acura MDX - it drove like a van. The Jag dealer was next door. After juggling one big baby seat and 2 boosters I got them to fit - then I test drove it, WOW!  I had a BMW 330i and have had a Boxster, this XF beats them both. It is very comfortable, will hit 60 in 6 secs and has one of best sounding rumblings when you get on it. The base model with heat package is everything you would want.

I had S Type Rs, Xtypes and fell in love with the new XF Supercharged in Silver- it is light years better than the old S type- better engine, trans, handling and of course the design. Back seat passengers don't complain now and the boot is rather large. I have driven in snow /ice with snow tires and the winter mode keeps you moving without fail. Valets love it and makes me grin every time I drive it too 7000 miles so far and only problems have been alignment and windnoise which the dealer fixed .

There are two issues with the car and maybe it's the early ones, but one is the sunroof clips - fixed.  The other is this creak or chirp which really ticked me off.  I was at the brink on this one but my service rep figured it out today.   The problem happened to be the cables attached to the latch which releases the back seats so they can fold down. YES, they fold down.  The cables were rubbing against the metal at the top of the trunk. Problem solved.  The car is great as it should be.",4.875

I immediately knew this was a car for me!  I have owned Lexus and Acura, but they do not compare with this car. The interior design is spectacular with the leather dash, great seating, and technology, and the exterior sets it apart from its competitors in its class.  I have fallen madly in love with my first Jaguar - it is an exceptional vehicle!  The build quality is excellent and the transmission shifts through the gears beautifully!

It has all the toys and features I could ever wanted in a car. Warm and cold package is a big plus. Blind spot warning is a nice feature. The auto dim mirror and navigation are nicely done. The rotating shifter dial is a nice change. The paddle gear shifters are convenient. The sound system is good.  The handling is good, but not great compared to my BMW (performance 8). The noise reduction is not so good compared to Lexus and MB (comfort 8). The fuel economy is good for a V8.

Each guest was provided a new Jaguar (XK or XF) to take on a 25 minute country drive. I am looking at the XF so this was a  perfect opportunity. The car truly exceeded my expectations. But it gets better, upon return each guest was escorted to the race track. We were assigned a car and professional race driver. We were each given the opportunity to test drive the cars on a real track. For the second lap the professional takes the wheel. Words cannot describe the experience of a race car driver putting the XF through its paces. I walked away from there with a new found respect for the XF.",5

It has only been a year and half since I've owned my vehicle, and although the relationship started off great, it quickly deteriorated. Starting with electrical problems when my windows wouldn't roll down. There are already issues with the spark plugs misfiring, there have been two recalls I've been notified of. It's like paying for a 5 star hotel only to end up with no hot water and dirty sheets in the room.  The embarrassment associated with driving an expensive vehicle I spent a ridiculous amount of money on for such poor quality work makes me feel as if I've been tricked. I feel as if I've paid the price for an emblem, not a car worthy of that price tag.",3

Auto Start/Stop feature feels like car has stalled. Should be user defeat-able. It can only be disabled per trip, not forever. It does NOT have a locking mechanism to secure the fuel door (United States). Really, anyone can siphon gas or contaminate it? It can take a minute or more to have the music start, and even several minutes to enter an address in to the navigation. Backup camera has a warning banner on screen that blocks view long enough to back out of my driveway or parking spaces. It's a beautiful car and drives nice. Plenty of power, but I have yet to get the minimum listed gas mileage.",3

I wasn't even considering Jaguar as option this go-around, but stopped at the dealership to check out the XE (boy was that TOO small). Then I sat in the XF and realized this was the perfect car (fit and finish). Once I took it for a test drive I was hooked. It feels like a big cat ready to leap out of it's skin! PROS: Acceleration, Exhaust note, Handling, Exterior looks, Interior comfort, Entertainment System, Space for family of 4, Touches of comfort not found in competing German brands, Warranty and Service plan included. CONS: Not many, but I've had a small rattle on the passenger side door, however, Jaguar has been great about isolating and fixing AND the Auto start/stop feature is maddening (just need to get used to turning it off when you start the car). I highly recommend the XF!",5
1880, on 01/20/16 20:07 PM (PST),Linda DeStefani ,2016 Jaguar XF Sedan S 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),My fast running Jaguar gets me in trouble!," If you like fast wild cats then this car is for you!  I'm about to lose my license because my Jaguar loves to run fast and CHiPs aren't impressed! So, I have 2 reckless-driving speeding tickets I can't ""work off""!  ""Cruising"" (?) down the road, listening to the news, not using my cruse control, I got pulled over outside of Barstow doing 92 MPH!  Even though my speed is posted in the window, I was so unaware that I had reached that MPH that I was shocked!  If Jaguar would maker a noisy, not easy to control/drive car I wouldn't have to hire someone to be ""Driving Miss Linda"" around!  I love my car!  Since there isn't a dealership nearby, there are just a few Jags here which makes it unique.  My car gets a lot of attention because it's styling is wonderful!  I'm so pleased I have camera's everywhere because I can't judge how close or far I am from curbs!  I still haven't tried to learn how to use ""auto park"" and living in a small city area, I  really don't need to.   My car hasn't been in the ""shop"" which is super since the dealer is a 1 1/2 hour distance away.  I tinted the windows which makes the car even more stylish.  The dash instruments are easy to use and more attractive where they're placed.  I needed a BIG trunk and this one is the best!  Both back seats and arm rest bend down so I don't need to ask a handyman to haul things for me .   I previously had a 2009 Jag that was in for repairs"" only once, so I think Jag's reputation is now restored.  I see on T.V. that Queen Elizabeth and others drive Jags so if it's good enough for a queen then it should be just ""the cats meow"" for us!",5
1881, on 09/04/18 13:42 PM (PDT),Rob Gordon ,2016 Jaguar XF Sedan 35t R-Sport 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl S/C 8A),XF has multiple personalities — it's a good thing!," I like my Jag's ability to comfortably ease on down the road, eating up the highway... and it can just as quickly be confidently flung around like the sports sedan it is. Other than a transmission issue at delivery, the R-Sport I purchased has been problem-free, back to the dealer only for the free one year service, which I enjoyed not paying for. It feels so very tight, and light. The interior is kinda weak, design is minimalist and flat, and they should have put a few more bucks into the carpet quality, and let's face it, the XF is not flashy, though the front end and side view is very slick. Buy the XF for yourself, for its capabilities and feel. If you need to have a bedazzled car to impress people you don't know, go ahead and be ""that guy"" and skip the XF. I only wish I'd known about and waited for the wagon version.",4
1882, on 08/10/18 19:39 PM (PDT),Lance Bowling ,2018 Jaguar E-PACE SUV P300 R-Dynamic HSE 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 9A),Best Compact SUV by a mile; simply outstanding," Pros: Best looking, best handling in class and fun to drive. Stunning looks & style for a SUV, well laid out & comfortable sporty cockpit (F Type copy), good driver visibility, brilliant performance technology, great features, smooth quick-shifting nine-speed transmission, quite nimble, precise steering, super stable braking, great cornering & windy conditions stability, excellent surround camera system, brilliant adaptive cruise control, unbelievable self parking, very good sound system, good interior fit and finish, and great storage capability considering vehicle size. Cons: Little expensive, feathery overly sensitive accelerator pedal (spurts), washed out touchscreen display, windshield blocks radio frequencies, and a few other minor issues listed under, “Details of Issues”.Overall: A vehicle well suited to city driving and equally at home in the country; but not my first choice for long distance trips (full-size SUV time). The vehicle is best suited to a family of four or less (children and smaller bodies in the rear). The 21 inch wheels provide a great ride in “Comfort” & “Dynamic” modes, better than the smaller offerings. Brakes are excellent and feel stable under hard braking. Has “ECO” mode to improve fuel consumption. 6 -different models and a plethora of options to suit most needs. Has all the latest safety features and collision avoidance. Top model could do with a more powerful motor. It is miles better than the competition.5 out of 5 if it wasn’t for the touchscreen display washout and the feathery throttle pedal. Bottom Line: If you want the best looking, best handling compact SUV in the world, your search stops here.Details of Issues (nothing major)ExpensiveHas better performance technology than the competition which costs a little more; but even so, still seems a bit pricey.Windshield Blocks Radio FrequenciesThe windshield is metalized resulting in the blocking of radio frequencies. There is a small clear patch to place your Toll Tag. So the range of wireless devices will be reduced (up to 95%), including; door and gate openers, phones, RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and medical alert. Feather Light and Overly Sensitive Throttle PedalAlmost no foot feel and too sensitive. A bumpy road, a sharp corner or just acceleration forces can cause unwanted acceleration spurts (jerking). Also, you have to hold your foot up all the time when just cruising. It feels unnatural and a little uncomfortable. Thank goodness for the excellent adaptive cruise control. Touchscreen WashoutThe touchscreen difficult to see in bright daylight and is barely visible in bright sunny conditions. The problem is that the display sits angled almost flat well ahead of the roofline and there is no sunshade, so the sun shines right on it. Accentuated by no high contrast color scheme option, just “Light” (light pastel) or “Dark”. It’s fine at night or on dreary days.Windshield Reduces Night VisionThe windshield is metalized to block UV rays which it does well. It also cuts down visible light reducing normal vision just like sunglasses or regular window tint does. The problem is that it also reduces vision at night too when you need maximum clarity. Road NoiseRoad (tire) noise is noticeable and could benefit from improved floor and wheel arch insulation.Automatic Relocking & ArmingOnly the dealership can turn it on or off. I can see the reason for automatic locking and arming in high crime areas. In the country, the automatic system is annoying and inconvenient. There should be an easy way to turn the feature on and off.Door Locked Condition IndicatorNo visible external indicator that the doors are locked (except the folding door mirrors). In a noisy bright light situation, it’s difficult to see (light flash) or hear the doors lock. Automatic Power Fold Door MirrorsUseful option, but it can only be turned on and off by the dealership? Keyless Door LockingKeyless locking is overly complicated and imprecise (Unlocking is great). The manual goes into detail not to grab the door handle while touching the lock sensor. In reality, it is only necessary to be lightly touching the handle for the sensor not to work; or if your finger touches a little outside of the sensor area. One could turn on the auto locking full time, but that causes other irritating convenience issues.Restricted Driver’s Foot WellNo good place to put your left foot if you have long legs. Wheel well intrudes into this space. I guess people with long legs shouldn’t drive compact SUVs on long trips.Reflections from Bright Shiny BezelsReflection in driver’s side mirror from bright shiny driver’s side air vent bezel. Can be a distraction. Reflections from bright shiny bezels (air vents and display) on front windshield.Driver’s Maximum Seat HeightThe front dash and side windows sills are quite high. I found that with the seat all the way up, I still felt like I was sitting a bit too low (1 inch).",4

I thought this would be a good alternative despite being almost $10,000 more. However, the tech is extremely lacking, the interior is simple but my Chevy Cruze rs is just as nice. So no big points there. Also, the car has less then 2,000mi and been in the shop twice with transmission issues kicking it out of gear while driving down the road and not allowing you to select a gear, Essentially leaving you straded.
