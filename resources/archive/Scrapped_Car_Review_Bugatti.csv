When you drive this kind of car no one cares about fuel economy, you only care about the experience.",5

Unfortunately, ordering one from the factory involved a very long wait, so I purchased one from a fellow in the Middle East sight unseen. After many months of waiting, phone calls, and emails, the car was delivered to my East Coast home after 7 months. The car is absolutely gorgeous and is truly a work of art. But sadly I must admit that due to my height, my feet can't reach the pedals to operate it correctly. My two brothers have enjoyed it immensely as they are taller than myself. I just made the decision to sell it at auction with a no reserve price. Best of luck if you bid on it. ",4.5

Beautiful car, however not practical.It will get you the attention that you want, but for this price you are better off buying a used lear jet which will get you further for less cost. The tires themselves cost $30,000 or $12/mile for wear and tear, and overall maintenance is approximately $25-30/mile.Pure joy to drive, however,yet the price makes it affordable only to the super wealthy who desire extreme attention or to the ultra serious car collector.",3.75
3, on 07/07/09 13:10 PM (PDT),bugattiowner ,2008 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (8.0L 16cyl Turbo 7AM),More Than a Car," After pondering which car to buy once I had traded in my Ferrari f40 and Ferrari f50 I began researching to find the best possible super car. The Bugatti Veyron impressed me the most so I purchased it. It has an understated exterior which is stylish simplicity and the interior is made from the highest quality materials.  The second you start the engine, you know that there is enormous power under the hood. It accelerates like nothing I have ever driven and it easily beats my Ferrari Enzo for speed. The acceleration is very linear and smooth. ",4.75

Aside from being the fastest most powerful car on the planet, it also more than succeeds as a fantastic daily driver. As soon as you step into the car you are surrounded by the finest materials and behind you sits an 8.0L W16 with four turbochargers. This drastic engine pumps out an unreal 1001 bhp and 922 ft lbs. of torque. It's an absolute marvel. The incredible thing about the car is not the massive performance... its the fact that you can outrun anything on public roads while on the way to pick your son up from school as I may do. The Veyron deserves the number one spot in any automotive hall of fame. Brilliant.",4.5

Delacroix ,2008 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Coupe 2dr Coupe AWD (8.0L 16cyl Turbo 7AM),"Excellent car, with some qualifications."," I purchased this car after an unfortunate mishap with my beloved Ferrari that involved a miniature Dachshund and high winds...but that's another story. I am indeed fond of this car and rather enjoy the looks it gets when parked. It is nearly as comfortable and useful as my beloved 1973 Chevrolet Blazer, but lacks the offroad capability of The Beast, as we called it.",4.25

When I first sat in it the seats wrapped around me as if they were molded to my body. And as I started it up you would have thought that I had lit the afterburners on a jet fighter. The 16 cyl. engine is loaded with all kinds of power. when you touch the gas it GOES (not to mention when the turbo kicks in!!). This car stands alone in a class by itself, way above the Lamborghini Diablo that I had purchased 5 months earlier. All in all this car is a dream!",4.75

There's actually no word I can use to describe the driving feelings. The only thing I can tell you is that I bought a Veyron base in 2006, and enjoyed every detail of it. So this year I bought another one with turbo for my wife. She loves it too. It's much much better than our previous MB SLR.",4.625

It is the most well designed and built car I have ever seen or driven. This is the platinum of performance cars ever built.,4.875
