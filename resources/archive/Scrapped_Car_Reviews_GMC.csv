The Duramax/Allison combo outshines the rest. I have hauled volleyball teams, 15000lbs 5th wheel up the Cascades, to work everyday and a multiple runs crosscounty and I smile everytime I start this truck up. Do I have complaints? One, the roof liner fit and finish leaves alot to be desired :( I have drove the rest and this is hands down the best. A Quiet diesel that can smoke the tires. I laugh when the Toyota boys try to pull something heavy up the mountains, they just don't have it. It will be the last truck I own. ",5

This truck has more power than the comparable Ford or Dodge, better mileage, and is MUCH quieter! (I'm a Dodge man) Mileage varies from 22 (cruise at 55mph, no load) to 12 (90mph with truck loaded and 14,000lb trailer). Plently of room in the cab and a full length bed too! Only problem with the truck is the moonroof has stuck open 3 times and lots of wind noise when open. The moonroof cover is designed more like a screen - the sun sure gets hot at an angle that directly shines on driver. The original tires had sidewall integrity problems at 55K. Goodyear great with warranty issues. The fuel gage takes a while to show that the tank is actually full (10min - 1hour).",4.875

Not sure what these other bad reviews are about? I have had no major problems. This truck pulls my 5th wheel better than anything on the road. Many Diesel magazines have given this truck its best in class award, and for good reason. Its a very comfortable truck to drive and loves to be hot rodded around.  I'm at 45000 miles looking forward to many years of driving and towing with this. I added a Delco navigation unit plus a Delco 6 cd changer, it was well worth the price. ",4.75

It has now been into the dealership twice with only 1200 miles on it. Since they can not get codes out of the computer they can not isolate the problem and fix it. This truck has been a nightmare. It has been to the dealership twice now for repair. I still do not have it back and they still can not figure out what is wrong.,2.125

The worst being a diagnosis, from a blood sample test, of carbon monoxide poisoning due to cab infilteration. This is caused by the missfiring of the injection electronics package and the poor cab fit and finish allowing the engine exhaust to get into the cab unless the recirculate mode is used on the heating system. Recirculate is defeated by the controller which will not allow the recirculate mode to be engaged except on max ac. The engine has very poor throttle response and smokes excessively under heavy acceleration. The engine has a propensity to consume oil. ",1.75

I was sent an email to update this -12/29/17.  Not sure why!  Still the same title for sure but now worse, entire dashboard is not functional, speedo does not work, all other gages peg out when starting the truck.  At least it is running-mostly. I have to hand pump the diesel filter to get the truck to start.  Happens about once a month or so.  (no it is not standar maintenance issue).  Replacing the batteries annually now (seems something is draining them when I am not looking!)I have received a call from Cust support about the dealer charge offering to reimburse some payment.  I would have even considered changing my review if he would have helped.  Then he disappeared!From the Dealer using my truck to tow the owners horse trailer (when turned in for maintenance) and adding 100 miles to it...to the more than $3000 I had to put into the electrical within 3 months-to the instrument panel stopping to work (speedo, then oil pressure, then battery-which comes and goes) $900 fix it so I just use a GPS for my speedo-to the rattle in the steering because of design issue always going out....to the electric seat positioning clicking 7-8 times before settling into place-to now the heater/AC blower stopped working and a cost of $750 to fix it at PEP Boys.Thanks to youtube the heater fix will only cost me $150 in parts.(my friend just had the same thing happen to his Tahoe and had to pay $750)The heater went out again in a couple of weeks.  replace resistor again, heater stopped again!Either this truck is a lemon OR my favorite GMC's are on their way out of business.(I am in Quality management and would not have allowed anything close to this happening where I work)",2

So far I am fully satisfied although I only have 30,000 km and time will provide more information on reliability of the Duramax.  I find it fun to drive and fuel efficiency is good compared to the other diesel (Ford & Chrysler).  It provide plenty of performance compare to a gas engine. The interior is perhaps blend as per the critics but it provides a price advantage compare to the Ford's King Ranch.  It does not take away from the performance.",4.125

My GMC has largely been used for hauling trailers, including my 35 foot fifth wheel, a car hauler and a 20 foot box trailer.  The diesel never falters, even on fairly sharp inclines.

I had an '01 F350 which was a great truck, but had some reliabilty problems and the brakes were not up to the task. The GMC is much better overall with towing and the interior is more car like. My biggest complaint about the truck is the gray steel rims with cheap trim rings. For over $40K the truck should be outfitted with Ford/Dodge similar rims.

The GMC is much more driver friendly with comfort and a more car like feel. Power from the Duramax is very good as compared to the ""chipped out"" F350. On the downside, the truck, although a softer feel overall, is a bit more bouncy than the Ford. Interior room is much smaller in the front and rear of the crew-cab. ",4

Gas mileage is alright(15 in town, 18 hwy). Since this is a 1 ton truck I think gas mileage is not bad. Insurance company rates it as commerical (even though I do not use it that way) so insurance is cheaper. As a mother I am always always concerned about safety.

I am amazed at how quiet it can be and how real the improved gas mileage is.  I think that professional critics miss the fact that many people will be coming from older trucks and so any new truck today has a lot more to offer than trucks from days past.  This truck has a very solid and quiet feel to it while maintaining the versatility of a full size pickup.  They run e85 Fuel as well and in KS you can get a $750 credit if you use 500 GL in a year.

My initial impression is that this is a great vehicle.  I have all of the standard features of a Sierra with gas mileage averaging 21 MPG combined City/Highway.  Outstanding!  Contrary to Expert reviews, I would not agree with assessments that transitions shifts between electric and gas as seamless.  On the contrary, these transitions can be felt-- abruptly in some instances.  I also have concerns regarding the transition between regenerative and hydraulic brakes.  In some instances, my brakes have actually disengaged momentarily making me feel as though I might roll into the vehicle in front of me.  A very uncomfortable feeling.  ",4.125

There is up to a 3-4 second lag where absolutely no throttle input is given to the engine, no matter how hard you press on the accelerator.

At first I had a problem with the transmission not downshifting easily in the 25-50 mph range, but the dealer flashed the ECU and now it's more responsive (although a bit less smooth- shifting - before it was like silk). Fuel economy has been mostly around 10-11 in the city, anywhere from 12-18 on the highway (the faster you go, the worse it gets). Most impressive is the quality.

I read many forums stating that blowing the smoke was normal and some said it was abnormal.  The exhaust system is stock as far as I know.  The truck seemed to run fine and was as strong as ever.  I became a bit worried about having to replace the injectors.

Been with Ford all my driving life.  So far, a great truck. Excellent power, very quiet and greater than 20 mpg on highway when unloaded.  Seems tightly made. 2008 F250 previously; a great truck but physically too large for my needs. GMC offers similar towing performance, better mileage so far and a better ride in a physically smaller package-- with diesel power. Overall, I think the GMC offering is the top overall in the 2500/250 line for daily use/driving. I was not impressed with Dodge quality; my Ford was great but meant for wide open, all day towing.  GMC offered the best package with the fewest comprimises. Very happy so far.",4.75

I have owned about ten 1/2 ton trucks over the last 40 years. I have owned mostly Ford trucks.  GMC has really done well with this truck.  It is the 6.0 gasser.  I haul a travel trailer and perform routine around the house hauling.  The powertrain and load performance difference between the GMC 1500 5.3 and 2500HD is huge.  I get better gas mileage pulling a trailer with this truck vs. my 2008 GM 1500 5.3 gasser.  I have been getting 17mpg on the highway without a load.  11 mpg pulling a 7000lb trailer on the highway.

Came from an 08 Toyota Tundra 5.7L and the GMC can not only haul twice the weight and tow 5000lbs more but it also rides smoother when empty.  It returns 20mpg unloaded on the highway and the engine note is just enough to remind you that you're driving a diesel but quiet enough to be mistaken for a gasser.  The interior is also a nicer place to be than in the Toyota, with more style and materials of a slightly higher quality.  The Allison transmission is very smooth and always shifts at the right times.  Test drove against the F250 and found the GMC a better all rounder, that stopped and accelerated better.

The 4x4 system proved problematic for the 1st year and once fixed worked well (it's only used 4-5 a year for a mile or two each time). The rear bearings needed to replace at 18,000 miles.

Slight rust on the cab corners and rockers, and the spare tire cable rusted and the tire fell off. As far as reliability, it's been among the best I've owned. It's not a powerhouse, but the little 2.2 does well when mated to the 5 speed. It doesn't seem to like interstate travel, as its runs about 3k rpms at 75 mph, but it cruises right along.

They are solid and a lot less pricey than the Toyota Tacomas.  It's a good looking little truck that is pleasant to operate. The 4.3 L engine seems to be this truck's best feature. Shifting (automatic) is sometimes jerky, but not too bad. These trucks have a typical rear leaf spring fracture, and I ended up with a whole new set of rear springs and shocks all around. The plastic GMC uses for their interiors must be made by the Mattel toy company -- cracks easily and is very hard to repair. Sounds like I don't like the truck, but I do. It's been reliable, and is relatively comfortable. Rear jump seats are pretty much useless, and the rear area (extended cab) is difficult to access unless you get the third door -- which I WISH I had held out for! Bought the truck used with under 100K, now have 140K and could sell it for more than I paid. Overall a decent little truck that will haul WAY over its rated load capacity. I get 18.5 around town and 21 - 22 on long highway trips.  UPDATE: I put on a set of Hancook tires with a more aggressive (but not too extreme) tread pattern that is pretty good off-road, but not so great on the highway -- a little squirrely tracking, and they have reduced my milage by one to one & a half miles. Great tires, just not fuel efficient, so now I'm getting about 17 around town and probably 20 - 21 hwy. Still like the vehicle, and how have just about 150,000 on it.",4

I realize many are skeptical of these reviews, but I felt compelled to provide a review of my recent experiences.  I purchased a new 2017 GMC Yukon Denali in August of 2017.  In less than a year and 12,000 miles, I've had significant issues.  First, I had issues with the Collision Detection system.  The Haptic Seat Motor has been replaced once and is now throwing the same error message, in fact this is a know issue by GM (https://gm.oemdtc.com/4389/pit5445a-diagnostic-tip-service-driver-assist-message-2014-2017-cadillac-chevrolet-gmc)  My $75K Yukon is now heading to the dealership Monday for repair for the third time for this particular issue. The last time around, they couldn't find anything wrong.   Now for the bigger issue, I just got the truck back earlier this week for an issue with the Lifters and Lifter rods.  About 2 weeks ago I noticed a ticking coming from the engine. After taking it to the dealership, I was informed that their were issues with the lifters. The dealership has just rebuilt the entire right side of the engine.  Again, GM is well aware of the issues based on their service bulletin ( https://gm.oemdtc.com/3656/15-06-01-002f-engine-misfire-tick-noise-malfunction-indicator-lamp-mil-illuminated-with-dtc-p0300-set-2014-2018-cadillac-chevrolet-gmc).  In fact, they just modified the bulletin to include the 2018 models of the Tahoe, Yukon and Escalade.  It's evident that GM engineering cannot figure out how to engineer the AFM ( Automatic Fuel Management) system based on the government's mileage regulations.  After getting my Yukon back, it was back in the shop a day later, as the water pump was defective, throwing a screeching noise. For $75K you should certainly consider other vehicles.  I love the look of the truck, however be warned, the quality is less than acceptable. Those are real services bulletins issued by GM, therefore buyer beware.  Before you consider buying a GMC truck, please take a moment to review the extensive list of Services Bulletins released by GM.  They should be embarrassed by the extensive list and the poor quality of the vehicles they are manufacturing.",1

We really liked the Lexus LX 570 but the price 90K+.  We looked at the Infiniti QX80 and while it was clearly the most luxurious the exterior was less than desirable.  We considered the Cadillac Escalade but found that it had the same capacity and motor as the GMC Yukon Denali at 20K+ dollars more with interior differences.  We also considered the Tahoe but when we priced it out with all the options it was the same price as the Denali.  All in all the Yukon was the best bang for the buck and quite frankly it just looked better.  Our research showed that it was a mix of happiness with owners from 15 and 16 years as these models had alot or recurring issues.  We learned that many of the issues were to be resolved in 2017 and decided to lease one.  Ours is fully loaded and we really like the technology GM brought to the table.  The onstar app and myGMC app are designed well.  Our only issue is that sometimes the apple play does't start when connected to the iPhone and we are unsure if it is the USB port or the iPhone cable.   It gets great gas mileage as well.   We really like the look and the ride and love the fact that is a truck base SUV vs a car base which provides us with more options.

I own a 2003 Yukon since new and it has 275k no work has been done on the engine or trans, bottom line is that they are not built the way they used to be.  For close to the same price as a Denali, we bought a Mercedes Benz GLS 450, tows what we need, better warranty, built like no other SUV, and much better resale value.

Automatic folding seats are nice when doing a Costco trip or traveling. What we did notice, which really had me wondering is the very rear cargo area does not have a light!

For the time this was plush, all leather, big capacity for people and cargo. It always got about 16MPG, and at the time with little kids, I needed room more than saving 3-4 MPG on a foreign SUV with tight quarters. The legroom was so good, I can't to this day find the same in a smaller SUV, although I just purchased a Toyota Highlander to downsize as my kids are grown and gone. To be fair, 6 years ago I had to replace the engine at 166K (Blue smoke, dealer said he could not rebuild the engine for under $3900. Bought brand new GMC replacement engine and had it installed for $6000, because I thought that was better than making payments. I'm now at 285K so I have 120K miles on the new engine. A wonderful ride, sluggish when you need to step on the gas on the highway, feels like a pickup truck then.  Still for $34K ($28 originally and $6K for the engine) a great deal. Have not needed to replace much, starter, batteries, never needed a brake job! Even now as I sell it, it is pretty nice. Paint held up for 10 years, still shines. Typical GMC with a couple of electrical issues (Seat heater stopped working, big LED bar in back needed to be replaced) but overall glad I had it in my family for a decade. Edit- Never did sell it, gifted to my 25 year old son, he sold his Subaru, needed a big vehicle to haul band equipment. Spark Plugs and wire job at 300K (150K on new engine).

My front seating area has the optional third seat or the console flips down as an arm rest or acts as a pass through for handing items to passengers in the middle seats. True, the gas mileage is bad, but I like being up off the roadway.

The Denali has a better value per dollar than the Escalade.  The Denali should get better mileage after it is broken in than my 2007 Escalade because of the active fuel management.  Mileage of Escalade at 68-70 mph with a K&N air filter was over 21 mpg at times.  In town average was 16.9 over three years.  Denali should be better. Performance in deep snow should be excellent. Most driving will be long cross country.  Will give updates after break in.",4.875

This past weekend I was able to take my new Denali up to the local mountains and as lucky enough to be there for a decent sized storm. The truck hard no problem at all driving through the rough conditions. It gave me and my 5 passengers a good sense of security as we tooled around town without any heart stopping moments. I have a 23' Centurion Enzo wake-boarding boat that weighs roughly 6,000 lbs. and is a piece of cake to tow with the powerful 6.2 L engine. Gas mileage isn't good but its what you can only expect.

Three years and 8 months in, I just love my Yukon. First the bad - fuel mileage sucks. But you know this anyway, it's a big bulky vehicle, so, moot point. My only other complaint is a lack of storage cubby spaces in the cabin, like for spare glasses, water bottles, cell phone, lip gloss and the like. I think such a big vehicle needed more little storage spaces for the driver. I'm a little old lady and even stuff sitting on the passenger seat is too awkward to get to when I'm driving. The good...everything else. I bought mine used with 110,000 miles, now have 160k. It seriously looks practically new inside and out except for some little brewing rust bubbles under the paint, inevitable in Michigan. In the 3 years 8 months I've owned it I've replaced one set of tires, the key fob, a windshield wiper blade mount, AC compressor, one headlight and did a full tune up. Oh and the trim piece on the drivers side is missing a clip and now rattles but that is an easy fix. Not bad. The good: It's beautifully smooth and powerful on the freeway. I can cruise at xx mph and feel like I'm in my living room lol. It seems happy at 80 mph. The sound system is fabulous; with a $5.00 adaptor cable I can play everything from my phone. Visibility is good. Not exactly nimble because of the bulk and height but maneuverable enough in tight spaces and city driving once you get used to it (backup sensors help) and I feel very safe and ""large and in charge"" in my Yukon. Did get a quilted rear seat protector cover so my 190 lb Mastiff wouldn't mess up the leather. ;) All in all I just love driving this truck and I get a lot of compliments even though it's 11 years old.

In addition, the driver side air conditioner blows out HOT when set on the coldest setting while the passenger side works fine so I have to close all the vents on the driver side and put the passenger side vents on me to get cool air.

What?  A few other things: The accelerator really bugs me. It is difficult to push down which gives the impression the car is bogging down. The auto back seat fold option doesn’t fold the seats all the way flat. And the worst, it’s a huge pain to try and get a loner car at GMC. My Acura MDX was super easy to service, always had a loaner available at no charge and cleaned my car every time. By the way, that car was $20k less than a Yukon!

Cost $1000 (mainly because we were stranded out of town and could not shop around for repair). ABS doesn't work. There was a recall in Canada, but it doesn't apply to the US. It will cost about $800 to fix. Intake gasket leaked ,causing loss of heat/coolant - cost $800 to fix.  Overall I'm very happy witht he choice. The truck has become too unreliable for my wife and young kids, so it's time for a new car. I'd definitely get the 2005 or later Expedition if I got another SUV.

I plan on leasing on new 2018 when my lease matures.  Everything I needed and expected from this model was delivered as promised.

I could only find GMC and Ford Ranger offering 4 cylinder engines and only GMC was available with the crew cab and a 5-speed standard transmission.

For highway driving, the mpg has ranged up to 29.3 mpg for one long trip with no load. The Ford Ranger is EPA rated slightly higher than EPA rates the Canyon 4 cylinder, but the Ford Ranger 4 cyl is slightly less horsepower.

Some reviewers have complained that the interior is not as good as they thought it should be.  I contend that this vehicle is not a sedan and, therefore, their expectations are not realistic.  I'm disappointed that the fog lamp button is not accessible through the light panel on an ""after market"" fog lamp installation.

Visibility poor because of steering wheel. Really have to move head off windshield and under steering wheel to see setting.  Getting In/Out of truck I seem to bump switches with knee, don't really feel it. Must check every time. Leased truck for 6 weeks right now. Feel 4wd dragging when first moving. Look down and moved to 4wd-low. Was set at Auto or 4wd High. Must stop completely and reset. Same thing with headlight lamp switch. Get out of truck and thought I was in auto, find out I was in headlamp full on. 2nd: Best gas mileage average is 16.6. Between 0-40 miles/hour your lucky to get 8-12 miles/gallon. Rated 17 City - 21 Highway.  Highway 18-20 miles/gallon. Can get more if you like playing lightly on gas pedal. Slow acceleration and coasting when reaching top speed. Really have to play with gas pedal. 3rd: Transmission shifting from  0-20 miles/hour not smooth. Must really barely touch gas pedal to get smooth shift. Otherwise truck revs from 1500/2000rpm to 3500 and quickly drops back to 1000 rpm. Truck jerks during that shift. My old 2004 Ford Explorer Sport Trak much smoother. 4th: Purchased bed extender and double fold tonneau cover. Cover hold downs poor design. Very tough to clamp on brackets. Have to have dead aligned. If you open cover and fold, hold downs fold in and slide out of position. Took nail polish to mark correct spot. Still sometimes miss. Can see this plastic and extended screw mechanism breaking. Then with the bed extender, hold downs are behind the side bars of the bed extender. Fun getting in there. Dealer had no samples on floor. Was sorry I purchased. Even the service manager didn't know how to use hold downs. Bed extender when extended is tethered into tailgate latches. Cheap, won't last long. Again my old Ford designs much better. Tried to give GMC site my review, but could not find a link at the site. Too bad Ford doesn't make a truck this size again. Ranger too small, F150 too big and not as smooth a ride as the Sport Trak or the Canyon. BRING BACK THE SPORT TRAK!!",4
1222, on 11/23/17 15:12 PM (PST),Andy Paul ,2017 GMC Canyon Crew Cab 4dr Crew Cab SB (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Beware the Chevy Lean!," Beware the Chevy Lean, surprising that neither Edmunds nor Consumer Reports has addressed this issue! I purchased a 2017 Canyon in October of 2017 after a painful buying experience with the local dealer. I was looking at the Colorados and Canyons based on their high ratings from Edmunds and Consumer reports and that they were US made. The following morning I noticed the truck leaned significantly to the left, almost 1"" when I measured it in my garage. I took it to the dealer who put it on a rack and measured it at 3/8"" and said it was within GM spec.s and it was purely cosmetic. I had the dealer take it out on the concrete at the showroom and we measured it at 3/4"", dealer said slab could be sloped so turned truck around and put in same place and got 3/4"" again. They contacted GM who said they were working on a fix and opened a case file and I was told to wait for a fix. A couple of weeks later I found out on the internet that this has been ongoing on Chevys and GMCs to the extent it even has a name, ""The Chevy Lean"". Given the years it has been going on, I am wary if GM is indeed actually working on a fix since they haven't fixed it after all these years. I called GM and a Senior Customer Service Adviser called me back. She said she didn't know automotive lingo or technology(Just my luck) but had talked to the dealer who said it was within spec. Case closed! My advice is to stand back 30' or so and check before you sign and drive it home because once you do it's yours and could affect your resale!",3
1223, on 10/28/17 06:50 AM (PDT),Gregory ,2017 GMC Canyon Crew Cab SLE 4dr Crew Cab 4WD LB (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Love the 2.8L Duramax Canyon," To clarify, we have a 2017 GMC Canyon that is an SLE All Terrain (Z71) 4x4 with the 2.8L Duramax Turbo Diesel engine and a 6-speed automatic transmission. Edmunds doesn't have that choice, so until they do, I'll leave this post here for someone looking into one of these.  This is a great truck. We wanted something smaller than a 2500HD Silverado; don't really need all that much truck. But we wanted to be able to tow things when we need to, for the reasons that you need a truck in the first place. The wife's 2012 Jeep Liberty just didn't cut it there....When we found out they were putting a diesel in these trucks, we were set on getting one. Chose the Canyon over the Colorado because the Canyon just looks more full-size truck looking. The diesel does cost more, it adds $5,000 to the price vs the V6 gas engine. But it's worth it, especially if you tow any. Less downshifting while accelerating or going up hills with a load (or unloaded). And the truck gets up to 30+ mpg on the highway. Lifetime average on the trucks computer is 27.4 mpg. Would be higher, even with city driving, but when the truck goes into a regen mode burning of soot in the DPF, it kills your mpg's and you can tell while watching your instant MPG's. I have hand calculated tanks of fuel and it is usually within a 0.5 mpg. Acceleration is a bit doggy especially compared to a gas engine. Having all the emissions equipment on the truck causes the to hesitate on takeoff if you mash the pedal, you have to just drive it and find the right spot in the pedal and then it takes off alright and then you can mash it from there. If you haul much, you definitely want a long bed. Towing is great with the tow/ haul mode that uses transmission and exhaust braking to slow you down. Not a whole lot of storage on the inside like under/ behind the seats or seat spacing for passengers, but it is a mid-size truck; if you want more, you need a full-size truck or SUV. The ride is smooth and quiet inside the cab. I have no problems getting in and out of the cab as I have heard others who are cramped trying to get out of the seat, but I am only 5'5"". It is a shorter truck, but there is still a little drop getting to the ground, especially being short so I added side steps to help. Seats are comfortable on long distance drives. SLE All-Terrain models (SLT and Denali's as well) come with heat seaters for driver and passenger which is nice when it's cold or if your back is sore. Driver and passenger seats are both power adjustable forward/ backward and up/ down. Being a diesel, you do have some additional costs like DEF, higher fuel cost usually, more expensive repairs/ parts, using anti-gel treatment in the winter for the fuel. But for the gains you get, it's worth it for me. I have heard of others who have had issues with the emissions system on these (DEF injection or DPF plugging up prematurely mainly) with their trucks. I have not had any issues with the truck in 23,000 miles. I know many others who have not had issues either. The trucks that do have the problems are still under warranty and GM is taking care of them. Overall, a great truck, definitely glad we went with it and would do it again.",5

Cons:  for a mid size truck the height of the vehicle(getting in and out) is slightly difficult(I'm 5'11""). You have to raise your right foot 2 feet to get into the truck.  The trucks rear end bumper is about 5 inches higher than the front.  It sits at an angle.  Level the truck off.  Lower the back end about 4-5 inches.  This would also lower getting in and out a couple of inches.  The top of the back gate is shoulder level.  Difficult getting things in and out of the back end. Had to buy a reacher like the old people use and a rake to get things out of the back end.   Again, lowering the back about 4"" would really help.  Really disappointed, NO CD player.  Everyone under the age of 30 probably has a CD collection which they can't use.  I gotta think this was done to force people to buy Sirrius/XM with GM probably getting a cut.  Also, the factory radio antenna adds 9 more inches.  Couldn't get truck into garage.  Bought after market antenna that works fine and lowered the overall height by 5-6 inches.  Why not the shark fin antenna like the suburbans?  If GMC would level off the truck and lower it by about 3-4 inches it would be perfect.  And put the CD back in.

Combine the extra power, all the electric options/conveniences, and an automatic and you have a great commute vehicle.   I looked at the Chevy Colorado, Toyota Tacoma, and a full size Silverado to compare.

This truck serves as a daily commuter and work truck hauling anything from construction debris to loads of gravel. The 242hp 5cyl. engine has plenty of power compared to competitors' V6s. The 4-spd auto is very smooth at all times. Now at 100k miles, we've had absolutely no trouble from either. The skinny tires that come standard on the WT trim offer very poor grip overall. Poor wet/snow traction. Poor roadholding ability. The WT trim should have received the wider tires that come standard on upper trims. The interior is spacious and relatively comfortable, but horribly cheap in quality. Everything is nasty hard plastic. There are terrible panel gaps. There's been a random, but persistent chirping/squeaking noise that seems to be coming either from the driver's door or driver's seat. Thankfully it's not a daily occurrence because it's incredibly annoying. The nuts holding part of the driver's door hinge to the body routinely loosened themselves. The dealer finally secured them with some glue and they haven't loosened since. The only other issues have been: an emissions control module failed at about 45k miles, causing the ""check engine"" light to illuminate. It was taken care of under the 80k mile emissions warranty. The rotors were noticeably warped at 10k miles, replaced under warranty, and feel warped again (pulsating brake pedal). The center mount brake light seal has been leaking rain water into the cabin since early days. It's a stupid design with a cheap foam gasket that provides a poor water-tight seal. The most recent issue was the ignition switch failing. I'd turn the key and nothing would happen. The latest issue is a sticking front brake caliper. If the truck sits unused for more than 2 or 3 days, one of the front calipers sticks engaged. Some pedal pumping and rolling the truck back and forth seems to get it to release. Although far from flawless, I don't consider this degree of reliability too terrible for 100k miles worth of driving. We plan on keep this truck until the wheels fall off, so we shall see how longer-term reliability is with this truck.",4

SLT interior is rather nice.  It sucks fuel, less than 14 mpg in city driving with the 3.6 V6.  The transmission, WHAT A JOKE!!! It has no idea what gear it wants to be in, constantly hunts and when it does pick one, it's 2 gears too high for the situation.  Case in point, turned left into my neighborhood, speedometer says 18 mpg.  Press the gas pedal to accelerate. . .nothing, downshift it (which causes it to drop one gear and actually display the number rather than the D), and it's in 4th gear.  That means, it was in 5th gear of a 6 speed transmission going 18 mph.  How does that make any sense??  I drive it like a manual with the manual shift just to have power when I need it. Now, it's started a new ""feature""  You'll stop at a stop sign, or a light with the tranny in drive and when you press the gas pedal to go.  NOTHING.  No RPM increase, no movement, look at the shifter and the D is flashing red.  It's almost killed me 3 times so far and just this morning, did the same thing trying to reverse out of the garage.

I have had it over a year now, and could see myself in it for years. It is very comfortable, handles like an SUV, and the interior is great. I had one small issue with the infotainment not booting one time, but it was quickly resolved by turning the truck off and back on. So now on the bad news. THIS IS THE WORST TRANSMISSION EVER! They have programmed the shift points to make it more fuel-efficient (which it's really not). MPGs are great, but not at the expense of driver comfort and safety. The thing just will not downshift when it needs to. So the scenario would be like this.. Youre cruising along at 45 mph and it's rolling in 5th gear. You come to a slight incline and give a it a bit more gas to stay at 45. A normal transmission would drop to 4th gear as soon as it started to struggle. well NOT this one. It tries to stay in 5th gear until you can literally feel the torque converter giving up. The only way to get it to downshift is to quickly press the gas pedal to ask for more power. But THEN, does it downshift to 4th? No, it drops 2 gears so now youre revving high in 3rd gear for no reason. GMC could easily fix the shift points with a new ECU flash, but for some reason just continue to ignore us.",3

Major factor for me was the reduced pricing (was able to buy for 37K + fees) -would not have bought the diesel if it was over 40k.  At that price would have gone with the Sierra.  Here are the things I really like so far: Parking is so much easier than full size truck, fits in the garage, crew cab has plenty of room for family of 4, fuel mileage, cosmetically pleasing exterior - it actually looks like a smaller version of the Sierra.  The leather interior, infotainment system and back up camera are all nice features.   I love the purr of the duramax and can't wait to tow something or go up in the mountains. Here are my complaints:  drivers seat does not have enough adjustments and not comfortable on longer drives (I bought a cushion at Costco for extra padding) I am average build, so was surprised abought the comfort level of the seating.

If you're an older guy like me you'll like the more refined, formal look of the interior.  Overall I am very satisfied with this truck; my wife enjoys driving it also.",4

Poor fit and finish, cheap plastic, two parts broke first week , one on the first day.  Finally got them replaced.  Oil indicator is messed up, had 53% life with 250 miles, now has 850 miles and only 40% now.  Either not reset at the factory correctly or the electronics are messed up.  The truck looks great, is fairly comfortable, just rough over bumps, but it is a truck.  I have read a lot of horror stories today about GM's customer service and that frightens me.  This is first $40,000 vehicle I have ever owned and now that I am retired I had hoped to have a good truck that would last for a long time.  I hope it does and that I don't have to deal much with customer service.  I will speak with the customer satisfaction representative tomorrow at Linus GMC and see if he can get me some help with the oil indicator issue.   I still like the truck, just hope nothing else crops up.",4

My last GMC was a 2003 and I put nearly a quarter of a million miles on it before it was destroyed by a reckless driver. I bought the new Canyon pick-up in the winter it was running and worm when I took it for the test-drive. Which turned out to be a huge mistake on my part.I also looked at important specifications, and window sticker nomenclature.(1) The ability to tow up to 7000 LBSThis I do not believe can be done. I pull a small 8x10 trailer including cargo of just 350 lbs. I figure it was about 2500 lbs. it’s like pulling a house down the road at 7 MPG. Not just handling the power plant was over rot trying to keep the rig at highway speeds without even attempting to pass ( wouldn’t even consider it with the way the motor was behaving) A fifteen minute drive took nearly a quarter of a tank in gas I’ve never seen anything like that EVER.(2) Gas mileage is just bad! 7-8 MPG with trailer!I may as well be driving the bigger rig this is not saving me a dime.(3) The on board computer is very slow – very, very slow.In today’s computing world this is so frustrating having to wait long periods of time more than (30) seconds to boot - to have the tools and information to proceed on a trip. It’s not covered under warranty yet runs the entire truck so if it quits. Well that’s a problem. now the screen keeps blacking out even after being in for repair on this issue.(4) Acceleration letting off the gas on a freeway ramp or navigating traffic and re-pressing the gas to find the motor (missing) no power!This happens allot and it’s a terrible issue. The shop said (“they are aware of that, it’s within spec”)The motor behaves like it’s stalling when the gas is re-applied – so, frustrating and a little scary when trying to get on a highway.(5) Maps that are way out of date.I travel daily and find that the navigation does not include neighborhood’s that have been established for 5 or more years.(6) Under-poweredGranted I’m used to a V8 but was told that “THIS HAS ALL THE POWER OF AN OLD V8” in your nomenclature and advertising.In short; I do not believe that you’re advertising, window sticker, sales team or nomenclature was truthful about what I could expect from this (Professional grade) truck. I’ve had it in the shop 4 times in 10,000 miles. I’m a self-employed and this was a major deal for me – Now being told the truck is running at specification. I’m really stuck. Tried to trade out of it only to be told I would get less than 3/4 its value so that’s a no go -- to be that upside-down. I do not know where to turn, this unit is not anything like what I was told it could do. There are other nuisances, what were you thinking - things that I could live with, but the power and towing is unacceptable! I have talked to other people what have the exact same experience- issues I’m having with this new truck!",1

Did it because the 2.8l diesel is new in the USA ( tho not new in Asia apparently).. Truck accelerates good enough for highway but does even better passing over 50 because of torque . Going up hill the truck doesn't sweat it. Gas mileage is great which really hooked me.

I listen to a lot of books on CD. Now I have to convert to a thumb drive to listen. However, that is not to say that I don't love this truck. I travel extensively on business and hate airports - so...if it's less that 12 hours, I drive. I've owned Ford Tauruses in the past and I always thought they were a comfortable ride, until the Canyon. No fatigue, and I could drive it a long way without having a sore butt! Even my wife says it is more comfortable than her 2015 Buick Enclave! I'm sold on this truck, even though I had wished that Ford had a mid-size! Ford's loss!",5

I love this truck!! It has great power once the turbo spools up. It takes a second for this to happen so there is a slight hesitation upon sudden acceleration but for the size of this motor it pulls really well. I paid $42,100 before tax and license which is a bit much but better than 60 grand for a full size diesel truck. The canyon is no small truck. It has a 6'2"" bed (long bed) that is large enough for most loads and it still fits in my garage. I get 23mpg around town and 28 highway witch isn't bad at all. The technology is amazing. You can send or receive text messages without ever taking you hands off the wheel or eyes off the road and the bose stereo sounds great! The exhaust brake (jake brake) is a nice little feature that will extend brake life too! I highly recommend this truck to anyone looking for a midsize truck they can fit in their garage and still handle all the tasks the average light duty truck owner has. Its not cheap but far better than the toyota tacoma or nissan frontier. I am sold on this little diesel engine.Update: after owning this truck for a year and half I am still very pleased with it. I recently towed a 6000 pound trailer 50 miles trough some mountains and it did great! It was sluggish on steep grades but did the job. On flat surfaces and slight upgrades it pulls well. I still got well over 20 Miles per gallon while towing this trailer. I normally get close to 30 without towing. It’s a great little truck and I would replace it with another one in a second.",5

Walked in to the dealer and saw they had 2 of the new Canyons with the 2.8L Duramax engine. Was an expensive up grade from the 3.6L gas BUT having owned it a month totally worth it:1. Around town/highway getting 25 mpg avg2. On a recent drive from Portland OR to San Francisco it did it on one tank of diesel (it must hold more than 21 gallons when topped off) and with it showing 30 mpg at highway speeds all the way (plus its 4WD)3. Fully loaded with 5 adults and 5 sets of camping gear in the Mountains you would think it was hauling just me, the engine and gear box are fantasic.My wife did not like the ride or roughness of the Jeep so when I bought this I did not tell her it was a diesel, it was only a week later, having riden in it a number of times, she was stood next to it when I used the remote start that she said ""your engine is making a funny noise""Over all car like ride on the open road, pick up truck for carrying loads (same length but slightly narrow than a full size truck) and an engine that as all the power I need and then more but makes me smile when I see the price of diesel is $0.50 lower than gas where I live.",5

It's just the right size for maneuvering and also hauls welI really recommend test driving the canyon/Colorado before thinking about the Tacoma. I test drove the Tacoma vs the GMs several times.  As far as driveability there was no doubt I had to go with the Canyon. Noise- for a mid size segment this is second to none in noise and quiet cabin.

Remote start is awesome, although I am overusing it a bit so it did ding the gas mileage.  Overall I'm in the 19s, on highway only trips it gets around 21/22.  All Terrain tires probably does not help.  I had experience with a Ford Ranger in the 90s and as expected this is light years beyond.  In some ways it exceeds the interior of the Mercedes I traded in, although the Mercedes did have some bells and whistles this does not, such as dual zone climate control.  While some reviewers do not like the infotainment, I think it works quite well and like it better than the Mercedes, and the voice activation is really easy to use.  I did notice on some hilly highway driving it had to downshift to keep up at 65/70 mph, but otherwise have had no problem with power or acceleration.  I'm coming from Xenon headlights versus the Halogen that comes standard here and I will probably look into brighter lights at some point.

Unfortunately for some reason the two local dealers decided that anyone wanting a LB would get it in white and the cloth seats of a SLE trim. A 6' bed isn't what I would call a long bed but definitely better than a 5' bed. Again only in white so that was that and ended up with a SB. Ride isn't the greatest but will wait till 5K miles when everything is broken in before upgrading to Bilsteins and those brake pads need to go as I can't be rinsing down the rims everytime I drive the truck due to that black residual dust. For me I just wanted out of a full sized truck and didn't care for the Toyota leaving the only other options a Canyon or a Colorado.At 8000 miles I changed the shocks to Bilstein HD all around. This didnt help the ride as much as I had hoped to. Rides horribly on our expansion jointed freeways. So I finally decided to dump the truck for a new 2017 Honda Ridgeline. Rides great but not really a truck but hey something for something until my next truck.,4

Exceptional ride, handling and interior comfort with a very quiet cab.  Fit and finish is excellent and the 8-inch color touchscreen is remarkable.  Full-size trucks are too big for my needs and although the Canyon is large, it drives like a mid-sized car  Gas mileage is around 22 mpg mixed city/hwy and 25 mpg pure hwy.  The Canyon is a great alternative to a full-size truck or SUV.UPDATE - Have now had the truck for 6 months and 4200 miles.  Still love it.  Best 50 mile trip mpg is 28.5 mpg.  Especially like the Android Auto feature - no need for factory navigation.  I feel like I should list some negatives, but there are so few.  Front seats could be a bit wider, would like built in Homelink and rear parking sensors.  Overall = A+UPDATE - Now at 2 years and 18000 miles.  Still a great truck and still an A+ overall.  Still drives great and extremely quiet inside.  Only dealer visits have been 2 oil changes, Android Auto software install and a recall to put a clamp around the heater blend door shaft.  All free.  Best 50 mile trip mpg is 30.5  I am particular about my vehicles and so far this is one of the best.  The combination of a great interior and pickup bed is ideal for a 1 car family.UPDATE - Now at 2.5 years and 22500 miles.  No complaints and no dealer visits as I am doing my own oil changes and tire rotations.  Overall MPG for life of vehicle is 22.4 as calculated by DIC.",5

1421, on 12/13/17 12:37 PM (PST),Kevin ,2016 GMC Canyon Extended Cab SLE 4dr Extended Cab SB (2.5L 4cyl 6A),OK truck that misses the mark," Overall this truck gets kudos for good ride quality and low noise levels. However, the 2.5L 4Cyl. doesn't belong in this vehicle. The gas mileage is horrible. I have averaged just a tick under 19MPG in 28K miles of driving. I've owned full size trucks with V-8 motors that deliver almost the same economy. In the city, this truck barely delivers 17.  There is a persistent sound of rushing water near the heater core when the truck is cold, a problem GM cannot fix. The transmission hunts for gears at the slightest incline on the highway.  The transmission will slip from 3rd to 4th gear on occasion and it gets confused  when driving in traffic and will make abrupt downshifts. The steering wanders and the truck veers at the slightest inputs on the highway.  The light switch and 4wd drive switch are located out of view and are blocked by the steering wheel. The cruise control light is in the area between 65-75 MPH on the speedometer and gets blocked by the needle. The radio display goes dark sometimes for no reason and other times shows a distracted driving warning at random. The On Star system randomly tells me the car is equipped with On Star. The engine stumbles at idle like it has a misfire. The truck has developed a persistent squeaking coming from the rear suspension and a clicking noise at low speeds from the front.  As this truck is again, more rattles are also developing in the interior.  The front seats become uncomfortable after about an hour of driving. The rear seats are utterly useless, they should have at least put a bench seat  in the rear so you can sit sideways. The truck is equipped with a power seat, auto headlights, bluetooth, power window/locks, rear defrost, cruise, back up camera, etc.,  but GM in their brilliancy doesn't offer power mirrors with this package and they continually wiggle out of adjustment.  Yes, that's a lot of complaining. I will say, it offers a much better ride than a Tacoma and has never broken down but there are too many bugs in this car to consider it again, especially with a $32,000 sticker price.",3

I mentioned this to General Motors explaining my displeasure with this .   They had indicated that they would honor this with me but phone calls to them got me nowhere.  I had to bring the vehicle back to the dealer five times as the key was left in the ignition and would not come out.   Communication with General Motors about this was poor as they never answer their phone and finally called me offered an extended warranty but would not give anything in writing.

I really doubt anyone needs the clearance it has.  I drive graveled and dirt back roads and go some rough places and don't need the height.  That makes it difficult for many [I have a bad leg] to get in and out easily.  AT the risk of voiding my warranty I'm seriously considering lowering it myself.  I test drove one with a step and it really didn't help much.  Other than that it is an excellent buy.  More than one friend has said that it rides better than most cars.  Even my wife is jealous of the ride.UPDATE: Still a great ride but now I have back problems and getting and out is very difficult.  After more than a year I'm generally pleased but still feel it could be 3 inches or 4 maybe lower.  And watching for other Canyons I've decided it is the choice for people who want to drive a truck or be seen driving a truck but not necessarily using it like a truck. I use it, but notice that most work trucks seem to be the Chevy version.Finally, I have a friend with a 40+K Toyota RAV4 who much prefers driving my Canyon. She says it's a much better ride.

Then drove it again, and decided to wait and maybe buy it in the future. I was looking at the crew cab, short box, sle with all-terrain. First-off, let's talk $36-39k for a mid-size truck. For nearly 40k, I expect some level of awesomeness. The front power seats don't have a tilt adjustment, and in the SLE (leather trimmed, cloth middle) they are just a tad on the firm side. Rear sliding window is manual. No manual locker on the All-terrain pkg (though it does have a type of locking differential). Short bed is very short: cannot put a bicycle length-wise standing up with both wheels on without the gate down. Stereo was great, interior styling excellent. No push button start (personally I prefer a key). The V6 is good, but noisy when stepping on the gas hard and really the 265 lb-ft of torque isn't enough for something that weighs 4000+ pounds. If this truck was $28k, I'd buy it now. But I think the prices will drop. For $38k you can get a very nice full-size truck (though don't many of us want something smaller?) that probably weighs about the same and has a much more powerful engine. If they could have tuned the gasoline v6 to a bit more torque and improved the seats to the level of the Sierra, I would think this truck could be a $38k vehicle. I plan on waiting a year and buying one when the prices drop or buying one used. Just not a good value as priced. The engine noise/torque were the main detractors.

This vehicle overall gets a 3.5 out of 10 for me.   Dealer and manufacturer support is terrible.  I will not purchase another GM product for quite some time if ever again.  Transmission is very .  Location of drive selector (2W,4W) is bad...easy to hit with your knees unless your 4 ft. tall.  Muffler sounds like a Toro with a hole in it, but dealer says this is normal.  I compared the 2016 Tacoma and 2016 Canyon closely and decided that for my purposes, the Canyon was more comfortable (driver head room and leg room) and used that as my main criteria.   The adjustibility of the driver seat is about the only thing I would give good marks for on this vehicle.  If I could do it again I would not buy a Canyon... maybe just a 1/2 ton. On the highway the Canyon is pretty responsive and handles fairly well (65-75 MPG power band), but the  mileage is substantially lower than stated.   My biggest issue is the poor dealer support I got when I had to replace a rear center side glass.  Some bonehead tried to break in the truck through the rear slide glass (I guess?... there were no rocks, meteorites, or dead birds present when I returned from grocery shopping, but the center glass was totally knocked out). The response I got was that GM showed the part with a price, but they could not tell me if it was available or not.  All third party glass companies said it was only a dealer part.  After a 14 days of waiting on the dealer (Ferguson GMC-Tulsa), they still could not tell me when or whether the part would be available.   GM needs to have their OEM vendors produce and stock replacement equipment for their vehicles for at least a few years, or until third parties can produce. UPDATE: After 54 days I finally was able to purchase the center sliding rear windows.     My only options were to replace the entire for $900+ or put a cheap (non defrost solid piece of glass into it).    I will go back to Jap and German vehicles as much as possible. I currently own 6 vehicles between personal and business.  You would think that American manufacturers learned their lessons in the 70-80's from Japan, but maybe they just need to be govt. subsidized in order to function at the level of Toyota, Nissan, etc.    No mention of ""bulletins"" by dealer when I purchased it.  The transmissions are going to be a big problem in this vehicle... beware.  GM will do everything in their power to hide and diffuse the issue... maybe like they did with the 124 deaths related to faulty  ignition switches that they knew about and covered up.  The Canyon is simply not worth the $$.",2

Comfortable and quiet overall.  It has got a lot of towing power and payload capacity with great gas mileage.  More city driving than highway but overall 20.7 mpg on regular gas.  Good acceleration.  Really like the backup camera.The interior does have a lot of hard plastic so change tends to rattle.  The seats feel good and firm on long trips and the road and wind noise level is very good (quiet).  The problem is that the steering wheel rattles and the dealer has been instructed not to fix it.  This is a problem with both the Canyon and Colorado models and is noted in the GMC technical Document ID: 4089969 dated in February 2015 .  Very annoying with the quiet interior. Other small interior problems were fixed by the dealer but this one instructs them to wait until GMC defines a fix.  A bad mark on an otherwise nice truck.,5

HANDLING, confident and comfortable but a bit heavy at times.  ENGINE, strong V6, fuel efficient. TRANSMISSION, shifts smoothly and for the most part predicable. On strong acceleration or downshifting the transmission can have a hard shift at times. FUEL ECONOMY, first two tanks over 22.5 MPG (70% Highway) This is a little better than I expected.

Overall I like the truck:  good gas mileage for a 6-cylinder truck, handles well, brakes work very well, and no major maintenance issues.  The main issue I have with the truck has to do with the technology, namely the navigation system and the entertainment system.  First the navigation system.  I won't say it's completely useless, but with the so-called ""voice control"", it's pretty close to useless.  I've tried everything to get the voice recognition system to work more than occasionally but to no avail. And, no, I do not have an accent.  Yes, I do speak slowly and clearly.  Still, it hardly works.  This is an added problem since the manual destination choices available on the touch screen are limited to a single page while the vehicle is moving.  This is supposedly a safety feature.  Interesting, since I can scroll through pages of station choices on the Sirius XM menu with no problem.  Apparently, finding ""Beatles Radio"" or a particular NFL game while hurtling down the highway at 70 MPH is safe, but trying to find a destination while moving is not?  And the biggest gripe on the NAV system is the updates.  GM wants you to shell out over $100 to get updated maps.  My portable Garmin offered lifetime updates for the cost of the unit.  C'mon GM...seriously?  If someone drops $35,000+ on a vehicle it doesn't seem unreasonable to include map updates with the cost of the vehicle.   Second there is the menu to ""save"" favorites.  It's set up on 3 pages....smaller icons on one page would be preferable, especially given the concern for ""safety"" on the aforementioned navigation system.  Just not very user friendly.",4

It doesn't seat well for tall people - I'm 6'4"". I've adjusted the seating and still have issues. The top of the seat pushes my upper back forward and causes me to slouch forward after prolonged sitting (greater than 20 minutes); this causes neck pain. Also, there have been 5 (maybe 6) recalls on the vehicle since I bought it in February of 2015. I'm thinking about selling it and getting a truck that doesn't have so many issues with better seats.Update 05/16/17: The truck had more than 8 paint chips around the entire body. After doing some research I learned that GM vehicles (GMC, Chevy, Buick, etc.) have a history of paint chipping issues. Apparently, the primer GM uses is the problem. Regardless, my truck was still under the bumper to bumper warranty and it would have been a prolonged source of frustration and anxiety to get it taken care of to my (the customer) liking. GM only had one representative for my entire state (Maryland) so my situation worse. In December of 2016, I ended up trading in my truck for an F150: I took a hit financially but it was worth it.

Even though it is the WT version it’s the upgraded version with power windows, locks, remote, air and the V6 complete with the tow package capable of towing 7,000 lbs.  The 2nd Gen truck looks awesome and great looking inside and out but that’s where it ends.  I’ll admit that the engine is very powerful but the transmission and computer is the weakest link.  It’s not a pleasure to drive.  Example:  driving on the highway, anything between 55 up to 70 and then needing to slow down and then pick back up on speed it starts to chug and surge like it’s struggling for the gear or running out of gas.  It does the same thing when trying to climb a hill or going around a corner.   I’ve had it into the dealership twice, had the computer upgraded and talked with them several times on the phone but they still don’t have a fix.  I would have gladly exchange the 22+ MPG for 17 or 18 MPG to have it shift right.   I would not recommend this truck.  As of today of writing this, it only has 10,000 miles on it and I’m still not happy so I’m trading it in for a Jeep G.C.

Only a 1500 series. Also the Pro Package has 2 double long air assisted opening panels, one on each side where the windows would normally be. Custom 12 volt interior lighting. Electronic transmission towing switch on instrument panel.  The 5.3L Vortex engine is to die for. As with all GMC/CHEVY exterior primer and paint SUCK! My van may be 13 years old but has less than 78,000 miles. On the 10th year after the RUST warranty disappeared so did the paint from the primer. Primer installed oh so thin and never properly adhered to the cheap paint used. Had an 1985 CHEVY 3/4 TRUCK that did the same thing with the paint. Thought somehow GMC would be better quality, top of the line. NO WAY! If you plan on getting a Chevy or GMC and keep it for any extended period, then PLEASE take my word for it, YOU WILL BE REPAINTING the vehicle. Rain water works behind the paint dislodging huge sections at a time.  Vortex engine is fantastic. Could have enhanced performance and economy with electric fans on the radiator (push/pull setup) and an electric water pump. This setup would have reduced unneeded drag on the 5.3L topped off with a cold air intake. But we are all aware of each and every penny that's saved in construction, goes in someone's back pocket.

Pull a 24' enclosed with a car with the cruise control on in trailer tow mode. Absolutely love this truck. My local dealer found it for me. The paint is incredible, the interior is extremely quiet and comfortable with the leather bucket seats. The 40,000 mile warranty over the Ford has an untold value that could mean thousands. Installed headers & exhaust, K&N, Bosch Iridium plugs & Tayler 10.4 wires etc. No effect on warranty! Didn't even look at the Chevy as we own a'10 GMC. Both Z71's.",5

SERVICE STABILITRACK has been a thorn while under warranty and persists to be a problem now that it is out of warranty! From early on, <10,000 miles and OVER 10 times since, this vehicle had been in to two different dealers and the problem, though intermittent, still exists and is a HUGE danger to me and my kids but I can't just go buy another car or trade this is like some people (including the car dealership managers) portray is the best option when I should be able to get GM to fix the car or replace it when they can't seem to figure out why the problem persists. But that hasn't been the only problem:Gear band broke twice on the transmission, had to have Transmission rebuilt because of faulty radiator, and other issues however none of the problems remotely compare to having taken it in for service because of the repeated unexplained de-acceleration and loss of ability to make the car do anything except pull to the side of the road and give it ten minutes to stop having a ""tantrum"" of sorts while traffic whizzes by and thankfully didn't hit us (YET).  Exterior / Aesthetics, I love this vehicle but poor function and even worse service of problems. I've reported it to corporate but they don't care and despite it having had been into the dealership numerous times prior to end of warranty, now they just want me to start paying them for all these fixes that haven't fixed anything.",2

It's reliably started easy 100% of the time as a daily driver. No repairs needed on the engine/transmission itself, only steering.

After just over one year of ownership, the 4x4 feature started to fail.  This lead to a complete transmission overhaul. $2400 there. Then within months, the fan clutch went for another $850.  Less than one year now, the light is on again, what now? We already have the electronic circuit needing replacement.  Apparently, that's to blame in the repeated blow out of the rear break lights. Great for camping or driving in snow/rain but you need to have some repair cash saved aside. ",3.625

Smoother ride than GMC 2500 Heavy Duty. Tracks down the road very nicely. (This next comment is not a flame, I'm a truck guy, not a ""brand guy"") Much better than Ford 250, which tended to wander a bit - that may have been due to the more aggressive off- road tires on the Ford. With a bed cover in place, gas mileage went from 17.5 mpg highway to just over 18 mpg highway. Every bit helps. XM radio is worth every cent. On-Star is invaluable.

I use my trucks for towing my toys and for getting to my hunting camp.  I bought the GMC used with very low (50K) miles and I received the service records. The previous owner had a few problems with the worst being the door handle. I have had no major problems.  Mine is the 3 door 2500 4x4. The interior is good with very comfortable seats.  The seats have some play in the tracks and I have a kit to fix it, but never got around to doing it so I'd rate that minor.  Gauges are great with tranny temp and steering is good.  4 wheel disk brakes are excellent.  HVAC works well and has not had any problems. Ride is above average.  Fuel economy is 15 -17 with the 3.73 gears.  The 4L80E transmission (TH400 descendant) is excellent and is heavy duty.  It has push-button 4x4 shifting.  Auto, high, and low.  You can from high to low on the fly, and to low below 5 MPH.  Auto works well on wet roads.  My 4x4 shifter has not malfunctioned. Mine has the rear locking differential and gets through sand very well compared with the Dodge.  This truck has a nice off-road feel and feels very capable  The 6.0L LQ4 engine does make the piston slapping sound at start-up, but goes away when warm as designed.  Engine makes good power, but power is a bit too high in the RPM range for serious work with the 3.73 gears.  This model uses the power steering pump to boost the brakes and my unit had a bit of a leak.  Flushing the power steering unit with Prestone anti leak pwr steering fluid fixed it.  The stock radio is below average and the speakers were blown when I got it.  The body has not rusted, but the black paint is starting to fade on the hood. The 3 door is kind of a pain just having one door and when putting groceries in the back seat since you can't fit the cart in the opening.  Other than that I like this truck very much.  I've only performed maintenance. Oil every 3K, brake flush, transmission flush, and diff fluid changed.",5

Poor troubleshooting procedures from a Chilton manual led me to replace the front diff actuator motor.  Seems the real culprit is a sticky selector switch. Humidity may be affecting this switch, apparently the resistors are shot for each position and loses ability to keep voltage signal to transfer case module. Original battery lasted 6 years so that was awesome to get over 6 years from a battery.  Also developed a leak at the front differential.

This is the 4th Acadia we purchased in our family.  We had 3, 2014, my wife and two daughters.  Love the vehicle.  Great for hauling around our 4 grandsons, car seats fit great in the second row and large cargo space for strollers and all the stuff that goes with infants and toddlers. Not sure why GM decided to shrink the size down to that of a Ford Exployer other than maybe the Acadia had knocked the heck out of the Yukon and Tahoe sales. The older Acadias and the 2017 Acadia limited (same as older ones) had as much cargo space as the Yukon, 5000 pound towing, better fuel economy, easier to park and about $20,000 less.  This being the last year they will make the larger Acadia is why we sold the 2014 and purchased the 2017.  Hopefully this one will last for 10 plus years.

Driving is smooth, I can't think of a thing to criticize in a major way but I have some  quibbles. The Infotainment system may have some improvements over my old system, but it doesn't seem as intuitive. For one thing, I can't figure out how to mark the location where I am sitting and if it's in the manual, show me where!  The feature was drop-dead easy in my old Acadia.

The Acadia All Terrain SLE2 won me over and I love the way it looks and drives. I bought the one with the bench rear seat and dual sunroof. The V6 has plenty of power and the AWD system is amazing, in my opinion. I feel very safe driving this. Now for the bad, after 6,000 miles I got an error one day stating ""Low Engine Power Mode""... immediately took it in and they replaced the electronic pedal system. Fixed the issue. A few miles later the driveshaft started making a ticking noise and got very loud after driving for a while, mainly over bumps and even the smallest ones it would make a noise... Not normal. The dealership replaced something due to a recall. Fixed the issue. Randomly the lights will all flash.. but since I can't duplicate it.. dealerships have no interest or idea what could have happened. The sunroof had to be realigned and still makes a cracking noise when closing and sometimes bounces back to open... I found water inside the rear glass when washing.. Today I get in after it had been raining all night and my passenger side has standing water... Brake plate on the driver side rattles like crazy..

1815, on 02/11/18 05:49 AM (PST),Doug Early ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV SL 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Someone should be fired," A 2 ton vehicle with a 4 cylinder? Someone at GM must have been dropped on their head. If I was the CEO and drove this car, I would literally fire the person that made this decision. Even more maddening is that the terrible 4 cylinder has an auto stop/start feature that you CANNOT disable. The seats are terrible. No lumbar support and no adjustment. You can either crank the seat up and forward or down and back. But as a tall person that needs it to be back all the way but up higher it’s incredibly uncomfortable. Power driver's seat and power lift gate should be standard equipment in 2017. The instrument cluster information screen has this eco index thing that makes no sense and is useless. Apple CarPlay is nice when it works but it constantly starts music automatically with no way to disable this. Also if you put a podcast on for example, as much as 5 minutes later the system might decide you should be listening to music on its own and switch it automatically. It happens just about every day. Some bugs to work out there. Calling this vehicle an SUV is really unfair to other real SUVs. The new Acadia is basically a minivan that is slightly higher than the average minivan. It’s really low to the ground. The cockpit feels like you're driving a sedan. It's narrow and feels small and tight. My wife and I have 2 other SUVs and both are higher off the ground than this. Cargo space is good when the 3rd row is down. When it is up, there is no cargo space. Oh, and if you wanted a roof rack the SL doesn't come with one so be prepared to buy your own. I really can’t say enough about how much I dislike this vehicle. It rides and handles fine but it definitely seems like they spared every expense. It’s a company vehicle so I just pay fringe benefit taxes, but that is just about where the accolades end. Some days it hardly seems worth it.",1
1816, on 02/09/18 07:00 AM (PST),Scott C Genrich ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Traded 12 Acadia AWD Denali for 17 AWD Denali," After test driving a new Acadia compared to my 2012, I had mixed emotions liking some things, missing others.  My wife on the other hand loved it and for the first time ever asked that we upgrade to this model after she drove it.  It was easier to control, see out of, and more comfortable.  I debated it for a while liking the improved gas mileage, ability to select FWD or AWD, and yes improved comfort!  What I missed was silly like folding mirrors, HUD, and cargo aka sheet of plywood.  I wanted a rare black on tan which no one had because black seats are freakin hot so we ordered ours.  I took great liberty and loaded it with every option available as I plan to drive this for a long time.  I have the technology, cargo, floor liner, exterior, performance ride & handling, dual sunroof, info\navigation, 6 passenger, read headset dvds, and trailer hitch.  It came in on a thrs and we drove to FL on friday.  Let me tell you how impressed we were with it!  It handles like a car even loaded down with luggage, kids, and pets!  We no longer have that top heavy roll in the mountains or off ramps, the mileage improved from 13mpg to 24 (remember I said loaded down versus empty).  The cruise control is easy, the braking warning is handy, and the lane drift not only warns you but actually corrects the vehicle if you dont respond which is very cool and a nice safety feature.  The visibility is great but I am catching myself using the 360 camera system more and more, the screen shows a split of rear view and a top down virtual image like the commercials show which help if you are blindly backing up say you are parked between two large SUVs or trucks.  That has saved the wife and me so many times now it isnt funny but valuable!  The engine has more horsepower than before and it is pretty quick for this leadfoot living in the city of the Indianapolis 500 and braking is impressive for a SUV again better than the old model.  As others have mentioned I do get the occasional transmission delay when turning and accelerating at low rpm but that is a larger technical issue now with computer controlled trannies.  Yes they need to improve it but again, if you give it a little juice it quickly responds and throttles you into gear so more of a nuisance than issue.  I have yet to trailer anything yet but the crossrails are actually wider and longer than the old model due to their engineering and we haul kayaks and bikes off the hitch a lot without any issues.  It is very quiet and comfortable inside.  I love the heated\cooled seats in tan which reflect a lot of heat in summer and the heated steering wheel is nice this artic winter.  Driving 15hrs to FL I was never uncomfortable and these seats are wider with more adjustments than the old model including heated rear seats!  Another improvement is the leg room in the rear.  The old model sat flat in the back meaning your feet just a few inches below your rear and your knees were high in the air which was uncomfortable.  They fixed that with lower interior wheel wells so your knees are now down even with your rear-end and much more comfy!  I do miss my heads up display still but the dash is well done and you dont really need it and I wish the mirrors reclined automatically but I accept it.  The only real complaint that I have is the narrower body where I can no longer get a sheet of plywood into it but someone asked me why am I hauling lumber in it anyway.  I look forward to see if they make any improvements in the coming models like a 10speed transmission and I am intrigued by the slightly larger traverse so wouldn't an Acadia XL be a neat idea like the yukon and yukon xl?",4
1817, on 02/08/18 16:58 PM (PST),Chris ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-2 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),All Terrain - Anything But," I compare this car to my 2008 Trailblazer. At 50% more in 9 years I find the 2017 Acadia many steps backwards. It is supposed to be a all weather vehicle. I've had it for a week and found it to not be at all as expected. Front seats too small - although most cars are until you get to a truck. Wipers is extremely awkward. They are confusing to operate and distinguish front from back. You need pliers to twist knob. Put the back control some place else. That is not needed as often. So I am driving in snowy / slushy roads trying to use my wiper, washer, and blinker. GOOD THING I HAD MY THIRD HAND TO STEER. You cannot distinguish how to turn on in the dark. I can see my feet though, socks matched fine. On icy roads this car was all over road. 2WD actually helped. I was the slowest vehicle on the road. This is not supposed to be the case with this vehicle. They built this car to hold snow all over. There is a bump between A pillar and windshield holding snow there in critical situations. Every time you open a door the seat fills with snow. The roof has more ridges making it difficult to brush snow off.  I went up north with my GM employee brother-in-law. I asked if GM tests the new models in winter conditions. He said yes. But I'm quite sure they did not. It don't take much effort to see the pit falls. I think we have a bunch of young designers worrying about WiFi and other electronic gadgets things they think is important. Ask those tech nerds how WiFi helps drive or clean snow? I wanted a navigational system, this is important for my work. I could not get without spending several thousand more to upgrade sub-model. So now in comparison to Trailblazer with every option, the Acadia is more like 70% more!!!! The sad thought is I am sure GM builds this car on par with competition. That is a sad state of affairs thinking how backward automotive companies actually went in 10 years.",1

Try that when you NEED it.  A definite safety issue that the dealer recognized but could not fix.  No fix from GM.  Needs to be recalled.  Other Denalis on the lot were the same, and this problem has been reported by several others and also to the NHTSA.",3
1826, on 10/01/17 12:19 PM (PDT),Elaine ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-1 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),My experience with the GMC Acadia All Terrain," My 1st vehicle was a Pontiac Aztek which I loved at kept for 196,450 miles.  Since Pontiac is no more, I had to find another car maker.  I temporary had a 2017 Toyota RAV4 hybrid for 7,091 miles which I had to get rid of due to the seats being extremely uncomfortable for me.  So the 2017 GMC Acadia All Terrain is my 3rd vehicle.  I've had it for 7,550 miles, so it is better than the Toyota RAV4 in terms of comfort.  When looking to replace the Toyota RAV4 we expanded our search to include all CUVs and I mean ALL, all the way up to the most expensive in our test drives, Porsche Macan.  So far I've taken the Acadia to the shop for one oil change, tire rotation, and a software update when a service light came on.  It has a smooth ride, not harsh, a softer suspension.  Sometimes I do feel like the engine creates vibration shortly after starting it sometimes but it goes away.  I love that I didn't have to have the 3rd row seat, nor do I have to have a sunroof because I don't need either.  Most CUVs when you get to the upper trims they automatically give you a sunroof which adds $1,000 or so to the vehicle for something I'll never use.  The infotainment is well designed and very intuitive.  The information in front of the driver is good, shows everything one would like to see (tire pressure, digital speedo, odometer, etc).  If I turn off the infotainment screen I still have a clock, most CUVs the clock goes away when you turn off the infotainment screen.  The steering wheel controls are well placed and the wheel itself is comfortable to hold.  The all weather floor mats cover the entire floor and stay in place.  The head restraint is a good distance from the back of my head unlike some of the vehicles where it was so close I found myself leaning forward which does nothing for good posture.  The audio system is quite good, better than most.  Now for some of the negatives for me.  So many of the CUVs have a bit too narrow of seats.  I'm 5'6"" and weigh 140 lbs and am by no means heavy.  The bolsters that are designed to ""hug"" you, I find uncomfortable and they tend to put pressure on my hips the bigger they are, deep heavily bolstered seats are the worst for me.  If the GMC Acadia front seats (the flat part) would have been 1"" wider, I would be happier.  The bolsters are relatively mild so I can live with them but I'm not in love with the seats.  I prefer not having an arm rest in the middle.  If the console was sunk down and if the seat had arm rests you could fold down if you wanted them, that would have been better.  Otherwise I find most CUV consoles get in my way.  The headlights should be LED or HID.  I could see much better at nice with those types of lights.  With the price I paid, I feel better headlights should have been on it.  And my last complaint which could apply to all CUVS is lack of color.  My first vehicle was yellow which I loved.  Now if you don't like B&W and red vehicles, you won't find a color you like.  I wish the auto makers would include 2 actual colors for us who like vehicles with color.  I want my vehicle to stand out and not blend in.",4
1827, on 09/30/17 09:39 AM (PDT),Roger ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-2 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),2017 GMC Terrain, I did a lot of online research before I honed in on the GMC Terrain. I have been a GM owner most of my life but in 2001 I decided to get a Toyota truck. Stuck with Toyota until February of this year when I decided I wanted a diesel truck. The Duramax was the only diesel I would consider so I went with a Chevrolet 2500HD. Anyway my wife decided that her 2000 Chevrolet Venture Van that we had for over 10yrs. was not doing it for her anymore. I still wanted to get back to the GM line so I started looking at the different GM smaller SUV's. It came down to the Chevrolet Equinox or Terrain. I chose the Terrain because I liked the bold look it has. There is no perfect vehicle and for sure they are all over priced. You just have to compromise and make a decision to go with your gut feelings. We have only owned the Terrain for a month now and so far the only complaint I have is the power steering is a little jerky when the engine is at idle. Seems like the idle could be slightly higher. Will have the dealer check it out. Other then that the V6 is the way to go.  It is now the first of April 2018.  Because of the distance from where we live to the dealer I have not taken it back to have the power steering looked at. When I take it I for the second oil change I will have it checked out. Anyway so far my wife and I really like the Terrain.,4

Dealership reset the codes and said it was a glitch. I was passing a steel plate in an intersection and the braking safety feature locked up. Good thing the car behind me didn't read end me, the seat belt kept me from hitting my head on the windshield. At 900 miles now keeping my fingers crossed. The rattle in the sun roof is driving me crazy, bigggest upset is the dealership either doesn't know anything or just passing the buck.",3
1829, on 09/20/17 21:42 PM (PDT),Valerie Valkyrie ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-2 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),No See the CD!! and a lot of other things too," ASTOUNDED to find on driving home in my new Acadia that there is NO CD PLAYER!!!! WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED had I known this! As it is, this will be a transition car as very disappointed in quality. Have wanted Acadia for several years, had Terrain SLT2 that was a great car but just a little too small and seats too firm. But this Acadia does not have near the quality of my 2012 Terrain, materials inside are cheap and unsubstantial, leather seats feel like velour cloth not leather as are so limp and sticky.  Another WTH????? were they thinking when they moved the remote liftgate button from the overhead console to the drivers door at knee level--totally inaccessible to anyone but the driver. Not helpful when you come out with your arms full, as your fob is in your purse and no one in the car is going to climb over the console and reach down almost to the floor to pop the liftgate, or jump out and run back to open it either.  Totally inaccessible.  Also could not believe that a $46000 car does not have height adjustments on the seatbelt anchor positions on the posts...but I guess it is only women and children that appreciate those. And how many years will it take to figure out how to get those back row seats to lie flat, like every other car company except probably Chevy and Buick. Those big seatbacks sure eat up the cargo space I want, sticking up in the way. The center console is tiny, the doors have 2 very small cubbies that nothing will fit into. On a positive note the graphics are very nice on the touchscreens although hard to find everything. And it is a relief to have the fuel door on the driver's side instead of the passenger.  To sum up, this could be the last time I buy  domestic, my friend has a Highlander and it was about same price, same options and much more impressive vehicle in terms of quality, design and the SPACE is unbelievable! Where do they put the wheel wells, because there is no big hump on each side like in the GMs?  It even has a little shelf under the dashboard and full bins on the door, but I guess all that plastic is needed to strengthen the door on the Acadia, it apparently isn't strong enough to allow for larger spaces. Another negative is the door mirrors, they are high and wide, in conjunction with the front post and airbags, when I turn I cannot see where I am going--I am totally blind. This is characteristic of most modern cars, the mirrors used to be level with the bottom of the window, now the bottom of the mirror is above the window bottom and blocks the view any direction except straight..(I tried to find a car without this problem but couldn't). And much more engine and road noise in this Acadia than the Toyota.  I looked at the Colorado and the Traverse before buying this Acadia and the interior quality was underwhelming in them as well. Already missing my old Terrain, at least it had a V6, which is not an option any more, and it looked like a quality vehicle.  So long Detroit!  I got some more space but I'll be eating crow  around my friends until I can afford to unload this turkey.",3

The slight increase in power is noticeable as is the decrease in outside noise (better dampening).  The electronic improvements sell the car all by themselves, especially if you use Apple products.  The smaller cargo space is obvious but liveable.  It feels sportier than prior year's models - tighter and more nimble - without any loss in comfort.  Overall, a good choice for anyone not wanting to spend a fortune but still wanting a quality vehicle.",5
1835, on 04/30/17 23:40 PM (PDT),TerryA ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Terrific vehicle - love it," I tend to keep my vehicles a while - this replaced a 2007 Pontiac Torrent which at ten years old was still a good vehicle - not flashy or large but dependable. I wanted to upgrade now to something a bit larger and more comfortable. The only thing the same is the color - red. My new ACADIA Denali is a great choice. It handles like a dream (I test drove an equivalent vehicle of another make - that experience was like driving a bathtub full of water). The ACADIA's acceleration is good. It's cornering is superb - considering its size, it is surprising.  Braking is great.  Front seat comfort is great (heated and air cooled), 2nd row is good (heated), 3rd row is ok for short runs - we'll probably never use it as a seat. I think the overall size of the 2017 is perfect for us - the larger size of the 2016 would have been too big.  It has ample room for our two very large dogs AND luggage. The technology took about 3 minutes to set up so I was comfortable driving home but honestly, most will need at least a few hours with the user manual to utilize all of it.  There is a lot there. It is totally keyless - you need the dongle but never have to take it out of your pocket or push any of the buttons on it. If you lock your dongle in the car (hard but could be done) you can unlock it with your smartphone, or for a plan C, call onStar to unlock it for you. I've only had it a few months and have gotten 18.6 mpg on what has been 90% city driving. As you can tell, I am as excited about this as I was when I got my 2000 Pontiac Bonneville SSEi (turbo) which I still have and which runs as if it were new even though it has 100,000 miles on it. The dogs like the new one a lot better. For trips, because of the roominess, comfort and technology, I do too. For the record, I tried other comparable vehicles and they all felt as if something was missing.  If I change my mind, I will update my review but don't hold your breath waiting for it.  The combined mileage shown below are for some short trips that included a bit more highway.Update after a few months - no change. Still love the vehicle",5
1836, on 04/22/17 06:52 AM (PDT),Hilde ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Moved from Honda and Toyota to GMC," We had owned a 201 Honda Pilot EX-L and we really thought it fit our needs well.  We had several mechanical issues over the course of ownership, though, and some recent trouble with it - plus the 120k miles - and we were ready for a new vehicle.  My wife and two young daughters test drove the new Pilot and Highlander and none of us liked them.  Really, at all.  Even though I wanted to like them, I just didn't.  Then we test drove a 2017 Acadia Denali.  We all liked this car much more than our 2010 Pilot - and WAAAYYYY more than the new Pilot and Highlander cars we test drove.  We did a pile of research and decided to go forward with the purchase.  It was easy to find one trimmed like we wanted.  We were realistic - we were used to the space the 2010 Pilot had and this vehicle has less; that is just a fact.  However, it rides better, gets better mileage, has a simpler dash and climate/infotainment interface/controls.  A few drawbacks - the USB ports which are all over the place (in a good way) - are labeled as not to be used for charging devices.  To me, that is really their sole purpose (beyond the option to plug in a USB drive with music in the front dash).  I haven't tried using them for charging but I assume they will charge a device.  Another mild drawback is the faux wood trim panels.  It is pretty 'faux' - I'd rather have a satin metal look than this plastic wood - and this is in the ""Denali"" trim (which to me is the luxury level - ""Professional Grade"").  There is an occasional 'shudder' when driving it - like a transmission shift-point confusion or maybe the 2 cylinder shutdown process.  It has only happened a few times and it isn't a big deal but you can 'feel' something odd for a few moments while driving.  The climate controls are easy to use/understand - I struggle with some of the cars out today that have buttons/knobs with multiple icons on them and you need to take 10 minutes to figure out how to do what you want.  The Acadia system is simple.  Same with the touchscreen - it isn't full of visual noise.  It's a few big icons/tiles.  The seats are comfortable, road noise is minimal and the interior is just a wonderful place to be.  I go sit in the car in the driveway :)  The kids love the 'captains' chairs they get (and the heat option).  The third row seats are comfortable, too and there is space for adults.  If you use them, though, you are just about out of space - there isn't much if you flip those 3rd row seats up.  We took an 8 hr trip recently with the car and it performed well - highway driving and long-term sitting/travelling was fine for all of us. The car accelerates strongly and handles well - much better than our 2010 Pilot.  The various drive controls (2w/AW/sport/etc) are easy to use/switch and seem to give it a bit more oompf and 'sportier' handling.  A drawback - there isn't a dash indication of what mode you're in.  Another drawback - there aren't blinkers on the sideview mirrors - this is a good safety feature to me on the highway when changing lanes to indicate to drivers on your diagonal that you're moving over.  The wheels are glorious and I favor Michelin tires and our model has them.  The interior lighting is nice and the LED DRLs are great.  Some reviews say it's hard to see at night w/ the headlights - I don't share that viewpoint at all - the HIDs light the road very well.  The bright lights are maybe a bit dimmer than one might expect but I don't feel it's limiting in any way.  As to 'active safety' there is a lot going on - there is low speed help w/ 360 degree camera 'bird's eye' coverage - helpful when parking/backing out of the garage, etc.  The backup camera is nice; the guidelines curve as the steering wheel is turned.  A helpful feature is the seat vibrates to let the driver know there is something to be aware of - if there is an 'object' on the left, the left side of the seat vibrates (same w/ the right).  If it is in front/behind, the whole seat vibrates.  You can change this to a beep if the seat vibrating freaks you out.  I'd like to be able to have both - audible and vibration - but that isn't a choice; it's either/or.  There is also low-speed and automatic braking if the car senses objects in front - I can't tell if this works or not.  There is also the adaptive cruise control (related to the auto-braking) and this does work - it was nice on our recent trip - if I approached a vehicle in my lane, cruise would ease back and hold until I switched lanes (or the other car did) and then it would resume my set speed.  It did this without gunning the throttle, either - I've been in those cars where 'resume' thinks it's a race back to the set speed.  I can't say much about the reliability yet.  Fuel economy is fine/as expected.  The dash has several 'modes' that you can cycle through to see instant fuel economy/per trip/per last xx miles, etc.  On our road trip, I think we were getting 26 mpg on the highway (there is a feature to turn off 2 of the 6 cyl).",4

We have been in for service 5 times, on the 4th service, our entire drivetrain was tore apart and the torque converter clutch/TCC was replaced.  Well.. it didn't solve the problem.  We now have a copy of a GMC #PIP5488: Vibration, Drone, Flutter, or Boom Noise at 1500-1700 RPM When Vehicle Is In AFM (V4) Mode Bulletin, dated March 23, 2017, and there is no current fix - but, I should feel good because GM Engineering is investigating the issue.  UNBELIEVABLE, a $50,000 new vehicle purchase with this problem, with no ETA.  BUT WAIT, it gets better - have been dealing with GMC, and they told me today that they would NOT be able to offer us a buyback option, but that we had to wait for an update/fix.  Hmm.. Dealership said it could take up to two years...  I won't even get into all of the other rattles throughout liftgate and cabin, chair squeaks, raddle through dashboard from fuel injector solenoid (NO FIX), improperly installed interior and exterior trim - QC on this vehicle is a JOKE!!  https://www.repairprocedures.com/bulletins/document/pip5488/4755310.htmlAND TODAY, the check engine light came on - per OnStar remote diagnostics, it's an emissions code - PO430.  One more issue for our never ending list!!  Sixth service appointment next week Tuesday! Original Review: Coming out of a new purchase, 2014 Chevy Impala 2LTZ, which was a great car - we decided to stay in the GM family of vehicles and were drawn to the all new 2017 GMC Acadia.  We quickly loaded this vehicle with options and wound up going with the AWD Denali option, our most expensive SUV purchase to date at over $50,000.  (Previous new SUV was 13 Ford Explorer).  This vehicle has been in the shop three times, next week will be 4 - I will focus on the MAJOR flaws with this vehicle.  BEWARE, per the dealership and GMC, this vehicle will ride rough (shudders, and is getting worse) at any steady speed between 20mph and 55mph due to it's flawed ""TCC"", torque converter clutch, but because it's not throwing any error codes, we're told there's nothing wrong with it - service advisor rode along and felt our concerns - this is how we learned of the ""TCC"".  There is also an annoying high pitch frequency that comes on that is audible outside of the vehicle after it is shut off - this lasts anywhere from 30 seconds to 6 minutes.  AWESOME!  Squeaks and rattles with second row seating, gaps with interior molding, missing fender trim clips, rattles in lift gate (I think with the window seal)...  I know, right?  Should've stuck with Ford, but we loved the Impala so much and preferred the infoSystem of the GM over Ford's mySync.  We'll, just over 4,000 miles now, a GMC Case number that's about 3 weeks old and off to a different dealership next week.  Great job GMC and Longhammer of Waterford - really appreciate the quality and support.  I would NOT RECOMMEND the 2017 GMC Acadia to anyone - this will be our last GM product, ever.I received an email asking to update my review (11/1/2017) - the latest is after 9 months of frustration (12 service drop offs with a total of 61 days in the shop, with issues still unresolved) and with the assistance of a Michigan Lemon Law Attorney, our vehicle was deemed a lemon and it has been surrendered back to the dealership.  We still came out on the losing end financially, which was difficult to swallow for a short period of time, but we are extremely happy with our new 2017 Ford Explorer Sport.",1

1843, on 03/03/17 12:31 PM (PST),SYakov ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Nearly loaded Denali model," As with any vehicle, your priorities as a buyer are really going to determine if the Acadia is worth your money. I would say the Acadia is not the best if you are looking for a minivan substitute based on lack of creative interior storage (very basic) and cupholders (one per seat basically). The center storage cubby has NO divider or shelf mechanism- it's just an empty box which is disappointing. From what I've seen other similarly priced SUVs like the Pilot and  Highlander are far more focused on storage and being minivan alternatives. On the upside, the performance and quietness, ergonomics and visibility are top notch. The handling is very solid and it doesn't feel overweight or tough to maneuver on the road. The HVAC and radio controls are super straightforward and there is little reason to use the manual. If you don't want funky shifters or touch sensitive controls, this is the SUV for you. The downside if that the interior design is a little too basic for such a pricey vehicle. I think there should be more differentiation between the base interior and the Denali interior- it needs more luxury for the money they are charging. All the tech you expect is there, but too much of it is limited to Denali trim which is a mistake and will probably chase away some buyers. GMC really needs to make things like around view camera and adaptive cruise available on lower models. Auto wipers should also be available because they are on the smaller Buick Envision and some other SUVs in this price category. Bottom line, I think this works well if you have 3 kids or less and don't plan on doing lots of long road trips. If you want an SUV because you don't want a minivan, looks elsewhere.",4

I tested the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander, Nissan Pathfinder, Ford Explorer, Chevy Traverse and Buick Enclave, and, of course, the 2017 Acadia. With my previous Acadia, I had it all! Perfect size, captain chairs in the second row, and I could fit 7 pieces of decent sized luggage behind the upright third row! Gas mileage was poor, but I didn't let that bother me at all. The only reason why I chose the new Acadia over all the others is solely based on the perks I obtained from sticking with GMC. I felt pressured. My lease was beyond its expiration and I was running out of time. I made a blind decision and now I will be paying for it for the next three years. Upon the initial test drive, I thought it was a smooth ride and easy to maneuver over my previous Acadia. I almost wish that dealerships would let you test a car for a few days or even a week before deciding! My biggest complaints are: How low this vehicle sits! I also have a 2017 Nissan Rogue, and that sits higher than the Acadia. Also, the whining noise when accelerating. The storage is awful! I have to fit my son's stroller in at an angle with the third row up. With the stroller in behind the third row, I have to leave the third row up because that's where I place all other belongings because they simply won't fit! I have had this car for almost 6 months and I am in the heart of winter here in Upstate New York and this vehicle is worthless in snow, even in 4 wheel drive. The weight loss of this vehicle really shows even in the lightest of snow. Just spins and spins at stop lights, and I find it annoying that I have to put the vehicle into 4 wheel drive JUST to make it through a snowy intersection. UNACCEPTABLE! I honestly wish I spent the 50k and BOUGHT the Acadia Limited, or went with the Ford Explorer. Cannot wait to dump this vehicle.",2

Limited color choice in Denali trim, most are extra cost.  Six-speed automatic when industry trend is to eight and nine speeds.

1851, on 11/12/16 15:53 PM (PST),John L ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),The Big Terrain is a great family vehicle," We traded our 2013 Acadia Denali AWD for the 2017 comparably equipped. The first thing you notice is the cargo area is (somewhat meaningfully) smaller and the exterior looks a lot like the old Envoy (we viewed it as a downgrade vs the previous mode Acadias). From the exterior it looks like a super sized Terrain but is much roomier inside. While the cargo space was a hangup they did a great job preserving very comfortable passenger space in the first and second rows. The 3rd row is now 2 seats and tight but it was tight before and nobody would try to seat 3 people of any size back there anyway.  There is a huge difference in the feel of driving this. It now handles like a crossover and not a truck. I think the transmission is smoother, it all feels much lighter and it's still very comfortable on highway. The infotainment system is a revolution from the previous (and awful) GMC system. Apple CarPlay is intuitive, reliable and simple. Great interface, especially for navigation. Safety features are also a plus. The backup sensors vibrate the driver's seat if you're getting too close going either forward or backward and the forward parking camera is a good addition to the rear camera and cross-traffic sensors. There is also a red indicator on the windshield and seat vibration if someone brakes in front of you (or 2 cars in front) while at speed which is effective but subtle. While we miss the cargo room, let's be honest: at least in suburbia this vehicle is a kid-hauler and not a large cargo transport and you won't miss the extra cargo space 95% of the time. We do miss the heads up display (HUD) that was eliminated in the 2017. All in all we've been very happy with the redesign and love this car.",4

When starting out the Acadia  whines, my wife says it sounds like I am pulling a cats tail.  The highway noise is unbelivable, you might as well have the windows open, in fact at times it howls like there is a window open.

The Envoy had very comfortable front row seats for all day driving. The front row seat bottom on the new Acadia is much shorter and only comes mid thigh. It would not be very uncomfortable for all day driving.  Only other negative complaint I have about the new Acadia, is that in order to have the bodyside molding's painted to match the vehicle you have to upgrade to a Denali.  That's a lot of extra money for a nice paint job.  The car handles nicely and the 3.6 L has power to spare.",4

No reasoning that I can understand on this.  I particularly am referring to the choice of a coppery brown dash/steering wheel/side door panels 1/2 way down-with gray seats/carpet/headliner.  These two colors just don't match.  The only other interior color option for the SLT2 is black on black on black.  Why is GM dictating to us on these interiors?? It's bad enough that you have to pay extra for almost any exterior color other than plain old white.  Sure wish GM would listen to their loyal customers.  I would have ordered what I wanted on the spot-but was told there was no other interior option for this model.

Have had it for a month, and for me, l love the new size (Similar footprint to a Pilot, Highlander).  GM really has infoitainment down.  It is dead simple to use, the combination of touch screen and hard buttons is intuitive, and terrific to use.  Also has both Apple Car Play and Android Auto.  The safety features all work as promised.  I looked at most of the competition (Pilot, Highlander, Explorer, XC90, MDX, Pathfinder), and the combination of near luxury feel, great in car technology and the new styling just for me put it ahead of the competition.  I really liked the XC90, but was hesistant to get into a first year Volvo model, and the large touch screen I thought was not as intuitive as advertised.  This is my first American car in 30+ years (Coming out of an 08 MDX), and have to say the Acadia Denali is a great alternative to the mass Asian/Koreans, and the near lux competitors.  If you still need the larger size, GMC is selling the previous body style as the Acadia Limited, and you can still opt for the Traverse/Enclave.  Areas of improvement would be more exterior colors, and the use of real wood versus the fake veneers.  I also would have preferred more interior leather colors, but I guess GM needs to maintain separation between GMC and Cadillac.",4
1859, on 08/20/16 06:04 AM (PDT),Miller ,2017 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-1 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Nothing to jump up and down over," I've had my leased 2017 Acadia for a few months, coming off of a 15 year old vehicle.  Build quality is not what I would expect from a 2017 model year.  Hood/grille is slightly off-center, gaps between the grille and headlights, trim pieces don't fit flush, rear seats are uneven, and when the seats are folded flat in back, there are a lot of weird humps and bumps in the fabric.  These are all kind of nitpicky, but these types of issues should have all gone out in the 90s.  Driving the Acadia is a pleasure, it is very comfortable on the highway or in town.  It does not feel like a full size SUV at all, much more svelte.  All in all, if you can get an SLT-1 for about $35,000, I feel like it would be a good deal, but for something north of $40,000, I'd look elsewhere.  It feels like GMC spent way too much money on electronics and flashing lights in the cabin, and not enough money on the mechanical quality of the vehicle.",4

I'm a very flashy guy and have been driving the 2013 Cadillac XTS. However after having two small kids and needing the hall things from time to time it was time to grow up and get something more family from friendly. however after having two small kids and needing the haul things from time to time it was time to grow up and get something more family friendly.  I looked at for something stylish and full of tech features.  And I found that and the Arcadia is not too big not too small it seems to be just right.  I got the  Captain chairs in the back my only complaint would be that my two year old can fiddle with the rear heat and air conditioner controls in the back.  It seems like everything is too easily in his reach.  But that's the nature of having the two year old.   But for the money and my budget this truck does his purpose is not a MDX or Cadillac XT5 but is well worth the money.,4

1862, on 07/29/18 12:08 PM (PDT),Scott ,2018 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),We love our Denali, My wife found the new Acadia while I was buying my Canyon. She loved the new down size as she had a Terrain and never likes the larger Acadia size. The Denali we found was on a very good rebate and made for a super buy. We got everything on it. One item many dealers do not have on most Denali models is the electronic tuned handling suspension. We almost did not get it till we drove one and it was well worth the money. It turns sport mode into a SSEI like touring sedan handling with a better ride. As for the third row and storage criticism it is not an issue for us as we folded the third row when we bought it and never used it since. The space is more than our Terrain was and suits us fine. The only issue is the latch on the sun roof cover in front. It is plastic and breaks even not using it. I made my own catch in Aluminum. We are please and would not hesitate again to buy one.,5
1863, on 07/24/18 06:08 AM (PDT),Paul H ,2018 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-2 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Please Spare Yourself the Regret," I've owned numerous new cars in my life, across a span of automakers. I've owned Chevrolet, Ford, Chrysler, Dodge, VW and GMC. I have never--and I repeat NEVER--owned such a pronounced example of garbage workmanship. This vehicle's fit and finish are so inadequate that I will never again purchase another product made by General Motors. Unless you're paying $10,000 for a brand new one, you're better buying anything else. My complaint? The vehicle seemed great upon test driving. Now that I've owned the vehicle for six months and it has 5,000 miles on it, it is literally sounding like it is falling apart. The windows/doors on this vehicle are designed so poorly that the front windows, in particular, CREAK and GROAN LOUDLY around every turn. I kid you not--turn at 15 miles per hour on smooth pavement and both front windows will groan louder than the radio for the entire turn. Any bumps? You'll think you're in a 1976 truck with 475,000 miles. When I pull up my driveway, which is uphill, I mean the sound is incredulous. You wouldn't believe it unless you rode in my ""professional grade"" piece of trash. It honestly sounds like a mechanical arm is in the process of ripping off the closed, locked door. Prior to this I owned a newer model Durango and while not perfect, the fit and finish were so far outside of this vehicle's wheelhouse that you'd think the Dodge was handcrafted by Ferrari. I typically keep vehicles 3 years, as I'm then in an equity position and don't like driving a vehicle that is aging. I can't even fathom keeping this rolling pile of garbage to the one year mark. The structure rigidity and frame integrity would be bested by a ten year old convertible. Please spare yourself the regret and financial loss incurred by purchasing something of this poor quality.  I would have been better off burning the nearly 40Gs in Vegas on nothing.",2

If we hit the smallest bump in the road it bounced like Tigger and the second and third row occupants could feel it, especially.  Third row seating is fine if you have nothing but people to haul but forget putting luggage inside.   If you own this as a family and plan to go on a road trip, also plan to put a luggage holder on top of the vehicle or you won't get enough space to haul your things.   If it weren't for the bouncing it might be an alright vehicle for around home, but not road trips.  I can't believe this was offered as a rental as most rental agencies know families with more than 2 bags often rent vehicles.   And it starts at just under $30000.00???

Only reason we moved out of it was the mileage and the depreciation value once you enter said mileage. We chose to go with the 18' GMC Acadia because we did not like the new look or feel of the new Traverse's. We test drove one and it was awful. They are strikingly similar to the Ford Explorers as well - no thank you. Anyway - we loved the look and feel of the Acadia! It's been an ok ride - not one I would purchase ever again. Ours is currently at the dealer with a whole list of problems! Back window leaking, cup holders popped or never installed correctly, the dash in the windshield area popping up when it gets hot, the recirculate air smells like wet gym socks, one door handle the wrong color and scratches we never noticed when we took delivery until after I took it through the car wash - boom, there they were. Those said scratches are near the door handle that isn't the same color of the car. Just this past week, a weird noise started when starting the car like the starter is on it's way out. The drop in value itself is absolutely sickening as well! We pay $40,000+ for these vehicles yet they darn near drop in half with as little as 5000 miles on them yet dealers are still selling them at high dollar price tags but trade in values/resale values are a joke! The auto industry is clearly robbing people, no question about it and it should be illegal what they're doing and getting away with! Conclusion - I will not ever purchase another GMC again! They're very cheaply made compared to my previous Traverse. The molding inside is very sensitive and scratches very easily which is insane considering these are suppose to be family vehicles (hello, kids....??) The rear bumper also gets scratches very easily - insanely poor quality if you ask me and GMC is suppose to be your higher end brands - not at all! Very disappointed in GM and plan to call them with all our complaints! If we have one more issue with this 2018 Acadia - next we'll be acquiring a lawyer in the event we have purchased a LEMON!

However, for a three row seater the size is perfect for us. Spacious interior and super ride and handling. The 3.6L V-6 is normally aspirated, which is a plus for me, and makes more horsepower and torque than the competition. In addition,  our real world fuel economy is significantly better than EPA estimates. We do live in the flat Midwest, but regularly get 28 mpg at 75 mph on a trip. I've actually achieved 30 plus on shorter trips when not exceeding 60. Infotainment system is easy to use and since it has Android Auto (or Apple Car Play if you have an iPhone) there was no need for us to buy the optional navigation system; just plug your phone into one of the many USB ports and map is displayed on the touchscreen. We bought it new and got a fantastic deal. So far no complaints and anticipate keeping for a long time.",5

Engine felt like it was struggling even though it is a V6. Interior looked kind of cheap. A lot of money for this vehicle. Now it could be that this particular engine was not good and that a different unit would drive better.  Have seen frost white and crimson red exterior in another dealership with cocoa interior that looked nicer. Unfortunately wanted AWD and this was only one they had. I also wondered if FWD maybe drives better.,2
1882, on 10/20/17 08:11 AM (PDT),Blob ,2018 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-2 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Could be better.... Update," UPDATEI now have ~7000 miles on my SLT2 FWD.I was pretty critical of the transmission in my first review. Well it has improved quite a bit. Most modern transmissions have the ability to learn. The 2-3 shift is the main concern & is the most inconsistent but it is now generally acceptable. Most people wouldn’t notice the issues I notice as most of my engineering life concerned automatic transmissions. I hope GM continues to review customer feedback and offers updates as they have in the past.During the first included oil change service, I asked the service agent if there is a service bulletin for the incredibly loud CHIME volume for the seatbelt, key left in car & tail gate open warning. This complaint is most common with the Bose Entertainment system. Even with the chime volume setting at the lowest level, it is still obnoxious. I did find a work around for the “key left in the vehicle” warning (when my car is in my garage I usually leave the key fob in the console) & that was to open the back door before the driver’s door. Apparently, the system only cares when opening the driver’s door. I would like GM to provide a way to further lower volume or even change the tone. It should not assault ones ears.The entertainment controls could be better. When in radio screen mode, I should be able to see the presets at the bottom of the screen all the time. It doesn't. If I am listening to the radio & the screen is in HOME mode & I touch the RADIO icon, the channel changes. Really?? Where’s the logic in that?I am still impressed with the performance, handling & braking of the Acadia. It has a sophisticated rear suspension design. I beat a new Honda Pilot with it a few weeks back, so it scoots pretty good.OK I am a bit nitpicky, but most of the things I have complained about are easily fixed & shouldn’t be there in the first place, or could be configurable in the driver settings.  If I could, I’d give the Acadia SLT2 a 3.5. With some attention to details and fixes it could easily be a 4.5. So I will give it a 4. More later…..Initial review....My 3.6L/6T70 SLT2 FWD Acadia handles better than I expected.  I just came out of a 2008 Pontiac Torrent GXP which handled pretty good for a non sports car.  I wanted to buy another Pontiac, but we all know that is not possible.  So I ended up buying the Acadia.  I have only driven GM vehicles for 40 years and considered the new Volvo XC60 & the BMW X3. The worst thing about the 2018 GMC Acadia is the 6T70 transmission.  After 1500 miles, it still doesn't know how to shift consistently.    My 2008 GXP was very good, so how did GM screw up a 10 year old design?  Some 2-3 shifts have a triple feel to them (Initial feel, sag & an end bump).  Terrible.  Then there is a "" bad shift in a turn"" phenomenon.  The 2-3 is really saggy.  GMC Should fix this.  I also found the seats to be narrower in the Acadia as compared to the buckets in the Pontiac which had a narrower chassis.  I was shocked to learn that the Acadia had few & less small places to put things than my smaller Pontiac Torrent.  Where is the technical memory for these kinds of things?  And that damn chime is so loud with the Bose entertainment system.  I have the chime volume turned all the way down & it still assaults my deaf old man ears.  Give me the option to use a different sound like the tinkle used for the ""check back seat"" warning and to turn it down some more.  It had 2 body fit issues.  First, the tailgate fit very badly.  Down at the driver side bottom edge, it stood very proud of the tail light.  I don't know how it got out of the factory that way & wonder why it was delivered to me that way.  I loosened the 2 bolts on the roof hinge & was able to correct it.  The hood also fit badly.  I played with the rubber snubbers on both sides to get it to look more symmetrical.  Inside, the drawer that pulls open from the rear of the armrest wouldn't open because it runs into the raised lip of the optional GMC floormats I ordered.  Doesn't any GM engineer check this stuff?  I removed the drawer & took a hacksaw to the bottom lip on the drawer.  Since it is at the bottom, no one can see what I did.  It now clears the floormat. Lastly, I have to mention the GMC dealer in Western Ann Arbor on Jackson Rd.  They were terrible.  They forgot my deposit, screwed up the registration and failed to give me the proof of insurance after talking to my insurance company.  Then they charged $210 for paper work!  And no one would call me back after leaving messages.  I guess they figured they had my money.  I even called their Corporate Experience Mngr., and she promised to call me back that day & never did.  4 days later, I emailed her only to get more promises but no action. I'll never go to that dealer again.  Being a ""GM"" guy that worked at the company for 34 years, this was a difficult review to write.",4

By that time the third fix did not take care of the check engine light and I asked the customer service agent about getting my money back.  The agent said her department did not deal with those issues, but she would route the request up.  Last night I received a call from the agent saying that GMC would not reimburse my money.

It has been in for service 14+ times. Ten of those times was for the service airbag light, they told us it was because of the passenger seat belt. The other 4 were because I needed new brakes and rotors, but they would never listen to use. I had to drive it in unannounced one day with it making a loud banging noise and shaking the whole vehicle. I now no longer have air conditioning. The last time I had it in for the airbag light I mentioned it and they said that there is nothing wrong with it and that the freon level is where it should be. It started with just the front not blowing. After I took my daughter out of the car yesterday after a short, maybe 15 minute ride, I quickly learned that the back is no longer bowing as she was completely soaking wet with sweat and looked like she didn't feel well. There is something wrong with my gas tank, maybe it's the float, I don't know. But one minute I could have a full tank, then next I am down to 3/4 tank, that is too much of a jump to happen that fast. I contacted GMC, got as high as the district manger, waited a month, only to get the call today that there is nothing that they can do to help me and that it is not their problem.

Even my 7 year old TomTom works better.Had some creaks and squeaks in passenger side doors and windows.  Our dealer fixed most of them.Drivers seat creaked and groaned when hitting bumps.  Dealer replaced seat base.Rear windshield washer stopped working due to a hose that had pulled loose.Middle row bucket seats are very hard to pull forward for access to third row.  No resolution here.Latest problem is camshaft position sensor and camshaft actuator.  Position sensor is covered under 100K mile power train warranty.  Actuator was not, even though it's an integral part of the engine.  Go figure.Dealer service writer tells me power steering hose is showing signs of a  minor leak.  In my experience, these are usually good 100K miles or more.I'd suggest a potential owner buy an extended warranty or be ready to write checks after 36K miles.

I traded in my car because I thought it was a smart idea to purchase a new GMC vehicle, since GMC is supposed to be a reliable car manufacturer, but I was sadly mistaken. I bought my current car a 2014 GMC Acadia SLT on 12/05/2015 while still under manufacturer's warranty.On 01/15/2016 I had to take it in to service - my major complaints were buzzing sound from dashboard (wiper cowl was deformed causing noise); A/C blowing smoke, noisy and causing a hissing sound - to this they stated nothing was wrong, when I expressed my concerns I was reassured that even if out of warranty it was recorded in the system and would still be covered; transmission shifting hard - did not find what was wrong and was again reassured I had a good warranty.On 01/29/2016 I brought car back in - I was concerned about knocking transmission; hard vibrations when accelerating (flex pipe was replaced); and mentioned about A/C issues once more, but was assured everything was fine with it and they mentioned once more that since it was in the system even if it was out of warranty it would be taken care of.On 02/12/2016 I was still not satisfied and brought car into service - again because of knocking/clanking engine/transmission (front engine mount was broken and replaced); A/C noisy (compressor replaced), the A/C hissing (Evaporator core leaking and was replaced)On 02/23/2016 I brought car in because of hard transmission shifts - I was assured this is normalSince temperatures had been cool I had not used the A/C until this day, when I got home I noticed the A/C leaking onto the driver's side carpet inside vehicle, I called to schedule service 02/23/2016 @ 12:44pm left a message and never got a call back (at this point we are close to the 36,000mi warranty) I called again 02/24/2016 @ 9:41am left message, still no call back. I had a pretty busy week afterwards with my kids getting sick with the flu, I called again on 3/1/2016 @9:41am, @10:24am, @10:29am, @12:57pm, @12:59pm no one called me back. Finally was able to reach and brought car in on 3/2/2016 they found A/C drain clogged and they unclogged I still noticed the leak which was worse and called on 03/03/2016 left message, no one returned my callI finally got a hold of someone on 03/07/2016, brought the car in and was told, sorry you are out of warranty you will have to pay for the repairs. I was shocked and very angry, especially since I have been bringing the car in with all these issues I was assured would be covered even if out of warranty since there is a record. I pay $569 per month for what is supposed to be a good, reliable car that would not give me trouble, and this car has been in the shop and had more problems in the 3 months I have owned it than my old Ford Expedition which I've had for years.

It had less than 50,000 miles on it and we were very happy with the purchase, at first. Within a month we had our first recall; it was the headlight wire harness that needed to be replaced. Took it in as soon as possible and they replaced it.Next thing we got was a recall on the water pump; that we had just replaced. Since we didn't used an actual dealership to replace it we were out the money we paid for replacing that.Next we got the airbag recall. We have yet to be able to get in to get that taken care of.These are the things we have had issues with:1. Our passenger side window stopped working. I can not get it to go up or down from either the drivers or passengers controls.2. The stabilitrak warning and clicking goes on and off. I take it in to get it looked at and no one can figure out what is going on. When the warning comes on though my car speeds won't go over 25 MPH. 3. Even with the headlight wires replaced since last October (2015) we are replacing our headlights at least 1 time a month. I can't afford to replace my headlights 1 plus times a month. First of all it is difficult to get the bulb in and positioned correctly and they are also not cheap!4. We are having issues maintaining oil pressure. No one can figure out what is wrong there. I will get a warning when I go around corners that says, ""Engine oil low. Stop engine immediately"" and yet no one can figure out what is going on there.5. Two days after we purchased the car there started to be a whining noise when you turn the steering wheel. No one can figure out what is causing that issue either.6. Filling up with gas and the car won't start up then. Thankfully this isn't an every time thing for us.We are still making a car payment on this vehicle. We have had to replace a lot of other things. I can't afford to have a car payment of over $400 and also have to put $500 plus dollars into it on a regular basis. When I started to do more in depth research I am finding that most other owners are having the same types of issues. Struts going out when they shouldn't be. Stabilitrak going off and on. There are so many things and no one can answer me as to what is going on.

The wave plate is a component in the transmission.  Instead of recalling the Acadia and having the part replaced, GMC offered a special warranty up to 120,000 miles to reimburse the cost of transmission repairs.  Of course, since I actually take care of my car and drive it gently, my wave plate lasted until 121,500 miles.  The transmission repair cost $2700.  The problem was a defective waveplate.  GMC did not provide any assistance with the repair costs despite the fact it was barely beyond the warranty.  I'm actually somewhat thankful though.  Now I have a good excuse to buy a foreign car.  For the past 20 years, I have always owned domestic vehicles...mostly GM vehicles because I have felt proud of supporting the domestic auto makers.  But, with this latest issue, it is apparent that GM has no interest in supporting their customers.  Now, if people give me a hard time about buying foreign, I can refer to this experience and people will understand.  This will be the last GM product I own.  I was going to buy a new Yukon in the Spring.  That won't be happening now.",2

I bought my 2008 GMC Acadia from a GM dealership as a used vehicle with 50,000 miles on it. Less than one year later all hell breaks loose. During a rain storm while driving, water started pouring into the interior through the seatbelts, airbags and sunroof. The next morning, all of the computers in the car went crazy and the car wouldn't turn on. Had it towed to the dealership, and come to find out there is a water leak issue due to faulty drain tubes in the sunroof. Although a recall for some vehicles, my vehicle's VIN was not included in that recall, even though it was the SAME PROBLEM. Called GM, that was a joke. They said there was nothing they could do and basically that it wasn't their problem. $1500 later and the leaks are supposedly fixed and so I drive away with my smelly car. A few months later, the engine started running hot. Brought the car back to the dealership and apparently there was an issue with the transmission. Another $500 dropped. The mechanic also informed us of a leak into the master cylinder which he then told us was a common problem he had seen with the Acadia. He said it didn't need to be repaired right at that moment, but would eventually need to be repaired in the near future for a mere $1500. Over the next 2 years in which I owned this car I had nothing but issues. Oil leak (also another common problem with Acadias according to the GM service tech), engine not turning off occasionally even when I took the key out, when I would get gas, I would have to leave the car running because if I turned it off, after I finished pumping the gas it would be very difficult to start the car. Usually took about 4-5 tries. The last and final straw was this past week. I was driving home one afternoon and sure enough, water started pouring into the interior of the car from the headliner. It came in through the airbags, sunroof and top of the windshield. You could also hear the water sloshing around in the headliner as I drove.  I can't afford to keep fixing the same issue that the dealership should take responsibility for in their faulty design on this car.  Traded it in on a Hyundai yesterday and we have so much negative equity in the acadia that my car payment is ridiculously high. Not to mention I have 6 people in our family and so we all do not fit in the car together and will have to drive 2 vehicles whenever we go anywhere as a family. Because we were so upside down trading in the acadia, we couldn't afford to buy an SUV or a minivan. But, at least I know I have a good, reliable car that will not leak that I can feel is safe enough to drive my children in. If you want a vehicle that does more than just look pretty in the driveway then stay away from this one. We will NEVER buy another GM vehicle again. NEVER.",1

We were between this and the Honda Pilot. (Spouse favored the crossover look and he was paying for it so here we are). The interior layout is great. Things to be aware of: Get an accurate cost of how much replacement tires are. Changing the rear wiper blade requires a new assembly arm (roughly $80). After about 100K miles, change the oil by the 3 month/3,000 mile marker or be sure to add a quart. After 100K miles, it seemed like a lot of things started going wrong. This car was also involved in a recall, which I had to have done twice because the dealership gave me a refurbished part. Thank goodness the headlights don't have to be changed often (I had mine changed for the first time at 160K miles) because you have to take it to the dealer so they can drop the bumper to access them. And guess where the battery is located? Under the passenger seat. (You can still get the car jumped by attaching the cables to other things under the hood.) Also after 100K miles, one of the tires routinely loses air every 6-8 weeks. The power steering is starting to go, and the passenger air bag light is blinking. If you have time, ask your local mechanic what they think of the car. Mine showed me three others on his lot and said these cars have a variety of factory defects. The thing to be most aware of are the multiple blind spots created by the frame and head rests. On the plus side, the cargo space in back along with the cargo net and movability of the two sets of rear seats is good. The radio and heat controls are well-placed. The heat and A/C are well spread throughout the back seat area (vs. the GMC Terrain which didn't have any rear climate controls per our rental during the recall). It is excellent for carrying multiple golf bags or bicycles. Unless you get this make and model for free, put any amount of money toward a Honda or Toyota instead.",2

Computer was reset because of P0008 engine code in 2/2017 light came back on. Only 4000miles later and it had stretched timing chains. When we bought the car it had 94,000mi on it and when we replaced the timing chains it was at 98,000mi. 2007 and 2009 model year Acadias have a CSP that cover stretched timing chains. The CSP states 10yr 120,000miles. By having this CSP available for those model years GM is fully aware that this is a problem. I contacted GM and they refused to help us with the cost and Dondelinger GM dealer in Bemidji, MN also refused to help with the cost. The service writer named Tim told me they have at least three of these cars in for timing chains a week. Our total cost was $2,011. I find this unacceptable on GMs part but obviously they don't care about losing another customer even know their website states ""Your complete satisfaction is important to us, and we're here to help"". I have found this to not be the case. Also we have yet to see 16mpg city driving. Granted we bought the car in October so the winter may take a toll on that.",1

I LOVED the car that much that I went and bought another one.  I currently own a 2010 GMC ACADIA WITH 85000 miles on it. I have always kept up on regular maintenance when needed.  Recently my check engine light came on and would go off.  So I took it to GMC and the code they came up with was P0008.  I was told that more than likely it is a TIMING CHAIN?  I said okay, is this covered up the Power Train Warrenty?  No.. your 5 year mark was up last April.  I was then informed the 2008, 2009 models have had these issues and GMC covered them but decided not to cover the 2010's.  I asked how much is this going to cost me?

1989, on 01/03/16 05:34 AM (PST),Peter ,2010 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-1 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Completely unreliable and poorly designed.," After years of import ownership, we proudly decided to try American one more time. Detroit was back, everyone said. Fulfilling our patriotic duty, we purchased our 2010 Acadia used about 2-1/2 years ago for my wife. First, what sold us:REAR SEATS: No other SUV in its class made good use of space in the back. The availability of a 3rd row, 2nd-row bucket seats, and the easy, one-handed maneuverability of those seats was one of the biggest selling points to us (we had a kid on the way). It's a mid-size SUV that allocates space as if it's a large SUV or minivan.GENERAL STYLING/COMFORT: At a glance, and during a test drive, the look and feel of the vehicle struck us. It doesn't drive like a truck. It's a smooth, comfortable ride. And it's sharp.Why we'll never buy American again:UNRELIABILITY: I cannot overstate how a) unreliable the Acadia is, and b) how difficult and expensive it is to repair. It was engineered in such a way that routine maintenance is not at all routine, and minor to moderate repairs are major. For example, if you need to replace a headlamp (a 20-minute job on most vehicles), you must loosen the wheel well cover, the bumper cover, and the grill and surrounding trim before you can even access the headlamp. That's dozens of bolts that must be removed or loosened just to change a bulb. A peristent A/C leak plagued our vehicle for two summers until it was determined the coil needed to be replaced. A moderate repair on most vehicles, this one cost us about $1600 and two days in the shop (the coil inexplicably must be accessed by removing the dashboard). We've also had endless problems with the front suspension and linkages.  The Acadia is in the shop every 2-3 months, on average, for problems big and small not counting routine maintenance like oil changes. For comparison, my German-made vehicle is in the shop 1-2 times A YEAR. We spend many hundreds (if not thousands) more maintaining the Acadia than our other car. The conventional wisdom that American cars are cheaper to maintain no longer applies. And then there are the recall notices stuffing our mailbox. But you already knew about those.In short, Detroit is not back.UPDATE: The woes continued throughout the 3 years we owned our Acadia. The last straw was the failure of the timing chain, a part that should not fail—ever—on any well-maintained engine (they generally outlast the engine). That was a $2k+ repair that pushed our 3-year maintenance total to ~$8,000. The steering rack also failed for the 3rd time. We traded it for a Toyota. Farewell, General Motors.",2

I posted my review in October,  3 days after we got it back with a rebuilt engine,  the motor was losing oil,  bear in mind there was never an oil light,  but we checked the oil every other day, we took a 2 hour trip, then had to drive another hour to help a friend,  apparently that was just too much for the engine,  in that time it had used up the oil and simply died on a random country road.  Spun a bearing.  Second motor in 6 months.  No one will rebuild or sell this motor because they can't warranty it, it's such poor quality.  I'd like to add that the traverse, escalade, Acadia, and enclave all have this motor. I won't be buying any of them either.  When we get another motor in this car we will be taking it directly from the mechanic to be traded in.

Two days later, it left us stranded when the timing chain guide broke,  another $1800 and a month at the shop.  I got it back and drove it 2 months before the engine blew because oil was not getting to the top of the engine.

The vehicle also rolls forward or backward up to 12 inches when removing your foot from the brake after putting the vehicle in park when on an incline.

We like everything about the vehicle other than the gas mileage (16.5 MPG overall with much highway driving) and the front seats.

In cruse control transmission shifts into higher gear to keep engine at 1500RPM (2000RPM at 65mph), and ODBII scanner shows instant MPG 35+ at 40mph, 30MPG at 65mph and slightly less at higher speed.

It even had decent miles.They had to be hiding something... They were...Problem #1: The moonroofs/sunroofs/whatever ""roof windows"" leak. Both of them. They're made to allow a small amount of water to seep behind them, and then drain out via hoses. They both leaked making water come showering into the cabin whenever hitting the brakes too hard. This led to water somehow getting into the dash and blowing out the amp for all the sounds in the truck, and I do mean all the sounds including not only the radio system, but the door chime, warning dings, and even the clicking of the directional signals. Not a cheap fix, and GM KNOWS ABOUT IT for a very long time and done nothing but screw its customers. They released a TSB (Technical Service Bulletin) that not only shows mechanics how to fix it, but PROVES THEY KNOW IT IS THEIR DESIGN FLAW.Problem #2: GM also is very aware of this design flaw. The wheel well liners are not long enough and do not protect the serpentine belt system from sudden rushes of water. Hitting a small puddle can render your steering absolutely useless and is VERY DANGEROUS! You have to go buy yourself new wheel well liners and have them installed at your expense even though the mechanic gave me a copy of that TSB also.

It spent months in the shop with everybody and their brother trying to figure out why we lost power steering ONLY when it rained. The dealership was great, but GMC was a nightmare to deal with. After several times being in the shop...each time assuring us the problem was ""solved"", we would have another close call when the steering would suddenly go out without warning. GM finally screwed a shield to the bottom of the car and added aftermarket parts to correct the problem. We NEVER feel safe in the vehicle & drive a rental more.

A GMC dealer says it is due to improperly maintenance.  I contacted GM and they agreed.  I changed the oil when the OLM indicator told me to.  The dealership wants me to pay 7K for a new engine.  I am in the process of hiring an attorney to help me with this.  The dealer I purchased from went bankrupt and I can not get the maintenance records so GM is saying I drove the vehicle for 29K miles before my first oil change because I cannot provide maintenance records.  The dealership who diagnosed the problem stated I should have changed the oil at 5K intervals.  Why then did GM put OLM indicators on these vehicles. ,2.875

They love the amount of space they have in both the rear and the third row - so much more than my old Outback.  The ride is very comfortable - it soaks up the bumps on the road really great.  When I was researching this vehicle I noted a few important things - the Acadia and the Ford Explorer both have 3rd row  seats however, the GMC seats are much easier to fold down - which is really handy when you're trying to load groceries or other items.  The Nav has road alerts which is really nice.  The back up camera image is large and crisp.  If you want blind spot warnings, you have to make sure your vehicle is equipped with it.  I think it may only be available on the Denali trim level in this model year - I wasn't aware of that when I bought the vehicle, but I'm okay with that.  I found that it drives like a big car rather than a truck.  This is really impressive to me since it's such  a roomy vehicle. It's really bright inside with the twin sunroofs.  My kids like that they can listen to a different radio station than I am.  The air conditioning gets cold really fast even in hot weather.

After owning the car for almost a year I wish I would have gone for the Yukon instead. The car is clearly made for young kids especially in the back seats! The captains chairs in the 2nd row need to be able to lean all the way back and they are quite tricky to try and fold to get people out of the 3rd row. They also need to be a tad bit wider for the average adult. The thing I hate most about the car is the cup holders! They were clearly built for little kids drinks so nothing large will go in them and if you do get them in and shut the car door it falls right out and then makes a mess!! The trunk space is also nice but if you have a car load don't plan on hauling much luggage! Another thing I hate about the car is when you are driving you can not type in an address in the navagation system. I do realize this is a safety feature but it can sometimes be annoying! The car sometimes seems like it has trouble figuring out when to shift and when you sit in the 2nd row you can hear it. The car is also quite heavy feeling so it's hard to slow it down! The car also drinks gas pretty fast at 17 mpg. The overall look of the car is very nice and the chrome details really make the car. If GMC could fix the issues I've explained the car would be absolutely perfect!,4

It's a great looking car, has a very comfortable and roomy interior, plenty of power, steers and handles well and this mighty 6-cylinder tows our camper better than the 8-cylinder Avalanche, thanks to the smooth 6-speed automatic transmission!  The gas mileage is a combined 17 mpg, which could be better.  The biggest thing I don't like is the rear mud guards.

Yes it is all covered under warranty, but it is a hassle to make time to get to the dealer.....   3000 miles in 7 weeks and I have had it into the service dept. 5 times. 1) & 2) Parked my new $50,000 SUV in my garage and noticed window washer fluid leaking out onto the floor.  Took it to the dealer they couldn't find it.  Rose hell and took it to the dealer again.  they found the leak and fixed it. 3) check engine light, new gas cap, problem solved.  4) one week later check engine light again.  Replaced some pressure sensor (emissions related), problem solved.  5)  Side mouldings on both drivers doors is falling off.  To the dealer again.  So at 12,000 miles the drivers seat is rocking back and forth plus the side mouldings on the passenger side are coming off. To the dealer for trip #6. They ordered the wrong part so I have to come back next week and they tell me the rocking of the drivers seat is ""normal OEM operation"".  Back to the dealer for trip #7, and they put the correct side moulding on but tell me again that the rocking is normal....I call bulls...t.  I make a formal complaint to GM Customer Service.  That was a communication nightmare, but eventually they hook me up with another dealer.  Off to that dealer I go for dealer trip #8.

I did purchase one with all the bells and whistles to alert me 360 degrees around the car for safety hazards.

2139, on 01/21/16 11:58 AM (PST),SUVoowwnner ,2016 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),The 2016 GMC Acadia Denali is my favorite vehicle," I've read the other reviews and don't share their opinions, so I wanted to add mine. The 2016 GMC Acadia Denali is my favorite vehicle I've ever owned. I've had infiniti, honda, acura, pontiac, jeep, toyota, and now the GMC. It's the most solid, luxurious vehicle I've owned. It isn't perfect and may not be what you are looking for, but for me, I traded my Toyota Sienna XLE minivan to go to this and got a luxury SUV while only losing a small amount of cargo space. My family and I love it.The heads up display is fantastic. I can remote start my car from my android app from anywhere on the planet and the car, based on outside temperatures, automatically turns on seat heaters and defrosters in the cold to warm it up.The towing rating is solid and the tow button works very well to control a heavy load. The seats are comfortable and I don't have back fat. I'm 6', 168 pounds and wear a size 38 sport coat. I have no idea why someone would think you need to be fat to be comfortable in these seats. It escapes me. Also, the headrests do stick forward slightly for safety, but they are adjustable front to back in addition to up and down. Perhaps the other reviewer may be more comfortable by adjusting the headrests backward.The engine is also more than adequate to get 6 people around town and up a WV mountain with no issues at all. Now, my 0-60 time is not competitive with my 370z, but that's why I bought the 370z - not the Acadia.In my opinion, the generous cargo space, high towing capacity, plenty of seating and the level of luxury makes this my favorite SUV at the moment and my favorite car of all time.Hope you try it out and determine whether it works for you.",5

Nali ,2011 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Acadia; almost as good as the National Park!," I have owned my 2011 Acadia Denali for 5+months now and it rides smoothly, holding the road with no noticeable roll and is comfortable for 1-7 people. My older parents have no issues getting in, enjoy the captain chairs in the middle row. It has ample room with the seats down when going to Home Depot or Lowes. Features in my Denali speak for themselves... great Bose sound, nice leather and trim and am happy to have the sunroofs back since owning a 2009. GMC/OnStar app is great, enjoying the remote start for the vehicle on these colder days, along with heated seats. As a ""spirited driver"", I will say MPG is better, as mentioned by someone else, at slightly better than standard speeds and without a lot of penalty even at higher speeds (unless you're stopped). Acceleration with the direct inject engine is swift and gets you where you need to be in a hurry. I haven't had any maintenance issues/requirements yet, knock on wood and it has been running solidly since purchase. I'm averaging 15.87mpg with a high of 23mpg (and I don't drive 55, legal is 70mph actually.) in 2000miles. So far, in snowfall, it's doing well... and I'll step on it a little to check out the traction/road but regular speed for conditions, it's been very safe and reliable. (Common sense factor applied (heavier vehicle, road conditions, constant other driver assessments while rolling along). I also put the effort in and invest in decent brakes and tires to ensure safety for all.  I hope to be as happy in the next year or two, but had to chime in now with my current information while I had time.  Disclaimer: I am not affiliated with Edmunds or GMC. I am a hard working stiff with a family of 4.5 (dog) and want to ensure their safety and those around me.",4

2148, on 10/28/16 05:56 AM (PDT),Not a fan ,2011 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-2 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Luxury SUV without the quality - at a luxury price," First I'll just say straight-up...My husband is a GMC truck guy -- swears by them! --  and talked me into buying the Acadia instead of a foreign-made SUV. That said, this SUV doesn't meet my expectations. I call it The Beast... say no more! I purchased it used with 96,000 miles. CARFAX showed that it had been a one owner lease for four years. I was upgrading from a 2002 Volvo XC70 I'd driven for 10 years and loved. I was looking at the Volvo XC90, but decided on the Acadia since it offers the extra room for an active family of five (and a dog!), and the convenience of 2nd row captains chairs to allow easy access to the third row. The 3rd row seating is small, but offers more leg room than other vehicles with 3rd row that I'd tested. It's very good for anyone with children under 12 who can get back there and buckle themselves in. We got the DVD system, but occasionally it doesn't play DVDs that it has played before, then on another day it will play them. This isn't covered under extended warranty, and there have been so many other mechanical issues on a regular basis that I really don't want to put money into fixing it. The heat and fan selector knobs are covered with stickers that are peeling off. Cheesy, GMC! The quality of leather for seating seems to be good at least, but the style of the seats is flat and not luxurious. Not enough lumbar support for longer drives. The heated seats work great, so I use them to ease my back when I'm traveling more than a few miles. The seat belts seem to function without sticking. Bluetooth allows you to switch between phones with voice command. I have to use AUX cable for my music and/or audiobooks, which is ridiculous. The AUX in jack is easy to access, but I've spent a lot on new cables over 16 months of owning the Acadia. The headlight bulbs need to be changed by going through the wheel wells, requiring tools, patience, and skinny arms. You can't see what you're doing. Same for charging the air conditioning. Thank goodness for YouTube! Now for performance: Braking, shifting, and hugging the road are good. I'm a 45 year old mom, so I don't drive it like a maniac. The brake pedal is squeaky every time I'd use it, and the garage couldn't fix the squeak when it was brought in for routine maintenance. Annoying, but not a huge deal. Steering seems to have more play than I'd like. It is, after all, essentially a truck with lots of seating room. Like a truck, it can be hard to get in/out of for children, older folks, or others with mobility issues. For a luxury vehicle, it's noisy enough that you have to speak loudly or turn up the radio to cover the tire noise. Plus, you really feel the bumps on anything other than the highway. The traction control/Stabilitrak warning has been an issue. Even after taking it to the GMC shop four times in 16 months, it comes back on saying to service it. Also in 16 months, The Beast has ALL new brakes, rotors, struts, and an alternator. When it was in for an inspection ($1600 later) the mechanic showed me another $2000 in work that will need to be done within the next year or it won't pass inspection. He's a friend of the family, so I trust that these are serious issues and he's not running a game on me! In fact, he told me to find something within the next year before we've overspent in fixing the darn thing! It seems to chew up tires (it came with new, but we had to replace the tires in just a year), and I believe this is something to do with the Stabilitrak issues the dealership can't seem to fix. The Acadia offers little storage because of the 3rd row seat, but I do like the ease of flipping down the split seating and pulling it back up. That is better than most cars I've driven. The things I like best about the Acadia: power tailgate, ease of access to 3rd row seating, and drives really well in snow/sleet. The things I like least about the Acadia: AVERAGE of 16mpg. Which means in city driving I'm getting around 13mpg. OUCH! That is NOT what I'd read online and NOT what's stated in the specs. It's got a cheaply made interior for a luxury-ish vehicle. And finally, I dislike the incredibly poor resale or trade-in value. Essentially, in a year and a half of not really loving this vehicle, I wanted to trade in The Beast, or sell it to get something better on gas. Not so easy! It turns out that dealerships *and* Edmunds.com are telling me that it's only worth about half what we paid for it 16 months ago. Nobody wants these things! So I'm stuck with driving and paying off this crappy SUV, or rolling over the amount owed after trade-in into a different vehicle. It just got out of the shop in July and is already making another expensive-sounding noise, so I am afraid that is going to be my bad luck. Summary: NOT A FAN! Buyer beware!",2
2149, on 10/11/16 15:10 PM (PDT),Peter ,2011 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-1 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Maintenance costs out of control," The frequency and exorbitant cost of maintenance has made the Acadia our worst car purchase to date. After a couple domestic vehicles in high school and college, my wife and I have both owned only imports since (Toyota, Acura, Nissan, two Audis). But we were happy to buy domestic once again. Detroit, we thought, was back. Or so people said. The Acadia shined during our test drives. The configuration  of the seats (2nd-row buckets & 3-seat third row) was a big selling point for our growing family. We liked the vehicle's size and styling. It seemed comfortable. So, we bought it. It's my wife's vehicle. It was a huge financial mistake. For comparison's sake: I drive an Audi that has almost identical mileage (about 70k) and is one year older. The Acadia is in the shop about 3x as often for repairs big and small. The cumulative cost of the Acadia repairs has been about 4x that of the Audi. Seemingly routine repairs on the Acadia are overly involved. For example, replacing a headlamp requires you remove the wheel well liner, loosen the bumper and loosen the grill. There are a couple dozen bolts to remove or loosen just to get to the bulb. The A/C condenser was leaking, and it required two days in the shop, as they had to disassemble the dash to get to the condenser. Almost $2k. The timing chain is now failing. That will be more than $2k. Going in, I would have assumed maintenance on a German import would outstrip that of a domestic, but it isn't even close. Detroit is not back. GMC is not back. In fact, I hate GMC with every fiber of my being. We'll be reluctant to trade in this car sooner much than anticipated, but we'll be relieved to be back into a less costly, more reliable import.",2

On the road I got about 23. I have an all wheel drive one, and I suppose the 2 wheel drive model would do better. The sound system is great, and I will continue with xm radio. The seats are very comfortable. I got the one with 2 bucket seats in the second row which causes less friction on who sits in front.

Test drove the new pilot, traverse, acadia, enclave, 4runner, highlander, cx9. The Acadia out-performed all these. Great interior space, great features if you like the additional XM radio and ONstar services. No lag on the throttle... immediate response, steady cornering and level steering. Superb traction control system; disengages acceleration when slipping on ice or when lack of traction, stops engine RPM shootups. ABS system works great. It does weigh nearly 7,000 lbs so braking is a bit more noticable at higher speeds (nose dive). After 5,000+ miles I am averaging 16.3mpg / city and 20.2mpg hwy cruising at 70-75mph...23 or 24mpg as stated??? yeah right! Overall safety specs are sufficient; airbags all around, great framework. well thought out interior heating and cooling system, is loud enough to overpower a bluetooth phonecall when turned all the way up. remote start, auto liftgate great features except when parked too close to something. bad side depth perception on back up cam. low road noise, good stock tires (goodyear fortera comfort tread); bad for rain, snow and ice... will hydroplane or loose traction at 45mph+ on standing water. upgrade tires to fortera triple tread (my opinion). steering wheel controls are oddly placed. front wipers on left stick, rear wipers on center console below a/c system controls, why? volume and radio controls in a good consolidated location on steering wheel. good location for cruise control buttons. three locations for liftgate operations (key, on liftgate, and next to rear wipers.. why?) auto dimming rear view mirror great, black lower trim around Acadia difficult to clean need special cleaner from autoparts store. a little above average accessory selection, great audio even without BOSE, radio buttons can be confusing, double vanity lighted shades, dual exhaust great feature. battery location inconvenient (center of car between 2nd row captain seats), deep lubricated slide rails for 2nd row captain seats, much debris can be lodged or stuck in there, not good. inside material ""plastic"" poor choice of material, easily scuffed, marked up and just unsightly.

After a few weeks however it just isn't getting very cold.  Contacted the dealer and they said the temp is within spec.

I have only owned my car for 3 weeks, however I did previously own a 2009 so I do have prior Acadia experience. The car seems to idle rough and doesn't switch smoothly into gears, as my 2009 did.  I have many blind spots such as the second row headrests.  You cannot see over them if you turn to look over your shoulder to check for cars. Your two back side windows are of no use to you with those headrests in the way. The seats themselves don't seem as comfortable as before and the car just seems to be bulkier and louder.

Superbly enjoyable ride, great power and comfort on the road. Comfortable seats and roomy cabin. I don't know what vehicle the user that complained about the headrests is driving, perhaps they haven't figured out how to adjust them back? Or they have a newer model? Non issue for me. This car really lacks almost nothing, kids love the dvd system. Bose sound quality is very enjoyable, second only to an aftermarket system. I have hauled more stuff around in this car and have always had plenty of room to do it - even with two car seats in the middle-row captains chairs. Downsides, not as great on gas as I'd hoped - I average 18 mpg with lots of mixed city/freeway driving, bumper to bumper traffic and I drive a LOT. Navigation is quirky, voice activation far too slow to use - I'm impatient so I use google maps instead. Headphones that came with the car for the rear dvd system have never worked properly - despite changing batteries and fiddling with them constantly. This is super minor and I don't know if this is an iPhone thing, but every time I plug my phone into the USB - the music starts playing always on the same song. Alphabetically. DRIVES ME NUTS. So I use the ac/plug-in w/bluetooth for music instead. The reviewer who mentioned that the front collision warning is overly sensitive is correct - it often beeps from overpass shadows. Minor complaint for me, once I got over the heart palpitations it can cause. Very clear backup camera, love the alerts although it's made me a lazy driver lol. Love the heads up display and blindspot monitors. I've found the controls for audio, settings and all else (except Navi) very easy to use. Have had virtually no maintenance issues - minus a recent scare with the AC unit turning up low on freon this beginning of this summer, mechanic says if it happens again I may have to repair it to the tune of $800-900. Yikes. I really haven't owned it long enough to comment on the long term reliability - but this is my third lease and the first one with near zero maintenance headaches. All-in-all, I absolutely love my Acadia. I plan to turn it in at the end of my lease because I really want something a little smaller/more nimble and I need better gas mileage, the AC thing also has me a bit concerned - but if fuel economy is not an issue for you, I highly recommend this vehicle.",4

In the time I have owned it the ac has gone out twice, to the tune of $4000 of work  in 3 years. The first time was picked up by the GMC warranty. This time I fortunately had an extended warranty that covered everything. There's no reason this should happen to a vehicle so new. Also about a month ago the Bluetooth stopped working.

I have a 2015, bought a brand new GMC Denali AWD in 2015. The first year was great, comfortable road trips, basic maintenance services included by the dealer, it was a dream. Then things wend down hill fast.  First service light- Side detection system failure.  (Caused by road salt, really after one year??) $400 to fix.  Next trip, horrible sound coming from right front tire, findings: the axle nut was OFF and rolling around inside another $200 !! Next, banging noise coming from outside while driving higher than 30 miles per hour. That was the roof seals, one came loose and was flapping in the wind. (easy fix for me, pushed back in when it comes out)  Service light is one again- Side detection system error,  back up camera malfunction- This time we had to replace the other side detection system for corrosion ($400) nope still not the issue. Had my truck for 4 days trying to figure out the issue. Wiring harness was bad had to be replaced. That trip was $1200!! At this point I have had enough, but they just tell me I got a bad one.... nice.  NOPE, non of this was covered by the warranty.  Now I am holding my breath for the next issue to come. Low and behold, here we go, stalling at stops and hesitating on acceleration---- Check engine light is now on. back to the dealer, who at this point knows my name when I walk in the door- this is NOT a good thing. O2 sensor is bad and needs to be replaced- out another $400 !! oh and the hood support rod is broken (I have NEVER opened the hood my self so how does this break???) The service guy said they have to find something to prop it up with so i should replace it for $65 get out of here! Here I am 3 weeks later and guess what, I can feel the transmission not sifting properly. I am DONE... this was the WORST by ever, not only that, but I am going to lose a ton of money on it as there is NO resale value. DO NOT BY GMC!!!! I am going back to Toyota or Honda, where I had more than 100,000 miles without one service visit.  If you like to visit the guys in the service shop on a regular basis than this is the truck for you, but if you don't like the headache and wasting money- DO NOT BY GMC!!!",3

2194, on 02/24/16 08:40 AM (PST),John Metya ,2015 GMC Acadia SUV Denali 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),2015 Denali Acadia: Nothing much better.," The Pros:  Build quality, engine and transmission are reliable and well balanced, ride, cabin comfort, seat configuration (dropping seats and re-erecting them for cargo space configuration is superbly easy), handling, super quiet cabin, predictable handling, lack of roll or sway, great towing, superb acceleration, great a/c (a must in south Florida), HUD display (it's amazing how much we've come to love it), the lighting is great,  the backup camera is superb, the lumbar support and overall seat design is as good it can be, seat belts are easy to use and comfortable, cooled seats are really great, navigation is very good.The Cons:  Unless you bought a badly designed and built car, this stuff only becomes obvious over  time.  The 20"" tires are supposed to be maintained at 35 psi, they lose pressure (all four of them) constantly, and not over months, but over days.  Put in 35 psi (measured by a good handheld pressure and the you'll be down to 34 the next day, and down 31 or 32 pounds in 7-10 days.  We own a 1994 Mercedes SL500 in mint condition, and I only add air once a year.  To be sure, this isn't a deal breaker, but it is a hassle and it will cause my tires to wear down faster. The dealer is aware of the problem and has no solution.I wish they would have spent a buck more and used real chrome on the exterior where they have used chrome looking plastic.  This is a $52,500 car.  How much would chrome add to the cost?  The Envoy had an air pump built into the car.  They should have left it in the Denali.The instrument panel controls, and far worse, the navigation controls are NOT accessible (meaning, you can't enter an address, ask for the location of the nearest Best Buy, etc.) once the car is in Drive and moving.  You can just hear the committee of lawyers deciding it's too dangerous to have these controls active while the car is moving.  So, now we have to stop on an Interstate (cars flying by at 85 mph) so we can enter an address.  Does that sound safer?  Or, we've have to enter the address into a tiny screen in our phones.  Is that any safer?  NO. NO. NO. The solution is simple.  There is a pressure sensor in the passenger seat ANYWAY, so when there is someone sitting there, allow the controls in the navigation system to be active.  Stop doing dumb things - stop trying to mommy us.  If it's a lawsuit you're worried about, well, I just laid out the plaintiff's wining case.The sunroof is too small, and awfully noisy even at 40 mph.  On the plus side, the wire mesh sun screen is unbelievably effective.The windshield wipers are noisier than they should be.  It's no a deal breaker, but noise is noise, and it is somewhat bothersome.The backup camera gets wet and uselessly blurry in rain.My wife always points out that the second row should have drop down (from the back of the front seats) trays.  I am sure this must be a lawyer overruled issue, as well.  But, I am sure they can design a break-apart tray in case of accident.  But, she's absolutely right.  You need a tray for the people (read, kids) to eat and play while they sit back there.This is the third GMC SUV we've owned.  We owned two Envoy (4X4) in the first decade of the 21st century, and this is our fist GMC (2X4) Acadia Denali.  We liked the Envoy, but the Denali is a game changer.  It's a large SUV (but, not a huge SUV like a Yukon), and will provide you with all the space you need.  Our Denali has four captains seats and a bench third row.  The interior is amazingly roomy, even for third row passengers.  But, those sitting in the first two rows, the spaciousness and comfort is like sitting in an airliners first class cabin.  This SUV is luxury car that's a pleasure to own and drive.",5
2195, on 01/01/16 18:51 PM (PST),Drew ,2015 GMC Acadia SUV SLT-1 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),AMAZINGLY UNCOMFORTABLE; POOR console layout," After extensive reviews of this vehicle (edmunds.com, consumer reports/consumer search, cars.com), it's surprising that not a single review comments on the uncomfortable headrests and unfriendly layout of the most-used console features.  Front seat headrests are so uncomfortable that I contemplate selling this brand new vehicle on a weekly basis, and swapping it for similar SUV from Nissan or Toyota.  Unfortunately, it's not exactly like returning a piece of clothing to a store for a refund.  The headrests (both driver and passenger) cause the head to protrude so much that it creates MAJOR discomfort.  I ended up removing and reversing the position of the headrest, so that it essentially faces backwards.  The layout of the center console buttons are considerably cumbersome and unfriendly.  For example, the front cupholder is really not usable if planning to use the 12 volt outlet (i.e., for a phone charger or radar detector).  The button to open the rear lift gate is immediately next to the 12 volt outlet/front cupholder, so it can be triggered inadvertently, and is really annoying.  For example, the lift gate can be opened at most inopportune time, with vehicle already parked in garage or backed up to a wall.  That happened twice (first time, passenger was plugging USB cord into the receptacle, triggering the lift gate; second time removing outlet plug adapter).The front seat heaters are really nice for Chicago weather (or any cold weather), but the buttons are lower on the center console than they could be and can easily distract when trying to adjust while driving.The wifi that GMC so proudly boasts of is only 3G, which is basically useless.  However, it becomes really annoying because anytime I try to use my phone (for bluetooth streaming of calls/music/Pandora) the phone's wifi connection asks to select the signal.  Since the GMC is only 3G, it is never fast enough to be useful.  Thus, I must turn phone's wifi connection OFF in order for the phone to work properly.  That is a MAJOR pain in the ass when driving or as a passenger.Also, I find the bluetooth a bit slower than I've found in other vehicles/radios (Infiniti I35 w/aftermarket Clarion stereo, Toyota Sienna w/OEM radio, Toyota Tundra w/aftermarket Sony stereo).  The handling/road holding is excellent (have driven in rain, 1-2 inches of sleet, and 3 inches of snow).  It is an assuring and comforting feeling.Gas mileage is NOWHERE close to the estimated specs listed on any of the websites.  I drove from Chicago to Benton Harbor, MI (all highway, avg 65-70 mph), and mpg was only 19 mpg (not the 23-24 mpg listed on websites).  It is nice that the vehicle uses 87 octane gas, so that will save $ in the long run.  In hindsight, I regret not test driving Nissan Pathfinder or Toyota Highlander.",2

With my 2015 GMC Acadia which we purchased in May 2015, I specifically said my only problem with my other car was leak from ""blocked sun roof drain"". Imagine my distress when last Monday my car was soaked again.  There is no sun roof to leak.  The service department said because there was leaves and acorns under the hood....?????

2203, on 11/03/17 15:57 PM (PDT),Matt M ,2012 GMC Acadia SUV SLE 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),$6000 is way too much for repairs for 90k miles," We purchased the 2012 Acadia with zero miles in Feb 2013.  It is now 5 years old with 90,000 miles and we have spent so much money on repairs.  Every year we have had to take the car in to have the sensors in the tires reset during the winter because for some reason the car can't read accurate pressure when it is cold outside.  In 2015 we had to replace fuel injectors due to what we were told is a 'known' issue by GMC but has yet to be covered under warranty or recalled.  This was $2,000.  From that time we had turned the car into the dealership multiple times due to a smell of radiator fluid inside the car.  They continued to tell us there was not a problem and it must have been some fluid spilled on the engine when they disconnected the hoses.  Luckily my wife works very close to her work so it wasn't too big of a issue for her to continue driving it with the dealership saying everything is okay.  Fast forward to June 2017.  The car now begins to overheat, so we again return it to the dealership.  After 3 days of looking they say it is the water pump.  Awesome!  Let's get that fixed for $1,000 and maybe the smell of radiator fluid will go away and everything will be fine.  My wife begins driving the car and on the ride home from picking it up she says there is now a vibration and can still smell the fluid in the car.  We called and were advised that again this is most defiantly common and fluid must be burning off the engine.  They said give it a day or two to burn off and let them know.  They didn't really address the vibration so we figured maybe it was in my wifes head (if you knew her you would understand). We allowed for 2 weeks and nothing got better, it was worse.  The car began overheating again and the vibration was uncontrollable.  Returned to the dealership and again, after a day of looking at it they now report the radiator has a hole in it and while looking they found there was 2 broken motor mount struts and a bad coil.  Great!  Let's get that fixed up for $2,100 and everything will be hunky dory!  But wait...... there is more! So we pick the car up on a Friday.  My wife parks it at our house around 8 PM.  She attempts to use it for the first time on Sunday around 3 PM.  The car will not crank.  The battery is not dead, the fuel tank is not empty, the key appears to work.  There is no detectable sound to think it is the ignition or starter.  After 30 mins of trying to get it to turn over it finally does.  It begins to idle at 300 RPMs then up to 900 and back down to 500 and so on.  We return the car back to the dealership nearly 30 mins after we got it cranked that day and left the keys in the Dropbox explaining what the issue was and figured someone there must have left something loose when putting everything back together.  So we call late Monday afternoon to find out if the car is ready and are told they couldn't find anything wrong.  They wanted to keep it a additional day to see if any codes would come up.  We agreed and waited.  Tuesday AM we receive a call that it is now the High Pressure fuel pump.  We are assured this has nothing to do with any work that had been completed in the last 30 days.  Fine! Woopty Doo, let's rock on and fix this bad boy for $900.  Sweet right, we are now in business.  I have a car that I paid 32k for with 90k miles and just replaced pretty much anything that may give me trouble for the next 90k miles. OH, wait... is there more?  Yes sir, there is more.  We picked up the car today from the dealership.  It is 80 degrees outside on this early November day so the wife decides to cut the air on for the ride home.  Well, she was unsuccessful,  the AC would not come on.  The blower was blowing but there is no cool air.  It worked fine on that Sunday as she drove it to the dealer but now, nope. So we pull a U-turn and hit that dealership on two wheels! The service manager comes out and we talk about the issue.  He puts on some fancy yellow glasses and goes straight to the AC line.  Wow! He said, that there is your problem.  This hose here with this piece of metal on it gets hot and has been sitting next to this here hose that runs freon inside your car. He then begins to describe how the area this hose is located is no where near anything they have worked on ever.  I am awaiting the pricing for this 'hose repair'.  I am sure it will be more then $500 but less then $1500.  Long story longer 'sorry', I am 6k in on the car and will be trading it in as soon as I get it back.  I recommend those of you in the market for a SUV not purchase a 2012 Silver Acadia as this one will be out there on the market probably at a Carmax or TrueCar waiting to bite you in the A$$.  It will seem great with low miles and clean interior nice wheels and a DVD package.  It will have the third row, leather seats and several months left on the XM system.  The body will be untouched and clean with a nice shine to her.  WALK AWAY, Fast.  I will not EVER buy another GMC.",2

Dealership purposely gives you runaround to find ways to void your extended warranty, and does not stand behind the vehicle they make. 120K miles the ""extended mile Special warranty"" went out on defective timing chains, and wave plates that cause catastrophic engine and transmission failure. replacement of EITHER engine or tranny are more expensive than buying another Acadia. At 124K miles the Timing Chain, BOTH Catalytic converters as well as Transmission and PCM. GMC refuses to acknowledge  any faulty and cheap  parts. I have had this car for a year, and it spent all but 6 months at a mechanic shop for one thing or another. Vehicle would NOT complete Drive Cycle for over 2000 miles as PCM was sending wrong signals to every sensor, Fuel trim Learn was shut off by the Computer, Os bank 2 was set to remain open loop not matter what, random antitheft codes came up and went on their own. Clear electrical issues goin on when check engine light flickers and then changes to stabilitrac and then turns off and then comes back on but NO CODES PENDING OR STORED ARE FOUND. GM refused to take a look at the computer to ascertain why and kep giving me runaround about appointmant (saying NOTHING available for over 2 months), and when vehicle was brought to them at 120K to check timing chain and all the psycho lights and codes that went on and disappeared- Gm mechanic told me car is a piece of garbage, that i probably crashed it as steering angle sensor code was on at that moment and that they had no availability to do anything and to make different appointment. THEN, when i did that they said nothing to be fixed as there were no DTCs stored for those parts and the codes kept going on and off as though they didn't exist, they could do anything as there were not fault codes related to anything i requested to check (timing chain, wave plate and PCM, anti theft and steering angle sensor). Sent me packing saying vehicle will learn drive cycle and be fine and if there are codes to bring it back. All the while been at various mechanics who could not diagnose anything wrong with vehicle and kept hearing the same thing from everyone: until the monitors are all reset, we wont be able to see what is wrong. Keep driving it to see what comes up. so i did as GM technicians told me same thing over and over. At 125K miles: first code (that didn't vanish) pops up for timing chain failure and multiple cylinder misfire- GM said i have to pay for it myself as i am out of warranty and i should have brought it to them before 120K miles. Never mind that i did and they turned me away. As soon as that repair is in, my car WOULDN'T pass inspection due to computer issues as i had to re-complete drive cycle (not that it ever completed to begin with after those 4000 miles everyone told me to drive. Is it customary to build a vehicle that requires 4k miles to reset monitors and test for emissions? NOw Dealership says they cannot help and wont do it. but they'd be glad to replace my windshield and seat belt for free... disregarded again. two weeks later, (Of course) find out my Catalytic converters are shot now as the PCM kept O2 bank 2 sensors in CONSTANT OPEN LOOP and one cat was doing the work for both and exhaust manifold cracked (engine was fine checked during timing chain replaced). O2 sensors, Catalytic Converters and Exhaust manifold replaced (another $2k). less that 100 miles later car stalls, wont engage into drive and goes into limp mode (still trying to pass DAMN INSPECTION). crawled to the mechanic for two more lovely codes: P0700 and P0777 (basically the Transmission failure MIL, and Solenoid B is stuck in ON position.) MIL turns on and off by itself this entire time. But when mechanics goes to check to see if reverse gear will engage, the car drives perfect and shifts normally. Mechanics (several i took it too) say that Tranny will need to be replaced as Wave plate for 3,5, R gear is the likely culprit leaving debris that prevents solenoid from functioning but MIL turned off by itself and has not come back on. (something Else Gm told me to go F* myself about). Estimated cost: $2000+ when (not if) this part finishes going or the computer blows it to hell. Cheaper to set the car on fire as even after those repairs, the computer issues hasn't even been touched (computer reads catalytic temperatures at 915 degrees? and temperature scanner reads them at 350-400 when car running at normal temperature. and sending random signals to sensors and wont pend or store any DTC codes) my 67 Impala runs better than [non-permissible content removed] with minimal maintenance. This prissy car needs an oil change every 2000 miles because of GM manufacturing bull. Cant even trade this POS in. I have always been an avid GM/ Chevy lover, but this car is garbage and GM will not help you in any way. You are on your own with this nightmare. Will NEVER buy GM again",1

But throttle lag and inability of the transmission/engine to hold on even the slightest slope make the car dangerous. If stopped on a slight slope the car will drift back - while in D - unless you are on the gas or brake. It's like driving a manual transmission. And throttle lags on takeoff. So if you're not very diligent you may find yourself drifting backward into whatever is behind. Never had an SUV (of many over the years) with this problem. Took it to dealer and they said this was not a defect - all Acadias are this way. Tranny is also easy to ""panic"" if you floor it, the thing panics to a low gear often beyond the power curve so you end up going nowhere.",4

So GM cars with all their problems may best be avoided to buy until they resolve to take care of customer problems or replace their LEMONS. Milage has averaged less than 17 miles to gallon more like 15 even HWY",2.875

Fun to drive and handles great with exterior styling to die for..  After ten years of Full size SUVs  No roof issues or tranny issues as previous year models. I have found the perfect auto for me.  Not a boat but not a low riding car.  Not worried about GM being there, car well hold up until they remove the cloud over their future. Waited for three years after intro so GM could address any new product concerns.  Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander don't come close to measuring up.  This puppy is a winner!",5

This vehicle is a joy to drive and sports very stylish looks.  At 6 feet 3 inches I am astonished at the interior roominess. I can even ride comfortably in the third row seats.  My last vehicle was a 2007 Yukon and the third row seats were a joke.   Car has lots of bells and whistle and the nav and sound systems are fantastic.  I only wish GM would have used better quality plastic on the interior appointments given the price of the car.  The engine is very responsive and the ride is very smooth.  I test drove the 2009 Acura MDX and the Lexus RX 350 before buying.  Both were nice but did not come close to the Arcdia in space, technogoly and smooth ride.",4.875

In terms of comfort, the leather heated seats, quad chairs and smooth ride were appreciated by the entire family. Performance-wise - it's not as tight a car as the MDX,but it remains a competent highway and city cruiser. .   Mileage was impressive, and it's great to fill up on regular gas for a change.

2343, on 01/19/18 02:55 AM (PST),Dean Gould ,2017 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-1 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Very disappointed in the GMC Terraine," I changed jobs and needed a car fairly fast.  I saw this car on the lot in what appeared to be a good deal, $23,000.  By the time I was out of there, my loan was $28,000.  For $28,000, I could have gotten a great Honda or Toyota but I wanted to buy American.  There are some great American cars out there but not this one.  My fault for rushing.  One of the reasons I liked it was the exterior design.  I like the tough front end which looks like a truck front end.  The 2018 looks like every other mid-size SUV.  Bad mistake on GMC's part to change the styling.  Here are my problems:  1) it sounds like a tin-can when you close the doors.  A little injection fill of some sort should have fixed that.  2) biggest problem is the seats are tilted up ever so slightly (bottom portion) so it is causing major pain in my right leg (probably sciatica)  I've spent hours trying to get just the right position and nothing works.  It lifts your leg just enough to be uncomfortable.  I looked on line and others have the same problem.  I called GMC about them adjusting it somehow mechanically and no one really cares.  Not possible.  So I had to buy a tacky seat cushon and I'm hoping that works.  You better make sure the 2018 models don't have that slant.  I was in my buddy's Honda truck this weekend.  Ahhhhh.  The pain resided.  3) the salesman told me the radio was the latest technology; that I could play my iphone through the radio, pandora, etc.  I spent hours trying to figure it out.  I called 2 dealers, I called the technical hotline.  I stopped in a dealer twice.  No one could help me get it working.  I was told by the technical line that my model, S1 radio does NOT have that option.  To replace radio would be $1500 or more.  Finally after wasting all that time, I found a special adaptor that allows me to play pandora, etc. through the car radio.  How could no one know that.  Meanwhile, its a great big hassle because I can't charge my iphone and use this adapter at the same time and there is NO other adapter that works.  3) the headliner is like paper.  it has ripped in 3 places and the dealer won't fix it even though I have the ""interior"" warranty.  What a joke.  I've owned and driven company cars for 40 years; at least 20 different cars and only a used Grand Prix in about 1983 had a torn headliner and it was probably already 10 years old.  4) The seat covers are cheap looking and it ruins the overall interior design of the car.  The little holes in the fabric catch food and other things.   5) I'd trade the car in tomorrow but it appears in just nine months,  I'd already lose over $10,000.

While not an option listed above, this was a 6-cyl SLT. After a test drive, the 4-cyl just didn't have the power needed for this truck. With that, though, comes less than stellar mileage, about 18 MPG. The other complaint is that the center console controls are a bit of a stretch, and the nav system could be simpler to operate. Besides those things, the truck has power, room (especially head room), good cargo space, and a generally sweet interior. It's a great ride, and we're very happy with the deal received.",4

This is a bad ass looking vehicle but the four cylinder doesn't cut it.  When merging onto the freeway and pressing the gas pedal firmly it makes all of the right sounds but doesn't actually do anything.  I am disappointed in that. The test drive was in a semi-congested city setting where pep doesn't matter so it was wasn't noticed.  It also has a fairly wide turning radius which surprised me.  I traded a Honda Pilot in for this Terrain.  The Pilot was much larger but had a smaller turning radius.  As much as I like the looks of this car I rate drivability low.  The interior is appointed fairly well and everything is easy to work but the lack of pep distracts from that.  The seat are comfortable on long rides.  It is a great vehicle for driving around town but isn't really a joy on the freeway.,3

I loved the Mazda steering but I did not like the back seat size and the engine could not keep up with very fast traffic and many large hills (without really straining ) on my Suburban NJ commute to NYC.    I liked that car because it felt more like a small sports car in handling (but not power),  but I love this one.  This is my first GMC vehicle and the first GM vehicle I have owned.  First it feels more substantial.  It’s much faster.  Handling is very good.  It’s only 3 “ longer than the Mazda but way more comfortable for passengers.  Best of all the 2.0L engine is really smooth and really good effortless pick up I need for short on ramps to major highways.  It’s relatively more quiet compared to the Mazda.  The tech is way better (also because its newer). Apple car play is great. The nav screens are MUCH better and it has LIVE traffic and I can get the weather channel APP too plus much more.  I am picky about the quality of the audio system in whatever car I drive and this is a GREAT audio system.  Lots of nice gadgets in the car and I like that.  I like that when I go into reverse I can have the mirrors automatically point down to see the parking lines or when parallel parking which I do often.    It has many options to adjust.  The User Interface is easy and intuitive.  I like the GMC app that gives you a report card for driving. It has become somewhat of a joke in my family as the app gives me a grade for driving.   I am a fan of this car so far.  In the articles I have read, it supposedly  ‘cost more’ than other ‘mass market’ small SUV’s, but I was more interested in its features and looks. Having said that GMC had significant incentives taking the price down quite a bit and what I got for the money was a truly loaded automobile.   If you are looking for a smallish SUV- try it- I was surprised how much I liked it and now I love it.  Oh... I was worried if I would like the buttons instead of a stick shifter.  It does take a bit of getting use to- like 2 days- but after that its a no-brainer.  I never use the manual shifters just R, D, P.   If you are a manual shifter person, you would have to test it out  I don't think its ideal for that.  It also automatically puts it in park when you turn it off- nice feature.      Also- I am a tall person and not slim.  I find this car very comfortable.  I have a son 6' tall and he fits in the back with ample leg room.   Front seat ability to fold flat is super nice for the home depot trip with something long.   Its a really nice car and I am happy with it so far.",5

Ultimately, I purchased the 2018 Terrain, and there is plenty to love about this vehicle. The price is very competitive. It seems GMC gets it, equipping this model with the 1.5L Turbo 4cyl. It  gives you fuel economy of 26 city for commuters and errand runners like me, with the power available to make quick lane changes in traffic. I test drove a 2011 Terrain,  2016 Rogue (too peppy) and a 2015 Terrain to purchasing.  The SLE base model comes well-equipped, only missing power seats and roof rack. Enjoy push start ignition/finger shifters/a fully revamped Infotainment system which allows you to place calls while driving with ease to your stored Favorites. There is privacy glass in the back windows. The back seat is spacious and equipped with reading lights. The rear cargo space is about 32"" deep, so luggage and duffels fit with ease for travel. No CD player but a USB for music stored on a flash drive.  The Terrain looks elegant and classy; the interior is quiet and the ride is cushy. The auto stop doesn't bother me at all.

I no longer needed a large 3 row vehicle so I was looking to downsize to a smaller SUV.  The ride of this vehicle is definitely stiffer and not as quiet as the Traverse.  But on the flip side the Terrain's steering is very responsive along with great braking.  At first I wasn't sure about the firmest of the cloth seats but after driving it for 2 months I have found that they are very comfortable and supportive for longer trips.  I have the electric seat and am able to fine tune them for comfort.  The new style button shifter took no time at all to get used to and love the extra space it affords.  The motor is the 1.4 which gives us great gas mileage but if you want a little more power you might want to test drive the 2.0 motor.  Wish that GMC had installed the on/off switch for the stop and start feature as it still seems odd to me to have no motor running when stopping.  I'm sure time will allow me to get used to this feature.  Overall this a great SUV with a stylish interior and exterior look plus it is fun to drive!  Love it!,5

A weird, blocky vehicle.  Harsh ride, loud, and a poor choice of engines...a weak 4 cylinder or an expensive, ""more-than-is-needed"" V-6.   It seems that GM learned from its past mistakes and also from the mistakes of its competitors and created a vehicle with proper balance.  I own an SLT AWD with the 2.0 L turbo.  Amazingly smooth shifts from the 9-speed transmission and it rolls calmly and composed down the road, however, published times of 0-60 of 6.8 seconds are not weak by any means.  Truly balanced.  People complain about the buttons for shifting.  Ridiculous.  It takes about an hour to get used to it.  I swear people posting on the internet just like to have something to whine about.  The big negative for this vehicle is the MSRP.  It is much higher than the competition.  That has always been Detroit's game; high starting price followed by incentives.  I saved $11000 off MSRP after generous March incentives (starting price $39620). Don't pay anything near the sticker price.   Front seats are so supportive allowing for long drives. Back seat room is spacious and comfortable.  Load height in cargo area is perfect with spacious lower cargo compartment beneath floor.   Awesome vehicle. I don't miss my Acadia one bit.",5

The best GM will do is replace part of the housing and 2 solenoids. Oh, they will also make 1 car payment for me.

I am sorry I did.  I have had the vehicle for less than 6 weeks and it is already headed to the dealer for repairs/issues. I have just over 800 miles on the vehicle.  The dashboard molding is separating near the front  passenger airbag and along the rest of the dash towards the driver side.  I am not sure if this will cause any issues with the airbag, but it does have me concerned. As a result my daughter is now riding in the back until I can have it looked at.  I have never had any issues of this nature with any vehicle I have ever owned. Let alone after 6 weeks of ownership.   I am not a fan of the seat materials, they seem very thin and not durable.  I am not sure they will hold up long term. I am not a fan of the auto stop feature of this vehicle. It can be a bit nerve racking when you hear your car start up after being at a light or stop sign. I did have some issues when it was icy and I was stopped on an incline.  I have noticed there is some acceleration issues unrelated to the auto stop feature.  There is a hesitation in the acceleration.  Overall, I wouldn't buy this vehicle again.  Lucky me I am stuck with this vehicle for a few years.

Also downsized from a 6 cylinder to this 4 cylinder turbo - and with the reduced weight, and extra transmission speeds, don't miss the bigger engine at all - this has even more pickup, and the braking is very good, and the mileage improvement more than offsets the extra cost for premium gas. Start-Stop technology easy to get used to, as is the push-pull transmission selectors. Much improved navigation system; great intuitive controls.

I recommend the 2.0L turbo over the 1.5 unless your all about mpg, another option  the 1.6L  turbo diesel.   go test one for your self. After 3k miles i have the same opinion this is an Excellent suv  but i feel gm should add magnetic ride specially to the upper trim like slt and Denali to ged rid of some road noise. Interior quality is good but should be better  for the upper trim level as well. Power is Excellent transmission shift very smooth after a couple of hundred miles of driving and adapting learning is completed. Driver seat is kind of hard but after a while it gets better. Shift knob was very easy to get used to and i will say its the safest in the industry. Blind spot is an issue with this vehicle make sure to get safety package 2 with cross traffic alert and parking assist. Over all a 9 out 10 for lower level and 8 out 10 for higher level.",5

Soft touch materials abound and most things feel like real quality to me.  Mileage is decent and would no doubt be better if I could keep my right foot out of the Turbo.  Cargo space is good.

I traded in the BMW (40MPG and a lot of power). I wanted to get back into an SUV, as I missed my Touareg the most. I did some poking around, some test driving, and ended up at GMC. I've never bought American and I'm so far thrilled with my purchase. The one thing I miss, obviously speed and pickup, is easily justifiable by the comfort and convenience of my car. I bought the SLE. There's no nav, and it's missing some power options that I really don't need (seats that I'll never change and a sunroof I'll never use). The entertainment system is great. I just plug my phone in and everything I want to do I can do verbally through the car or my phone. Play Spotify, Navigate here (I use Google maps off my phone and it projects very nicely on my display), Text my friend this, etc. The design is sleek, the interior extremely comfortable and the ride incredible smooth. Go give it a test drive, you wont be disappointed.",5

Dealers will try to bait you with ""INVOICE PRICING"" acting like they are losing money if they go any cheaper - doesn't mean a thing (they don't tell you about ""HOLD BACK"")  and ask them to throw some ""FLEX CASH"" into the deal that is what it will take to get your best deal and don't be shy about holding firm and saying NO to their counter offers after about a dozen phone calls and counter offers the dealer I ultimately bought mine from came to my terms after originally starting off $2,294 higher and if I had really wanted to play hardball I think I could have gotten it a few hundred cheaper.

2408, on 07/14/16 18:15 PM (PDT),anart04 ,2010 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-1 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Run from this car!!," We've owned a 2010 GMC Terrain SLE 6 cylinder since December 2009. We purchased this after our first child and quickly realized how tiny the backseat was with a carseat installed. Along came baby number 2 and bye-bye went the third passenger in the back. Even just three average adults are squished into that tiny space. I couldn't sit between the 2 carseats and I'm 5'4, 130lbs.  Within the first year, the tailgate needed to be repainted because the back licence plate housing rubbed the paint off. 18 months later, the same thing happened. At the 4 year mark, the inside bottom of all the doors were rusted to the metal. The center console USB plug stopped working after a year. Out of the blue, I got a service stabilitrac warning one day around 60,000 miles accompanied by loud grinding from my brakes. I needed a new wheelbearing, all new brake pads, and rotors, and my emergency brake caliber somehow fell off. At 63000 miles, at startup one evening, the engine sputtered and the notification center said low power mode, service stabilitrack, and the abs, stabilitrak, and check engine light stayed on. After turning the car off and on a few times, the lights turned off, but I still had an intermittent check engine light turn on. The code for that was for a camshaft actuator and the engine had somehow burned or leaked 2 quarts of oil in a very short amount of time. Wasted $300 on a camshaft actuator and the check engine light stayed off long enough for the ride home. Called the dealership next day, they stated that the timing chains usually need to be replaced in these and that may be what is wrong (mind you, ""may be"" to the tune of another $1,000!) They also informed me that they had never changed the timing chains on a 6 cylinder at that dealership. I questioned if it would affect the engines function and was assured that the timing chains made noise when they went bad and I would know when it was time. Fast forward another 8 months and 3,000 miles and my service stabilitrak light, ABS, and check engine lights are on again and the engine has again consumed 3 quarts of oil in a short amount of time(yes, I regularly check the oil). At 70000 miles, the motor failed on the windshield washer pump, so I am unable to wash my front/rear windshield until I repair it. There is currently a recall for an intermittent problem with the seatbelt notification chime dinging despite everyone wearing their seatbelts. This has only happened twice and resolves itself if you restart the engine. This car was garage kept and averaged less than 10,000 miles a year, and I followed the maintenance schedule. I am the original owner. When I contacted GMC, their reply was that the vehicle is out of warranty and then they had the dealership contact me. After some research, I found my issues are similar to other GMC Terrain owners and if your Terrain isn't having any of these issues now, great, but I strongly suggest getting rid of it before this happens. If your looking to purchase a Terrain, please choose something else!!**Update**2018 This beast is still running! In the past year, the moonroof malfunctioned and needed to be completely replaced or permanently closed. It was a difference of a $1000 or $200 repair. You can probably guess what I chose. I now have a sweet sky light in my car that has the tiniest annoying air leak in it, but it's closed at least. I still randomly burn through oil, but again I regularly check it, so I guess it's not an issue. The check engine light permanently stays on. The bottom of the doors are rusting faster than I can drive it. I'm just waiting for the engine to blow up.**UPDATE** summer 2018At 81,000 miles the AC compressor quite working. I figured it would be a sweet $1000 fix, but it was a steal at only $585. The check engine light is on and I still wash my windshield with a bottle of Windex at stop lights, but I'm not burning through as much oil so that's a plus!",2

My son surprised me with this vehicle for Christmas 2 years ago. Needless to say, it was an expensive gift that was NOT worth giving. This vehicle will bankrupt you! If you purchased a 2010 GMC Terrain I certainly hope you have a good warranty to go along with it. You will most certainly need it. The Engine in these vehicles are LEMONS! You better buy stock in engine oil as well. Never mind any recommended oil change schedules you are given. Do it every 2,000 miles or you will pay the price. The best thing about that is, the car will warn you around every 2,000 mile interval. The engine begins to rattle when you press on the accelerator. It will begin to cut off on you upon acceleration. It will surge. It will stall and scare the hell out of you. And KEEP YOUR OIL CHANGE RECEIPTS, you will need them when you have to replace the engine...and you will have to replace the engine! They will try to say you did not change the oil according to schedule. Trust me, If I would of waited to do it every 3,000 (or 5,000 as they suggested) miles the engine probably would have caught fire. There have been numerous other issues as well, but the engine issues and the drastic over consumption of oil are the mother of all other issues. BUYER BEWARE! It's a shame too because I like the design, the body style, and the interior cabin space. But the cons far outweigh the pros.",3

I also purchased their 3rd party warranty (Protective Asset Protection) with hopes to be pro-active and a responsible car owner...- May 2015: Low oil light comes on, I return to Harris Mitsubishi Dealer to be told that they just ""forgot to reset the button but my oil is fine"". They reset it and told me to come back as directed on the reminder window decal. *NO repairs preformed at this time as directed by Harris Mitsubishi*-June 2015: While driving my Terrain dies multiple times when slowing to a stop. Must rev my engine to keep it on. Took immediately to Seaview GMC Service Department (Lynnwood, WA) Diagnostics come back with a TIMING CHAIN ISSUES and my Terrain had been LEAKING and now RUNNING ON NO OIL. *Preformed ALL recommend repairs by Seaview because this part was cover under factory warranty*- October 2015: Check engine light turns on and clicking noise seems to be more regular. Took immediately to Seaview again and now diagnostics show CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAS FAILED and my AC COMPRESSOR is FAILING. $175.00 for diagnostics alone. Catalytic converter is not covered under my warranty and since the ac compressor has not failed they will not replace this. Seaview recommend not driving until these parts are replaced, quoted me at least $1,200 just for the catalytic converter part alone.-November 2015: Researched online for answers only to find out that all of these issues are consistent with other numerous Terrain owners. When I contacted GMC direct 1-866-996-9463 with my frustrations, facts and safety concerns I was told essentially that its a used car that's out of warranty, but they will look into it.... ****My advise to YOU is invest your good hard money into some other vehicle****",1

At first I thought it was a nice car for the money and offered a lot of comforts and conveniences. After 20k miles it needed at timing chain. after 40k miles it needed another timing chain. Shortly after that the ac would cycle on off every 10 seconds. Took it to GMC for ac check and they said was ok. Took it back at least 8 times and they started changing parts and every time they touched it it got worse. Finally they told me it needed a new evaporator because it was leaking. So I took it to another shop for a 2nd opinion and they said they could not see or find any leaks. So back to GMC again and they started messing with the computer. Only to make it worse. Than Yesterday driving home I hear a growling noise coming from the tranny and than my car stoped and I had to get towed to GMC. The next day GMC told me the tranny was toast and it would cost 4400 dollars because I am out of warranty. This car has only 4300 miles on it and has never need driven hard.

I am 19 years old and was lucky enough to drive my parents h3. It was very nice, but the interior and engine power was really lacking in quality.  The interior was alright, but compared to this beautiful brownstone leather with the red trim, it doesn't compare.  The V6 is slow in first, but really speeds up in the other gears.  (Most likely for fuel efficiency.)  Love this car.  As for either the ecotech or v6, i had to get the v6 with the hills, I really enjoy the ride.  If you don't have hills, you can get away with the ecotech.  I am definitely a lead foot driver (college student) and get 17 city and somehow 26 on the highway! Camera is great",5

I am a 6'2"", 375 pound guy who has an artificial leg on one side & a big brace on the other leg. So I needed a car that had great leg room, head room, and belly room. Also needed to set high off ground so getting in & out was easy. The Terrain was my best choice after looking at about 30 different SUVs. It is working great. It has good second row room,& plenty of space in back for big load of groceries or luggage. I also like the smaller size. I have a lift on the back hauling a scooter. I can still fit in parking spaces. I highly recommend it for people needing lots of room up front - it had more than even the biggest SUVs",4.875

In this review I will discuss the exterior, interior, performance, and technology of the Terrain. I hope this helps you decide if this is the vehicle for you.**ExteriorThe GMC Terrain is a sharp looking midsized SUV. If you are a young college student, grandparent, or anyone in between this vehicle can suit your style. It has nice lines and curves and comes with a reverse camera. This vehicle is also nice for tall people because it sits just a little higher up and there are no foot rales on the outside.**InteriorIt is easy to tell that GMC put quality into the inside of the Terrain. The seats have a stylish look to them and are very comfortable. It is roomy in the front but also in the back seats and has lots of leg room and does not feel cramped. If you travel often and need room for your luggage this would be a great vehicle to have. The trunk is fairly sized but if you fold down the back seats the vehicle has more than enough room for anything you need to move.**PerformanceThe GMC Terrain is an excellent vehicle if you only want to use it for around town or highway driving. The breaks work very well. It is an all-wheel drive vehicle therefore it does have a slight bit of trouble in the snow but if it slips or tires spin it recovers quickly. If safety is important to you I would recommend this vehicle.**TechnologyThis vehicle comes fully equip with a digital touch screen radio, a USB and AUX port, and Bluetooth. The display is nice and user friendly. When first purchased, this vehicle’s radio sometime shuts off on its own and would not turn back on. After doing some further research it just needed two system updates, which the dealer will normally cover the cost of. Once this is done the radio is top quality and definitely worth it. One other cool feature is the lane departure system. This lets you know when you are crossing into another lane or going off the road without your blinker, it is very useful for people who do a lot of highway driving.If you are looking for a luxury SUV for practical use, then I would recommend taking a look at a 2016 GMC Terrain. It is a nice looking, quality vehicle that you are sure to love.",4

Supposed to be suitable for sports and utility use, right?  The materials in the cargo area need to be better suited for that use. Even with the factory cargo mat, burrs, dirt, sawdust etc impregnates into the surrounding carpet like on the seat back. It's like Velcro! Vacuuming only pushes it deeper into the fabric. The plastic in the cargo area dents and scratches too easily - materials should be more resilient. Inside of the tailgate should be faced with rubber not semi-hard plastic that is easily damaged. Mechanically this SUV is great. 11k mile and zero issues. Quiet, comfortable ride. Once the 4 cyl engine was broken in, it has adequate power for everyday driving. Controls are easy to see, Bluetooth phone connection was simple. Handle for tilting driver's seat is award to reach when door is closed.  Very nice vehicle for road trips. When folded, rear seat has an angle to it which makes loading long items problematic. Should fold flat. I have to go to a side door and pull cargo the rest of the way into the area.",4

Prices do vary I have noticed from dealership to dealership. I traded in my 2015 owned since 2014 Terrain SLE1 for my new 2016 Terrain SLE2. Most noticeable upgrade on the 4cyl engine is the power. Truly impressed. Gave it about 17 more horse power, you can feel the difference in acceleration on highways. Backup camera made improvements as well especially for parking. On my SLE2 model GMC to access Virtual Advisor feature, on you say OnStar command, I finally figured this out, GM didn't know and OnStar told me NYS discontinued this feature, not true. I'm a happy camper about this again. Car interior is also quieter than previous model. Styling upgrade although modest makes a nice statement especially with the new LED lights and redesigned hood. Not sure why Edmunds is down on this model but it is a well priced, beautifully made, nice riding SUV. I am very happy now owning my second one. I would not have done this if I were unhappy with my first one. Remember I own I don't lease. Not into throwing my money away . It doesn't grow on trees in my house. One more thing MPG is lower in city then advertised but show me one that isn't. Getting about 16 MPG city right now but should go up once its broken in, highway haven't done a trip yet, but based on other terrain I had I'm expecting about 28 MPG not using ECO button.  Another nice thing why I could trade in my 2015 after owning it for 18 months was trade in value, seems it maintained its value well enough to afford me the opportunity to buy the newer model, reset the warranties, get a new SUV with no miles and once again start over again. How much is that worth when you invest your savings? Another consideration when considering this SUV.",5

I have gotten as much as 36 mpg but the average is 26 - 28 mpg.  Love the phone feature where you can call from the vehicle and have great sound talking to someone.

This vehicle seemed to be a good choice according to the reviews, well I was very disappointed to have to come back to the dealership multiple times for recalls and repairs needed that were covered under my warranty. This issue I have is eagerly and reliability. I have a family with four children and every time I ride I this vehicle I got nervous out our safety. I contacted GMC CEO directly and expressed my disappointment of the vehicles performance which resulted in me having $2,400 worth of repairs covered through my warranty. Just a couple months later my vehicle cut off while driving on the highway. I returned it back to GMC only to have a oil consumption completed and no issues or codes to show up on the diagnostic test. GMC customer service then closed my complaint and wished me luck. So I’m stuck with a unsafe SUV that I’m supposed to drive my children in. GMC refuses to take the vehicle back and satisfy the loan therefore I was forced to purchase another vehicle and pay on this SUV that isn’t safe to drive. I will not say that all vehicle through GMC are bad but the Terrian needs to be taken off the market. This vehicle will end up killing a family at some point.",1

2489, on 01/18/18 13:07 PM (PST),Ron Hutchinson ,2011 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-1 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Avoid This Vehicle," I wish I had known about this website before purchasing a 2011 GMC Terrain. This thing is a lemon. I bought it at the end of June 2017. I made two trips from Southern Ilinois to North Carolina. I also made one trip to Nashville, TN. These long-distance trips were relatively uneventful. Ever since then it's been one problem after another. The Accelerator sensor needed to be replaced. Then the throttle body went bad which made the engine go into 'Reduced Power Mode.' That means you limp along at 20 mph. After cleaning the throttle body,(easy to remove in the 4 cylinder) it would drive around town with no problem. But on the highway, it would go into reduced power mode. If you pull over, shut the engine off, wait a minute or two and restart it, it would be fine for a short while and do it all over again. The dealer wanted $400.00 to replace the Throttle Body, but I found one for less than half that and replaced it myself.  Then the catalytic converter went bad. At least GM warrantied that, but while replacing it, they found the exhaust manifold was cracked. I'm waiting for a phone call to find out if the extended warranty I purchased will cover that.  One word about the extended warranties the dealerships offer, DON'T.  They aren't worth the paper they're printed on.  On a positive note, we get around 30 mpg highway and an average 23 mpg for both city and highway.",1
2490, on 01/04/18 16:47 PM (PST),am ,2011 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-1 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),GMC lies - whats a warrenty?," I bought my 2011 GMC Terrain and actually really loved the car.  I was getting pretty good gas millage compared to others I have read about.  It ran well, was just the right size for me, nice looking, I just really liked it.  UNTIL the engine died, I was just driving along and ... stop ... I'm like what the heck.  I am very responsible with my vehicles I did regular oil changes every 3000 miles using the required synthetic oil.  Then all of a sudden it just stops running.  I had the car towed to my usual ASE certified mechanic whom I have known since high school, who has worked on all of out vehicles.  He informed me the yes the timing chain came off but the worse thing was there wasn't any oil in the car, not a drop.  I had just scheduled one of my usual maintenance oil changes for the following week and if would have just about exactly the 3000 miles mark so that made no sense at all.  This is when we found on line a service bulletin on the 2011 Terrain/Equinox this bulletin was regarding oil consumption.  This bulletin described exactly what happened to my car so we had it brought to the dealer we bought it (Chevy dealer but that's still GM).  The bulletin also had a special warranty attached in which I fill all the parameters to have it fixed yet IT WAS NOT.  They claimed since I had not brought my car to a dealer for it's regular maintenance it wasn't any good.  So one they pretty much said my certified mechanic was worthless is how I see that but any....   when I asked why there was no notification regarding the ""service bulletin"" they said the only ones that get it GM dealers because ""service bulletins"" are non life threatening issues so they don't notify the owners.  So how are we supposed to know and monitor the problem if we are not informed about the problem.  And non life threatening - really your driving and boom the car stops running.  I was at a stop light, it turned green and it didn't move - then I noticed it wasn't running (power was fine) - at this point I'm out into a busy intersection with about 10 cars behind me honking and such, unable to move - the light turns cars the other direction are trying to go around me, what if one didn't see me - boom, tell me that could not have been a very life threatening situation.   We fought the dealer, who charged us an extra 300 to look further into the engine, half way there GM said stop but yet now we still have to pay this 300 and they never really finished the job - telling us exactly what needs fixing.   We filed something with GM and of course was told it was a ""service bulletin"" and we didn't have a GM dealer service it to monitor it (and we would know how) - plus the manager of that area had his assistant call us to tell us they were declining out claim - poor thing she got an earful and it wasn't her fault that he was to inconsiderate to return the call himself and answer questions.  Ok this is long but one last thing - the core values of out deal #1 Do the right thing - nothing is work compromising a relationship (well that a lie) #2 Display positive energy - a good attitude is highly contagious (well another lie)  #3 Lead by example - be willing to help no matter how difficult the challenge (well there were no help they didn't even try except charge us for nothing)  #4 Be open minded - the only thing that is constant is change (well they better change their attitude towards helping the customers that's all I have to say).   All that plus the fact, yes I'm pulling the cancer card, but I have been battling this for a little of 2 years chemo, radiation, 8 surgeries in 2.5 years (6 totally cancer related) needless to say when your off work for all those surgeries 4-6 weeks it's rather hard to pay bill as well as all the medical bills you rack up during that time.  Then GM throws in your face - your not worth our time.    NICE",3

Finally (after much frustration) GM put a new engine in the car and, after another road trip, I took it to the dealer for an additional problem.  I'd been on message-boards about GM vehicles and the 2011 vehicles seemed to have improved this issue, so I decided to take a chance on trading the Equinox for a 2011 Terrain.  This SUV offered a smooth, quiet ride initially with good handling and great, little percs, like Sirius, bluetooth and a seat that I could adjust to exactly the way I wanted it....plus I loved the privacy windows,leather seats and moon roof.  However, after a short time, the transmission began shifting hard in low gears, particularly on an incline.  I really enjoyed the car and, stupidly, didn't want to have to deal with the dealer again over 'supposed problems', so I let the problem ride....it seemed minor after the huge difficulties with the Equinox. Well, needless to say, I just had to put in a rebuilt transmission at 115,000 miles.  Now, deciding whether to take more chances after this investment, or to trade it in and be done with it.  I know many of the positive reviews are from new buyers in the 2011 time period.....buyer beware.....I'm looking at Subaru's.",3

There is extended coverage for this issue. Be sure to signup on my.gmc.com and explore the ""Special Coverage"" bulletins for yourself. The fact that this was not a recall is absolutely ridiculous and the reason I will even consider another GM product. I had to jump through hoops having oil consumption tests(every 500 miles I think) but in the end they did a partial rebuild of the engine. Problem solved. The dealers are aware of this. I had little or no consumption after 1000 miles but after 2000 I needed 3 or 4 quarts of oil.  Secondly after some 72,000 miles my transmission ceased to work except in 1st gear. The warranty had expired after four years(which allowed up to 100,000 miles, argh). The Trans shop told me this was fairly common in this transmission. Argh!!! This car was bought new by my stepson and he had many issues. He thought they had all been rectified. Boy was he wrong(the two major repairs I mention were done since I owned the car)! If I had taken the time to research here, I would never have bought it. Lastly, a few comments about the interior. The door lock button is in the middle of the dash. The drivers seat is not very comfortable.  The drive of the car was pretty solid and I think it looks good but those are not enough to consider this auto. I still cannot believe the 2016/2017 version looks nearly identical.",2

Fine, got repaired after numerous apologies from GMC. That was after 6 months!! Then, the year after owning the engine was burning too much oil after I have complained several times and all the advisors say there is no problem with the engine maam. Really? Then they keep my car again for another two weeks after they believed me!! Changed out the engine parts....ok fine. As of a month ago the ""terrifying of all terrifying"" my whole entire transmission fails and stalls on me at an intersection!! The advisor at GMC does not help me at all but tells me to tow the car there and no cars available to use while my car is in repair for almost three weeks!! Then decides to call me days later after my nightmare to apologize and then offer me to use a loaner??? I totally understand the concept cars break down but not a second time after you had time to repair my transmission the first time!! I was so furious, and all I got was apologies. Definately not happy.  Just what I thought exactly the first time all over again. GMC has taken a toll over and over again. Never ever doing business with GMC, people please take your money and business elsewhere. I am no happy I ended my night mare and got me a new honda hr-v.

Beginning 3/2016 I've consistently taken my car into the dealer for the following issues; Stability Track/ Check Engine Light stays on/ Engine speed reduces. Each time that I took the car into the dealer they would inform me that the problem was fixed. They would keep my car for days sometimes weeks. I would have to get a rental car while they had my car. On or about the 4th time of me taking the car back, I spoke with a General Manager that assured me they would have the problem fixed. Over a holiday weekend the dealer called to ask me if i would authorize them to keep my car some additional days to insure the problem would be fixed this time after service. I gave them my authorization. In the meantime, I spoke with GMC Corp offices who suggested that I take the car to another dealer. When I received the call to go pick up my car. I drove it off the lot, went 2 blocks and the engine speed reducing light came on immediately. I turned the car around and drove it back! I pulled into the lot (again), put the car in park and went to get the Manager. He came out to see the lights (which they told me time and time again they could NEVER get the lights to come on) he had a Master Tech come look at the car. He hooked it up to a machine. They asked if they could keep my car (again) for 1 day (which turned into 4 days). This time when they called me back to pick up the car i started driving home and WITHOUT ANY WARNINGS the car shut down on the frwy....to this day my car is STILL shutting down without any indicator lights whatsoever! I've spoken the Corporate Offices. Now im taking matters into my own hands before im in a fatal accident and my family is left to fight with GMC. ....This has been the worst NIGHTMARE EVER!!!!!",1

In those 7 months I have had 2 major repairs which have caused my vehicle to be in the repair shop 5 times.  Three of the five times I have had to have a rental vehicle (luckily I only had to pay for 1 rental).  This last one included a tow of the vehicle to the repair shop.  These two major repairs are KNOWN defects by GM, per consumer reports.  The oil consumption issue with the engine was a known and recognized default by the manufacturer.   GM paid for the repairs and my rental, but I was without my vehicle for almost a week.  Transmission failure is the second major repair and is covered under my warranty (NOT BY GM).  Repairs have taken longer than a week and the warranty only covers a rental for 7 days.  Again, I am paying for a rental for repairs to a known defect.  I may not be out thousands of dollars for each repair at the point of service, thanks to the purchase of my warranty up front; but, the frustration, time spent handling the repairs, and concern for safety during my break downs on the road is ridiculous.

This problem warrants a recall. The doors are so lightweight that they will slam on you when opening/closing which is dangerous to passengers.This needs to be sorted by GMC as it's dangerous. Passenger airbag light doesn't work. Poor gas mileage.,3.375

It is now 6 months later and I sold the vehicle. Thought I would adjust to the weak engine, never did. It annoyed me more everyday. I do live near Pittsburgh PA. The area definitely has a lot of hills which is where the Terrain seemed to struggle the most. Had I lived in an area where it is more flat maybe I could have been happy with it. As far as comfort, space, reliabilty it was great. I really did like all other aspects of it. There are tons of these and the Equinoxes with 4 cyl. out there maybe I just expected too much. ******Original****** I purchased vehicle recently. I've put about 1500 miles on it so far. I wanted the 4cyl for the fuel economy as this is my everyday driver. To date I'm a little let down with the mileage. I live near Pittsburgh PA and we have had unusually cold weather this winter.  -5° lows to 10° above highs for the last coupe of weeks. I'm getting about 23MPG in this cold weather. A little disappointed in that. With my commute and driving habits I have typically been able to get really close to EPA highway ratings in everyday driving with previous vehicles. We did have a few days about 50°since having the vehicle, one of those days I did drive on a longer trip and was able to get 26.1 MPG. I'm hoping when this cold spell goes away mileage will improve. Aside from that, the 4 cyl is  under powered. Living in hilly terrain, it does downshift on a lot of the hills on the interstate. When it does it seems as though it is shifting down one gear more than it needs to and the engine roars. When topping the hill it will often not shift back into  higher gear until well over the crest and sometimes you need to lessen pressure on gas pedal significantly.  As far as the rest of the vehicle, I'm very happy with everything. I really like the interior, they chose high end looking materials and it seems more than an entry level SUV when inside. It is roomy and comfortable. It has the 8 speaker Pioneer stereo with sub and is very good. Clear, crisp sound and it definitely has more volume potential than I need. The interior is also very quiet including at highway speeds. The seats are pretty good, seat heaters are great, warm up quickly. I find myself lowering settings in a few minutes even in the very cold weather we've been having. The back seat has plenty of room for adults to be comfortable. The NAV has a flaw I've noticed. The small information boxes on left of map screen which tell you ETA, distance to next turn etc. are very small. I really have to strain to see them. I've looked briefly in the manual but haven't been able to find an option to enlarge them. Otherwise Nav works very well. The ride quality is very good and the vehicle seems solid. At this point I'm happy with the vehicle. I knew going in the 4cyl was weak. I'm adjusting to it.",3

This time the dealer is saying I have to pay $1700 to have harnesses changed to fix the stabilitrak.  This is outrageous.

This is not acceptable.  2nd, the front of the car is too low.  I am sick and tired of worrying about how close I am to a parking stop or curb or hitting the front going up a steep driveway.  I would never consider taking it on a dirt road or out in the snow and getting stuck with the low front profile.  Things I really like are the rear camera, being able to talk on my cell phone hands free through the radio, and the leg room inside.  We are a tall family and both the front and back seats have more than enough room to sit comfortably on long trips.  I like the seat material and everything has been easy to clean.  We cut our gasoline bill in half by selling our Silverado truck and getting the Terrain.  Other dealers don't want to fix it when you are away from home, though.  The power steering quit working during a trip we took shortly after we leased it.  The front end had to be replaced and we had to drive home 1100 miles without power steering and take it to our dealer because the one in Oklahoma refused to fix it.  That is really bad customer service.  Our dealer has been provided excellent service, always helpful.",4

2566, on 07/12/16 06:05 AM (PDT),Lori ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-1 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Very nice car for traveling and local driving," This car would be about perfect except for two main things. First, it has no rear air conditioning and we have to freeze in the front so passengers or our little dog aren't too hot in the back seat, and dual controls would be appreciated because we fight over the temperature constantly.  Second, it is too low to the ground and has a plastic wrap around border on the bottom of the car which means you have to be very careful when you park not to hit parking stops or curbs and you can't take it off road on rough ground without worrying about damage as well as having to forget about steep driveways.  The gas mileage is excellent and we bought it for traveling.  We are very tall and the seats go way back in the front and the back seat is adjustable, too, and is comfortable even for very tall people.  It is easy to get in and out of because the seats aren't as low as a car.  This is not a Subaru Outback type vehicle... I suggest staying on the paved roads.  The drivers side is rather noisy on most roads, but tolerable.  I appreciate the back-up camera. I wish we could have afforded the AWD, but so far no problems with only FWD.  The power steering went out on our second trip and we had to have the entire front end replaced, but the car has worked fine ever since.  However the dealer in another state wouldn't fix it and we had to drive it back to our state without PS to get it repaired and that lack of GM service was a shock.  For maintenance our local dealer has been great.",4

We had a cx5 and there just wasnt enough space to drive safely.  Be careful with parking forward facing.   We lost the under carriage the first time my wife drove it on an average curb.  Other than that we love it but I think I'd hate it if it was a 4 cylinder.,4
2568, on 05/14/16 16:40 PM (PDT),A. Holbrook ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-2 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),If it wasn't so noisy!," GMC has a great mid-small SUV in the Terrain, but after about 7500 miles it started to develop small rattles in the interior.  Also, the 2.4L engine is LOUD.  The noise suppression system seems to kick in a bit late, leaving it noisy around 40 to 45 miles per hour.  This is a great car to take trips due to the interior space and spacious back seat, and can get up to 35 mpg according to the computer on our last trip to Canada.  If you don't mind an occasionally noisy interior and a buzzy engine when you need power, then this is your vehicle.  I'm not sure if I will lease another GMC next time unless some of the problems are taken care of.",4
2569, on 03/06/16 12:45 PM (PST),OJ Sergent ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-1 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Simply put. I got rid of that piece of junk.," I dislike this car. I bought it with 25k miles and now has 28k.  I am 5'3"" tall and it's very hard to get in and out of. Guess I didn't really give that much attention. My head hits the top of the  opening if I don't bend or go in head first. I am 81 years old and the ol' body doesn't bend as easily. My wife has the same problem on the passenger side. Additionally, when using the ATM machine it's very hard to reach over the window sill to use the ATM controls.The quarter panel behind the front wheel caved  in when snow/ice built up in the wheel well  and the wheel  hit it while turning. Dealer grabbed a hold of it and pulled it back out with very little effort. CHEAP. He said to be sure to keep the wheel wells free of ice build up because it will happen again. CHEAP.

The safety features about drove me nuts but once I got used to them (or turned them off) they were fine.  I love the interior, very comfortable to drive and the seats feel great.  I especially love the heated seat feature.  I previously had an Envoy that I dearly loved.  The ride in the Envoy was much smoother and less stiff.  I have found though, that all the smaller SUV's have that log wagon feel, where you can feel almost every bump.  I am 100% satisfied with the overall performance of this vehicle, however I may consider a larger SUV next time to improve the ride.  The gas mileage is good, I like the infrequent trips to the gas station.",5
2572, on 11/13/15 08:20 AM (PST),Romualdas Stanenas ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV SL 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),"Designed for 6'2"" guys", Excellent value for the money.,5
2573, on 11/10/15 12:36 PM (PST),Rick ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-2 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Very good vehicle - most of the time," We basically picked this vehicle based on cost after our GMC Envoy XL had major problems, but we very happy with the choice after the fact. We wanted an Acadia, but the $10K+ price difference was too much. The Terrain rides great, it's easy to drive, is comfortable and pretty spacious for a ""compact"" SUV.  It has way more room in the back seat than the Envoy did and I know it has better front passenger area than the Envoy. We fit 5 of us (kids 16, 8 & 3) but it's a little tight (my 8 yr old can't us his booster seat with 3 in the back seat).  It's easy and comfortable to drive (even when loaded down) and it's mostly quiet.  There is a lot of tire noise (not sure if it's the car or the tires though) which can get really loud on the highway.  The cargo area is a little small considering this isn't really a small vehicle, but the back seat can be adjusted to make more space (but not by much without sacrificing all the leg room).  We recently took a 2500+ mile trip with all of us.  Even loaded with all 5 of us and all the luggage (including a roof cargo box) the ride and handling were very good.  I was surprised the back end didn't lower much once everything/everyone was loaded up either.  You noticed the weight when driving, but it didn't make it much harder to drive and I quickly got used to it. Even after 12+ hours in the car we didn't feel really stiff or sore and we survived with 3 in the back seat.  This is where I wished we got the 6 cyl motor though.  The 4 cyl is good 90% of the time for us, so it probably is the better overall choice.  It really struggled at higher speeds (70 MP+) with all of us and the luggage; although understandably so considering it was probably about 1000 lbs of people & gear.  We only got about 23 MPG for the trip so I was disappointed in that (I expected about 25 MPG with the cargo box). It downshifts on almost any kind of hill trying to maintain speed.  The constant shifting gets annoying; especially when it kicks down a couple of gears.  It's kind of like 2 different vehicles when it comes to the mileage (even without the cargo box).  If you stay between 60 - 65 MPH it easily gets 28 - 30 MPG.  Once you start going 70 or more it really drops off to low to mid 20's. I guess because the squared off styling.Overall = Likes: styling, comfort (although the seat material with the holes can be a little itchy & collects crumbs/dirt), ride, stereo is very good, gas mileage (most of the time) and safety ratings. Good amount of storage places, cup holders and charging ports.  The center console is quite large which can make it a little hard to find things with too much stuff in it. I think the headlights and fog lights work great; good brightness and distance so you don't have to use high beams all the time.  Dislikes: 4 cyl when the vehicle is loaded up, no rear A/C vents and the front ones are low (glad we got a light colored one), cargo area is a little small. My 8 yr old says the center seat in the back is too hard.  The transmission downshifts a lot because it always tries to get to the highest gear.  It can be difficult to try to accelerate a little bit without it downshifting (and sometimes it goes down 2 gears).Update 5/26/16:Most of what I previously stated still applies to this vehicle.  Overall, I really like this SUV and my wife and I enjoy driving it.  It's comfortable, rides and handles well, and gets good mileage (especially compared to averaging about 15 MPG with our Envoy).  We have over 28K miles in the year we've had it and never had a problem and no rattles, random noises, etc.  A little thing that continues to annoy me: the back wiper design.  It doesn't extend away from the window very far so it makes it difficult to clean the whole wiper blade and where it rests; making it hard to keep the window and blade clean. Admittedly, I have a ""thing"" about clean windows so it's probably just me.  My biggest problem is still the engine. If you have to try to accelerate quickly, it just doesn't like it. It downshifts multiple gears and makes a lot of engine noise, revs way up but very little forward motion with all of that.  Again, for most of the time it's fine, but lane changes or passes have to be planned.  If I had the V6 though I probably wouldn't be happy with the gas mileage.  GMC needs to figure out and engine in between the two that gives more horsepower without killing mileage.  Maybe the turbo 4 (2 liter I think) GM uses in a lot of their other cars or better yet the diesel from the Canyon  would be ideal (probably never happen).  I started driving a 03 Highlander as my daily driver now.  The difference between the ride, handling, noise, etc. is definitely in favor of the Terrain in that comparison.  The V6 in the Highlander makes my highway driving so much easier though and I still get about 22 mpg.",4

2575, on 08/28/15 03:08 AM (PDT),marona ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV SLE-2 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),GMC Lover," I've had my 2015 GMC Terrain for 3 weeks now and completely love it.  The exterior is shiny with chrome features that really set it off.  I'm in love with the front end style, the grill and headlights are so classy.   It's comfortable, stylish, affordable (lease), great gas mileage, easy on the eyes.  I'm coming out of a 4 dr sedan so riding higher than normal is awesome. The interior features are good, with the exception of the vent placement.  I like air movement, weather it be cool or warmer air - I like to feel it on me.  The placement of the vents don't allow that to happen unless I lean towards the center, over the arm rest.  The steering wheel is in the way and while I can adjust the wheel to tilt and extend, it doesn't help much.  I will update again once I've owned for awhile and have a trail run in the snow.  So far, impressed. I feel like I'm driving a luxury vehicle and a mid class price level.  I recommend test driving if you're at all interested.",5
2576, on 05/28/15 17:49 PM (PDT),tradedcmax ,2015 GMC Terrain SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (2.4L 4cyl 6A),I have the Denali AWD with the 6 cylinder," UPDATE # 2:  After now 2 years, I'd say this is still a great SUV.  There are some things I don't like.  But all in all, it is a good vehicle.  The cargo area is smaller than I'd like, and seems much smaller than my RAV4.  The rear seat room is great, but you use up cargo room doing this.  The large sloped rear of the body cuts into cargo room as well.  My feet hurt after driving this SUV, and I tend to feel stiff from the seats - they seem like they don't have shaping in the seats.  The NAV system is annoying, but it works.  The touch screen is hard to reach.  Little things like this.  But the vehicle runs well, no breakdowns, and seems solid.  UPDATE:  After a year with this vehicle, there are some good and bad things.  The ride continues to feel like a high end luxury ride.  And that is saying something when you are driving this each day.  The MPG's range from 15-20, and mostly somewhere in between.  For a big 6 cylinder with just over 300hp, I'd say that is to be expected.  No worries merging in high speed traffic, this car is super fast.  The nav system is so crazy - just yesterday I was trying to find a point of interest by name, and it was not in there.  It was a cemetery, but if Waze GPS app can find it, why not the car's nav system?  The bluetooth phone integration is annoying.  If I make a call with my phone, and put it on handset mode, it only stays on handset mode until someone answers, then it goes back to hands free.  Then, I transfer to handset and it will periodically go back to handsfree.  Why?  I don't know.  But using Waze it will automatically put you onto bluetooth audio and start/stop with directions, mostly pausing the music.  That is such a pain.  This is my wife's car but I've unconnected my phone because it is too frustrating.  The cool part though, is when it uses your phone to make a call, it dims the A/C or heat to make it less loud.  The insulation in this car is amazing, it is so quiet compared to my car, lending itself to that luxury ride thing.  The cargo area is skimpy, but if you fold the seats, and move the rear seat forward, it makes it better.  It is not a low height load floor and the rear wheel wells cut into valuable cargo room.  Sad, but true.  The good thing though is that you can move the rear seats back to make more legroom for rear passengers and that is really good as I rarely carry cargo vs. hauling people.  In fact, I use my RAV4 for cargo since it seems to carry more and more easily and save this for hauling our family members as it is a comfy ride.  The only complaint about the build quality is that the rear tail lenses were leaking water at the car wash when I first bought it, but that has not happened since.  You'll be hard pressed to find another ride that feels as luxurious as this for the money.  The powertrain warranty on the 2015 is 60 months/100,000 miles - which was changed to 60 months/60,000 miles for 2016, which is disappointing.  I'm predicting few repairs, as it has a really nice build quality.   The carpets are real carpets, not a hard piece of fake carpet.  The seats are luxurious leather and feel like it.  The car has a quality feel unrivaled by other competitors.  And I like the more squared shape than the newer rounded edged SUV's.  Would I recommend it?  If I wanted a luxurious ride and not spending $50K at the big ""M"", yes.  If I wanted a people hauler and not a cargo hauler as the primary purpose, yes!  And if I didn't mind spending $5K more than for a RAV4, to get that superior ride and handling, then yes! The only other thing I should mention that comes to mind is that the steering wheel will give you a workout, and that it doesn't have a great turning radius.  Yes, tight turns in parking lots are hard to do - and wears you out.  The steering is VERY stiff, not loosey goosey.  I find it annoying, but tolerable.  My wife loves that firm feeling.  While we have only had this for a couple of weeks, it is proving to be a great SUV/CUV.  It isn't the cheapest out there, but for a premium ride and feel, coupled with the money off of sticker price, it is a nice compromise.  For the sticker price, you could get more bang for your buck at a competitor, but after taking money off, that isn't so true. This vehicle has a premium feel and ride, with some decent features.  Compared to my foreign SUV/CUV, it feels like I'm driving a high end model, even though my foreign SUV/CUV is a limited trim.  Everything seems more luxurious in the Terrain.  It is a nice blend of size and features.",4

Was a little skeptical of the 4cyl. engine at first, however it has plenty of power for my needs. Interior is very rich and well designed and comfortable . Like driving in a cockpit . Smooth ride, feels like a higher end car ride. Considering what 2 year old SUV's go for nowadays I say this is a tremendous value for the money.

Never once took it to the dealer for any problems other than oil changes and tire rotations.   Fuel economy was rather good.  The car lacked acceration and the gears were pretty bad going up hills it would always shift into a lower gear going up hills.   Economy mode was pretty worthless on it.    The inside technology was ok in it.  The backup camera and larger center sceeen was fantastic.    The on board dash computer provided good info.   The worst thing about the technology was not being able to listen to music through Bluetooth. That was a huge miss.    The ride was always nice and smoothe and quiet.

I enjoy the AWD and the cargo area (I do not have kids and use the cargo mainly for groceries, gardening, trips to the hardware store, etc.). The interior is sharp looking and the car has great speakers and entertainment system for it's price range. What I dislike most about the car is it's power (or lack thereof). I previously had a 4-cyl vehicle so I thought this would be ok, but it is very laggy on acceleration. Sometimes during fast acceleration the transmission does not seem to want to shift. I have also had many issues with the brakes, finally replacing the rotors, calipers, and brake pads to solve the problem. In the first year I owned the vehicle I had to put over $1,500 into it in repairs, and most of that cost was parts as my boyfriend did much of the labor. At an age of only 5 years old I had to bring it in for a new exhaust manifold; the original was cracked and irreparable. From the research I did this is a common problem with this vehicle. So while I enjoy the mpg, interior styling, and entertainment system in this vehicle, I do not think it is reliable and am planning to get rid of it as soon as I am able (that reminds me, the ""clean retail"" value of this car completely tanked from $18,000 to $11,500 in the 22 months I have owned it!)",3

I had an issue with the sun roof drain, the drain tube broke. This caused water to seep into the passenger cabin and finally caused mold to grow in carpet.  The vehicle was covered by a GMPP, yet GM and yes Mary Bara refused to cover the cost of the $1400 repair. The selling dealer even offered to cover my insurance deductible (auto insurance covered the repair) but I turned down the offer. It was up to GM to pay for the repair. Since GM was a bunch of jerks, my Terrain will be the last GM vehicle in my driveway. As much as I do enjoy owning the Terrain, I cannot continue to do business with a company who has forgotten where the revenue comes from. I told the dealer principle that if he obtains another brand, I will do business with him. I was actually trying to find out about an oil separator for the Terrain. I came across this forum. I must say that the issues other spoke of I have never experienced. My biggest issue with this vehicle is the power drivers seat. It has now failed twice since I own the vehicle, however the repairs were performed under the warranty and the GMPP. As far as the fuel mileage, well the 32mpg advertised is not an SLT-1 or with AWD. The AWD alone is 300 lbs. I purchased the 4cyl and found out that between the SLT trim (extra sound deadening) and the AWD, that little engine is just overworked from a standing start. However for my purposes the vehicle is just fine. I do not pull a trailer, or carry heavy loads. I go supermarket shopping and just short trips. The vehicle is very comfortable and I totally enjoy the Pioneer sound system. I have not had any issues with oil consumption, but that maybe due to my personal maintenance program. I have the oil changed 3 months/3k miles, not 7500 miles as recommended. I have had the vehicle dealer serviced 100%, and the dealer is just wonderful. I do not drive the vehicle hard. But I took delivery on April 30th, 2012, and currently have about 23k miles on it.  My daily driver is a 2015 Subaru Outback Limited 2.5i. The Subaru's 175 hp 4 cyl has way more low end torque than the 185 hp 4 cyl in the Terrain.  Other than my error in ordering the 4cyl, I love the Terrain.

2589, on 05/20/16 19:44 PM (PDT),Alan D. ,2012 GMC Terrain SUV SLT-1 4dr SUV (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Very Nice Vehicle - No Complaints," We have a 2012 STL-1 and couldn't be happier. It has more than 119,000 miles on it and not one serious mechanical issue. We had one check engine light issue. It was a minor repair costing less than $100.00. We've never had to add oil between changes. As far as fuel mileage, we average 26.6 overall, 22 in town and 29.8 on the highway at 68 MPH, our normal highway speed. In town, we don't make jack-rabbit starts and approach stop signs slowly. Also, dealers, no matter the company, are required to use the EPA fuel mileage estimates. They test these cars with no passengers, no wind resistance, no A/C with no stops and starts. Chances of getting the published fuel mileage is very unlikely. The dealership isn't lying, in most cases. They just report the EPA findings.The car is comfortable and a pleasure to drive. Everything has worked as it should from day one. A far as those folks who complain about the turning radius, ""mushy"" brakes and relatively slow acceleration ... did you not drive the vehicle first? If so, you should have noticed these things before your purchase. If you didn't test drive it, then you have no one to blame but yourself. Our dealer let us test drive for about 15 miles, part in town, part on the highway.  Of course, you would have had no idea about the oil consumption issues several folks have mentioned. That would not be your fault.We are very pleased with our Terrain. And no, I am not in anyway connected to General Motors. This is the first General Motors product I have owned since a 1960 Chevy station wagon I bought in 1974. Here's wishing everyone the best of luck with their GMC Terrain.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's been about a year since I did the initial survey (above). The only thing different from what we said back then is we did have to have a right-rear wheel bearing replaced. But, that's not unusual at 126,600 miles.

I noticed about 6 months ago that while at a stop sign, it wanted to jerk forward while my foot was on the brake.  I called my dealer and they said it may be low on oil.  I took it in and they performed an oil change, saying it was low on oil.  The problem was fixed, but I noticed it was not running smooth.  Now understand, I am not mechanically inclined whatsoever,  and there was no check engine light.  Then last week it started jerking again and almost stalling out.  Once again, I called the dealership and made an appointment.   Before I could get in, I was at an intersection and the car stalled out.  And thankfully, it was right in front of my dealership.  I limped it in and they said I had less than a quart of oil.  They would do a oil change.  Long story short, the cylinder head needs to be replaced.  My car only has 60,000 miles on it.",3

2677, on 07/11/18 09:33 AM (PDT),Steven D. ,2017 GMC Sierra 1500 Double Cab SLT 4dr Double Cab 4WD SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),"First year of ownership, 2017 SLT Double Cab 6.2L"," The performance from the 6.2L V8 is exceptional, torque can be had at any engine speed, the 8-speed shifts a lot better then the 6-speed, which hampered my 2014 SLT with the 5.3L V8.  It surprises many how quick the truck is and the passing power is phenomenal.  Towing is easy, especially hooking up a trailer with the backup camera.  With tow-haul mode engaged, towing is relatively effortless with the 6.2.  Braking, handling, and ride quality are adequate for a full-size truck, but much better than most older trucks.  The seats are large and comfortable, especially for highway use.  They're not bolstered especially well for sporty driving, and rear seat room is limited with the double cab - the back seat is straight against the cab wall.  Ergonomics are excellent - the center console with the bucket seats can fit a laptop or several file folders, the underseat storage accessory is great for holding a few tools, and there are plenty of cupholders and cubbies for front and rear passengers.  Technology is great, the active safety tech works well though I've had several false alarms with the emergency braking and forward collision warning, the active lane keeping works well.  Navigation, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, Bluetooth are all there, even Wi-Fi, an owner experience app with cool features (MyGMC), OnStar telematics and emergency services, SiriusXM radio, and even a cool little app store with podcasts and other available apps.  The infotainment system is easy to use and intuitive.  Most buttons are large and placed conveniently, and the infotainment is set up so you don't have to dig through menus to find most features.  I love the spray-on bedliner, cargo tie downs, LED bedlights, and bumper-mounted bed steps.  They make using the truck easier.  The LED headlights are a welcome addition - the standard halogen headlights are not bright enough.  I'd recommend springing for the Intellibeam headlights for a little extra visibility at night. In just over 12,000 miles and 1 year of driving, I have had 1 oil change and service around 7,000 miles and have had no issues or reasons to bring it to the dealer, a welcome improvement over my 2014 with its malfunctioning Safety Alert Seat, A/C condenser, a set of tires, and radiator all before being traded in at 39,000 miles.  Gas mileage is about 15 on average with the 6.2, I mostly drive on 2-lane backroads and in town.  I've gotten over 25 mpg on a 200 mile highway trip before.  BOTTOM LINE:  No truck or car is without it's compromises, but I have been very happy with my purchase.  PROS: Acceleration, utility, technology, ergonomics and large list of creature comforts.  CONS: 8-speeds seems too much, although it shifts a lot smoother than the 6-speed in my 2014; interior quality is a little lacking, they keep getting more and more expensive.",5

Low speed shifting and No Gas Cap.   My truck is the SLT Premium Plus package that has the 8 speed transmission.   At slow take offs it shifts hard to 2nd gear.  Have also experienced ""lunging"" into 2nd gear when crawling to a stop such as heavy traffic.  This could be dangerous if so be alert!    I was told by the stealership that is is an adaptive learning transmission and it would learn my driving habits.  Well,  I now have 2900 miles on it with no change.   My transmission obviously a slow learner. Now the gas cap...  Capless fuel filler is the most ridiculous option that GM has come up with in my opinion.  The 5 seconds that it takes to unscrew and screw back on the cap doesn't justify the ""convenience"".   First off, there is nothing to keep dirt, water, or any other element from pooling on the flapper door for the nozzle insertion.   The time that I am suppose to save by not have to remove or install the cap is used searching the gas pump island for a paper towel to soak up the gas that will inevitably pool on top of the flapper.   Water always pools here as well whenever the truck is washed or it rains.   GM, please bring back the tried and true GAS CAP!  Absolutely happy with the fuel mileage for a big V8 truck.   I can get 24 mpg on a 55MPH road and 19's on a 70MPH road.   City is OK.  Averaging 15-16MPG.",4

With the 6 cylinder engine I have been getting an average of 20.2 mpg. Not the greatest but I believe it's better than the same truck with the 5.3 motor. I did my research and I thought, do I really want a full-size pick-up with a 6 cylinder engine/ Through the research it can tow the same amount as the 5.3L but at a cheaper price initially for than the 5.3L, plus I don't tow a lot. With that being said; the smaller engine theoretically should have cheaper maintenance costs and being the base model with the smaller rims the tires are cheaper too. This exact model definitely seemed the biggest bang for my buck. I still have not purchased tires because the tread is still good and it did well in the 4 ft. snow storm.

Overall I have been pleased with this truck. The truck has a smooth ride and is a pleasure to drive on long trips. My only gripe up until recently is the poor visibility of the headlights.  Six weeks ago I had an accident with a deer which caused damage to the grill and a  condenser located behind the grill which made the vehicle inoperable. I went to my local body shop where the parts were ordered. A day later the body shop informed me that the condenser was back ordered and according to the GMC parts dealer it was on national back order. I waited a week at which time the body shop informed me that the GMC dealer could not give them any time frame on when the back ordered part would be available. I then contacted the GMC dealer where I purchased the vehicle and had it serviced regularly to inquire about the back ordered part. The parts department advised me that the condenser was on national back order and they had no idea when it might be available. I contacted GMC directly and was told they had no information. So after six weeks of frustration and no help from GMC my truck sits in the drive way as I continue to wait for some kind of response from GMC.  My family and I have been long time owners of several Chevrolet and GMC vehicles. this will be my last GM vehicle. As soon as my lease ends this October I will be looking to purchase a Ram or Ford Truck.,4

I absolutely loved the looks of the truck but I have had nothing but issues since day one.  The transmission cannot figure out what gear it needs at slow speeds and when it does it jumps and clunks underneath.  I have a problem in the rear of the truck that when I back out of my driveway or hit a bump it clunks and bangs.  The steering wheel sticks to the right when coming off the highway.  When I took it in for repair they would not fix the problem because the could not get a repeat event.  I have had several since then which is a huge safety issue.  I have problems with rough idling at lights almost like it wants to stall.  I have taken my truck in twice for humming in the rear.  The first time I was told that it was normal.  I returned it a second time and they replaced the gears in the rear end.  I am starting to have the same problems again.  My grade braking comes on periodically for about five seconds.  I cannot even keep my coffee in the cup holder because of the intense vibration on the highway.  So far I still have the same issues with 18,000 miles on the truck.  I have tried to trade it in but I cannot get anything for it.  I filed a claim with GMC and all I get is its taking some time because we don't have the VIN number.  I have given the number twice to them so far and nothing.  I will never buy another GMC.  My next step is the better business bureau.  I have been a GM fan for years but this truck is an absolute mess.",1

While cloth, the seats in the All-Terrain SLE are buckets with a great seat heater feature that allows heating the entire seat, or just the back which I love on very long drives.This truck is very comfortable, with a smooth and quiet ride and excellent (for a truck) handling.  Steering actually has pretty good feel and the truck corners quite flat.  The seats as mentioned above are heated and are very comfortable, with firm padding that holds up well on long drives.  The steering is perfectly weighted, though like in all GM full-sized pickups I've ever driven, the steering wheel is an inch or so off-center (just they're design).  I thought this would bother me, but honestly it doesn't.Fuel economy tops 20 MPG if I keep speed under 75, but at 85 it drops to about 18 MPG and in town about 15 MPG, with my average over 35,500 miles at 16.2 MPG.I have had no issues whatsoever with this truck.  Thus far I've changed oil a few times, wiper blades once and thats it.  Everything still looks and feels like new, which is more than I can say about the vast majority of vehicles I've owned over the last 30 years.  Highly recommended.",4

What gives?) and this GMC is a powerful, comfortable, and reliable steel safety cage of a truck - we have an ACTUAL horse farm, tow REAL horses and tractors, and I live in SF, so I go out to Petaluma and back, three four times a week, up the grade to the GG Bridge in traffic, driving around the streets of SF in a truck too big to live here. So. To say this is hard working truck is putting it lightly. This is the best truck I've had, mostly because all truck companies make huge advances every year.29,000 miles in, I'm having some power loss on the hills of SF, a reluctance to go from gear to gear as traffic allows. Not real problems, mind you, but a general sense that I'm headed into the realm of transmission problems (hardly ever the actually transmission but the transfer cases and whatnot). My problem is something that can generally be rectified with a tune up, but I came on here to look at other folks issues with their 2014 sierras, just in case there was an issue others knew about that I should have checked out. Turns out I'm probably better off on the web boards. The reviews here are iffy.I'm surprised at the number of reviews details folks' issues with the Nav System and the headlights. You know you can change those out, right? Doesn't really affect the truck's performance. Obnoxious, but then, I'm equally surprised by the amount of folks' thinking they have problems with the transmission or the engine being hesitant at lower speeds - it occurs to me that there are more people in big trucks who aren't really knowledgeable about how to drive them. So, I write all this to beg those of you who are looking at trucks to ignore warnings about the engine or transmission being weak or unreliable or the front end being wonky - and remind potential truck buyers that opinions are [non-permissible content removed], everybody has one.  I highly doubt anyone who was looking for a hard working truck and bought this one has anything bad to say about the 2014 GMC Sierra.

First, exterior styling is awesome, mechanical wise the transmission and engine both run strong, locking rear differential does its job. MPG not bad for power/weight ratio.  Major problem I had was driver-side (LH) rear axle seal went bad/leaked with just 9,500 miles on it.  My owning experience was further dampened by at least 10 recalls from GM-I understand about small glitches but it left a bad impression.  I don't believe that GMC is ""professional grade,"" maybe the premium the customer paid for the brand pro grade-premium.  No doubt better quality for American vehicle these days.   I do give GM credit for making the truck that holds up to ordinary/average daily use.  Daily use of hauling kids and sports gear(s) and moving mulch for d.i.y. house work.  As to Apr 2018, I've had the Sierra for 99,645 miles, transmission fluids were changed at 65,000 miles and next change will be at 110,000.  I've never had a problem with the auto transmission, it runs strong with smooth/crisp shift points, I've driven the vehicle from central U.S. to West Coast and back.  Engine is also strong on the vehicle, I change the oil on avg every 4,500 or 5,000 miles OR every 3 months.",4

The warped cylinder heads that caused the disaster were on millions of gm vehicles between 2002 and 2006.

He explained a recall would have cost millions of dollars so they decided it was pretty much just cheaper to screw the buyer. 3k in parts and labor and the car was down for a week.

I like the magnatized drain plug too.  Very easy oil change.  A great ride.  Much better than my 1993 ford F-150.  Very similar to my old 1978 Silverado but with a much better turning radius.

If you want to do towing or be quick between red lights I would get a 3.73 or 4.10 ratio to make up for the lack in low end power. The transmission performs Okay if you're looking for smooth shifts. I prefer a firm shift which you don't get, even in the towing mode. Towing mode just runs out each gear to a higher RPM. Which is good for towing. They advertise a locking differential.

I did have the intermediate shaft in the steering fixed at 25k miles.  Now that my warranty is up my check engine light is on and I guess the vaccum canister needs replaced which is $500(for plastic). Overall I love the truck and use it for everything from towing to hauling. I just wish the standard warranty was 100k.  ",4.375

I would highly recommend average forward looking maintenance on the vehicle, though, (like making repairs when an item is showing end of life wear) as that makes a big difference.  I have almost 190,000 miles on this truck over all terrains, including farm roads, rock bluffs and trails, and it hasn't fallen apart at all, not even a loose bolt or rattle.  Criticisms:  The alloy rims tend to degrade over time and, thus, lose air.  You'll be airing your tires up if you don't repair or replace rims when they show signs of corrosion, at about 7 years for me.  Gas mileage plummets at high mileage, but not remarkably for a truck.  I have gone from an average of 16 m.p.h. to 12-14.  The engine has needed gasket and seal repairs for oil leaks, particularly around the pan and main bearing.  I consider it routine as I did it at 100,000 miles and will again soon.  Wheel wells on the rear started to rust out after about 6 years, so I've replaced them.  The only other repair beyond replacing head lamps, which you can do yourself, is the cruise control went out.  That's it.  Pretty darn good for hard driving if you ask me.  It still looks like new inside and out.  Luck?  Don't know, but it does, and it isn't just the repairs I did.  It has held its own, particularly inside.  Great truck.  I'll drive it at least another 20X and then see where we're at.",5

This 2008 Sierra Crew Cab SLT 4x4 started consuming 1 quart of oil every 2K miles without any leaks, and then the traction control light, service engine light and many others came on at 84K miles (no warranty).  Took it to the dealer where I bought it, and the dealer said it is cylinder 5, camshaft and lifters need to be replaced, and it would be better for me to spend $7500 on a new engine.  I skipped the dealer and called GM who agreed to cover everything above $3500.  I asked the dealer if the problem with the AFM has been fixed and the dealer said they are not aware of a problem.   Ridiculous.  So I have a brand new engine but have no confidence in how long it will last.  I'm hoping to get rid of this and buy anything other than a GM product.",1

At 104,000 miles (notice it's just outside the warranty) engine heads both cracked - with the mileage and the reported issues about oil usage and AFM related issue, it makes more sense to replace with a GM crate engine than to solve part of the problem.

GMC's shift at any speed automatic 4x4 is far better than Tundra's crude hi/lo 4x4. GMC has better crash test scores than the Tundra. This is the 1st full-size truck I've ever owned but driving it is actually a joy. Parking is a learning experience but the parking assist makes it doable even for a newbie like myself.",5

The interior is outstanding with great back support in the bucket seats; easy accesss to everything on the dash; to great controls on the steering whell. This is the first time for GMC to have cruise control on the steering wheel and it is much easier to operate.  Performance is outstanding with the 5.3 engine and my gas mileage is good as well. With the 4-6-8 engine I get 24 to 25 mile to the gallon at 55 mph. Amazing!  My friends drive Fords and Dodges and their milage is so bad 10-12 mile per gallon. Too bad they didn't buy a GMC. My company truck is a Ford 4x4 and on a good day it gets 12-13. Really sad. ,5

I was worried about such a big engine and fuel economy (6.0 liter) but when under moderate excelleration or on the highway it only uses 4 cylinders giving it better mileage than my mini-van that I traded in on it. It is very comfortable and the fit and finish of the leather and brushed aluminum trim competes with a Mercedes or BMW. The new design is way ahead of anything else I have seen on the road, when people see it they can't help but notice it's size and intmidating looks.

GMC really thought through the location and function in the interior. The fit and finish is much improved over previous versions and the quality of the plastic is much better.  The truck rides very smooth and feels much smaller than it is (which is a good thing when driving in traffic and parking). The engine is smooth and delivers quite nicely.

I have never seen a truck with auto-4WD, it engages seamlessly, you dont even realize it has. Between that and the stabilitrac, this truck handles under snowy and icey conditions like no other truck I have driven. GMC took advantage of every inch of the interior to make a wonderfully roomy feel. The handling is tight and the manuverability is outstanding. Another great thing is you can turn off the stabilitrac and/or the auto 4WD and do some brodies! Also, going from 8 cylinders to 4 and vice versa, you dont even notice.

And true, it may be a little soon to offer a really unbiased review, but so far, this truck has impressed me beyond words. The truck is extremely well constructed from the inside out, and at the SLT trim level, offers a lot of things found in most luxery cars. With lots of electronics, that could potentially be a problem fixing on your own if needed. The active fuel management convinced me the most to purchase this full-size truck. Among all the other V-8's out there I researched, the 5.8 had the best fuel economy. And with GM's 5yr/100,000 standard powertrain warranty, that measure of commitment was certainly more piece of mind for ownership. ",5

GM was certainly doing some deep discounts for leasing. Sticker price from 45, down to 37. Combined with tier 1 credit, good resale value make this an excellent lease vehicle if you're not too hard on them. Initial quality seems very nice. Some soft touch materials and even some of the hard plastic doesn't look or feel cheap, feels solid. Some leather trim with cloth seats, pretty comfortable. Back seats are a little tight to get into but ok otherwise. Interior layout is adequate and the big color touch screen is nice. Plenty of storage bins, USB ports, and a 110 plug. Outside the truck looks nice, no flaws in the factory paint that I could find (onyx black) and all the plastic trim looks ok and fits well. V8 performance with the 6speed is good but I have yet to really stress it. Gas pedal is a little mushy but it's not broke in yet so we'll see. Column gear shift, trailer mode button, 4x4 knob all work as expected. Steering is a little heavy as to be expected and turn radius compared to a car is poor. Ride is truck-like, a little bouncy/firm as expected but controlled and not jarring.  The big touch screen is nice with controls smartly divided between real knobs and icons on screen. Example; I have a Lincoln product and when adjusting radio, climate, it's a nightmare of push buttons and unresponsive touch screen. B/U camera is basic, no sensors, basic stereo is good. Voice control does a great job with phone and can select songs/artists. The problem with this tech is you have to know what's in your system for it to work. Surprise to me,  you only have nav if your subscribe to Onstar. Truck has a wifi hotspot best suited for a minivan but connection was easy and seems to work well. Nice surprises: remote start can also turn on heated seats, you can open all the windows with the key fob (summer), favorites on entertainment use all media inputs, not just the radio. Duel climate works good. Very satisfied for now!",4

SB (5.3L 8cyl 8A),Everything you need to know about the 2016+ SIERRA," This is probably the only review you will need to read as I will cover almost everything. I have an extensive knowledge of vehicles and have owned 96 vehicles in my lifetime (yes, keep record of every single one) for either work, pleasure, or daily driver. Start of by saying I have owned the vehicle since September 2016 and I have almost 30k miles, so I know it pretty well. I was looking for a stylish, but yet functional truck as I do drive clients, but also go to home improvement stores quite often (both for work). This vehicle has served as a work and personal vehicle. Prior to purchasing I looked at the Ford F-150, Ram 1500, Chevy Silverado, Nissan Titan, and Toyota Tundra. I chose the 2016 Sierra Denali because I have favored GM vehicles in the past (owned several Corvettes and Impalas) and more so because I believe it is the best looking truck in its class (towing, payload, etc didn't play that big of a role in my purchasing decision). There are MANY complaints I have about the truck after owning it and I have found out that most of the complaints I have are common ones. I am starting off with the complaints as that is what I look for first when reading reviews. Also this is the only vehicle I have ever reviewed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          *Power train Concerns*: Engine - I went with the 5.3l V8 as I wasn't able to locate a 6.2l, I would strongly suggest anyone doing even any light pulling to avoid the 5.3l, calling the engine weak and under-powered is an understatement. Transmission - I was after the 8 speed transmission due to thinking it would provide better fuel economy over the 6 speed, although I am not certain, I can honestly say that the 8 speed transmission is one of the worst transmissions I have ever witnessed. The transmission is simply HORRIBLE. I took it to the dealership 3 times as I started experiencing problems around 7,500 miles, the transmission would downshift and you would hear and feel a loud thud, as if someone took a sledge hammer to the bottom of the vehicle (no exaggeration). That would happen between 1-2-3 gears and never past the 3rd. Along with the jerking of the transmission, if the vehicle sits over night and there is a variance in temperature when starting the truck and putting it in gear the transmission would slip, then quickly hold, and jerk the car - I almost took out my garage door! This is a major safety concern as someone could EASILY get injured this way. The dealership reprogrammed the transmission the 3 times I took it in, the problem still happens, not as often, but definitely still not OKAY. *Quality/Concerns*: The GM crew cab trucks have a severe problem with rail dust/rust (basically flakes of iron from when they are shipped get embedded into the paint and over time with oxygen and water it rusts and shows as little pin dot rust spots). I noticed this at 500 miles after owning the vehicle, GM offers 1 (one!) detail to remove the rust, basically what removes it is a clay bar... but the amount is so much that I still have spots all over mine after 3 professional details (even one back to the selling dealership in a neighboring state (Kirksville, MO). The shark fin antenna leaked water (driver side headliner), local dealership replaced - all is well. The passenger side taillight leaked water, local dealership replaced - all is well. At 29,450 miles and a trip I just got back from (reason for writing this review) - the truck shakes HORRIBLY going over 70 MPH! I have yet to take it to a dealership, but this is a common problem from GM, friend traded in his Silverado because it was doing it at 12,000 miles and the dealership couldn't fix the issue! We will see what my experience is and I will update accordingly. *Feature Complaints*: It does NOT have push button start, boo! This is just my opinion, but if this is your ""top-of-the-line"" truck, you should have this fairly cheap feature! The auto-folding mirrors, yeah they don't exist, you have to go through the settings to 'enable' them, but all that does is give you the ability to push the mirror button so they fold in, they will not fold in on their own once parking (not a big deal, but wth?). Automatic windows, the driver side goes up and down with one push... the passenger you have to hold to get it up - wow, how did GM overlook this in 2016 as my 2003 Escalade EXT had it. *The Good!* - Looks/Style, the exterior and interior are very well designed and aesthetically far more pleasing than the competition. The back bumper step, once you have it you can't go back! The soft close tail gate! In conclusion, I would rate the truck overall as a 6.5/10. I will be looking to trade it in and most likely will NOT be for another GM.",3

Classy interior, quiet and comfortable ride, strong acceleration and great mpg's (for a truck). One complaint that I do have is with the transmission. From time to time, the tranny will seemingly slip. Other times, shifting is very rough. These issues aren't consistent, but when they do occur, they seem to occur when shifting from 1st to 2nd gear. These issues seem to be common and I've read that they are less about the transmission itself and more about the programming that determines shift points and other transmission related operations. Apparently these things have been programmed for max gas mileage and the result is less than desirable shifting. This is a tough pill to swallow considering I paid 50,000+ for the truck. I'd gladly give up 1mpg for a transmission that doesn't act like its about to fall out of the truck.",4

Bluetooh and entire entertainment system with car play is spectacular, better than Tundra's entertainment system, could be that Tundra was 2014 this is 2017 and technology moves rather quick.

Up in North Jersey, the terrain is all hills, almost nothing flat.  In local driving, I have been averaging about 17 mpg, not bad considering the terrain and the size of the vehicle. We took the truck to the outer banks for a week, 520 miles each way, on this trip I averaged 22 mpg, fully loaded, 2 adults, 2 kids, a dog, and truck bed full of beach gear, clothes, food, grill supplies, etc, etc.  this trip brought the lifetime fuel economy for the truck up to 20mpg.  pretty impressive.  I will admit, I monitor my driving and kept it in v4 mode as much as possible, it worked.  I am impressed.  While in the outer banks I saw one period of driving, the first 100 miles leaving for the way home where I averaged 25.7 mpg, slow steady state, traffic free flat land, 55mph cruising. Amazing. The trip was 11 hours each way, factoring in stops for bathroom and food. Not a single complaint, everyone was comfortable beyond compare. The connectivity was loved by the kids, as was the ability to have all the electronics charged.  While the dog would have preferred a yard, even he had room to move and get comfortable.  Moving up from a Subaru Legacy, this was an obvious upgrade, what is surprising is that a vehicle this size is actually more efficient than a car that weighed 2000lbs less, and had a 2.5 liter 4cyl turbo engine.  Finally, the GMC dealer experience has gone upscale and every dealing I had with them, beginning to end, has been easy. No quality based issues with the truck yet, and hopefully none on the horizon.  There is a steep learning curve with the technology of the truck and the personalization available, but a good long trip like that helps to sort it all out and learn what the options are.",5

My brother and my next door neighbor both acquired Sierra Denali's after seeing mine.

I also lose satellite radio signal much more often in the truck than I do my other cars.  Update - 13 months and 19500 miles:  still the vehicle of choice for road trips or weekends down to the beach house.  Still get comments on it being a great looking truck.  All systems working just the way they did a year ago.  Getting 20 mpg around town and 22-23 on the road.Update - 18 months 30000 miles.  Still on original tires - no problems.   Spent a good part of a month towing a U-Haul 6 X 12 cargo trailer, like it wasn't even back there, but at times wished the truck had the Ford trailer backup assist option.Update - 24 months 37,000 miles.  Original tires still holding up.  Satellite radio signal still drops more than in my Equus or SL550.  Retracting step-rail occasionally sticks in open position on drivers side but corrects when a door is opened.  Still meets my needs better than the Dodge, Ford, Nissan or Toyota trucks and would buy again.",4

Second dealer visit the truck heater does not turn off, the dealer told me this is a common characteristic of this truck, no fix but the did tell me to leave the air on at all time I will get less gas mileage but it wont be so hot in the cab, Nice? Third Dealer visit was not big deal but come to find out GMC intellilink does not support iphone6. Basically I get a phone call it will shut off nav, radio, etc. and not return. I have to manually turn power back on to device.

Hot sun, freezing winters with heavy, deep snow and ice, and torrential rain. My version is a 4DR Extended Cab SLE Z71, 5.3L with custom cap and racks. This is a fabulous truck. Handles great and delivers fantastic performance under absolutely any condition and/or load. But it had growing pains: bad ABS brakes,and some electrical issues with power windows and doors, and extended cab hinges that didn't fit properly in cold weather. All fixed over time and the brakes are now very good(watch out for the door hinges, though.)Now in 2009 I am trading it for a Suburban Z71 for a roomier cab (family has grown). I will miss this truck. ",4.25

I find it a little wierd but I have never had to change anything, or even touch the brakes, and they still look great, I was told this was b/c of the 4 Wheel ABS/Disc system. I own the 4.8L V8 model and get ""great"" gas mileage for a full size V8 truck, especially loaded with tools. 15 city, and 21 hwy.

True, it is fun to drive and has a good ride and great stereo, there have been several disappointing mechanical problems.  It seems to chew through brake pads in about 10000 miles.  This problem was worse before the recall work on the anti-lock brakes that I am surprised no one else has commented on.  Also, the rear tailgate is about to rust off and a brake line has rusted through leading to a brake fluid loss and near braking disaster.  Also, numerous squeaks and noises that are undiagnosable.

The 5.3 has lots of power, but I do notice a difference in the summer with the AC on.

I retired and bought a travel trailer that needed a truck that could pull it without grunting uphill.  The Sierra doesn't even know it is towing it, it came with the trailer package, built in brake controller, and the Z71 package. Without the trailer the best mileage I have gotten is almost 22 mpg, I never got over 18 with the Tacoma. The IntelliLink system is terrific. I have upgraded the headlight bulbs to LED, making a huge improvement over the stock bulbs. At a cost of about $400, I installed the Roadmaster Active suspension kit, (about 20 minutes per side) which makes a big difference in handling, especially with the towing. I eliminated the OnStar and changed over to a factory Navigation System. No need to pay $40 a month for directions, which I don't need everyday. I also purchased a rear under seat storage box. GMC should have it as a standard item. The 5.3L engine has a light ticking sound, but I understand that is characteristic to all of them and may have something to do with the cylinder deactivation, and it doesn't bother me. The Sierra is comfortable, quiet and so to date has been dependable.  At my age I don't see any more new vehicles in my future, I intend to keep this truck until I cant drive any longer. I may just put in another engine if it comes to that. I cant say anything bad about it. Hopefully it will continue to perform well for a long time to come. I have changed the trans fluid, antifreeze, hydraulics . . . fluid changes are crucial to the longevity of any vehicle and for what prices are these days for new trucks, my used Sierra is worth every cent to keep it road worthy.

It has more than adequate power. The payload exceeds the 2007 I previously owned. Because I have radical lug mud tires, my fuel mileage is only about 16MPG. I expect it will increase when i put street tires and quit hauling heavy loads or pulling a trailer. It has the trailer towing pkg, 4 wheel drive, and I believe it has been lifted, since I can't reach over the bed to access the bottom of my tool box. The BEST I have done is 20MPH but it is avging 16. i am running 275/75/18 tires. It also has the locking differential, a must on a 4x4. The trailer brakes are integrated into the dash, I love that. In fact the only thing it doesn't have is a telescoping steering wheel, but it does have adjustable depth pedals. It is as if I custom ordered the truck, I LOVE IT!!I STILL love it. Switching from the mud tires did increase the MPG. I average about 17 in town and 20 on the highway empty. It has a 4"" lift. I've driven it more I love it so much. About 15k instead of 10 over this last year.",5

Probably so you don't fall asleep. lol.3.) Needs more storage space like on top of the dash or center console style changed. The 3 sections behind the cup holders on the split seat styles are completely useless and waste of space. The dividers need to be either removable or gotten rid of. Would be a nice place for pens. Also the bottom center could pull out with a nice configuration there. Instead you have to lift the bench to get it opened.4.) Ride is a little stiff, but that could be because its still new.",4

I've had two F-150's and a/c would freeze you out. Here in Alabma summer's are very hot. A/C blows hard and very cold, briefly. Then the A/C cooling stops while the hard blowing continues. And since we have such hot summers it feels like hot air blowing on you. It does this back and forth continually. Of course once the truck cools off enough then it not so bad. But it's a good 10 minutes- long enough to start sweating!  It's as if the compressor switches off and on while the blowing remains the same. Dealer kept it two days and said it was working normally. I work indoors in an extremely cold business and am a slim guy so when I leave work I'm not overly hot so sweating my rear off on my drive home is unacceptable. Im wondering if the dealers hear this a lot and know it's baked into the design. Either way I will be trading it near years end when prices drop on 2015's. In the deep south with our long, hot summers and high humidity good A/C is critical. UPDATE: A/C still sucks. Truck has always had a vibration at HWY speeds which I attributed to the original tires. Finally after 2 and 1/2 years I needed new tires. Got a set rated the best for All Season/ HWY for my size and truck still vibrates at HWY speeds causing the change in the center console to clink! I will definitely be getting an F-150 when my lease is finished in July 2018. The A/C issue is a real deal breaker for me living in the Deep South.",3

SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),If you want an OKAY truck this one is for you!," I took a week and test drove all the major brand trucks (minus Ford, just not a Ford guy and I regret not test driving one) at the end I ended up purchasing a 2016 GMC Sierra 1500 Denali (5.3l V8 / 8 Speed Transmission). I have personally owned 94 vehicles, sold vehicles at a dealership, was part of a dealership, so I am very familiar with anything automotive. I bought the vehicle in September of 2016, brand new from a dealership in Missouri (I live in Iowa) and I have put 4250 miles on it in the past 3 months that I have owned it. The first 5 days of owning it I realized I have regretted buying it. The first issue was the RUST! well as they call it rail rust/dust, it was on the inside of all the doors where the door meets the body of the vehicle, then I noticed spots everywhere else - I was told all vehicles have this, it's just that mine was the pearl white so it showed more - my thought was if I was paying $50k for a vehicle it should be perfect! (apparently not). Either way I had to have the dealership take it to a local detail shop and they took a clay bar to it (twice since they didn't do a good job the first time the rep says) but it still didn't get all of the rail rust off, decided to live with it - will be trading the truck in 2-3 years even though I bought it to keep ""forever"". Out of the trucks I drove and compared it to this was the best overall buy for what I was looking for - if I had to do it all over again I would buy a RAM 1500 EcoDiesel Limited (friend week after me bought one for $5k less than what I paid for the Denali). I test drove the Ram 1500, Toyota Tundra, Nissan Titan, and Chevy Silverado. The Sierra in my opinion is FAR better than the Silverado - just go drive both and you will see the difference in ride and overall feel - I figured it would be the same truck, but I was wrong. The Ram 1500 and Nissan Titan had the best features that the others lacked, keyless entry/start being the main thing for me - only the RAM and Titan had keyless entry - Huge Fail on GM and Toyota. The main reason I would purchase a Ram 1500 instead of a Sierra 1500 is the fuel economy - I do about 75% interstate driving and rest city and I am averaging 16.1MPG (that 16.1MPG is based on the last 4250 miles I have on the truck, I am currently with it being cold/snow getting 13.4MPG). Also not to mention when I completely babied it and drove extra economically it showed 18MPG - when I actually calculated (dividing miles by gallons filled up) I got a grand total of 15.9MPG. My friend has the same driving habits and in his Ram 1500 EcoDiesel (6 cylinder diesel) he is averaging 24MPG. I was ideally looking for the 6.2L and not the 5.3L engine, I have driven both - there's a huge power difference, the 5.3L is not powerful enough, not even for daily driving - it constantly feels like it's lacking power. The 8 speed transmission is what I was looking for - but isn't what I expected it to be, 95% of the time the transmission shifts GREAT, but that other 5% of the time when you are going slow and it's shifting between the lower gears it JERKS and shifts WAAAY more than you would expect a brand new top of the line truck to do. Either way, ideally I would love GM to contact me and give me some money back ($10k would be ideal) - this is a $35k-$40k truck in my opinion and not a truck with an MSRP of $60.5k OR JUST BUY IT BACK OFF OF ME (last 6 of VIN - 344961, contact me). Either way here are some pro's and con's:                                                                                                                                                                                                             ---Pros: Looks/Styling, OnStar App (start/unlock/lock your vehicle from anywhere, first 5 years free), tailgate design/hydraulics, interior design, Car Play, Towing Mode (very smooth when towing / gauges)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ---Cons: Gas mileage is a considerable amount lower than advertised, no keyless entry/start, paint is very poor quality (I even have the $1000 upgraded White Tricoat), the heated seats/heated steering wheel with remote start don't really work, the auto folding mirrors are a joke (all there is is a setting inside the menu screen to enable you to use the button on the door to fold them, what a joke), the truck is under-powered (5.3L - this does not apply to the 6.2L), lack of innovation/features (like the RamBox)",3

From day 1 I have told the dealer that something was wrong with the transmission.  It does not shift smooth at speed 36/37 and 46/47 mph.  It was taken in 3 times and was only programmed once and the problem kept getting worse.  Dealer tells me that I should not be pulling trailers with this truck but they talked me into the 6.2L engine because they knew what I had (boat, dump trailer and small tractor which is not pulled regularly).  I put in reverse one day and the rear end sounded like it was about to fall out.  Driving in first and second gear sounded like metal scrubing. Took to dealer and told them I did not want it back until it was fixed.  They finally said I needed a transmission. Duh I told you that a month after it was purchased.  After the transmission was installed, it still does not shift smooth;  I still hear a whining sound like something is not grounded.If finally took it to another dealer to trade in for a GMC 2500 HD and they said trade in is only $41K.

Dealer says it is normal ( really?)- I traded in a 2007 SLE i used to leave running all the time because it was so quiet. Explanation is new technology with fuel injection system - Hate te noise from outside the truck - never hear it from inside.  Everything is super, and I am still getting used to it but Navigation is a bear to use - does not understand my voice  - easier to use Waiz on my phone. Stereo sounds nice but again a bear to understand.I will review again in six months - only have had 5 weeks.Dealer ok - not great -- got the feeling they wanted to dump this truck ( after I bought it of course).",4

SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),The quietest truck out there!," The Ram and the F150 trucks are both excellent and worthy choices, but there were three things that clinched the deal in favor of GM's offerings.  One is the quiet cabin.  In driving all of them, GM has the secrets to making a quiet vehicle.  Secondly is OnStar.  No one else even comes close to offering you a system that can contact help in case of an accident, directions and as well as keeping watch on the condition and operation of the vehicle.  OnStar is a big plus.  And the third benefit was being able to have Wifi in the vehicle as you travel.  No one else even talks about it except to link it through your cell phone, which is perfectly fine if you are always in urban and perfect cell phone areas.  Otherwise you are just out of luck.  We use our laptop a great deal as we travel so the Wifi is a huge benefit to us.  I have no complains whatsoever except that the headlights are terrible.  The dealer has changed the bulbs and that has helped some, but it is surprising, that in a modern truck so well thought out and built, that they could install such poor headlights.  Hopefully they will upgrade those soon.  Otherwise, I love this truck.",5

Took my Sierra double can in for an oil change on Thursday and bought this one on Friday. I have the fanciest slt z71 2x4 you can get without paying for the Denali name. All the trucks needs is a grill and automatic running boards. First off I never thought I'd see trucks this fancy in my lifetime. The other reason I bought it. It was a left over 15 13k off lower interest rate and lower payment. First looks gmcs are the best looking trucks on the road. I like all the bells and whistles on it except for the 8 way seat I can't seem to get comfortable in it. I know it's crazy but it's almost to much adjustment. I don't care for the ride now that I have driven it for 1500 miles but I'm stuck with it. My wife loves it. And yes the transmission shifts at very weird speeds. And I don't care for it but my last one did the same thing. I haven't hauled anything yet I will update when I put it under a load. Also found a bad spot on the paint job we will see how my dealer handles that. But I can say they have been exemplary so far for 2 years. Sunrise gmc on the pike Memphis Tennessee. They deserve to be mentioned they are the reason I bought a second truck. I have noticed the rattles we will deal with that later my 14 did it also. Now on to the positives. 5.3 plenty of power. Looks well I can't say enough about the looks. Dual climate control love it. Heated seats love it a/c seats love it. Flow through console love it. It has a handy pouch in the center console that holds my full size 1911 pistol very nicely. The leather is very nice. The carpet leaves a little to be desired. And the factory floor mats suck 45k for a truck I expect something better. Now on the feature I can't say enough about. The driving safety system. It's awesome it will make drive the way your supposed to. The collision alarm saved me the other day. The park assit is very nice its my daily driver so I park in a tight lot at work. The back up camera in the 15 blows away the 14 model. The lane departure is nice. Heck it even warns you when take your eyes off the road to long. And it has the Anit tailgater feature very nice. If you rear end someone driving this truck with the system on your an idiot and don't deserve to drive a truck that nice. I bought the iridium metallic and with all the chrome it's a nice looking ride. Everywhere I go I get compliments on how nice it is. If you got the money go for it. My purchase date is incorrect the system wouldn't accept that I bought it in 2016 I bought it on 3-4-16,5
3377, on 02/29/16 19:06 PM (PST),Andrew ,2015 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew Cab SLT 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 5.8 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),SLE/SLT REVIEW w/ V6-V8 compare," What you need to know from someone who know cars and trucks.I've driven both the SLE & SLT models in the crew cab both in the V6 and the V8. The issues right off the bat for myself (someone who probably won't tow more than 5,000 lbs) is that the V8 (5.3L) can tow more, has more HP, and torque and WILL have better resale. Really quick on the V6, the power, responsiveness, torque and capacity was more than capable of satisfying most buyers. Onto the truck I purchased, the 2015 GMC Sierra V8 SLT short bed. I absolutely love this truck. From the power, torque, comfort, to how absolutely quiet the ride is... I'm absolutely impressed. I'm 28, a homeowner and a homeowner. In my few years on this planet I've owned 9 cars; SUV's, sports cars, trucks, and finally the GMC. My dad is a huge proponent of Toyota and so am I but this truck is a cut above the rest. INTERIORThe interior is absolutely amazing. In both SLE and SLT models you get the stitches dash and steering wheel which is both stylish, and sleek. I could do without the ugly silver accents surrounding the 8"" touch screen but I can survive. Both the bench and bucket seats have their benefits. I love the bench but the middle seat is hard (due to the compartment underneath) but oh can still seat 6 people... but when will that really happen? and it's not comfortable. The bucket seats are amazing, in my SLT model I have power seats and leather and so far after 4,000 miles they have held up well. The electronics and capability of the truck are outstanding and expensive but amazing. The lighting in the vehicle is almost spot lighting and recessed so the light will not bother the driver when turned on... and it looks amazing when it's dark. EXTERIORThe truck looks better than most any other truck on the road. This truck has a smooth suspension and on mine and I have a Z71 and the ride is amazing, smooth, classy and responsive. The tailgate lowers slowly and has bumper steps which are nice. I love the four door look, the bed, and it's just all around sexy. Overall - the truck is great... MPG is industry leading for a Crew Cab V8. I average 20ish on the freeway at 80 and 17 in the city with my moderately heavy foot. I want this truck to start coming pre leveled instead of having to buy a 1.5"" leveling kit. The truck also deserves better reliability ratings similar to Toyota... I'm hoping they figured it out and in 7 years I can still say my truck is perfect!",4
3378, on 02/10/16 08:47 AM (PST),Randy ,2015 GMC Sierra 1500 Crew Cab SLT 4dr Crew Cab 4WD 5.8 ft. SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),"10,000 Miles and In Love"," Reading all of the reviews made me want to post one. Specifically in response to someone who obviously had a really negative experience with this truck and wanted the warn the consumer. Well I want to do the opposite. I drive a crew cab SLT with the 5.8L V8 4WD as a daily commuter in VT. We get the hot weather and the coldest of the cold. I log a min of 50 miles a day. I'm incredibly pragmatic and evaluated every truck, cost/quality/ride etc... I ended slightly blowing my budget for this selection. It's not a Denali but essentially in name only (and maybe magnetic suspension). Otherwise I have every bell and whistle, 20 Inch luxury rims, folding mirrors, hot/cold seats, premium leather, wide running boards and more. To put it simply this is the best vehicle I've ever owned and don't know that I could ask for more. Now I will admit I'm relatively young, 32, so perhaps the advanced controls come really easy to me, but I find everything to be intuitive. My favorite feature is the ability to call up Siri in 2 seconds and direct her to do my bidding. I've asked for songs to be played that I don't own but it's found on apple radio in 3 seconds. The feature I did shut off almost immediately was the lane departure assist. Either I cross the lines all of the time or the roads here are narrow but my rear end was vibrating worse than a stripper riding the sibian on the Howard Stern channel. Aside from absurd comfort, phenomenal amenities and an awesome look the gas mileage for an engine of this size is nuts. I'm getting an avg. of 20 MPG, my old V6 BMW barely got that but now I can tow a boat if I feel the need.Addressing some common issues I will say that I've noticed the weird shifting at certain speeds. It is disconcerting but it happens very rarely to me. The other concern is the headlights, with everything on I don't have an issue but I can see how it's a bit dim. To be honest slightly shocked it's not a higher quality bulb considering the money put into the headlights on these new rigs.I'll post again if issues arise but I can say that if you can afford it and want a truck, you won't find a more luxurious option.**The folding back seat in the crew cab is game changing. Full size dog bed, tires, golf and even seat down packed with people it works great!",4

SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),I was going to buy a Suburban...," Went to the dealer thinking new Suburban I ended up with a Sierra Denali!  Briefly stated, I have had Suburbans for 20+ years to haul materials for my business and personal use i.e. hauling black labs, gear for various outdoor adventures, etc. I actually have actually used a Suburban for what the vehicle was initially intended! Unfortunately, the new recently redesigned Suburban is an engineering disaster for folks like me. The rear storage area is much smaller and chopped up. Also, if you have to crawl in the back you darn near need a ladder to get in. It's clear that GM has targeting soccer moms for the new Suburban. It's strictly a people hauler...period. So, I just happened to look at a Sierra Denali crew cab pickup. After a test drive, I was ready to buy. The back seat area is roomier than a Suburban and will seat 5 comfortably. I could go on and on, but the bottom line is I love this vehicle. Best of all, it cost far less than a comparably equipped Suburban!",5

SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),Comfortable Truck," UPDATED from 10/2015 I have owned this truck for 24 months- mileage now at 34,452.GPS roof antenna unit shorted out within a week after purchase or was likely not working when I purchased the truck. I believe it had a defective seal on the roof. Replaced by dealer. Nice looking truck. Decent fuel mileage. The truck says I am averaging over lifetime18.6mpg, it has about 23,452k miles so far. My truck has the 5.3L w/6 speed transmission/ 3.42 rear axle ratio. I opted for this engine configuration thinking it may get better mileage than the 6.2L/8 speed trans. The truck handles much like a Corvette on sharp turns at higher speeds. Not crazy about the ride; however its ride is MUCH better when carrying a heavy object  in the bed or towing my utility trailer with a heavy zero turn mower loaded.  I have the 4x4 Denali model which has the magnetic shocks. I drove another new GMC truck with the V-6 engine while my Denali truck was getting the GPS antenna roof unit replaced which took over a week to obtain the parts needed. I really liked the lower priced V-6 truck, although the interior creature comforts was NO comparison to my completely creature comfort-loaded Denali model, which was the reason I bought it (and the front grill). Both trucks are quiet riding. Horrible price tag. No complaints so far after 15 months (2 recalls and the info center needed updating).",4

The touch screen info system takes a little getting use to but is not too complicated. The voice activation software need to be improved, takes several tries before system understands what you want. The setup in the G8 works very well, so GM should have it perfected by now. The WIFI hot spot was ok but not something I would use regular enough to keep. The resolution of the backup camera is good and I like the  scaling on the display, keeps things in perspective. The ride is a little on the bouncy side and road noise is minimal. I have the 5.3L engine with trailering package. Power is good but transmission seems slow to shift when in town driving around 30mph. Have not had any service or equipment issues, only 4XXX miles mostly highway miles. My only true peeve is getting in.

SB (5.3L 8cyl 6A),Looks so good but just so awful," This is my third 14/15 with the first two being lemons.  Well it looks like ill be able to make lemonade pretty soon.  The quality of these trucks as awful.  My truck has 7000 miles now and is on its second transmission and second rear end.  The transmission blew at 6500 miles.  The rear end went at 7000 miles.  The vibrations from the truck are horrid for a truck that stickers at $62,000.  Aside from all the driving issues with the truck, unfortunately the list goes on.  The GMC IntellaLink is a joke. It doesn't understand basic Bluetooth commands such as a persons name.  It will not understand street names for the nav.  Its basically useless. The collision warning is downright dangerous, if you are driving on a slight incline, and it picks up a shadow (like from going under a bridge or something) it activates and tells you are going to crash.  Now imagine it that activated the brakes??!!! You would crash or at least be rear ended.  On the exterior lets start with the lights, you literally can not see at night and if its raining, forget it you have a better shot of hitting the lottery than seeing what's in front of you. Poor panel fit on the front bumpers expose the locking tabs.  The plastic skid plate vibrates when you shut the doors making the truck feel cheap. This review is not to blast GM and is not a rant, its for you the consumer.  These trucks are awful to drive.  I don't ever look forward to driving this truck having the fear that its going to break down in the back of my mind.  This truck has the 8 speed transmission and the 6.2L and its quick but the downside of the transmission and general driveline whiplash and vibrations take away from the fun of having 420HP pretty quick.   They make trucks for a nickel now (in Mexico) and have the walnuts to ask you for upwards of $60,000 for the ""high end"" truck... get out of town GM with this garbage.  You should be embarrassed with this product you put out knowing of all the problems.  The general public should not be your beta testing group.  Last thing I will say to you the consumer, go onto any forum GMC/Chevy and type in ""problems""  and you will get a 50+ page list of issues.  Good LuckAfter now 27000 miles the truck is undrivable. Gm won't fix the truck. The transmission slips in all gears and the rear end bangs so hard when it shifts it actually activates the traction control. This is by far the worst truck I have ever owned. Gm does nothing to make it right and blames the consumer for being ""uneducated"" on newer vehicles. I can't tow my snowmobiles with any confidence with this truck. If you use this truck for ""truck"" things, or any performance at all, this is not the truck for you.",1

The infotainment center went out in December 2014 and it took the dealership over a month to get the parts to fix system.  Dealership indicated it was a common problem.

I still can not get the heated and cooled seats to activate even after making sure the settings are correct.  At around 11,500 miles, I noticed that the bed of the truck is slightly misaligned with the cab.  Grapevine GMC in Grapevine TX refused to honor as a warranty issue.  A call to General Motors customer service and the representative indicates the misalignment of the bed of the truck is an alignment issue and the truck is outside of adjustment period.

I usually keep a vehicle for 10 years or more however, the only reason I traded was because of the very good incentive on the 2015 and the excellent deal I had gotten on the 2014 and the reasonable trade in price on the 2014. I now have 13,000 miles on the 2015 and feel that it is also an excellent truck with many more amenities. The safety features to include  back-up camera, parking warning, lane changing, navigation and hands free make for a very safe truck. I have not been able to attain quite the mileage I got on my 2014 even though I have a tonneau cover and drive the truck in a similar manner. The best I have been able to attain is 21.6 on a long trip. The advantage of a large vehicle with plenty of interior comfort, good mileage numbers, tons of room for luggage and smooth ride made this vehicle my vehicle of choice over a sedan or suv.I will add on to the information above which has not changed. I took a long trip to Michigan and pretty much backed up what I ha determined in the first review that I sent to you. I did attain 22mpg on one leg of the trip and 21.5 on the second leg of the trip. Truck still very comfortable, spacious and has given me absolutely no problems. I have had the oil, filter and tires rotated on schedule and had one recall corrected on the airbag system.I have owned the truck now for 25 months and still feel that it is a nice looking well made vehicle. I took a recent trip and was able to get 23.0 mpg which is slightly higher than advertised. The sweet spot is right about 70mph when the 5.3L engine is in 4v and on flat terrain. In that configuration it gets excellent mileage. The other sweet spot is driving a steady 55mph when the truck is in 4v. Presently I have 22,500 miles on the odometer and I am very satisfied with the vehicle.This is my third review after owning the truck for two and a half years. I have over 27,000 miles on the truck so far with no problems. I did notice that my transmission temp was running much hotter than the allison transmission that I have in my diesel but in looking into it further I found that 190 degrees is not an unusual temperature for this engine and transmission combination.",5

The truck is pretty fast and keeps plenty of power on tap and will pull a tandem trailer loaded 70+MPH with relative ease.

This could be from a number of things and I don't think this is necessarily true across the board with these trucks.  I have the Z71 version and currently use all- terrain type tires and must say it certainly outperforms my expectations off- road.  The 4x4 auto is a nice feature as well.  This half ton gets outstanding gas mileage comparative to my older 1500HD and certainly pulls its weight for a 1/2 ton.,5

Upon retirement, decided to go back to a full size pickup.  Found this two yr. old 2012 ext. cab.  5.3l, 6-speed, 20"" wheels, chromed out, tonneau, dual exhaust, bed liner, led lights, 16k miles for only $22.9k.  Bought it from a 70 yr. old retiree.  True, we would all love better gas mileage, but now that I'm retired and driving less miles per year, I love driving this truck.  Has been trouble free and very dependable.  My young kids love it, too.  I'm hoping to drive this thing off into the sunset, or until my wife/kids tell me that I'm just too old to drive.To update:  Truck has another 17k miles and is still immaculate and runs great.  Absolutely no problems.  I needed to drive a sedan the other day and don't think I could ever get used to driving while sitting in a seat that is so close to the ground. My truck feels so much safer and ""grand."" Price of gas dropped but is now slowly rising.  But I'm only driving about 7-8k miles a year now.  Time for new tires and am shocked to learn that Sam's sells these stock 20"" for only $138/ea.  True, I only got about 35k out of them, but can't see paying twice that for Michelins.  Still thinking I'll be driving this thing for many years to come.  Every family needs at least one truck.Well, to update.  I just got tired of parking at far corner of parking lots, getting about 16mpg, and having to deal with the suicide doors.  I sold it.  Was going to trade it in, but couldn't get over 19k, sold on craigslist for $22k, nearly what I paid for it 2 1/2 yrs ago.  It is a nice truck, dual exhaust added a lot, plenty of power, comfortable, looks real nice.  I miss it but don't regret selling it.

The trucks I test drove (in this order) were the Ford F-150, Nissan Titan, Dodge Ram, Chevy Silverado, Toyota Tundra, and GMC Sierra.  I returned to test drive the the Ford and the Dodge.  When it was all said and done; the GMC is the truck that stood out above all others.  A combination of its appearance, comfort, features, and just the way the truck felt and drove simply overshadowed the other trucks.  This truck has plenty of power, great ergonomics, and I like the features.  The 6sp Auto and 5.3L are a pleasure to drive and run as smooth and quiet as I expect a truck to be.  Solid Truck!",4.875

Just traded a 2008 GMC 5.3 w/4A.  3 reasons why I traded/upgraded so quick: 1) Cloth seats collected lint, 2) Slow (20"" wls) 3)Fantastic trade-in value on the 08. I have no trouble getting 20mpg highway at 75mph.  If you drive it like you stole it, you can't get much worse than 15! Easily 10% better than my 08. The leather seats are great for long trips.

I went on some WV mountains on Route 50 and it pulled up just fine.  It wanted to go a little too fast down the mountain so I downshifted instead of overusing my breaks which worked fine.

The leather seats are super comfortable, and it has a good ride.  So far, most things have worked.  The defects I've experienced are the battery and the turn signal switch.  The factory battery was defective, and to make a long story short, I'm on my third battery!! Acid leaked out of the other two.  I can't really blame Jimmy for that...

SUV was the biggest money pit I have ever owned.  Performance through first three years was good, but as soon as the warranty expired, bang, the problems occured.  GMC had to know this car was substandard by only offering the 3/36 warranty.  Wheel bearings/ball joints went at 60k-dealer told me I was lucky, as he had seen them ""as early as 14k."" That was $1300. Other problems: driver's door joint fell apart/replaced; rear window hatch rusted/replaced; alt. replaced, etc. I maintained this car meticulously with no off-road.

If you are looking to buy this car find out if the radiator has been replaced. These vehicles used Dexcool 3 when they first came out, it was issues so it will have or will rust out your radiator. I did a few different flushes on mine. I did have to replace the water pump, alternator, starter, and fuel pump. The fuel pump came at about 150,000 mile for me though. Keep and mind the drivers side door has issues, if you find a good body shop they will fix it for about $100. The Engine is awesome has always run like a champ for me considering i used this vehicle to deliver pizza. Overall it is a good buy and a safe SUV. I sold mine for $800 to a friend and it is still running with over 176,000 miles on it.

I had to replace the head gasket, fuel pump, rear differential swap-out, brakes (twice), oil cooler lines, power steering hoses, ABS module, the door handle broke off, mufflers, exhaust system and cat converter, front sway bar and links, EGR valve, and the windshield leaked so I bought a new one--that was a minor expense.

Gas mileage is actually slightly better with the V8 than the 6 cylinder because of the Displacement On Demand (rated at 16 city  22 hwy). I dont understand why people complain about gas mileage. They should buy a small compact SUV. With the air compressor you can put air in your own tires. It's smooth riding with the Luxury Ride Bilstein Shocks and quieter with added sound proofing.

Boy, that was a mistake. We owned the car for about a year and a half and in that time I had to replace both front tie rods, the steering rack, the power steering pump, the control for the blower fan, the front upper and lower ball joints, and the water pump. When I took the Envoy into the dealership for an oil change I mentioned that the brakes were pulsating, which was interesting since the dealership told me that they had replaced all four discs, all the brake pads, and the front calipers, doing over $2,000 worth of work just before I bought it. The dealership inspected the brakes and told me that all four discs needed replaced as well as the brake pads at the cost of almost $800. On less than 10,000 miles of driving. We're not the slam on the brakes type of people. So that was the last straw. We traded the Envoy in at a loss for a used Hyundai which has only needed a new battery in the six months that we've had it due to a VERY cold winter. In that year and a half that we owned it we spent over $1,800 in repairs to the Envoy. In the ten years and 180,000 miles that we owned our Toyota minivan we didn't spend half that. Do yourself a favor. Don't buy a GMC. Don't fall for the ""American Made!"" patriotic bologna. If GMC made reliable vehicles they wouldn't have to wave the Red, White, and Blue to sell their cars.

I traded in my Envoy and purchased a Honda Pilot 2012 EX-L It was a pre owned certified vehicle.

My vehicle looks new, and runs like a well tuned watch even with 157,000 miles.  I have my own maintenance schedule that has kept every car I have owned in great shape for many years with hardly a breakdown (which I blame on ethanol).  Change hoses every three years with a coolant flush, change the battery every three years with the best you can buy, replace any potential defective wiring as noticed, and change oil every 5-7000 miles running only synthetic regardless of climate.  Replace all brakes before damaging rotors, and ensure the rotors are the best duty you can keep on the car, rotate tires with every oil change, and put the best tires on the vehicle possible.  A few extra bucks here can save thousands.  Update mechanicals as noted by a GOOD mechanic.  I use a high quality dealership, and the repair prices are not really any higher, and the mechanics are well trained and supervised.

My brother in law is a master mechanic and shop owner and rather than purchase a new vehicle (which he could easily afford)  he chose a well cared for Trail Blazer.  He is highly impressed with the bullet proof power train rugged body on frame design.  I can attest it feels like you are driving a SUBSTANTIAL vehicle.  The mass of power available at the slightest touch of the gas verifies what I read.  The truck engine in these SUVs were over built by GM.  The solid axil always stays put and signals when you are adrift in the lane resulting in a reassuring ride and stable tracking regardless of the highway condition.  Newer vehicle designs may give you more storage pockets and cup holders but I value solid construction and indestructible power train as more important for getting you from A to B.  Comfort is exceptionable and everything is quiet and solid inside the car.  Repairs have been limited to a cracked exhaust manifold and wires chewed up by a demented squirrel.  I would strongly lean toward buying a well cared for Envoy over a new vehicle just because they simply don't build them like this any more.  UPDATE AS OF 1-13-17----  Our Envoy has now 185000 miles on it.  Everything still works.  Have not had to fix or replace anything, (no lie).  Still has the original brakes, muffler, shocks, A/C freon.  I change the oil and have had all other fluids changed as advised by GM.  A great great car.",5

They are grate for long trips and ok for city driving. Guys I make my living  repairing automobiles and my Envoy gets the best of the best for its maintenance but GM didn't put it right together. By the way if you go for the Explorer get the V8 (bullet proof engine) instead of the senseless V6 (1mpg more on the V8).

4184, on 11/15/16 10:03 AM (PST),tireguy ,2007 GMC Envoy SUV Denali 4dr SUV 4WD (5.3L 8cyl 4A),They don't make them like this anymore!," A lot of people can't tell the difference between what they're calling full-size SUVs now, and what they called mid-size SUVs in the 90s, but there is a major difference.  When the popularity of SUVs exploded in the 90sNow vehicles like the Pathfinder, Explorer, and Durango were based on truck frames, meaning the body basically bolts onto a ladder which has a big engine in the front, a transmission bolted behind it, and a driveshaft going to the rear axle. Now those same vehicles have much more in common with minivans than they do with trucks.  Their construction is of a unitized body, which, rather than being a body bolted onto a proper backbone, is just a bit cluster of sheet metal with some stressed areas stamped with thicker stock.  It saves weight, which in turn saves gas.  In standard crash tests where it's the vehicle vs a concrete block, the safety compromise is negligible, but when two SUVs collide, one has massive beams spanning from bumper to bumper and a 500+ lb advantage in structural steel, and one has a body which is optimized for weight savings, how do you think that turns out?  The powertrain is also different, going from a large longitudinal-mounted engine powering a rear axle and an optional front axle, to a small transverse-mounted engine with a combined transaxle powering the front with the rear being the option.  So here you have the Envoy, the last of GMs mid-size SUVs possessing the guts of a truck.  It's built on a ladder frame, with the same basic engine (5.3L V8), transmission (4L60E) and rear axle (GM 8.6"" 10-bolt) as the Sierra/Silverado line of half ton pickups.  It's an expensive way to build trucks, and GM abandoned it with the introduction of the Acadia/Traverse ""SUVs.""  Most of the other mid-size SUVs, such as the Explorer, Pathfinder, and Durango have followed suit.  Only the Toyota Four-Runner still uses a ladder frame.  The true full-size SUVs (Suburban, Expedition, Land Cruiser) have retained the ladder frame, for now.  As far as our Envoy Denali goes, it's a fun vehicle to drive.  It's not especially spacious, not a fuel sipper, not the most luxurious, it's just a really cool vehicle for active people who don't have to carry a lot of stuff. Having owned this vehicle for seven years now, I did two modifications to make it suit our needs: first, I added a jump seat in the rear from littlepassengerseats.com, which made it into a six person vehicle while still retaining a decent amount of cargo space.  And second, I installed a lift kit from BDS to allow larger tires.  The Envoy Denali is the only vehicle I know of which came with 245/60R18s, meaning there is almost no selection, and certainly no truck/SUV tires.  By raising it up 2 inches, and adding 1.5"" wheel spacers, I was able to install the standard Chevy Silverado tires: 265/65R18.  The vehicle looks awesome, but still stock to the casual observer.  If you get the SLT, with the standard 17"" tires,  you'll have no problem finding tires, and the lift won't be necessary.  Personally, I only got the Denali because I wanted that beautiful LS-variant V8 in the short body (305 hp based on the Corvette motor of the early 2000s).  I was never really a fan of the bling, but love the bang.  Toward the end, they did make some SLTs in that configuration, through they seem kind of rare.  As far as major maintenance, it's needed nothing other than new rear suspension airbags at one point (about $200 each).  It does have three annoyances, however: 1) the driver's door always made a ""thunk"" when going over large bumps, especially while turning left.  2) I've found the decapitated heads of three of the 10 exhaust manifold bolts on my garage floor throughout the years, all from corner positions--it's not leaking yet, but when it does, the job will be a real pain with that huge engine shoe-horned into that tiny compartment.  3) The Bose system makes a buzzing, interference sound from time to time, which goes away with a good whack of the center console.  I can live with those minor issues.",4

Seemed ideal on paper; in reality it was an absolute bore to drive and own.  Wife and I hated it, so we swapped it after a year (even trade) for a pre-owned two-year old Envoy.  This is a vehicle you can fall in love with.  It's a truck, on a ladder frame.  It handles like a truck and I like that.  It's got beautiful lines, lots of power, room inside, and a real hi/lo 4 wheel drive.  No compromises.  It's an all around great vehicle, and fits into my standard 2 car garage next to my Yukon XL perfectly.  It's really sad that they discontinued it this year.

But, if you want something that is comfortable on the road for long stretches, solid, safe, roomy, powerful, versatile, this is it.

4318, on 02/12/16 19:10 PM (PST),Benjamin ,2002 GMC Envoy SUV SLE 2WD 4dr SUV (4.2L 6cyl 4A),Benjamin Iowa State," Attractive features: This 2002 GMC envoy (blue) with just less than 150,000 miles and 270-horse power has several features which drivers of all ages would find appealing. This vehicle includes 5 available seats, 2 front heated seats, an automatic transmission, and a 6-cylinder engine that offers a quiet and comfortable ride. The dash interior comes with a stock CD changer; two power outlets, no sunroof included in the specific model, but does come included with power-adjustable seats.  Review: I have no problem giving this vehicle five stars out of five stars. This early 2000’s model gives back seat riders a great amount of legroom, and is a wonderful vehicle to take the whole family in on long car rides. In between the two front seats there’s two cup holders. The back seat also includes two pull down cup holders that will hold any size cup or drink. I purchased this SUV with just over 100,000 miles on it and I’ve never purchased a more reliable vehicle. This vehicle has never been in an accident and does have two dents in the rear trunk door; otherwise there is no cosmetic damage. The SUV comes with a ball and hitch and is very good for towing. When not towing, this vehicle will get around 22 miles to the gallon. When towing, depending on the size of your load, the vehicle can get anywhere from 13 to 18 miles per gallon. The four-wheel drive comes in very handy if you live in an area where it snows in the winter and even without the four-wheel drive on, it does pretty well in snow. The size of this vehicle is smaller than your standard pickup truck, yet big enough to haul a trailer or small family with room to spare. The back seats fold down to allow the entire trunk to become open which you can use to transport numerous items that wouldn’t fit otherwise. Many consumers worry that the SUV is a 6 cylinder and not a V-8. In my opinion, the 6 cylinder has enough power and as a result, produces an extremely smooth ride. The main console is a bit undersized but the vehicle has no other major inconveniences. Although this model was discontinued in 2009, I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase another one with less mileage on it.",5

This truck by and far is head and shoulders above the rest. The ride is amazing, the amenities phenomenal, and the look is impressive. The only knocks I will give are the headlights and exhaust. There is no reason for a 60k vehicle with practically all LED lighting inside and out, not to have HID headlights.  The halogens cheapen the look. Granted you can get higher intensity halogens, or switch out the system completely to HID, but it would be nice to have it done at the factory. Of course, the Denali comes equipped with HID headlights, but in this day and age, should halogens even be on the table? Next is the exhaust. As soon as looked under the rear and saw the cheap looking exhaust system I knew I had to make a switch. While there are a million exhaust companies out there, I wanted to find something that balanced performance with a classy look. By chance I read that Borla makes exhaust systems for GM trucks/ SUV's.

There were three on the lot with the options I wanted.  Two were made in Mexico, and this one was made in Janesville, WI.  Easy choice.  Through the past 12 years, this truck has carried us up and down the east coast from Florida to New York, spent weekends driving on the beach in NC, and survived every Pennsylvania snow storm that threatened to thwart our Holiday plans.  It brought all four of our newborn children home from the hospital from 2004-2012, towed 10,000 lbs of household goods (the stuff that wouldn't fit in the semi) on our last interstate move, has pulled tree stumps out of the ground, cars out of ditches, and basically made any long trip enjoyable.  If on business I have a choice to drive, rather than fly, I'll drive the old Yukon XL every time.  Now, in 2016, she is finally starting to look her age.  I had to have the hood sprayed last year because the clearcoat was wearing off.  Now the roof is suffering the same fate.  The sides and rear still look good, though, and there is not a spot of rust. The leather on the driver's seat is starting to tear.  As far as maintenance, minor things have happened throughout its life, but no more than expected.  The 4wd selector went at around 80k (leaving me on the beach in 2wd--but I still made it out).  That was a simple plug and play replacement of around $150.  Like an above reviewer mentioned, I also had the oil pump go at around 110k miles.  That was the biggest issue, though my wife was smart enough to notice the lack of oil pressure and shut it down before any damage ensued.  New oil pump installed was under $1k.  I had to replace both front wheel bearings at around 120k, at a cost of around $700.  The stepper motor in the speedometer went at around 130k, but it's incredibly easy to remove the cluster (pull the trim off with your fingers, unscrew it, unplug it).  I shipped it off to circuitboardmedics.com for a complete overhaul (new lights, stepper motors in gauges, added the transmission temp gauge) for a couple hundred bucks--better than new.  Both catalytic converters went around 150k, replaced with generic ones at about $300 each.  The battery lasted about 8 years, then I installed an Optima battery which is still good.  As far as routine maintenance, I let it break in with standard oil, then went full synthetic starting at 10k, with changes every 5-10k miles thereafter, based on the DIC oil life calculations.  To this day, it doesn't burn or leak a drop of oil.  I gave it a tune up at 100k, flushed the transmission at 120k, changed the differential oil at 160k.  I replaced the junk tires it came with at 20k, then went with BFG All-Terrain TAs which took me to 90k, then All-Terrain KOs to 150k (I let it get out of alignment which hastened their demise), then All-Terrain KO2s which are barely showing wear at over 25k miles.  Prices of tires has risen and fallen, but they typically cost about $1100 per set.  Basically, it costs money to maintain a vehicle like this.  As long as you keep up with the little things as they arise, it will serve you well.  The initial cost of this $50k was no small sum to this family starting out, but I've seen so many friends go through multiple $30k vehicles over the period I've owned the Yukon, it's laughable.  This truck could suffer a catastrophic engine/transmission failure tomorrow and I could walk away from it feeling content that it was worth every penny.  Of course, that's not going to happen.  It's still basically a new truck, with 175k on the odometer.  Everything works as it should.  I have no doubt it will still be reliable at 250k plus.  Damn shame that Janesville plant closed down.  Those folks sure knew how to build a truck.",1

4498, on 11/29/15 20:33 PM (PST),Barry Gartner ,2005 GMC Yukon XL SUV 1500 SLE Rwd 4dr SUV (5.3L 8cyl 4A),Vortec 6.0 is AMAZING! LOVE This Denali XL.," The Denali XL is everything you need to get your family up to the Cabin, tow your toys, and more. This vehicle is hands down the best vehicle I have ever owned. It is smooth, powerful, comfortable, and has AWD for towing my Ice-House, Boat, Snowmobiles, and ATV's. The Denali has the Vortec 6.0 but this is essentially the same engine as the 5.3.  My Vortec 6.0 has 232,948 miles and does not burn oil between changes. I have had to perform repairs on this vehicle which I will list but most of them were only after 200,000 and well worth the investment. These vehicles will easily go 400,000 with routine maintenance. Maintenance & Tips:**TIP 1** Buy a blue tooth OBD2 adapter online for $20 and then get the Torque App for your iPhone/Android to monitor/trouble-shoot data and reset error codes.**TIP 2** Change the fluids on this truck regularly. It will pay off in the long run. These trucks will last FOREVER. You can do both the front differential, rear differential, and transfer case very easily/cheap. The same goes for the transmission but that takes about 17 quarts and isn't exactly cheap to do a total flush but it is much cheaper than a whole new transmission.**TIP 3** Search Online for videos for trouble-shooting and repair. I guarantee you will find out how to do many of these repairs yourself/cheap. 1. Transmission may go around 200,000 miles = $3,700 to repair.2. Rear Air Suspension will go around the same time = $800 to $2,700/Dealer to repair. You do not have to put the Air Suspension rear back in/Kit Replacement. I however Love the air suspension for towing, etc.3. Passenger Side leak into Heater Blower Motor. This shorts out the Fan. Easy fix, take off the wipers and the plastic grate between the windshield and the hood. There is an oval metal plate with cracked brittle caulk. Reseal this or put another bigger metal plate over this with caulk.  TIP: Pull out the wet metal heat sink heater fan control module and dry it out. It will come back to life. No need to spend money on this.4. DON""T spray off this engine at the Self-Serve Car Wash. Water on the top side will drain down and short out the anti-knock sensors on the top of the intake and you will start throwing codes. I had to replace both (2) anti-knock sensors and the wire harness. 5. The intake gasket will need to be replaced at some point if it has not been already. It will throw lean bank 1 or 2 codes when it is time to replace.  I think the original was green and the replacement is orange and a better design. Easy fix, just take your time to do it right. 6. If you start to get a random misfire code when it is hot/towing that only happens when you stop it is the front O2 Sensor. Easy fix. Get on the ground and do it yourself. They sell a cheap tool to remove/replace these. 7. Low Oil Pressure when first started cold. Some of these engines will lose oil pressure when first started COLD. Then as the engine warms the oil pressure will come up to normal. That is your clue. A rubber ring in the oil pickup tube has become brittle and cracked. When it warms up it expands and your oil pressure comes back to normal. FIX: Bring this to a shop with some good old boys who are not afraid of a little work. The front differential can be dropped with two people and a hoist in about 20 minutes/intact. This will grant access to drop the oil pan which has to be removed to get to the oil pump pickup tube so that the rubber o-ring can be replaced. $350 - $550 to repair. Don't take it to the dealership for this one. They will want 1K to fix this and it isn't that hard to do. FINAL TIP: Don't be afraid to work on this vehicle. I have performed every repair on this besides the o-ring replacement and the transmission. Working on this has saved me thousands of dollars and prevented me from having to fork out another 50k for a new vehicle. Don't believe for one second that a new GMC truck with the 6.2 is the answer. People are buying these and having oil burning issues from the factory. Not to mention transmission issues, etc. Newer isn't always better.  I for one will be driving my 2005 GMC Denali XL for many years to come.Sincerely,Barry G",5

It is wonderful for trips for families that have more than 4 people. While the gas mileage is not great. I get 18 miles on the highway fully loaded with cargo going 75 MPH with cruise control on. This is not much worse than our old minivan. The AWD makes you feel like you are glued to the road. The optional rear camera is a must. It makes backing out a snap. The turning radius is as good as any sedan. No joke. The interior looks like a Lexus and there is a ton of room. This car is identical to the Escalade except for the grade of leather.,4.5

The backup camera is a must, even though it is tied to the navigation and DVD player.  The ride quality started with a 160 mile trek home after signing the papers.  The Yukon was baptized with heavy snow and freezing mist and performed remarkably. The 5.3 engine is strong when passing and efficient.  I am averaging 18mpg on the Hwy.

You have the american people thinking they cannot get the big GMC, and get good gas mileage.  Our neighbors bought a Surburban after we told them about how good the gas mileage is on ours.  We also told another neighbor who told us they didn't think they could afford putting gas into one.  They now have a 2008.

Had a bad experience years ago with a GM product and was nervous to purchase another even with access to GM employee discount. After several test drives and reading good press regarding much improved quality and design I decided to take a chance on my silver 2010 SLE with the exact features I was looking for: SLE-2, cloth buckets, ext appearance pkg, conv pkg, tow pkg, and integrated trailer brake.

Used the USAA Buying Service and got a excellent deal. Compared Suburban LT to Yukon XL SLT and prefer the Yukon to Suburban based on the options available.

The 5.3 V8 engine is well made, I had same engine in my GMC Sierra pickup that got 255k miles before selling and it still had plenty of life left in it. Never gave me a single problem with regular maintenance and provides plenty of power and acceleration even while comfortable seating 8 adults or pulling a trailer loaded with a boat or 4,500 lb car + trailer weight. Appears to have had dealer installed CL 3 tow package that's just perfect for the pulling I do. MPG isn't great however its on par with any other SUV in the large class plus if your in the market for this sized SUV, MPG should be low on your priority list. The transmission shifts very smooth, I only wish GMC had put a 5th OD gear in for better highway MPG (currently get 18-19 mpg on highway going 75-80mph). Interior is very inviting and well laid out. Logical and comfortable setup with some great features like the instantaneous mpg / V8 or V4 display that will help change your driving habits to the good if you pay attention to it to maximize your mpg - why rush to a red light?? Sound system, AC, general comfort and braking are all above average. I was able to get my '07 in excellent condition with 87k miles for $6,200 so I got a great value but there are plenty more in similar condition for well under $8k, just be prepared to buy from an individual (dealers will want at least $12.5k, even the desperate ones) so have it checked out by a good mechanic and drive it until the odometer rolls over to at least 250k. Hopefully you will be able to hand it down to your son/daughter - ideal as its very safe and doesn't seem to fetch what its worth resale wise.",4
4569, on 10/21/17 17:19 PM (PDT),Max Manning ,2007 GMC Yukon XL SUV Denali 4dr SUV AWD (6.2L 8cyl 6A),Not real impressed with 07 Denali XL," Engine sounds like a threshing machine for 15-18 minutes after start up and driving. Had an 02 Denali XL with 6.0l that knocked when first started and with 250,000 miles on it it would still only knock for 1-2 minutes at most even in sub-zero weather. With 120,000 miles on the 07, there is something wrong with the traction assist, stabi-trac, the rear auto level is not operational and acts like something in the transmission or transfer case is starting to let go. Unhooked the air pump for the rear and added manual air valve to the shocks but the computer still doesn't work. Everything on the 02 was still working when it was traded in. Run great, fuel mileage about the same as the 02 with a smaller engine.07 didn't have a Bose radio in it and the 02 did. Not nearly as impressed with the 07 purchase as I was when I purchased the 02 and it was 9 years old and had a few more miles on it when purchased. Never had any major engine, transmission or drive train work that needed done on the 02. The 07 is roomier on the inside. Very,very hard to read the HVAC controls in the day time and I miss the dash mounted trans temp gauge when towing. Over all I like the horse power, roomier interior and better view looking out of the interior. The quality overall is far less than what I have come to find in GM products thru the years.Update. Now with 132000 miles the rear differential has a very very annoying whine coming from it. Sounds like a pinion bearing is going out. There is a very long bang every time it goes into passing gear, not sure if its coming from the transmission or transfer case. You can hear  and feel the bang coming from the transmission tunnel between the front captains chairs. The motor, transmission and transfer case mounts have been replaced and the cross members are not broken or loose. The front differential seals were both out at the time of purchase and I was unaware of it until it was to late and damage was done to the front differential housing. This I do blame on the dealership and their ""inspection"". Many of these problems were in the vehicle long before I purchased it and I feel that the GM dealership that had taken it in on trade had done a very very poor inspection. This is a local,reputable long standing family owned GM dealership,but I will never purchase another vehicle from them.The tow/haul mode for the transmission isn't very reliable, sometimes it works fine sometimes it doesn't work at all. The dash electronics have went haywire as the check tire pressure indicator comes on about every 4-5 miles of driving and the tire pressures have all the same reading. The traction control and stabitrac lights come on at frequent intervals. They will usually go out in a few miles of driving, but have been on for up to 100 mile before going out. No one has been able to find out why, just that they come on. The cruise control will not work when the air temp falls to 32 degrees and colder. Again no one has been able to find the problem or repair it. If I didn't know better I would say that if it was possible to turn the odmeter back, it has been done on this unit. It is in far worse condition than the one I traded in with 250,000 plus miles. I have owned Chevrolet and GMC Suburbans and Yukons for 40 years and this one has been the biggest piece of junk that I have ever owned in my life. I will never own a import brand, but I am not sure if I'll own another GM product. I am amazed at how much the Denali was cheapened up from the 2002-2006 models and the 2007 and newer models. I am keeping it mainly because of the money I have invested in purchasing this vehicle and the cost of repairs so far and I still have several large and expensive repairs yet to come,but can't yet afford. I hate this vehicle, but I refuse to sell it to some other person knowing that there is so much wrong with it. I am approaching retirement and was planning to use this vehicle to travel with, but i am not sure if i will ever be able to feel safe in driving it far from home.",1

What a great vehicle it has been! The main reasons for this selection were the upgraded features, the towing ability, and generous cargo/people space. The burble of the 6.2 reminded me of the string of late 90's TransAms I did time in. Things that made the GMC the best choice over the Navigator were interior ergonomics, the discrete (if not slightly understated) luxury, the engine/6-speed with manual shift selections, and the interior decor (looks great in tan/brown) two tone). Almost two years later, we have not been disappointed.  We have had no quality or warranty issues what-so-ever.",4.5

It is very responsive and has good gas mileage.  I get 17 mpg around town (not too many stoplights) and I get 21+ mpg on highway running at 76 mph.   The on board computer is optimistic about gas mileage, telling me I get about 1 mile per gallon more than I really get by my own measurements over several long trips. Nevertheless I get better gas mileage than most pickup trucks and many smaller SUVs.  Cargo area is not as good as my old Suburban and the second row seats do not fold flat--a problem if you haul a lot.  With the Denali 6.2 the car drives and handles very well--this is a fast SUV.",5

Also, the control panel that is on the front window fell off and messed up the automatic lights as well as the cruise control.  The seat belt would not retract after we picked it up at the dealer after they fixed the roof rails/luggage rack.  So, back in the shop.

Loved the ride height, power, and engine sound.  We have 4 small kids.  The only way to change the rear zone temp is from the rear. My kids were in car seats, and too young to manage the controls anyway. Bad design.  Heat was either on or off, couldn't adjust temp. After five weeks the rear view camera stopped working every third time we put it in reverse.  GMC replaced center console 3 times and it never fixed. I told them it must be a wiring issue but they said that is too hard and expensive to try to fix.  It was a brand new truck! They told me they were going to charge me $3200. The truck was a few months old at that point, and I had bought it brand new from that dealer with 10 miles on it.After 5 months a plasticky smell started coming from heat. Dealer could not find anything wrong and said it must have been our fault and they were done.Lost a good bit of money but traded it in for another Sienna minivan.  So much happier again.",3

We replaced a 2009 Denali. Unfortunatly the price does not reflect the quality. We paid just under $85,000 out the door for our loaded Denali XL. We knew going in that there could be transmission problems because of other reviews. What we didn't know is that everything in this vehicle is cheaply made. It shows nice but is only ""skin deep"", and it has very thin skin. We are very disappointed in almost ever aspect of this vehicle, when you pay $85k for a vehicle you have certin expectations. It is on it's way back to the dealership for it's 3rd warranty work, on the engine ( same 6.2 from 2007-2014 ) we don't even mention the deterioating leather and low quality of materials to thhe dealer. Oh and the Yukon only has 21,000 miles so far. We are planning on selling it at this point, probably go to Toyota, BMW, or Mercedes-Benz for quality, GMC isn't cutting it for the price tag they want.",3

4645, on 02/10/17 09:42 AM (PST),Robert Bob ,2016 GMC Yukon XL SUV Denali 4dr SUV (6.2L 8cyl 8A),XL for empty nesters," This is a big SUV that doesn't feel big when driving.  Easy to park and has a small turning radius.  We often have our kids and grandkids with us and routinely haul 7 people in this and love the legroom and cargo room with everyone on board.  The ride and quiet cabin are spectacular and the fuel mileage is better than expected.  Has tons of torque and pulling our 4,000 lb boat is effortless.  It is easy to back the boat up too with large mirrors and good backup camera.  Like the auto leveling rear shocks.   My only disappointment in the vehicle is GM's decision to eliminate the ability to pause and rewind live radio that my previous vehicles had.  This was available before 2016 but GM eliminated it which is a shame.  My 2015 GMC Canyon had this feature but a $70,000 vehicle doesn't.  Doesn't make sense!Had trouble with torque converter clutch but dealer was able to resolve with fluid flush and new transmission fluid type.  Problem caused shudder or vibration in 8th gear that felt like going over rumble strips.  RPM fluctuated between 1600 and 1800 when TCC clutch was not happy.  Downshifting into 7th gear would eliminate problem at the expense of poorer gas milage.  Problem started at 16,000 miles.  Have 17,000 miles on it now and problem is gone after fluid flush and change.  Car is very quiet and subsequently any rattles are heard very easily.  Chased a problem with a rattling/popping noise that sounded like is was coming from the right side dash area.  Disassembled many components inside the glove box/dash area looking for it and finally found the noise was coming from the right front inner fender well!  The noise could be duplicated by standing on and off the front part of the running board.  The noise was from a loose spot weld on inner fender metal.  Placing a section of close cell foam under panel solved the noise!  Fixed by owner!Still not happy with GMC 22"" wheels that cause harsh and rough ride.  22"" wheels should not be an option on this car!  Changed to Michelin Defender tires and solved vibration problems with original Bridgestone Dueler tires but this 22"" size tire has low profile sidewalls which contributes to tires not absorbing bumps well and transmitting the bumps to the passengers.  Car would ride much smoother on 18"" or maybe 20"" wheels.  These wheels were a $2,400 option from GMC and it was a waste of money in my opinion.  They are also very hard to keep clean and not very happy with the chrome plastic inserts on the wheels.  Just learned the owner can't rotate tires and reset TPMS system without a special tool!  This tool should be included with a $70,000 vehicle.  Unfortunate that a simple routine simple maintenance task can't be accomplished without the $100 too or a trip to the dealer or tire shop.  If the TPMS system is not updated after wheel rotation, tire positions will not agree with dash display in the event of a tire problem.",5

The back seat is tight, but right now some of the kids are small.  We have 8 people in our family so we got the 9 seater which gives us one extra space.  I'm very happy with the vehicle's road noise, comfort, power, and AWD/4x4 in the winter.  This would be my wish list on the next re-design though: I would love to see a ""well"" in the back cargo space area like in minivans.  I know it can't be too deep because of the spare tire, but anything would be helpful.  This would naturally increase the cargo capacity, plus things wouldn't roll out when you are on an incline (soccer balls, cantaloupes, watermelons, etc.) Perhaps they could put a faux floor that could come out or stay in depending on the needs of the owner.  Also, this is crazy, and maybe I'm the only one to think of this, but I would love to see sliding doors on the suburban/yukon.  It's a beast to park, and if you actually have kids like we do, no one is allowed to open doors until we open them for them.  If the sliders were there like on a mini van, it would be the ultimate family vehicle.  I know a lot of people buy these with small families in mind so it's probably not a big deal to them.  And, the running boards are slippery when wet.  Could it be possible to put a different coating on them?  In any case, it's a great car and I'm glad to have it.

No problems except one battery in 3-years with 45k miles. Better than Japanese cars I have owned. I added an K&N free-flow air filter and acceleration has noticably improved.  When punched, it really moves out. While no econo car, it will take me over 500 miles on one tank while cruising at 80+. I calculated it around 16 MPG.  In pure city driving I get around 12 to 13.

4753, on 02/13/17 20:15 PM (PST),mike ,2015 GMC Yukon XL SUV Denali 4dr SUV 4WD (6.2L 8cyl 8A),Stay away from this vehicle.," I ordered this suv from the dealership, just the way I wanted. The problems started 3 months after I bought the car, and they are as follows: (1) After the 3 month or 2GB data plan expired. I figured I would enroll in the monthly data plan, as the wifi worked great during the trial. I subscribed to a 1 GB data plan per month. My daughter drained the whole data plan in less than 10 minutes by streaming a you tube video (she didn't download anything.) I called ONSTAR to see how the data plan got depleted so quickly. They refilled the data bank. Again, she depleted the 1 GB streaming a 10 minute video. I called again, they replenished the account a 3rd time. After the same thing happened again. The ONSTAR people told me that my daughter was either downloading a big file or there was something wrong with the hardware in my car and I'd need to take my car into the dealership to have it fixed. So,  I took it to the dealership. They told me it would take a day, 7 days later I got my car back and the wifi NEVER GOT FIXED!!!!! The dealership could replicate the problem my car was having with burning through 1 GB of data in less than 10 minutes while streaming a video. The dealership said the car passed all diagnostic tests and ONSTAR said all of their equipment was properly working and I could leave my suv at the dealership until they somehow could get it fixed. But, they had no ideas as to how to fix the problem because it passed all diagnostics. I chose to cancel the monthly wifi package, which got the ONSTAR people to call me and reassess the problem. Guess what, they could never figure out the problem either. (2) About 2 months after that, I had the first of a total of five problems with the prim pieces on the outside of the car. If you look at every door on the car, their are vertical trim pieces that are plastic that run vertically between where the windows join the door seals. Every one of those pieces on all four doors has come loose and had to be reaffixed to the car with something called appliqué. Each time one of those came loose, it was strip to the dealership, so FOUR more trips to the dealership. (3) This past October a red warning light showed up on the rear view mirror. I called the ONSTAR people, they said the ONSTAR system needed to be checked out. At this point the suv had 35,900 on the odometer. By the time the dealership could look at the car, the odometer had gone past the 36,000 mark. SUV has a 3 year/ 36,000 mile warranty. The problem with the ONSTAR system was that the antenna on the car had broke. The dealership wanted $500.00 to replace the antenna since the car was now out of warranty. I came uncorked at them and they eventually fixed the antenna for $100.00. (4) This last December the sunroof started to leak water into the car on both the driver and passenger side of the center console around the controls for the sun roof. The cost was $500.00 The work repair order said that the drain tubes for the sun roof had come a part. NO NEW PARTS WERE USED. THEY RECONNECTED THE DRAIN TUBES. (5) Then, last night one of the previously reattached trim pieces has come loose again. Today, I took my car to the dealership to see if the previous work was under warranty. They told me it was not and that to get the trim piece reaffixed was going to cost $300.00!! Mind you, the trim piece is loose and not missing. I told them no thanks. I took my car over to CARMAX and had it appraised. I took delivery of my 2015 GMC Yukon Denali XL in Jan of 2015. It currently has 39,000 miles on it and has had to go back to the dealership 8 times since I got it for building quality issues. Mechanically I have not had any problems with it, but quality wise this suv has been a nightmare. I had a Toyota Sequioa that had 140,000 miles on it when I traded it in on the Yukon. I think I'll be getting another Toyota. In my live I've owned vehicles by: Ford, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, and GM. This was my first, and last GM.  I would avoid this these things like the plague. I was able to find several web sites where people had mentioned the problem with the trim pieces after the second one on my car had come loose. Unfortunately for me, I didn't find that information until I specifically started searching for problems with window trim pieces on 2015 Yukon.I traded this car in on a 2017 Toyota Land Cruiser 6 months ago. I have had 0 problems with the Land Cruiser and my GMC had been to the shop 2-3 times for problems within the first 6 months of ownership.",1

Quiet interior with little road noise. I do have a suggestion though for cargo capacity- somehow they need to make a well in the back to increase cargo space like they have in minivans.  Big families need the space. Even if it is only a few inches, it would be very helpful.  Perhaps a faux floor that can be removed would be a nice compromise if they really wanted the back cargo area to remain flat and sloped towards the hatch so your melons and balls will still roll out.  A sliding side door would also be helpful in those tight parking situations.  We have to directly supervise door opening when the kids are getting out.  It would still look just like it does now, but with sliding doors.  (But, maybe I'm the only one that bought the car for a large family and it's 4 wheel drive capability. )  Hope this helps anybody considering this as their next purchase.",4

4761, on 08/14/18 13:48 PM (PDT),GMC Remorse ,2015 GMC Yukon XL SUV SLT 4dr SUV 4WD (5.3L 8cyl 6A),#Rolling Garbage Truck," Where do I start? I have owned a '15 Yukon XL since July 2014. It has 28,000 miles on it today nearly two years later.  The truck has been in the shop more in two years than my previous 2003 Suburban was in twelve years. IMO this truck has numerous major issues: 1) The transmission is a clunky, ill shifting, garbage can. GM and my dealership says that it is over-engineered with numerous design flaws and cannot be truly fixed. At any moment during cruising down the road, the truck will shudder and make a thunk/clunk sound so loud you will feel you lost a drive shaft. Add to that its propensity to get stuck in auto 4wd at the slightest temperature change, and requires a technician to unlock it. 2) The cheap plastic used for the running boards and chrome around the fog lights and multiple other cosmetic areas on the truck look old and weathered already, and I maintain my vehicles impeccably. I recommend any potential buyers look around the door frame edges and under the tail gate handle to see some of the worst paint runs/drips that you will ever see from a factory. I have fought one wheel with a slow leak since purchase and GMC has turned their back on me about that too, and refuses to replace it. It is one of the 22"" rims, so I regret that little upgrade. 3) Electronics - total hot mess. The screen that slides up and down broke after maybe the sixth time I ever actually used it. Its a total gimmick and it took GM a week or more to get the entire radio to replace it. Yeah that will be a fun repair cost outside of warranty someday. On top of that the radio does not play media stream songs back to back without changing the inputs between songs. How irritating is that? Very! Alas, GM has given me a bullet that it cannot be fixed. Also, forget about text reading or Apple Car Play that was promised when I bought the car - you see, its not compatible with first version 2015's. Oh, and the screen collects finger prints and dust like a magnet. But don't worry, you will be so frustrated by the near useless weather app (you can see weather radar for a whole multi state view but not zoom) and inability to quickly store radio stations and retrieve them that you will most likely use a fist on the screen and forgo the fingerprint all together. 4) Leather seats. I have the heated and cooled seats. The ventilation holes are not done well and the leather will tears from hole to hole. Another design flaw, but at least GM replaced this for me with little fuss. The longevity of the leather is going to be very poor indeed which will completely discount its resale value. While we are on the interior, check out the cup holders mounted into the doors in the second row - nobody out of the car until your drinks are completely empty otherwise your door panel will be wearing your youngster's latest slurpy or soda as soon as they close the door; this little gem tells me that GM has a bunch of buffoons as designers. They are worried more about drink holder count versus practicality - it must look better in a marketing ad. 5) Carpets inside ride about 2-3 inches off the floor and are of the poorest quality. The look like they were installed by a vision challenged person missing all of their digits sans thumb and pinky. After market full floor mats work ok to hold it all down and dress up the cabin, but should this be required on a $70K truck? 6) I have saved this one for last because it is the catalyst for me waving off GM products for the rest of my life. Last summer, while my car was parked running in my driveway and cooling down in preparation for a family trip to dinner, the truck just started rolling away and down the driveway and into the street. I had to do a stunt man move to run to the car open the door and slam on the brakes as the car was heading directly into my neighbors living room. Since I am not a stunt man, nor had any practice jumping into a moving truck, I slammed my head on the door as I threw it open and injured my hand grappling with the handle. I do not recommend anyone try this! This event could have easily killed my grandson or daughters that often spend time loading or unloading items in the back of the truck. I immediately called GM, and they simply lied and said that they have never heard of this happening before. They then blamed me! They said they could do nothing for me. I immediately went to google, and found a recall issued by GM for the same exact issue that I experienced. I call GM Customer care back to tell them what I had found, and they told me my truck was not part of the recall at this time, so there was nothing that they could or would do. I told them that they need to take the car off the road and investigate what happened, but they were useless. My dealership took the car immediately, and upon inspection found a transmission shaft was manufactured incorrectly, and there was a software update that would ""most likely"" fix the roll away issue. So many more issues - IMO GMC Lemon.",1

There were cars, trucks, and semis in the ditch or over turned along the way. The Yukon had zero problems. I watched the transmission temp the entire time. It never got over 135 degrees.

The Yukon was comfy and had plenty of space for the six people in my family and a dog. The heated seats were great for bitterly cold New England winters, and the 4wd was great in the rain and snow. The car was very reliable, and aside from scheduled matinence, the car only had two instances of emergency repairs when just the brakes needed to be re-calibrated, and the dealership was very helpful and fixed the problem easily. Materials wise, the dashboard, I thought, felt a bit cheap as it was made entirely of hard plastics, but the plastics all looked nice and held together nicely and never chipped or cracked. All of the places where you would rest your arms and hands were nicely padded (aside from the third row) and all of the seats were very comfortable, although I thought the driver and passenger seats could have used a bit more side bolstering but were comfortable none the less. The car was very safe as well, with a backup camera with good quality, very responsive parking sensors, good blind spot monitoring, and just giving the size of that car would make it safe if you were to get in a crash in one. The car ride and handled well, the steering could be defined as a bit numb, but it must be for a car of its size. The car accelerated stupendously for its size and braking was fine. Two complaints I have for the car's performance are that I thought that the headlights were not too bright, though I am comparing them to halogen projector beam lights, but they do suffice nicely, and that the accelerator could be a bit touchy and could take some time to get used to, but once you did it was nothing. All of the electronics worked splendidly, the touch screen was very responsive and Bluetooth worked fine, that navigation system could be annoying to work with when in crowded city streets, but it usually worked fine. This was the first car that I drove when I got my permit and the more time I spent driving it, the more I came to like it! It was a solidly built American body on frame SUV and it made me feel very safe when in it, and I loved going fast down the highway in it. However the Yukon's lease ran up this August and instead of buying it, my mom leased a 2016 Toyota Sequoia and it is a good car, but there are still things I liked better about the Yukon that the Sequoia. The Yukon proved that it was a good, reliable, and useful car that will suit any large family and all of their needs.",5

My only warnings to people are minor. In the extreme cold the rear cargo door won't work, you have to shut off the motor too it and manually open it. Not the end of the world but it's helpful to know. Also our engine light is on. It's apparently something to do with the emissions system, a $500 fix. Unfortunately this issue disables the remote start on the vehicle, a little more annoying. I have a few friends with similar Yukons/Suburbans and these issues are common in them. Otherwise we don't have any major complaints. It tows our 32' camper wonderfully and hauls the kids around too. Gas mileage isn't the best but what do you expect??",4

We traded an 2004 Suburban for this brand new and now with 155,000 miles on it, this baby still runs and drives like a new one.  Being totally honest, there are two weaknesses for these trucks.  1st is the displacement on demand or active fuel management.  This is supposed to increase your gas mileage, but it causes your motor to consume oil after about 60,000 miles or so.  And if you're not the type that keeps an eye on your oil level, you can run too low and burn your motor up.  I have always kept a close eye on this and finally had the dod deleted and I've had zero problems.  My mileage is the same, maybe even a little better, and no more oil consumption.  2nd weakness is the transmission torque converter design.  Due to a design issue, these 6 speed trannys will give you problems between 100k and 125k miles.  Mine made it to 153k and then it cost approximately $1300 to have the fix done.  The good thing is my guy went through the entire tranny and all was good except the torque converter and another part, the name of which slips my mind.  A complete rebuild would have cost $2500-$3500, but because my tranny guy is honest, he fixed only what needed fixing.  Bad part is that the design flaw is still there and in another 120k miles, I'll be looking at doing it again.  Overall, this vehicle is awesome.  Still looks good and haven't had any other issues with it except for what I've mentioned.  Granted, some people will drive them even when they know there's a problem and this will wind up costing them a lot more in the long run.  But for those that get luckier and catch these two issues quickly, this vehicle will give you many, many trouble free miles and will do so efficiently and in style.",5

4907, on 09/02/16 19:48 PM (PDT),dan ,1999 GMC Suburban SUV K1500 SLT 4dr SUV 4WD,My 99 Suburban," I bought a 99 Suburban 8 years ago. It was 8 years old.  It only had 100,000 miles on it.  It was local. It also had a completely rebuilt transmission  just weeks before I bought it.  It is a  4 wheel drive and the 4 wd operates by a push button on the dash. I've read enough reviews and complaints about the push button 4 wd  being problematic.   This vehicle is bad on gas and very high maintenance.   I'm a mechanic and so I save myself 1000's of dollars by doing repairs myself ; radiator, heater core, fuel pump, differential, and other mechanical and cosmetic repairs as well.  I was willing to accept the fact that this truck would be more expensive to operate.   I drove this truck 65,000 miles after I bought it then the detonator  went off.  it started back in January 2016 on a very cold day when the speedometer would not register when you first start it up and begin driving.   Coincidentally the transmission would not shift out of first gear.  This only lasted for a few seconds. By the time I reached  20 mph, the speedometer would begin working and the  transmission would go into 2nd gear.  This symptom would not occur again for another month and it would only last for a few seconds. Since I didn't know what was wrong, I took it to a local garage that I trusted and obviously  they could not diagnose the problem because everything was working exactly the way it should. There were no engine lights on and no codes.  Well when summertime came around it happened again accept in a huge way. This time you may be going down the highway and everything is working fine when the speedometer decides it doesn't want to work anymore.  Well guess what ?   You're going back into first gear, no matter where you are or how slow or fast you're moving.   O it gets better.  About a second or no more than 2 seconds later the ABS engages whether you have your foot on the brake or not.  The brake pedal  begins vibrating so bad that the sound it made would be very loud  and you would have thought the brake pedal was coming out of the floor board.   It still gets better.   About a second or no more than 2 seconds later the steering wheel would try to lock up on you and then it would change and  get very loose. It would be similar to playing a driving  type video game at an arcade.  I found out what that part was.  There is a collar that fits around the steering shaft located close to the foot pedals.  It supposedly regulates the flow of power steering fluid at various speeds.  So there it is in that order.  There is no need for me to take this vehicle to any garage since my 350 engine has thrown at least 1 rod bearing.  I thought for sure I would be able to take this truck 200,000 miles.  I've always used Mobil 1 synthetic oil, but this engine is not designed to run at 8000 rpms.  I spoke to a ""person""  at the main plant in Michigan, but they could care less.  Plus it's a 17 year old vehicle.  I never had a car like this and never heard of anything like this happening with any brand vehicle.   In my case. 1 computer sensor triggered another sensor.   Just think about how much more complicated the computers are on new  vehicles today.   I guarantee you  ""if""  the speedometer quits working on my 455 Olds,  I'm not going back into first gear.   I would like to know if there is anyone else in this world who has experienced the same thing.",1

I have no worries about turning the key and making another 1500 km trip without notice or time to prep. Aside from changing the Fuel Pump once (common problem), I have not had any major issues with her. There is no rust on it and the interior is still in great shape without cracks in the dash or holes in the seats. Aside from regular maintenace and fluid changes, the only thing that I had to change was the air freshener. It never quits! ",4.625
4968, on 06/23/09 23:29 PM (PDT),Mike H ,1997 GMC Suburban SUV K1500 4dr SUV 4WD,One of GM's Best," This truck's been in my family for 10 years now, and I just received it from my dad last year around this time.  And, at 210,000 miles, it still runs like a dream.  This truck's been through hell and back.  My older sister destroyed two cars with it, every winter in Michigan, this truck's a toughie. Repairs have been minimal: replaced alternator at 125,000, replaced rear-end at 160,000, one battery, 3 sets of front brakes, distributor cap.  The back brakes are the originals that came on the truck 12 years ago, and they still aren't worn through. Essentially, from my experience, it doesn't wanna give up.  And, atop all that, I'm still beating the mileage ratings. That old 5.7 is a strong one.",4.875
4969, on 06/20/09 14:18 PM (PDT),sandyle03 ,1997 GMC Suburban SUV C2500 4dr SUV,Unreliable," I have had my truck for 5 years. Although I haven't had to replace the fuel pump, I am having some electrical issues. The starter is not bad, but sometimes I will drive some place, get out, and get back in the truck...it won't say a sound, no turn over or nothing but everything in the truck still works. I took it to GMC and they refused to dig into the problem because it would not stall there (no wonder they are in bankrupt). They put a $356 wire on it, and it did it again as soon as I stopped to the store leaving. No one would come up the road to help me.(maybe 5 blocks) Great vehicle but the gas cost is killing me! If I can get it to stop stalling, it would be even better!",3.25
4970, on 10/02/08 16:04 PM (PDT),RTS ,1997 GMC Suburban SUV K1500 4dr SUV 4WD,1997 K1500 Suburban," Good solid truck for the most part. Two issues in the last 57,000 miles, first it lost the 2-3 clutch pack in the transmission at 121,000 but the previous owner had done a lot of towing. Second I lost a fuel pump at 154,000 miles but that was my own fault for not changing the fuel filter as often as required (filter was pluged).  It took me longer to drain the tank than it did to replace the pump, which cost $110.  I have a 32' travel trailer and 4 kids and overall this has been a good vehicle. Mileage is poor, but there is a limit to what you can expect from a 5300 pound box.",3.875
4971, on 08/12/08 14:05 PM (PDT),JWG ,1997 GMC Suburban SUV K1500 4dr SUV 4WD,Tough & Reliable," We purchased our '97 Suburban new and will probably have it for 3-5 more years. It's been a great vehicle! I'm big on maintenance. Treat the car right and the car will treat you right. Consequently, we've never had a break down or surprise issue. ",4.875

It'  reliable and comfortable. The only problem is I go through 2 sets of brakes a year, thank goodness for lifetime warranty pads. Plenty of room for camping and ballgames. Pulls 5 quads easily. Rear air is great.",4.75

Hauls our 3000 lb travel trailer well, but uses a lot of gas when towing (9 mpg).  When not towing I get 18 mpg on the highway.  Replaced fuel pump two times in two month (also replaced steering gearbox and alternator, but after 113,000 miles, I suppose that's OK).  The engine itself is solid as a rock. 125,000 miles and no leaks. It runs very smooth even on heavy acceleration. I've heard from a lot of people, including mechanics, to watch the tranny.  Had a spring break in the tranny, but was inexpensive to repair.  ",4.625

It has been a nightmare and waste of my time waiting in the waiting rooms while it gets fixed.  And that doesnt include the $900 for the tires I will have to replace if I keep it.  I've only had it a year and bought it with under 100k miles. ,3

4976, on 03/04/06 18:44 PM (PST),waderboddle ,1997 GMC Suburban SUV K1500 4dr SUV 4WD,my favorite vehicle," This vehicle is over nine years old but is still solid, quiet and dependable. I have owned it for five years. It handles well for it's size, tracks well and is a pleasure to drive. Current odometer is 170k. Motor is still quiet and peppy. I use synthetic oil. The downside of this truck is the fuel pump. If you plan to buy one and can hear a buzzing sound, with the engine running, coming from the rear license plate, replace the fuel pump. Also check the gas tank for rust. I've replaced the pump twice myself. I was blessed, both times when it died it was parked.",4.5

4978, on 12/28/04 22:41 PM (PST),Mike ,1997 GMC Suburban SUV C2500 4dr SUV,4 months and lovin' it," I really like this Suburban.  This is the first full size SUV I have owned and I love it.  I have had minor problems such as the wipers getting stuck, but move after I ""help"" them.  There is also a gremlin in the wiring for the interior lights.  They stay on all the time unless I use the override switch.  I find these to be minor problems I can live with.  I have the 7.4 2wd.  Loads of power!  Gas mileage the same as my old Grand Cherokee 12mpg.  Nine-passenger seating has plenty enough room for three kids and camping gear. Handles great on the open highway, a little tougher to handle in the city traffic.  Also, it's a big truck that needs lots of room to stop.  Brakes could be better.  Great truck. ",3.875

4982, on 06/04/03 00:00 AM (PDT),dls ,1997 GMC Suburban SUV K1500 4dr SUV 4WD,High Cost of Ownership," By far the most costly vehicle I have ever owned (and I consider myself a GM guy).  Although I love this vehicle for trips and towing my boat and motocross trailer it has cost me dearly over the past 12 months.  Repairs to the transfer case, power steering pump, rear universals, sway bar connecting rods and upper and lower coolant intakes have cost me just under $2500 this year.  With only 70K miles on the vehicle I had hoped to own it for another 70K-80K miles.  I expect the poor gas mileage, wear and tear and brake pads and a new battery every three years, it's a big vehicle and I bought it with my eyes open.

I love them and I feel my family is safe in one.  Safety is more important to me than a few miles per gallon.  By the way all 5 of my Suburbans have averaged 18-20 mgp on the road.

Make sure it has LT tires and not P, the passenger radial tends to pull even though the alignment is good. We just spent over $500 putting 4 LT tires on and it rides a heck of a lot better. 2. Make sure there are good shocks.The dealer claimed to put on new shocks, they spent $11 a piece.  They are wrong for that class of truck.3. Check for maintenace history. 4.Have FUN. We did the 100k tune up,and it runs like a champ.  The gas mileage is about 15 mpg, but the tank holds 40 gallons and we can go a long long way on a tank. ",4.75
