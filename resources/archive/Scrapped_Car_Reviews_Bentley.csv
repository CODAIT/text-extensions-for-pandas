However, with the Bentley GTC you definitely see where the money goes. With custom interiors, hand-crafted seats, and an exterior unmatched by anything else, Bentley really does know how to build a car. After driving mine for about a year now, all I can say is how timeless of a car it really is and will continue to be.",4.75

It was a lemon. Lots of problems. Broke down twice. Terrible car. The car was sold to me with defective tires too. They had to replace them. It was in and out of the shop all the time. The dealer (Bentley Naples) was a nightmare to deal with as well. Filed Florida Lemon Law. Vehicle was bought back by Bentley as a ""manufacturer buy-back"". Got full refund. Would never buy a Bentley again or recommend this vehicle to anyone. They tried to make me a sign a non-disclosure document to prevent me making this public. I refused. They told me that is common practice. I asked why. They said to protect the brand name.",1.5

The sales rep swore it was normal, but after driving for the last 33 years, I know what a transmission should feel like. Decided not to get this one, but will continue to look.",3.625

Handling is reminiscent of my 10 year old Rolls.   I thought this car would be much tighter, and squeak free,  just not the case.   Electronic gremlins, including a very slow downshift automatic transmission.   Dealership says ""everything is normal"".  We will now be selling a pretty new car.",2.375
6, on 12/25/07 13:57 PM (PST),jim ,2007 Bentley Continental GTC Convertible 2dr Convertible AWD (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),Best of All 3!," I've owned a GT, Spur and now the GTC and this is the best of all three. Better drive/ride/handling than the GT and Spur - AND, as of 2008 model, they've eliminated all the kinks/idiosyncs out of the electronics, esp. the phone and nav. system from the earlier models.  The GTC is a joy to drive and a head turner.  Build quality is better than ever and the sound system, in a word, spectacular.   The GTC is, in a word, masterful.   Even the Breitling clock is improved!",4.75

I have a Ferrari 306 Modenna Spider and this Bentley to my amazement could easily outperform it.  If you're looking for extreme style and class while getting the performance of a Ferrari or race car for not too much money (if you're already in this market), this is a win, win, win, win situation.

9, on 12/31/06 20:00 PM (PST),JA ,2007 Bentley Continental GTC Convertible 2dr Convertible AWD (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),Continental GTC, I have had the Bentley Continental GTC for about one week now. It is a real blast to drive. I am planning to get rid of my older Bentley GT because this one is so much fun to drive! The interior is the best part of the car. The leather is like no other car in the world! The GTC drives so nicely I prefer to drive this over my Rolls Royce Phantom. In my opinion this is Bentley's best car yet!,4.75

I think that Bentley did a GREAT job with it.  It is beautiful and handles well, plus it has GREAT acceleration.  My kids love it!

11, on 01/25/09 12:35 PM (PST),Tom Alison ,2008 Bentley Continental GTC Convertible 2dr Convertible AWD (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),The Best of the Best," I have owned 3 Ferrari Spyders 305, 355 & 360, Mercedes 500 SL, Jaguar Supercharged XJR.  I have owned my 2008 Bentley GTC Beluga/Beluga with GTC Speed steering wheel and seats.  In my first week of ownership I have driven the car 500 miles and must share that I have never experienced the surge of emotion with any other of my cars. The GTC is really not a car.  It is a work of art that delivers complete satisfaction whether just admiring the beautiful composition of the design or pressing the V12 to its ultimate power range. Bentley nailed it. Thank you Bentley for delivering on your promise!",4.875

Spoils you for any other motorcar.  This is an automobile that is as comfortable at 120 MPH as tooling around the neighborhood.  Superlative handling, nice exhaust note, power (@ 552 BHP!) Appointments are bar none.  Flawless reliability, fit and finish.  KILLER sound system and back up camera is well appreciated.  Top up or top down it's definitely at the top of my automotive list.  Never go back to MB again.  Overall ownership experience is superior and I've owned them all.  Plus you don't see yourself coming and going all day in one.",4.875

14, on 07/01/16 09:09 AM (PDT),Charles Jones ,2015 Bentley Flying Spur Sedan V8 4dr Sedan AWD (4.0L 8cyl Turbo 8A),Fantastic!," The 2016 Flying Spur is absolutely perfect.  The interior quality and finish is second to none, as expected.  The thing that surprised me the most is how fun the car is to drive.  You cant hear a thing when driving in the cabin.  The ride is so smooth I didn't even notice I was going 100 mph until I looked down and the beautiful instrument cluster.  Purchasing a radar detector is certainly a good idea. This is a heavy car but it corners and handles like a dream.  Put it in sport mode and you actually have more power then you know what to do with. Took the car over a windy mountain pass and I was simply amazed at how well the car ate up the curves.  Coming from an S550 4matic there is really no comparison between the two.  Totally different driving experience in a good way.  Oh, and its also nice when passengers from other cars are taking pictures of the Flying Spur as you drive by.",5
15, on 12/12/15 19:15 PM (PST),Abe ,2015 Bentley Flying Spur Sedan V8 4dr Sedan AWD (4.0L 8cyl Turbo 8A),>2 minutes tin can," The review after 3 years with about 23,000 miles:I really did not have any problem with anything except with the display unit. It kept freezing and not responding to any touch/button unless the car is turned off and turned on again. They replaced it under warranty but I understand it would have been >$6K items if I had to pay. Other than this there has been no other issue. Car is still very nice to drive and feels as good as new. Of course there has been NO fix the to electronic performance that I mentioned below. It is pity for a car like this to have such terrible electronic performance. Cars with 1/10th the cost has better electronic performance. Apparently this was a known issue even on the previous models. Some body should have been fired over this!By the way, I have V8  Flying Spur not V12 as the heading says. I could not navigate to change it to V8.I have 2015 Bentley Flying Spur V8. This is how long it takes for it to load up the phone files and it takes almost 25 seconds for the rear camera to come on in the morning. When you go over the road divider rectangular reflectors it makes noises that makes you think you are driving ""PINTO"" It actually ""accelerates"" when you want to decelerate in cruise control mode before it decelerates. These are some of the features that Bentley calls ""normal"" It took repeated calls and days for the Bentley customer service manager to call me back. Other than some of these problems, it is a beautiful car, fun to drive, quality finishes all thru. Information system is actually pretty functional and intuitive but its performance sucks! It is a big car but it feels sporty and connected to the road. It would have been really a great car if it did not have these problems that Bentley calls normal.  I have about 6K miles on it so far and it had no mechanical problem.",4
16, on 12/28/16 14:47 PM (PST),Happy Mom ,2014 Bentley Flying Spur Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 8A),A Heavenly Ride!," I have driven many luxury cars, Mercedes, BMW, Maserati, Jaguar, to name a few, but this ride by far, is like no other! On a scale of 1-10 I give it a 12 in comfort and the same for it's impressive look. My only issue is that I'm a tech-lover and it seems to be that even this updated version (I previously owned a 2009) doesn't offer the same technology as, say the Maybach or even a simple Mercedes GL (which I had as a loaner car and appreciated the technology). So I'd say that's the only thing it lacks but otherwise it's one helluva machine!",4
17, on 10/07/16 16:45 PM (PDT),Guy Brady ,2005 Bentley Continental GT Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),You better have deep pockets," These are a great status car, you'll impress everbody that sees it. You can steal these cars second hand, but there is a reason for that. My suggestion is put $50k in your repair fund, you'll need it. For the same amount of money you can buy a Lexus 460 or a S550 Mercedes. Or even a 7 series BMW. Do yourself a favor, avoid the divorce.  When you see one at a unbelievable low price.

Love driving it, but I don't often because it lives in the shop. The 2005 has evil electrical gremlins! I got it in December 2014 with 14,800 miles. Two previous owners. First owner had it 8 years and managed to put only 4500 miles on it.  Second owner had it two years and put 9500 miles on it.  I put 4000 miles on it over about 2 1/2 months. Then it just died..literally.   the engine just shut down at a stop sign. Had to disconnect the battery cables to recycle the electrical system. I noticed on the service records that owner number one had a similar issue the first year of ownership.  I parked it for several months then drove it to my independent guy (where it died at a stop light 1/2 mile from the shop). All my sensor lights came on, Windows only rolled half way up. It was a mess. Been with my independent for 4 months  (he's good, but ridiculously slow). He believes it's a module board because he can hear relays clicking off and on in the battery compartment. Love the looks, head Turner of a car but seriously thinking about dumping it when I get it back. Too unreliable....",3

Cost of ownership is very expensive. I have spent over $70,000.00 since I bought the car new in 2005. The repair cost doesn't count the items that needed repaired that were under warranty. This is my first and last Bentley GT",1
21, on 03/23/09 08:16 AM (PDT),Bent ,2005 Bentley Continental GT Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),its great when it is not in the shop," The car handles great and has plenty of power. The interior could be a little better thought out, but only a minor issue. Reliability is a huge problem. There is an electrical bug somewhere in this car and the Bentley service has been poor at best. The car has been in the shop at least 5 times in the last year, and it is still not right. Dealing with the problems has taken all the fun out of this car.",3.625
22, on 08/25/06 18:52 PM (PDT),St. James Red ,2005 Bentley Continental GT Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),2005 Bentley Continental GT , I am a 60 year old maried businesman.  We also own a 2006 Jaguar VP and 2004 Mercedes S500.  I cannot drive this vehicle without someone giving me the thumbs up. This vehicle is the ultimate driving experience. ,5
23, on 07/14/06 04:50 AM (PDT),Overlord ,2005 Bentley Continental GT Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),Muscular torso in a Savile Row suit," I bought this car for the interior and it doesn't disappoint - except perhaps the plastic display surround.  The leather and wood is heavenly and reminds you of the English craftsmanship clothing the largely German dynamics.  The latter is reassuring, since I have had an unpleasant ownership experience with an old school Brit supercar, the Aston Virage.  The car is undeniably heavy, but the 4wd deals well with the power, and good drivers can push it further than you might suppose.  However, dynamically it would be outpaced through the bends by some of my other cars - Ferrari 550, 911 Turbo, Noble (small volume English rocket!)  Still, for elegant trundling, it beats any Merc, BMW or Audi.  ",4.5
24, on 06/18/06 08:09 AM (PDT),keith ,2005 Bentley Continental GT Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),A Quality Ride," After a Mercedes-Benz S55, the Bentley has restored my faith in expensive quality cars.  The driving experience is all that I expected and the quality of build inside and out is first rate.  Its performance is astonishing for such a heavy car but it translates to relatively poor mileage.  The stereo is great but sat/nav is fiddly to use and very basic in its features.  Servicing has been hassle free with all costs covered under the warranty and the dealership has taken care of any problems.  The rear seat accomodation is tight but if I wanted a 4 seater I would have got the sedan! All in all I am very satisfied with the car and it fulfilled all my expectations.  I highly recommended it.",4.875

26, on 12/25/05 07:22 AM (PST),AlanPMatthews ,2005 Bentley Continental GT Coupe 2dr Coupe (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),It doesn't get better than this, Behaving well at every speed I am constantly amazed that 80 mph in my 2005 Bentley Continental GT feels like 40 and 110 feels like 60. This car is effortless in just about everything it does.  It just keeps on delivering power.  The back seats are a bit of a squash for adults but the kids are fine in them.  The Turbo R feels like a real clunker now!,4.875

The performance is breathtaking. The finish work is superb. The interior is very usable. The back deat is far more usable than I expected, particularly for a 2-door. Even the GPS system is more usable than the Mercedes that I traded in. All in all I give it a near perfect score. Resale is excellent also.",5

I've owned every exotic and luxury car you can think of over the last 30 years, including a prior Bentkley Turbo R, which was a trash can that I dumped in 6 months.

While the Bentley GT does not have the, ""outer edge"",handling of some of the Ferriaris, Aston Martins and some other exotics, it is truly a high performance car, but without the harshness exhibited buy most of the other cars of it's breed. As for the over all handling, it should be more then adequate for 98 percent of the people out there that buy these kinds of cars.

It joins my other fine cars: Lamborghini Murcielago, Ferrari 360, Aston Martin Vanquish, Porche Carrera GT, Ferrari 612 Scaglietti, Maybach 57 (custom made), and Mercedes SLR, with the last been the best but at $600,000 it is hardly the car to go shopping with!

End of story. It is clearly the best luxury porformance car I have ever owned. The blend of styling, performance and engineering is unsurpassed!

After 3 months not satisfied. Engine is strong, but does not prove out to alleged specs that are reported. Porsche all models will give it a solid run to 60mph.

I'm a car nut, and the interior is gorgeous.  But the car is no fun to drive.  Visibility is terrible, drivetrain doesn't harness power smoothly, and dealer experience has been lousy.  By comparison, my 2004 Jaguar XJR is a delight to drive and a bargain-- at half the price, it's very fast, has MORE features, has never even required dealer service and handles with nimbleness the Bentley can't approach.  The Bentley is a stop-light ego builder, no doubt.

Other manufacturers now need to play catch up.  Bentley has been able to maintain the ""Bentley image"" with help from the Volkswagen/Audi infusion of capital. This car's engine wants to run, with tons of hp and torque. The leather inside is of the finest quality. This model's limited production should keep it a classic.

This car also has poor overall handling.  The engine is strong off the line and above 70 mph.  Its braking is no better than a Lincoln Navigator's.  The Continental GT is just too heavy.  If you are over 6 feet tall, forget about comfort.   Its quality has not met my expections, especially considering the fact that I had to wait a year for my ordered car to come in.

It may not be the fastest in acceleration or handle the best but it is an all around solid car that performs very well in all catagories.

Car was in great shape with 51,000 miles on it.  Paid $1,600 for Dealer to do maintenance of oil & filter change, and total review of car (more than a standard oil change at dealer, but did more as to changing out fluids, batteries in keys, etc. - was worth it to find out exactly what the car really needed)  Had about 10% left on Brakes. Replaced Brakes AND Tires (got them from Tire Rack) and went to independent mechanic to get things done (ABOUT HALF what Dealer would have charged)  The Trick with these cars is that you DON'T go to the Dealer - you go to good mechanic who knows Bentleys. Had an 1989 Bentley Eight for 20 years and traded it in for this one.  This car is SUPER fast and is comfortable. Better gas mileage than the 1989 BUT, you don't buy one for the Gas Mileage.  After putting on about 7,000 miles in a half-year, I would say it was a great buy.  No way could we afford a new one (total price w/tax about $240,000) but getting this car at $62,000 was a good deal. Oil Change is once every 10,000 (Synthetic oil, 14 quarts - YES 14)  It is a racing engine on a luxury platform. So much better than a Mercedes, BMW, or other High-end car. Repairs? So far just put on Brakes and Tires to insure we had solid traction.  Have had it up to 120MPH and it's like you are driving 55MPH.  I am surprised at some of the other negative comments. Maintenance is not bad if you DON""T go to the dealer.(and that is true on ANY car!!)  Find a good mechanic.  Join the Bentley Club and the Rolls-Royce Owners Club and you will get great tips in maintaining the car and not overpaying for service.  Bottom line - You're driving up in a high-performance Bentley and that makes everyone's Lexus, BMW, Mercedes, and Audi pale in comparison.  No one asks what year it is - it's a Bentley!UPDATE: At 61,000 miles on the car.  Great car that gets a lot of notice.  Had a sensor problem with the Parking Brake warning going on. Very minor replacement (sensor).  Looking forward to entering it into the Rolls-Royce Owners Club's Regional Concours.  Glad we bought it.  If you buy one - DRIVE IT.  Don't let it sit in the garage.  These cars were built to be driven hard.UPDATE:  At 62,300 miles on car.  Still great driving.  Had the air struts start losing pressure in the front. (this is the BIG repair that scares anyone from buying some of the exotics - not just Bentley, but high-end Mercedes and others as well). The air struts are like $2,800 apiece and the compressor is $1,100 PLUS installation at the dealer.  You're looking at about a $10-12K repair.  If you shop-around like I did, you can beat that price AND get quality parts (NEW - NOT refurbished) for a LOT LESS.   I bought a total kit for about $2,500 - BOTH Air Struts AND the Compressor. Even my mechanic said I got a steal on it.  I did not need to replace the compressor so I am saving that for the future but my total bill with installation was around $3100 (and I still have the new compressor in a box for the future).  That is  the way you can afford running a high-end exotic and not worrying about maintenance costs. That is the biggest repair on the car.  By a quality used car and learn how to be a  ""shopper"" and you can pull up in a true luxury performance car that originally cost $230,000 next to the guy who paid the same price for a mid-level, nothing spectacular  BMW new.UPDATE - Have had car for a little over 2 years now.

For not so much more than it's Audi sibling, the Bentley fit the bill. While it does have some electrical issues, none have been disabling.

True luxury that mass-produced BMW's and MB's can't begin to match (Mercedes had to come out with the Maybach line to even try).

My Arnage has not disappointed me in the least. The fit and finish are top notch. Gone are the days when my Arnage would have made me special. I now must see Continental GT's and Flying Spurs daily on the local streets. Now my Arnage just brings me joy because it is such a wonderful automobile. It's quick without being startling. It's refined and stately. In a world where S-Class Mercedes Benzes are as common as Fords, the Arnage insures that I will not only arrive in style but in an automobile that is not as everyday as some lesser automobiles.",4.875

I enjoy all aspects of the it.  It is a great conversation piece at gas stations, which I hit often with the 10 miles per gallon that the Arnage gets. Overall it is a great car.",4.625

I have longed for a Bent for a long time, and by the time this beauty came in, I was about to explode with anticipation. The second I turned the thing on, the engine almost made me wet my pants because of the roar that was produced. Every surface has wood and leather for miles and miles, and I could almost fall asleep behind the wheel, it's so comfortable.",5

149, on 08/02/15 17:00 PM (PDT),Mark ,2012 Bentley Continental Flying Spur Speed Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (6.0L 12cyl Turbo 6A),over rated car ?," I have had several high end cars, my main focus is 4 door luxury sedan, combined with performance, this is my 2nd flying spur, 1st one was a 2006 model, 25k miles, this car gave me a lot of problems, mainly confined to the info-tainement system, though a few major engine problems did occur.Luckily it was under warranty, good job because it cost 20k plus had the front struts replaced, i sold it within 2 years.I purchased a high end Mercedes AMG SUV, what a mistake, how i missed the bentleys serene ride,composed road manners, the overall feeling of luxury, and secure ride. I had to buy another, there are no words to describe how it feels, other cars just don't compare.The Bentley is a very simple car  , there is no lane departure, brake assist,forward cameras, in fact you feel short changed in that department, but it you will not miss them, the is a simple elegance the other cars don't have, or replicate.So i purchased the best i could, 2012 Speed, what an improvement on the 2006, much better car all round, more power, better seats, handling, just great.Buy warranty if you can, or good after market service repair, low miles,  good service records are essential, and then enjoy the best ride of you life, in a way i regret getting the car, as everything else seems boring, and mundane, for the price of a new Cadillac Escalade, a used one makes sense, my car was $240k when new 3 years ago, i saved $135K over new, what a bargain. You only live once, go for it.",5
