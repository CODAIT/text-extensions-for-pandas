1, on 06/03/18 21:39 PM (PDT),Ron Consiglio ,2018 Buick Envision SUV Essence 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Perception is not always reality," My Buick Envision is an excellent machine. It's major problem is perception. It is supposed to be a luxury SUV, but when most people think of a luxury SUV, they think Cadillac, Lincoln, Acura, BMW,Mercedes or other brands. When I was shopping for an SUV, I went to a GMC dealer looking for a Terrain. The dealer also sold Buicks. I Had never even heard of the Envision. The saleswoman showed a better equipped Envision for much less than the Terrain.  Test driving both vehicles,  I liked the Envision better. Not that the Terrain was bad, but the Buick was a better value, and here lies the problem. Someone looking for a Chevy, Ford or a Japanese or Korean SUV would not even think of a Buick, just like someone wanting a ""luxury "" SUV  would probably overlook a Buick. It seems that Buick SUVS are neither fish nor fowl. So if you are considering an SUV,  give Buick a look and see if there is more value there for you",5
2, on 06/08/18 06:19 AM (PDT),Anne ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium II 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Love this car - Great value," I reviewed all types of cars and once I set my sights on this one, I had to have it.  I have been driving it for only one month and I am not disappointed.  Love it!  I saved quite a bit by buying a previously owned Corporate Lease with only 12,000 miles.  Had to have it brought up from Naples.  Must have saved nearly $10K by buying slightly used.",5
3, on 05/28/18 08:02 AM (PDT),Eric ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Essence 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),The Essence!," I really like this little SUV / Crossover.  The dealer has let us use this vehicle while our car has been in the shop for the last 1.5 weeks and I'll be a bit sad to let it go.  I looks great on the outside and inside and I can fit my 6ft 3in 215lbs 50 year old frame into the very comfortable, heated, leather, drivers seat just fine with plenty of head room.  It's easy to get out of too and the roomy rear seat area is similar.  Our vehicle comes with heated rear seats and rear HVAC controls.  The interior is nicely equipped with faux wood highlights and panels, the dash knobs and buttons and the instrument cluster gauges seem to be well placed and the infotainment system works great other than sometimes it automatically connects to my iphone and other times it asks to connect.  This might be because the SUV is in demonstration mode... at least this is what the SUV tells me whenever I start it up.  I also like the auto open/close rear hatch.  I can adjust it so it only opens 3/4 or fully.  With it set at 3/4 I can open it in my garage.  It drives very nicely and comfortably and I have good visibility other than the front window posts are a bit thick which looks nice but sometimes can hide an approaching car.  The vehicle is punchy and takes off well when I hit the throttle hard but it obviously doesn't have the 300hp my sedan has.  It brakes well and holds a line well while accelerating, cruising and braking.  It also has the auto start feature.  It's kind of weird coming to a stop at a stop light and feeling the engine stop.  It starts right up quickly so really no complaints there, I just wish it would wait a bit longer before shutting down.  Overall, I really really like this SUV.  It's comfortable, handles nicely, has plenty of comfort features, quiet and seems well made.  That being said, there's only 5k miles on it and I've only had it for a week and a half.",5

7, on 03/21/18 19:34 PM (PDT),Donna Allen ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium II 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),No CD player," I purchased  a Buick Envision a little over a year ago.  I discovered shortly after completing my purchase that my new car did not have a CD player.  While I love my Envision, the fact that I do not have a CD player has plagued me for the last year.  I have downloaded to a flash drive and it is just not the same as having control over my what I want to listen to. I even went to Best Buy today to see if they had a cd/mp3player that would work in my car.  They don’t.  Bottom line.  I WOULD NEVER HAVE BOUGHT THIS VEHICLE HAD I KNOWN THAT I DID NOT HAVE A CD PLAYER.   I Guess it’s back to BMW for me.",1

Wow! I love everything about it!  What is vey important to me is the visual views from inside a car. One must be able to see all around you. It has the blind spot indicators as well as the back up camera. The one thing this car could improve would be, to be the premier package, WHICH HAS EVEN MORE SAFERY SENSORS!  I love driving this Buick.",5

Drive almost any other midsize suv after driving the Envision, and you will really notice the difference. One of the only vehicles, where the engine is not directly mounted to the frame. Very little vibration, quiet, smooth ride for a midsize suv. Handling and braking is great! We leased the Premium 1 with the Turbo. Very lineal torque curve, not a lot of down shifting on the highway. Smooth 6 speed, and no engine noise except when you accelerate. Interior fit and finish is excellent. Highway mileage was 26 mpg on our first highway trip. If the start stop feature bothers you, just shift it into ""L"" and click it to 6. It will cancel out the stop start feature. Very happy with this selection.",5

I have asked the dealer to disable this feature, but was unwilling to do so. Other than these two items, it is a nice, smooth, quiet car.",3

17, on 07/29/17 20:06 PM (PDT),M Berry ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium I 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great Car with one BIG bug, UPDATE. Now I'm getting a bad smell from the AC ever time I start the car. Went to the dealer and they said to spray AC fresh in to intake duct. What a crop or crap. We only have 8000 miles on the car....This is my last buick....... I would give the car 5 stars on everything if it didn't come with one GREAT BIG BUG. Every time you come to a stop the engine stalls and dies. Now there is nothing wrong with the engine because someone at buick though it would be a good idea to shut the engine down every time you come to a stop. They need to kick that guy to the curb. If you test drive the car when it's very hot the AC will keep the engine running when you stop but when the heat lets up the car thinks you only need AC when your moving the darn thing stops running every time you stop. On some GM cars they put a button in so you could deactivate this annoying feature. I realy do think the owner should have the option to take the car in and have the dealer reprogram the computer to deactivate the ENGINE AUTO STOP. If I had knew about this when I test drove the car I would have never bought it. It reminds of my younger days when I had to drive junkers and every time I pulled up to the red light the car would die. Hated it then and realy hate in even more now with a $46000.00 car. BEWARE,3
18, on 07/21/17 12:15 PM (PDT),Clyde Rodgers ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium II 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Hot Buick SUV, This SUV with Turbo and All Wheel Drive is almost as much fun to drive as my 2015 Regal GS. Handles superb for a 3000 pound plus SUV. This is very nicely appointed vehicle. I like the hands free tailgate operation for when your arms are full of packages or what ever. This vehicle is very quiet at highway speeds. The Bose stereo system is outstanding.,5
19, on 07/07/17 19:26 PM (PDT),Rmw ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium I 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Almost Great," Electronics, nav, etc controlled mostly with touch screen. I'd like to have more functions controlled on the steering wheel.  Rear cargo area will not fit golf clubs transversely.  Integration with phones, IOS and Android is excellent, but everything must be controlled via the touchscreen, and this requires taking ones eyes off the road, not too  much different than texting.  The control pad on the right side of the steering wheel controls information screens on the center of the dash, such as gas mileage, next oil change etc.  All of these could be controlled by another means, and the control pad on the steering wheel used to control functions on the touchscreen.  I believe this is a serious flaw in design, and is as dangerous as texting while driving.",4
20, on 06/05/17 09:27 AM (PDT),Darrel Kirk ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium II 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Vaarrrooommm," Was upgrading from a GMC Terrain SLT 2, Narrowed my choices to Mercedes GLA and Buick Envision Premium II Turbo.  Bought the Envision because overall a better choice.  All the Bells and Whistles, this CUV is amazing. A lot of people complain about the shaking while stopped or starting, this is normal. You have to change your driving habits to get used to the auto-stop feature, it's easy once you adapt to it.  Will give another review 6 months after the winter is over.",5
21, on 05/06/17 12:55 PM (PDT),Leland ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Preferred 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Great Value for the features included," I recently purchased the Envision with the Preferred Package. I was looking for a mid-size SUV to go along with the small SUV I purchased a few months ago. The dealership I went to had over $12, 300 in incentives. With my trade in, I was able to upgrade from a 2014 Lincoln MKZ to the Envision. The technology available is the best I've ever had with a vehicle. The ride is classic Buick, smooth and comfortable. I would recommend to anyone considering a mid-size SUV.",5
22, on 05/06/17 11:53 AM (PDT),Dissappointed Owner ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Preferred 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Last Buick EVER!," Traded an 2015 Encore for the slightly larger 2017 Envision. Loved the Encore's quietness, shifting and general driveability. The Envision has more engine noise, transmission shifts like a 60's powerglide and the autostop is a horrible addition to any car. The little vibration it makes when it starts up is really annoying. Making a left turn from the middle of a busy intersection is very scary when the engine cuts off and you have to hope it restarts. I doubt this car will make it two years in my garage and I seriously doubt that another Buick will ever be in my garage and by the way, I've had at least 3 or 4 previously. Still HATE the auto stop but found that if you shift to L and then use the manual shift button to shift up to 6 then the transmission upshifts and downshifts like any other transmission and the auto stop feature does not work. Worst Buick ever for road noise.",3
23, on 04/23/17 06:13 AM (PDT),Steve ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Essence 4dr SUV (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Apple CarPlay A REAL Plus," I traded-in my Lexus NX ... loved the performance ... but CarPlay was not available with aftermarket radios or in a new Lexus (but hear it is ‘coming soon’ to at least some models).  Having CarPlay in the Buick has already (in just the first 2 days) saved on highway toll charges and got me quickly to my destination in a new development 30 miles from home.  I would have eventually gotten to the same location but it would have been a LOT harder to find with the built-in navigation.  The Buick handling, ride and performance -- comparable to the NX ... has been terrific.  Drove it from VA to FL for a 45 day vacation.  Performance was excellent and gas mileage on the long stretches was amazing.  Coming back I was getting 540 mile range after a fill-up vas normally 410-430 city driving.",5

26, on 04/10/17 18:24 PM (PDT),neal fondren ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium I 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Nothing BUT Problems," We acquired the vehicle in late November of 2016. Looked great. Since then, it's been in and out of the dealership for everything from a noise that is blatantly obvious that comes from somewhere near the gas tank that comes in at certain speeds and has been in for 3 times to try to cure, to a failed operating system. By the way--apparently it takes 7-10 days to get a part for the automobile. If I had to do over, I wouldn't buy that car. For the same money, go buy a Mercedes.",2
27, on 03/30/17 08:26 AM (PDT),TomW ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium I 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Sold vehicle after 3 months - Issues," As another reviewer noted, the vehicle has a shake when accelerating from a stop.   It is usually not experienced in a slow/mild acceleration.  But, when turning or straight acceleration on an incline, there is a noticeable shake/shudder while in 1st gear.  The harder the acceleration,  the more severe the shake.  I've even paid to have my local tire store check the tires and balance.  This should not be in a vehicle of this class and price point.  I hope Buick identifies the source of this issue and gets a fix in dealers hands, and proactively notifies owners, before more reviews make note of this apparent defect.  Once you are moving, the Envision's ride and handling is exceptional, quiet and smooth.  For such a soft ride, it is very responsive and does not have cornering body roll.   I love the interior design and materials,  but would prefer slightly softer seats.  The safety features are nice.  I personally do not like the Lane Departure feature and have turned it off.  You find yourself constantly fighting the steering wheel.  The stop/start feature is ok.  But, it should have a couple second delay.  When making parking maneuvers, the engine cuts off on you ... this should have been thought out a bit better.  Overall, it is a nice vehicle at a reasonable price point, but has a few quirks that you should think about.UPDATE:  I sold the vehicle after 3 months.  I just couldn't stand the engine stop/start feature.  Also, the shaking that I, and others, have mentioned was unresolved by two dealers.  They both said that it is common for the Envision.",3
28, on 12/19/16 10:33 AM (PST),Paul ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Essence 4dr SUV AWD (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Best Bang for Your Buck$$$, I have owned other mid-size and smaller SUV's and this one is as good or better than those that cost almost twice as much. I made riding in my Rav4 or CRV seem like I was in a tractor. Typical smooth Buick ride with all the techno upgrades. We have 3 smaller grandchildren and we all love it!!!,5
29, on 12/18/16 15:58 PM (PST),Jack ,2017 Buick Envision SUV Premium II 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Shake&Bake," We have had the car for four months. Car shakes badly when taking off and even worse if you are turning left or right from a stop. The back up monitor is the worst I have every seen, can not see anything at all at dusk or dawn, exhaust has a bad rattle and the heater motor sounds terrible. All this is normal according to the dealer Thompson of Springfield Mo. nothing fixed",2
30, on 01/29/18 15:41 PM (PST),Gary ,2016 Buick Envision SUV Premium I 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),How much more do you need?," I am 75 years old. I have had 6 Buick’s, as well as many other brands over the years.All of the Buick’s have had all the options available at the time. This care outshines the others cars by a lot. Have owned the car now 20 months. Have not had a single problem at all. I have the premium 1 model no moonroof. Sticker price 43k. This car was cheaper than the Audi with almost all of the same options. The stop start is not a bother at all. The engine restart in less than a second after your foot off the brake. Merging power and highway passing acceleration is more than enough. Cruising at 75 mph is no strain. The best thing of all is how quiet the interior is. There are active white noise speaker on the base of the exit handles on the ceiling. They nullify almost all of the road noise at ear level. Seats are comfortable. All controls easy to reach. Front and side vision better than the Audi. Gas mileage is dead on to what Buick says.",5

GM Senior Advisor was assigned to my case bu would not answer my phone call or return them. Finally after several attempts to get some answers on getting this problem resolved I had an attorney write a letter to GM stating my states lemon law. Within 2 days my ""Senior Advisor"" found my email address and sent me an update on my case. Only stating that because I involved legal console that she could no longer assist me. Well she haven't been assisting with anything to that point so I'm not sure what changed. Now at 45 days out of service I continue to wait with no other feedback on a resolution.",4

It is now August 10th and we still do not have our car. They cannot get parts and GM has been of NO help. I would NOT buy this car again, nor would I tell anyone to buy this car.

I love the freebies when it is 20°F out otherwise I be in thr unheated garage doing it myself.  I love the heated steering wheel as it get very warm.  The heated seats are appreciated by all four of us and thr heated mirrors work great too.  The AWD is perfect on the white stuff and seldom slips unless you want to punch the throttle. With 3,000  miles on our 2016 Envision Prem ll, we picked up used in the mid-$30's,  the moonroof and Driver Confidence Package are quite the deal compared to the more expensive German car companies.  My in-laws are quite smitten with the Envision overall and are considering one for their next purchase. I searched new/used 2.0l turbo for months as it has AWD and torque vectoring included. The 2017 Prem ll discounted was capped my lower models starting at $35K.  So our 2016 Prem ll GM executive driven with 3,000 miles in the next state over was lightly driven with no excessive tire wear, so I know it was not used for closed course driving events.  New 2016 with no options were popping up for $10K off or $33K but I did not want white or silver, so it pays to shop with discounts like that and spend a few hundred to have it shipped.  Currently getting 25 mpg on my half city/highway commute now that it is warming up.

I can't imagine how an engineer figured out how to combine a church pew, high school bleecher, and a cheap 1970's lawn chair, but they succeeded. And I don't think the Buick designers ever encountered a switch or knob they didn't like, or wanted to use. The adjectives I would use to describe this car are: squirley, buisy, jittery,. I would opt for a nicely equiped, low mileage pre-owned AWD wagon, maybe a Volvo.",2

The remote start from remote or OnStar app worked like a charm as the car is running when I walk up to it and can take off as soon as I enter.

Next up...wintertime driving. 9,000 miles now.Coming from a 2013 and 2014 Cadillac, both of which I still have, the Buick is refreshingly solid and comforting in both riding and driving.  We got a used 2016 Premium ll with roof and Driver Confidence.  Plenty of head room with the sun roof in all seating positions.  The Adaptive Cruise Control along with the self parking feature and lane assist are really neat features. The parking is neat show off feature that this car is very easy to park and see out of.  The lane assist will have you bouncing off each side of the lane for miles, which is a little scary at first.  The ride quality is refined compared to the stiffer, performance oriented Cadillac.   The handling does not take a back seat to the softer suspension that this tracks and takes input better than a rental 2017 Escape we drove 6 hours to pick up the Buick.",5

It is the poster child for technology gone amok! The ""start/stop"" is awful! I leased  weather was torrid (90+ every day). It ""shut"" down every time I stopped. The air conditioning stops working and it makes a clunking sound when the engine re-starts. Since the weather has become cold, the start/stop doesn't kick in any more? I enquired at the dealership if this ""feature"" could be shut off which they didn't know which is typical for them. The backlighting on the dashboard and media panels automatically adjusts to changes in the exterior light but doesn't work properly and will dim so much that they are unreadable. This ""feature"" can not be turned off and per the dealership this is a complaint of many owners but Buick does nothing about it. Gas mileage is awful at approx. 18 mpg combined city/highway and I drive conservatively. My previous car was a Buick Verano and I loved it but this vehicle was twice as expensive and I hate it.

We never agree on what to look for in a car. When I went to look at what she was leasing, I was so blown away by the features and quality of the vehicle, 1 week later, I leased one myself! We are a 2 Envision household! The lease value was also a very convincing factor. The monthly  lease cost was similar to vehicles with an MSRP $10,000 less than the Envision.

This car has far exceeded my expectations and in my opinion is going to be a serious competitor in the luxury compact SUV market.  The turbo engine is powerful and fun to drive.  Loving the interior design and the technology is top notch.  The quality inside and out is also top of the line.  The lane departure assist and all the other safety features are way above the competition especially for the price point.  Buick continues to impress!! Definitely worth a test drive if in the market for a new compact SUV!",5

We've leased an Acadia for over 6 years and our youngest just left for college SO our full size SUV needs changed.   We were seriously considering a full size sedan ( Buick Lacrosse or Toyota Avalon) BUT our salesman encouraged us to just take a look at the Envision.  We wanted the moon roof and the navigation upgrade.  This has a great ride and is fun to drive.  It's true we have just taken possession but it fits everything we could ask for in a luxury SUV.,5

With the panoramic room, the 49k msrp may look steep.  But if you're shopping for a medium-sized luxury SUV/CUV, it's unbeatable for what you get.  We shopped for Suv/Cuv vehicles in its size range that met our requirements of having full-range acc, blis/cross-traffic, and ventilated or cooled seats.  That eliminated Audi & BMW because you can't get one equipped that way.  And ran a similarly equipped GLC300 up to over 55k.    Compared to the NX, GLC and Discovery Sport, we found:  Actually Cooled seats (also on the Discovery), rear seat climate controls, auto-dimming outside mirrors, rain sense wipers that can automatically turn on headlights (which is required in some states; also on Discovery Sport), head-up display (also on NX, $995 on GLC, part of $1800 package on Discovery Sport), passive locking, tire monitor shows actual tire pressures, blind spot detection includes turn signal warning (also on GLC) and closing-vehicle detection (also on Discovery Sport).

45, on 07/21/16 08:37 AM (PDT),-M.B. ,2016 Buick Envision SUV Premium I 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),The Crossover with class - Envision," Great luxurious crossover- The vehicle is priced appropriately when compared to other luxury crossovers. Do your homework you will see for yourself. I had test drove the Acura RDX prior to the Envision and found the RDX road height to be a bit low with a very hard ride, stiff sport suspension, not sure if that is ever needed in a crossover/small SUV. So I took a look at the Envision while looking at a Buick/GMC dealer. This Envision fits a void in the Buck SUV lineup. The Enclave is fairly large while the Encore is well yeah, kind of small. I was very impressed by the quiet smooth ride of the Envision along with the interior and exterior styling. On the interior the first thing i noticed was the all digital instrument panel, which makes it feel that much nicer. The interior trim is fitted with leather, i went with black since it is a lease and has a less chance of showing marks even though the beige is beautiful too. The dashboard is also covered in leather this is a nice touch over a plastic one most vehicles have. The front seats seem a little stiffer than i would expect but the heated leather wrapped steering wheel make up for this minor issue. Rear seating is comfortable with separate controlled ventilation for rear passengers. The rear seats can recline ever so slightly and have the ability to glide forward to make more room for cargo in the back. Interior lighting is very well placed with accent lighting on the floor and very eloquently placed lighting on the door panels and front face of dashboard. This looks very nice at night. Exterior lights look very nice with the daytime running LED's on the front and HID headlights and fog lights. Power lift gate is very convenient for loading and unloading. Now the real good part, the power that comes out of that little 4-cyl. is very impressive. I live in Colorado - high elevation and the vehicle has no problem with the thin air and  steep roads. The turbo on the 4-cyl works wonderfully. Lag is in the seconds, like 1-2 maybe. Collision avoidance and lane keeping assist work wonderfully as well. Hard to talk to the reliability right now but so far so good. Really the only downside (reason for not giving this 5 stars) is knowing it is being built in China. Hopefully Buick brings the assembly line for US sold vehicles to the US someday, I guess it is nice to know your employing Americans with your American brand vehicle.",4

I have owned the car for 18 months now and am very happy with my choice. but the warranty is great and have owned other Buicks with no problems. I love the way the dash is lower so that the visibility out front is outstandingly clear.  The car is very nimble and the steering is better than my previous Buick Enclave. Plenty of punch with this turbo engine, in fact it hardly acts as a four cylinder engine. The technology is greatly upgraded from my previous 2015 Enclave. Extremelythis size is right for us. The interior is of high quality material and well put together as you would expect of a Buick.  If I would find anything on the negative side, it would be the price. The price is too close to the larger Enclave and I expected it to be less, but the intro price was compensated to be fair. After 18 months, this is all still true of this vehicle. We love our Envision.",5
47, on 11/24/15 16:17 PM (PST),Michele ,1997 Buick Skylark Sedan Custom 4dr Sedan,97 Candy," I was recently involved in a pretty serious car accident in my 2009 compact car which was a total loss. My insurance co gave me a good replacement check but financially I can't get involved in another car payment. So my Father saw this Buick Skylark Limited Edition for sale for under 4100.00 (not including taxes and fees of course) with only 64,000 + miles. We went to look at it and it was apparent the other owners took very good care of this car. Mechanically and otherwise. The minuet I sat in the drivers seat I was hooked and knew this was my new honey. The acceleration is fantastic, the ride is smooth, the tape deck still works and there is absolutely nothing mechanically wrong with this car. I get great gas mileage. I drive over 100 miles a day and only need to fill the tank once a week (if I can keep my foot out of the petal). I have only had her a few weeks but I do notice the power windows are a little slow and the seat belts are not the greatest design. But as far as feeling safe I am very happy with this car. My parents always owned Buick's when I was a child so I feel as if I am driving a piece of my childhood history and I just love that nostalgic feeling. This car ROCKS!",5

After she died I got the car and it is a great little car in perfect shape and reliable--until now. The water pump went and I found out that it takes hours to get to the pump and it costs $$$--$750.00 to replace it-- and a gasket too. Why did Buick design an engine that would be so hard to get to a water pump. The mechanic suggested that as long as you are paying for the cost of labor to get to the water pump you should have several other somewhat related items fixed as well. I called the dealer to verify the extent in reaching the water pump and they verified this issue. Not good.",3.625

99, on 05/21/16 12:17 PM (PDT),Elwyn Davis ,2015 Buick Enclave SUV Premium Group 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Update after almost 2 years of ownership," Here is an update prompted by Edmunds after 2 years and 10 months of ownership with about 46,000 miles on our 2015 Buick Enclave.    We have not had any problems with this automobile at all in this time and over these miles.   Unfortunately, we now have a more comfortable ride in addition to the Enclave, a 2017 Buick Lacrosse.   However, that doesn't mean the Enclave is less comfortable than it was.  I wrote a review of our 2015 Buick Enclave after 22,000 miles.  It was our second Enclave, and it won't be our last.  I was prompted by Edmunds to write an update.  I wouldn't change a thing from my previous totally supportive review, other than like a fine musical instrument, it seems to be getting better with age.  We are getting slightly better highway mileage than we did with our 2008, often getting 22-24 mi per gal, and we have the all wheel drive.  It is a comfortable on trips as any automobile in which I have ever ridden.   Around town it absorbs bumps and pot holes very well.  There has been plenty of room for any use we have found.  It has the same interior space as our 2008, which we used for a week's vacation in Colorado for a week carrying 4 adults and 2 grandsons and all of the stuff we 6 people needed.  My only suggestion to Buick would be to bring some of the technology features more up to date in refreshes of this wonderful vehicle, such as keyless entry, push button start, and power sun shade with 2nd row seat sun roof.  But these are picky little things, far outweighed with the delightful driving experience and usefulness of the vehicle.  With the 2008 and 2015 we now have over 130,000 trouble free miles of driving.  If you are interested in a near luxury, super comfortable and reliable, spacious people hauler you should seriously consider the Buick Enclave.",5

Why would they only put cup holders in door of second row.  Everyone knows cups don't work in door cup holders.   To lay third row seats down you have to move second row of seats forward.

103, on 11/24/15 07:40 AM (PST),Paul Horvick ,2015 Buick Enclave SUV Leather Group 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Third Impressions," This is my third posting.  We recently completed a 4987.5 mile trip with the Enclave, from Arizona, to South Carolina, to Florida and back to Arizona.  I now have more extended time in the car, and can fine tune my thoughts.The good news is that, on the road travelling, the car is superbly easy to drive, very nice ride, and a feeling of safety and substance.  Gas mileage on the highway was also very good, with an overall 26.5MPG for the trip.  All worked well, comfort was very nice.The sound system is excellent. The BOSE system and radio was superb.  When you also have a very quiet interior even at highway speeds, this was an easy car to be in and drive.  The lane deviation system is a very nice feature, particularly useful on the highway.  The blind spot warning is also a great feature, particularly when side and rear vision is less than ideal.  The forward collision warning system was not in play, but seems like it would be a good feature.  The ride, on the highway, is controlled, serene and quiet.  (Unlike city driving, where the ride was harsh...feeling every road imperfection.)The navigation system is not particularly intuitive (although when set correctly it was helpful).  One very annoying thing is that when our iPhone 6+ was connected via USB, the radio automatically defaults to the music on the iPhone and you must manually go thru the menu to get back to what was on the radio.Front seats are comfy, supportive and good for a long ride.  The automatic return to a seat setting was very nice, as were the heated seats and heated steering wheel.  Cruise control worked fine, but more than once I inadvertently turned on the heat to the steering wheel rather than engage cruise control.  As noted in an earlier post, the middle row of seats is a joke.  Compared to our Sienna van, the seats were uncomfortable even for people that are well under 6' tall.I really want to like the car.  It is good looking, cruises well, and gets good MPG on the highway,  But....the ride is harsh in town, about 15MPG in town, and the lines of sight in the rear and sides are awkward, more so in town driving.  The rear seat comfort also is very poor for a car in this price category.We bought at the end of the 2015 model cycle; it had an MSRP of $47K, and we paid just over $37K.  Buick also has a fairly decent reliability rating, and the 48mo warranty is a plus.  Lots of good things about the car....a few that are poor.  But, if the rear seat is not a concern, and perhaps without the towing package the city ride would improve, it is a safe and good looking car.",4
104, on 11/01/15 07:12 AM (PST),Does it matter? ,2015 Buick Enclave SUV Premium Group 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Quiet and smooth," Bought a fully loaded model in September of 2015. I'm fairly tall and leg room was a big concern for me, so my options were somewhat limited. We wanted a mid-sized SUV but ended up with a large SUV because we liked the comfortable seating so much.The ride is great! It is exceptionally quiet and smooth. You can spread out and make yourself comfortable. The engine is a bit undersized but I don't push it so it works fine. There aren't enough cup holders up front for such a big car, my old Toyota Seqouia (sp?) had about 100. And the space for storing stuff isn't all that good. I added an aftermarket cell phone holder which really helped. We charge our phones from the back USB ports to save on clutter. The interior looks luxurious. The AC seats rock, but I wish they were stronger. My biggest complaint is the driver side seat has something that pokes me in the thigh and is uncomfortable - I plan on addressing this at my first (complimentary) servicing. The sun roof is small but doesn't blow you away when open so I ride with it open almost everyday.Mileage is terrible. I drive in So Cal traffic everyday and knew this before buying it from other reviews. The infotainment system is pretty good, but the favorites could be a little easier to work with. The navigation system is a joke. Voice control is non-existent even after taking it to the dealer to get it fixed. Not the biggest issue because I trust my cell phone navigation more anyway. Swapping from my phone to my wife's phone via Bluetooth is easy. I plan on not renewing the satellite radio because I can get everything I need from my cell phone at a fraction of the cost. The Bose stereo system is fantastic - makes me wish I listened to louder music. Needs to have a push button start; it has everything else, I'm can't believe they left this out. The remote start is a nice feature.Safety features like blind spot detection and front collision warning are extremely helpful. The rear backup camera is very helpful, but I have seen clearer cameras on other vehicles.Tons of space on the inside! More storage than we commonly use. Suggestion: if/when you buy this car make sure you speak with a knowledgeable salesperson who can show you the features.I would buy this car again.",5
105, on 09/15/15 11:02 AM (PDT),Tony M ,2015 Buick Enclave SUV Convenience Group 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),My wife loves it but it has issues," This is our second Enclave. As with the first, a strut needed to be replaced before 20k miles (both needed front right strut?), and as with the first one continuous transmission slippage between 2nd and 3rd gears. My second one also has motor-mounts that need to be replaced (31k miles on it)! It is currently in the shop where they are replacing the motor-mounts and have replicated and are trouble shooting the transmission slippage. They are most likely design/quality issues. I work with an exceptional dealership (Carl Black in Atl), and they have been the difference between me walking away from Buick vs. ""Sticking it out"" as they work out the kinks.",3
106, on 09/13/15 11:32 AM (PDT),Gross ,2015 Buick Enclave SUV Premium Group 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Our 2nd Enclave," We had a 2009 Enclave for 6 years, made over 70k miles driving around town and family trips, never had any issues, travelled even long 12 hour trips comfortably, no backpain or soarness, nor excessive exhaustion. We shoped around but always came back to the Enclave. In the end were between waiting for the new generation or going for a new current version. In the end because of the many upgrades done to the current version and finding the exact vehicle we wanted, along with the attractive incentives, we decided to go for it. We absolutely love the ride, the suspension is a little better, the shifting became a little smoother, overall all the improvements, new facia and dashboard along with the color combination and better sound system are just great.We are very pleased with the vehicle and looking forward to enjoy many family trips in years to come. The only complain is GM cutting back on the warranty, which I can't understand on a matured product other than cost cut for increased profitability. If you are looking for a full size family vehicle with lots of space and a firm ride, yes I drive sporty, this SUV pulls it together. Surelly there are other more sporty driving SUVs out there but perhaps not as spacious, quite, and comfortable.",5

This SUV drives like a dream, great acceleration and it is very sporty on the highway.  I don't have to let off the gas much going into curves.  And what a nice surprise on gas mileage.  Averaging 23 mpg on the highway and 21 in town.  Electronics work well.  A few bugs but not enough to get into a twit about.  Great sound.  I got a towing package and plan on getting a small travel trailer to do some weekend trips.  I am completely satisfied with this car.

108, on 09/06/15 06:40 AM (PDT),Paul Horvick ,2015 Buick Enclave SUV Leather Group 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Second Impressions," I wrote the earlier review shortly after we took delivery of the vehicle. It was (and is) a solid vehicle. But...I am downgrading our 5 stars to 3.  We apparently did not do a great job in test driving it.  In addition to the less than smooth ride noted earlier, the middle row of seats are, for most adults, very cramped and uncomfortable. My wife, about 5'6"", complains that the leg room is really tight when the front seats are all the way back.  I tried it also (I am 5'10"") and would never want to ride in the middle row.  (Yes, we had the middle row moved back as far as we could).  So, couple the relatively harsh ride, the inadequate middle row seating for adults, then this becomes just an average vehicle...one that had we done better due diligence, we would not have purchased.  Yes, good looking, quiet, nice technology, ...a solid feeling car....but one that, in hindsight, we should not have purchased.  Before buying, do a better job of test driving than we did!",3
109, on 08/21/15 07:46 AM (PDT),Paul Horvick ,2015 Buick Enclave SUV Leather Group 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Early First Impressions," We spent some time looking to replace our 2011 Toyota Sienna.  Looked at the Toyota Highlander, new Honda Pilot and the Enclave.  Because of a bad back, getting in and out of a car that has a high floor lip, or low ceiling is hurtful.  The Enclave is a perfect size for ingress and egress with no back strain.  In fact, the seats are marginally higher than those on the Sienna (and we loved the Sienna).The car was delivered with radio issues; it would not accept the signal from Sirius/XM to put it into subscription mode. A neighbor also just got a new Enclave and had the same issue. I am sure it will be resolved, but it does speak to the necessity of having a good warranty that covers the electronics (and, at 48 month warranty, it is excellent.)Steering is heavier than I would have thought; not really an issue, just an observation.  The interior is quite plush and upscale; quiet.  Kind of the old school luxury feel.Many consumer reviews comment on how comfortable it is on the go.  I would say that is a matter of opinion.  Our Sienna rode much better and was much less truck-like.  Even in town, you notice every bump.  Granted it is a soft bump, but somewhat disappointing compared to the Sienna.Controls, although there are many due to the sophisticated technology, are pretty intuitive.Sight lines forward are great; rear mirror vision is less than the Sienna due to rear headrests etc.  Passenger side sight line is poor.  The ""blind spot"" warning system is nearly a must have option.One odd thing, and it is a negative in my view, is that there is nothing stopping anyone from opening the gas cap.  I would have assumed that at least some basic security would be in place, but nope...just push the cover and it pops open.  Easy for sure, one less thing to go wrong I suppose, but I like the security of an in-cabin release.Resale value of the unit is (based upon a cursory review) rather typical of American vehicles. However, if you buy at the end of the model year, there are big discounts to be had.  Ours had an MSRP of over $48000, and the cash price was $37000, and that puts the later resale in a much more competitive mode.It is a good looking SUV, and comes in a nice range of rich looking colors and interiors.  We have the dark brown, and it is very rich looking.Time will tell if we made a good choice with the Enclave. As much as I want to love it, I am disappointed by the harshness of the ride.  I won't downgrade the review for that, because it is so subjective. But, if you are expecting a cloud like ride....it is not there.",5

Being we are moving to the mountains of North Carolina, was not sure how many more of the 6 to 8% mountain grades the Terazza was going to be able to take.  Purchased the Enclave new and have currently made 2 trips back and forth to the mountains, each time filling the cargo area full.  While on the flatland from Illinois to Kentucky, kept it in FWD and upon hitting the mountains, put it into AWD and turn on towing mode.  This works great for keeping the brakes from over heating when going down an 8% mountain grade.  Last trip, which we just completed, averaged out to 27.5 MPG, for full trip.  High we achieved was 34.9 MPG, while basically coasting down the mountains with towing mode on.

The good thing is its still under warranty and not costing me anything except time and aggravation (and Uber to get home from the dealer since they didn't have a loaner for me). This is my 1st American car in over 20 yrs and I bought it due to the increasing reputation of American made cars and Buick in particular. I am beginning to think I made a mistake since my car is only 8 months old and I am already having a problem. I am still optimistic and hopeful that this is not the norm and it will be my last problem for a while. Otherwise, I have to admit, I love the car and hope this repair issue is only a fluke and not what I should be expecting in the future.",4
114, on 06/30/18 05:51 AM (PDT),Bob Janik ,2018 Buick Enclave SUV Avenir 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),A couple minor things Buick missed," We leased a the Buick Avenir about a month ago and there are a few things that Buick missed. 1. Rain sensing wipers. On a 60K car, you’d think this would be available but it’s not even offered. I have them on my 2017 Dodge Durango Citadeland it’s a great convenience.2. Pre sets for driver power seats. Most cars have a button 1 and button 2 and the Enclave does. Issue is, you can’t just press the button like most cars, but you have to hold the button down until the seats gets to your programmed position. My wife is 5’-4” and I’m 6’-2” so it takes 15-20 seconds of me standing and holding the button until my seats go back to their pre set position3. Driver seat is too narrow. I read a couple reviews that complained about it and I have to agree. If you’re over 200 pounds, it will be tight. ",4
115, on 06/13/18 08:57 AM (PDT),Peter ,2018 Buick Enclave SUV Avenir 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Disappointed," Now after having the Enclave for a month Ive found some things that are very disappointing and some where I think I was mislead and some because I didnt dig deep enough. First, no auto sensing wind shield wipers as rain on and off on a road trip and very annoying to have to turn them on and off. My Lincoln and Acura had these as standard which I would expect on a car costing over 60,000. On this recent trip I found it necessary to call Onstar with questions on some of the things I didn’t understand and found they were totally knowledgeable as multiple times they put me on hold or transferred me to advisers who had to go to the manual to answer my question. Now, the biggie and the reason I would never have bought this care is the Nav and Info system. They pride themselves on having blue tooth connection in the car and was told you could connect 10 devices. A call to Onstar took that down to 5 so another misleading statement. So whats the most important device I want connected to the blue tooth, my cell phone of course. Now I understand you can only use one device at a time, however, if you're cruising along at 75 mph on the highway and you are listening or using another device other than the phone and you get a call it will not be answer through the cars system meaning you have to physically answer the phone which is not only dangerous but against the law here in Ca. Must say I had a Lincoln MDX and an Acura MKX and both paused the device being used and the call transferred to the car. Buick has been most unhelpful here. Thus connecting 5 or 10 devices through Bluetooth on your car real is useless and switching between one or the other is extremely difficult. Their answer is, if your using a Kindle or Ipad is to hard connect it through the head phone connection in the car meaning that all that wireless connectivity that they advertise is a bit of BS meaning you now have to deal with a hard wire. Buicks answer to this is put all the info you might use on your cell phone. Yes I was told that to my by one of the Onstar adviser. Really! again meaning they admit the 10 devices I was originally told I could connect would be useless as moving from one to another is so difficult or impossible that is would be dangerous which is the whole reason for the wireless connection which is safety. As many might agree there is a lot in all the new car manuals that you must learn which is why Onstar is important but as I found Onstar advisers a bit useless as they are not not trained very well mean I might as well pull of the road and go to the manual. Bottom line safety is what I want in a car and the connection to my cell phone is the most important device which I believe should always be active. Not so with Buick again as noted above. Very disappointed as I decided to try again to support an American manufacturer.""",3

Then next to it was an Enclave 1SN AWD which was great because it had most of the luxury features from the Cadillac in this great 3 row CUV and priced $10,000 less.  AWD is a must as I drive around curvy roads and snowy conditions. This may be my next vehicle!  Loved the easy entry/exit feature which helps get older / back injured folks in/out of the car with ease by lowering the seats and pulling them back each time you park the car and then remains that way when you get back in.  Seats would then raise and pull you forward to the steering wheel when you start the engine! Because this car is so similar to the XT5 without the price tag - it's a sure winner for a luxury CUV.",4

You must match your personality to the vehicle to truly love your car. So why do I rate the 2018 Buick Enclave Essence a must test drive? As a disabled Veteran who (let's face it) hurts everywhere all the time, I find the Buick Enclave to be the most comfortable and luxurious of the SUV's. The seats envelop you and hug you like the warm embrace of a mother to her child. No exaggeration. When I open the door either front or back (except third row) I can slide into my seat without having to contort my body just to get in. In the third row once you fold the middle seat up you can get right in and the back seats are just as comfortable and roomy. It drives like a luxury vehicle should with little to almost no road noise. My advice is to ask the dealer to take it with you when looking at other vehicles to compare. When you test drive one get back into the Buick and drive it again. You will see what I am talking about. One draw back.....seatbelts in middle seat tend to not let you lean forward to adjust middle climate controls when moving. Oh...Get middle captain seats.",5
120, on 04/01/18 10:51 AM (PDT),Carl T. ,2018 Buick Enclave SUV Premium 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Screwed in Kutztown," I had the 2013 Enclave.  It was everything as advertised.  I loved that car.  The shaft bearings went on it and I should have paid the $5k to fix it.  However, I thought why not just buy the new designed for 2018.  Big mistake.  I thought it was just an outside design.  However, they changed the design of the front seats (and I guess the back).  Made them smaller and you sit on the structural member of the outside bolsters. Structure pressure point creates pain in the legs and the Lumbar does not completely retract which causes back pain.  I can not drive this car for more than 15-20 minutes without having to get out.  I wanted to travel cross country with it.  Not now.  My better half complains about the passengers seat also.  I am presently trying to figure out where to position seating pads to prevent different back and leg pains.  DO NOT BUY THIS CAR if you are not young and narrowly skinny.  Pretty automobile but everytime I look at it I see pain.  Kinda like the first snow fall to the painful shoveling of the 10th.  However I am very pleased with our Dealership.  I traded in the 2018 Enclave ""even-up"" for a 2017 leftover XT5 Caddy.  Nice people.",1

Car performance met my expectations. However after extended driving times the front seats are extremely uncomfortable. To the point that the circulation in the legs might be a problem. My wife experienced the same thing in the front passenger seat. The side bolsters in the front seats are narrowed to the point they hit you in the hip area and thighs. Due to the lack of concern or satisfaction from Buick or the dealer with a vehicle with 3,00 miles on it, I have had to purchase front seat cushions in order to use this vehicle. Goodbye GM.",2

Lots of storage room providing great utility. Drives nicely .Brakes are excellent. Reasonable ride .  However the front seats are VERY poor  being TOO narrow and a structural member in the side bolsters on each side catches one under the hips creating a uncomfortable pressure point. Seat backs are TOO narrow pressuring ones rib cage. I am 6""-3"" 225lbs. My 2014 Enclave has perfect front seats that are very comfy . How Buick engineers could put these poor quality seats in a large luxury SUV is very surprising  . Why Buick would completely redesign the seats to this new configuration ,when past seats were comfortable, is poor management  and development.   I am also disappointed in the lack of a CD player and the Start/Stop system ; but these are not deal breakers.  I am now looking at other makes of full size SUVs after owning three Enclaves since 2008 but may drive my 2014 Enclave another year . Again very disappointed in BUICK.",2

Both the BMW and Audi are excellent vehicles but do not match the smooth quiet ride of the Avenir trim level of the Enclave. The interior gives the passengers an exceedingly quiet ride while moving effortlessly down the road. The sound system is just outstanding and the technology control panel is easy to learn and use. Passenger safety is enhanced with features that keep you at a safe distance from vehicles in front and blind spot awareness. Have not found a better value in this price range.,5
129, on 11/04/17 14:40 PM (PDT),Kevin ,2018 Buick Enclave SUV Avenir 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 9A),Buick Enclave Avenir beats the imports," The 2018 Buick Enclave Avenir just arrived in AZ the last week of October.  I had been looking for a car for a year to replace my 2012 Lexus RX 350.  I was about ready to give up on finding a car with a good ride, that is quiet, has room for adults on long drives, and is still able to fit in a parking space.  Oh yeah, and it had to have a decent engine.  These are the attributes of the Lexus brand, but I find the new Lexus just mean-looking.  I test drove all SUVs:  Honda, Toyota, Porsche Cayenne, Audi Q5 Q7 SQ5, Chevy Traverse, Jaguar, Acura, GMC.  I like to think I pretty much covered the universe and I liked the Buick best.  It is extremely quiet and yet has the guts to handle a high speed pass 70 to 90 smoothly.  The long wheel base and great suspension give it a very smooth ride.  This was not the most fun car I drove, but it was the most practical.  We don't need the 3rd row often, but I like the immense storage with easy parking.  BTW, the most fun car was not the Porsche, but the Audi SQ5.  I would highly recommend it for a sporty 2 row.  Buick has upped its game and matched the prestige badges with a 4 year, 50,000 mile warranty.  The Avenir trim is worth the money over the premium.  Looks better and seems quieter.  If any of my checklist matches yours, go drive the Buick.",5
130, on 08/09/18 09:03 AM (PDT),Lisa ,2009 Buick Enclave SUV CX 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Never again GM," We bought our 2009 Buick Enclave from a shady dealership, didn't know that at the time. It had 95000 miles on it. We loved the way it looked and we liked the way it drove. Paid way too much for it. Immediately took it to Buick because of a hesitation problem when accelerating. Was told that there were no problems. Had it for approximately a year when we found out that it needed the timing chain replaced. Took it back to Buick and were told because it was 4000 miles over the special warranty that we would have to replace the timing chain ourselves. Even though I explained that I had brought the truck to them immediately after buying it because of the same issue but they still refused to honor the special warranty. Couldn't afford to fix the problem immediately and drove it for another 9 months until it could not be driven anymore. Took it to the dealership we bought it from and they did the work on it. 3 days after getting it back the transmission blew. And since it has been one chronic issue after another. Granted the car now has 206, 000 miles on it but in this day and age that should be nothing for a car, not a $40, 000 vehicle. We are now completely upside down on our loan after putting in over $10, 000 in repairs which has included the engine control module, power steering pump, alternator, ignition coils, CV axle, catalytic converters, O2 sensor, and more. And we are now certain that we need another transmission. As soon as we can come up with the money we are turning the car over to the bank and going back to the reliable vehicles, Honda.

The dealership found a  broken rocker arm, opened the engine and determined that the engine required complete replacement (vehicle under 50,000 miles).  I was told by the dealership that they could not identify the cause of the issue.  GM offered to cover less than half of the cost to replace the engine (My bill will be $5,500).

The instrumentation buttons (AC temp control) have worn incredibly fast (replaced them once already), have had a ""stuck strut"", replaced rotors, replaced the battery and some decorative adhesive molding on the window frames is bubbling up and shredding (looks horrible when you look at the driver's side of the car).

In straight city driving under the most conservative starts and stops my Enclave gets an averave of 11.7 MPG.  I have provided the dealership the gas receipts and milage.  The fact is that the 6 speed electrocic transmission holds the car in 2nd gear at 30 miles an hour causing the engine to Tach at a steady 1900 RPM. When the car passes 40 MPH the Tach drops to 1200 RPM. I was contacted by GM's Division Manager who told me that is how the transmission is calibrated and there is nothing they can do about it.

Don't know what we get around town.  We liked the styling inside and out which is what attracted us to the car after doing much research.  Two of our neighbors were so impressed with the car they bought one themselves.  One of them traded in a newer Lincoln cross over.,5

I'm a car aficionado and this is the nicest riding vehicle I've owned or driven in.  We purchased a 1-yr old 2011 CPO vehicle and until late summer 2017 all was well.   The only previous issue was a leaky engine gasket covered under warranty.   At our 100k mile check we found: broken engine mount, leaky strut, and HVAC stopped cooling turned out to be a cracked rear AC evap core.  Online forums show this was a common issue into 2013 models, and repair costs $1,000 - $1,300 for either front or rear.  So at 100k miles we've a $3,500 repair tab.   The car has been great to date, but as it ages I'm questioning whether or not we too will begin to experience the transmission problems reported on the forums.    PROS:  Exceptional ride quality, excellent interior room (more actually than my Tahoe), good safety rating, outstanding traction in wet/snowy conditions, great dealer support   CONS:  adequate but not exceptional power, GM leather seating quickly shows wear compared to other brands (same happened in my Tahoe & those of friends), weight keeps mileage middle of the pack, tight power train packaging complicates maintenance/repairs (over $300 for spark plug change!?!).

Why aren't they recalling this paperweight? An expensive luxury car with 50,000 miles with engine failure--complete--ludicrous. Wrote the President of GMC, VP of North American operations, and Vice President for Customer Experience and received absolutely no reply to my email--still waiting for the form letter that says they feel my pain although it is doubtful they have or give one iota about a customer once they have been suckered into this car.

It was in the shop multiple times and they finally had to rewire the airbag system. At 12000 miles the engine light came on and car shut down 4 hours away from home after waiting 5 hours for roadside assistance they towed me an hour away. I got a loaner car and had to leave it up there. It ended up being a bent valve and the head had to be machined. I got it back 3 weeks later after having to drive back up 4 hours to get it. I have a problem with the gas guage that I still have it was back multiple times(they replaced gas tank) and it still does it. It shows 1/4 tank when its empty. Ive had multiple front end components replaced. It runs rough(like a miss) and tach jumps been back multiple times they tell me all the tachs do that. Now charging system is not working replaced battery must be alternator. The car has 52000 miles I bought it in today (thursday )to make appointment. They cant look at it till Wednesday at the soonest, So I dont have a car again. The car is paid off in another 5 months!! So now I dont have a car again. Maybe I should just leave it at dealer.

I have to tell you the car is a money pit. I have had 2 recalls on bought the extended warranty. In the last 12 months I have spent $2500. Last December I had it checked out and they flushed and replaced the brake fluid. Front end alignment. So now I took it in for a check for a road trip. Well I found out the master cylinder and booster on the brakes needed to be replaced. The rack and pinion steering had to be replaced, also the the timing chain cover was leaking oil into the engine and needs the gasket to be replaced, front struts and mounts need replacing and the navigation system isn't working and to fix I would have to replace the entire radio system. I needed a front end alignment after they replaced the rack and pinion, another $90. The buttons to turn the fan up or down turned green after the black peeled off. The car has never been in an accident and kept it serviced and at 44,500 kept in the garage,  it falls apart.  The air conditioning  drain hose and the roof drain hoses all need flushing due to blockage. I will never by a Buick again. The repairs costs as much as the resale value.",3

Not so. The small part is a the entire fuse panel and to correctly modify the electronics in this car to support  towing is so expensive the dealer wouldn't give me a price -there's even a TSB for this but GM has canceled the TSB.

The cons, high price tag, not so stellar fuel economy, large and bulky to maneuver in tight places.  Yes, the latter being true to the point of passing up parking spaces to find one a bit less convenient, but at least with enough room to swing the vehicle in place.  With that said, now that I have been driving this vehicle for 2 years now, I have learned to except the small flaws and be content with all the positives this vehicle has to offer.  I travel often and having a car that makes driving enjoyable is important to me.  Its also extremely important to drive a car which makes me feel safe in the event of an accident.  I have enough car around me to feel quite substantial and a bonus are the many airbags in place should something happen.

I am furious, yes the car is nice, drives nice but not happy that this is a problem they inquired when making this car, it is not something I have done.  I am currently having my power steering replaced for free because they found that it was a safety issue.  Guess I don't quiet understand how the timing chain is not a safety issue when it is know by them that it heats up and stretches, the could break over time and cause catastrophic engine failure, I have heard some stories of this happening as people were driving down the road and car just stops running and no time to get off the road, how the heck is that not a safety issue.

More than adequate power, very comfortable and quiet.  Fuel economy is good for a vehicle of this size configured to seat 7.  I wish I got the AWD version - too easy to spin the tires on the FWD.  Using mapquest and sending it to your GPS via Onstar is cool.  Rear entertainment system has been well utilized.

I purchased it because I wanted a seven seater vehicle, with an aisle down the middle, that wasn't a minivan.  My prior car was a Mercedes R500 which I loved, but felt I needed more storage room and additional seating capacity.  Compared to the ride of the Mercedes, driver seat comfort and handling in the snow this car doesn't compare. The Enclave does have a superior navigation and entertainment package, as well as, heating and cooled seats.  I think the biggest drawback to the Enclave is the transmission on a incline.  The car rolls back or forward when on a hill, almost as if you were in a manual transmission vehicle, when you take your foot of the break. ",4.125

Since 2008 the Buick has improved the power of the engine and transmission is now smoother.  The 2010 Enclave is a pleasure to drive.

We got the bucket seats in the 2nd row to make it easier to get to the 3rd row for my oldest(booster).  The 2 Britax carseats are installed in the second row.

It rides very nice.  It is quiet.  The seats are comfortable.  It is easy to drive.  While on a trip out west, we noticed the engine feels underpowered with 4 people and luggage traveling through the Rocky Mountains.  It struggled going up some hills.  All was well though until we hit 68000 miles.  It started with the engine shutting off while driving.  The power steering went out when this happened making it very difficult to try and steer to get off the road.  After this happened 3 times in 2 days, we took it to the dealership.  The power steering pump needed replaced, the timing chain needed replaced, and a cam shaft was bad.  This came to around $12000.  Thank God we purchased an extended warranty when we bought it.  It was all covered except for the deductible.  After going through that, the vehicle then started making a strange noise whenever we would turn the wheel.  The brake booster is also going out.  At this point, we decided to trade it in on a new GMC Acadia.  I strongly recommend if you buy a used one to purchase an extended warranty.

I have approximately 50,000 miles on the vehicle.  At 46,000 my ""low oil"" light came on.  Sure enough - the oil barely registered on the dipstick.  The dealership told me that I need to have my oil changed more often, even though I have it changed religiously and have NEVER been overdue.  They also told me that the owner's manual instructs that customers must check the oil at every fuel fill up.  (Shifting the blame to me?)    Here I am - 3000 miles later - and about to take a road trip.  I checked my oil and it barely registers on the dip stick.  Apparently I am driving a $40,000 vehicle that has an engine that burns oil.  There are no oil leaks on my garage floor, so it must be going somewhere.  We will be taking my daughter's 2009 Pontiac on our road trip because I feel safer with us going far from home in that.  There is also a LOUD bang in the back floor.  I have taken it in and they ""can't find it"".  The repair tech could hear the noise when I called in to schedule the repair using Blue Tooth - it's that loud!  How can they not find metal banging together.  A waste of money.  I recommend purchasing a different vehicle.",2

439, on 09/22/16 17:57 PM (PDT),Steve H ,2016 Buick Enclave SUV Premium Group 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),1000+ miles across the Northeast," I've owned two Dodge Durangos (first a 2012 V6 model, now a 2015 RT Hemi) and found myself spending a week with the Enclave during a work trip. High points of the Enclave are generously sized cargo and seating areas, smooth freeway sailing, and overall comfort. The cargo area seems to be quite a bit larger than my Durango.  However once you get off the interstate and onto the twisties, the Enclave shows it's weak spots. In my rental with 20,000 miles, the transmission hunts for gears, is slow to respond, and can be clunky as it tries to keep up. Switching to low for engine braking on steep downgrades is not terribly effective in this vehicle, nor is it smooth. Low speed cornering is controlled and predictable, but at moderate or greater speeds there is quite a bit of body roll. Getting into technology - the audio system (this one did not have Nav) was not intuitive. I'm sure you get used to it as you own it, but the system of menus and sub menus seemed oddly organized. Dodge/Chrysler is miles ahead with the UConnect system, and I would also rate this well behind the system in Toyotas that I have rented. THe interior material quality also is not what I expect for the price range. Granted, rentals do get abused, but the high gloss console surfaces appear to be easily scratched, and the dull black plastic center stacks look cheap. Lastly, there were a number of odd noises that I would not expect from a new vehicle with this mileage. Creaks and groans from the suspension were noticeable over the rough roads of New Jersey. To anyone considering one of these, I urge you to check out the competition closely, especially the Durango (I feel that the Durango handling is worlds beyond the Buick, and with the V8, so is the power). You can do better than the Enclave for the money.",3

I like how the Dodge Durango and Honda Polite drove. I had basically narrowed my choice to those two SUV until I test drove this SUV. This one blew the other two away on how it hugged the road and how quiet it was.  The spacious room in the back and the ease of getting in and out of the second and third row was a selling point as well.  The interior did not have all the bells and whistles that the other two had but the comfort and safety I felt in this SUV made my decision easy.....I highly recommend this SUV above all. Update:   I have had this SUV since August (now April, 2017) and have nothing but great things to say about the vehicle. It rides great and is very reliable. I wish it has gotten better mileage but it gets about 18 mpg.  I have not been to happy with the On star and Free Radio both are expensive once the three months free trial is over.  Both are nice but very costly.",5

Love the seating, and storage.  Wife hauls a lot of items when doing Prison Ministry work and she can still get 4 people into very comfortably .  I like the vehicle for over all appearance, and variability.  Good vehicle for us as we haul grand kids around and three car sets with 4 grand kids is not a problem.  The entertainment system is great when traveling any distance with them as they can watch DVD's and not bother us in the front seat.  Only hang up I have ever had is getting at the spare tire.

Electronics at this trim level may be intimidating.  You won't be able to instantly use all features without reading the owner's manual,...several times.  There are very few features the cares does not have.  It's loaded.  The only complaint so far with the electronics is the navigation system.  It doesn't understand my southern dialect.  Half the time I have to manually key in destinations as opposed to speaking them.  I hope that time will enable the system to learn my voice.  Creature comforts are impeccable.  Seats are a little stiff compared to my Town Car but I expect them to loosen up over time.  Leg room is the best out there, bar none, particularly the second row seating.  Even the third row seating is adequate for relatively short trips.  Noise levels are on a par with most luxury cars, quiet.  Power is adequate for a vehicle this size but will not snap any necks.

So far best that we have gotten pure highway is 23.1. Hopefully will improve somewhat. 2500 miles on it so far.  Acceleration is acceptable to pass and go up hills.      Overall we are very happy with it. One option that we got was lane departure & front end collision warning. Leather edition comes with blind spot warning and rear side collision alert. Thus loaded with safety features. Also, a middle air bag.     One issue that we are not happy with is the ""hanger"" hooks are in the 3rd row. Can't use exit handles in second row since they are on the back of the front seats and not on the roof. We like to hang clothes on clothes bar when we travel but this is a problem other than just 10-12inches of such if using third row. With cars we put clothes about 50% across and still had good vision out of the back window. Third row and second row both fold down flat for storage.      Overall very happy with this ""car.""",5

Other than this, the car truly was the lowest maintenance/repair cost of any vehicle I've driven or owned to date, and I've own a few cars during my day. I give it an A++ for reliability and get up and go. I'm also a person of 5'2"" and the seats were great, my back did not sit off the back of the seat as it does in most cars because the seat is usually longer than my hip to knee area which causes my back to not sit flush with the back of the seat; this can cause great discomfort and lower back pain. I had no such problem with this car while all of my taller friends never complained once about being uncomfortable so that is a win/win for tall and short drivers and passengers!!

Why buy small cars when the comfort/power/reliability of a Century gets near same mpg? My 16 yr old son didn't want me to get a ""grandpa car"", but he sure loves it now that it's his!

The tiresmust be poor quality, because when taking curves on a road which is slightly crowned, the car feels as though it is about to roll over; insteadof tires, perhaps design has poor weightdistribution.

Pour a can of transmission Seafoam in the automatic transmission by pouring it down the tube of the check stick.2. Replace the air filter with a K&N or home made from cut reusable air conditioning filter material. MPG will improve 10%.3.

A few things have gone wrong such as power windows, a blower resistor, led resistor in gauge cluster, and a/c clutch coil. I fixed all those things myself. The cost and level of difficulty were low, though. I have done all of the regular maintenance such as oils, filters, brake pads,coolant, tune up, -again cheap and easy. This year (2015), the car was showing some signs of wear, and since it ran and drove quite well still, I decided to do a semi restoration. I repaired the rusted rocker panels. New tires, brakes, struts, motor/tranny mounts, tires, headlights,exhaust system, wheel bearings, paint touch up, a few other piddly things. It runs and drives like brand new no issues at all. In 12 years time I have spent under 4000 on maintenance and 2500 of it was on the semi restoration this year. It has spent most of it's life outside, but the paint still looks very good.

611, on 06/22/18 21:09 PM (PDT),Andy ,2000 Buick Century Sedan Custom 4dr Sedan,"A comfortable, reliable, boring, rusting car"," This car is pretty old, but if you need a really cheap car that is reliable it could be a good choice. Visually it isn't the worst looking 18 year old car. Reliability has been great since we got the car from my grandpa. He had to do some transmission work and I'm sure the intake manifold gaskets at one point, but I believe that after that it's pretty much going to run forever, maybe not with the best health as rubber hoses are going to get brittle and break on an 18 year old car, but it should still take you places without too much trouble. It's not really a car you have to worry about too much since parts aren't expensive. Mine has 185,000 miles. The driving experience is pretty boring but adequate for getting you around. It has a lot of body roll and doesn't feel particularly secure doing fast turns, or is in other words floaty. The steering is decently responsive though. Acceleration is adequate, which means it won't wow you but should be enough to get up to speed on the highway. The car is a little hard to park, because the edges are all rounded and it makes the position of the car a little uncertain. Windows are plentiful and mirrors are large which makes visibility good. Build quality wise the car isn't the best. I know it's old, but the mirrors have fallen off and have had to be glued, the speakers are blown (although it's 18, years old so we'll cut it some slack), but there is random wear and tear that has occurred that shouldn't, like the radio knob is missing, piece of cupholder broken, loose looking components that look like they barely fit all over the place, broken glovebox, passenger side window switch doesn't work, button broken on window switch, foam disintegrating. The door panels literally move when the windows roll down. But that is okay if your main focus is reliability and a car that just drives you around. The only big build quality problem is rust. If you are living in the south it may not be an issue, but in the north the bottom of a door has begun to rust after 3 years here. Whether critical components like rocker panels are affected is uncertain, but I've noticed a few Centuries with rusted out rocker panels. Interior wise it is roomy, but you are missing features like rear cupholders. It is neat how center console folds up for a 6th seat. It has a lot of door storage. No rear vents though or fold down seats. Climate control is basic but easy to use, and has Dual zone control. One thing to watch out for is these old cars probably don't have a working heater and the A/C might not work well. My heater doesn't work for a long time, and the A/C which has been recharged is ice cold only when the car is moving. Technology is not great because it doesn't have a CD player. Comfort is good. The seats are not uncomfortable but not the most supportive or contoured. The soft suspension is awesome on our pothole roads though.",4

After 3 years and 70,000 miles never had any break downs or mechanical failures. This car was made in Canada so it was built to higher standards. I only payed $7000 for it and have already gotten my money's worth. Excellent in the snow especially with the flawless ABS and traction control.

I feel that the other problems with the car have been typical for the mileage, although I had to get a transmission replacement kit at 92,000 miles. Interestingly, the replacement kit has worked twice as long as the original transmission. If not for the window problem, I have had a pretty good exoerience with the car.",3.875

However, I have been relatively pleased with the car. It is a superb cruising car, and is comfortable in the city. The 3100 V6 is powerful enough, but the transmission seems to sap power from the engine when accelerating from a standstill.

The transmission still has problems with harsh shifts and chugging motions at times, even interstate speeds; somewhat disconcerting. This car has developed a lot of creaks and rattles.

It needed and alignment and tires. It also had the ABS and ""Trac Off"" light on. I bought it with 165,000 miles on it and had a mechanic look over it and do some pressure tests.  Only complaint i really have with this car is there is no rpm gauge on the cluster. kind of a pain but i can live with that. The car is extremely comfortable. I have a slightly bad back and driving for long periods of time doesn't mess with my back at all. The electronic seat adjustment helps out a lot too. The dash has a nice setup. Nothing is complicated and its easier to fix that a lot of newer cars. The engine is pretty nice. It holds up well with basic maintenance. With the higher mileage I have on mine I've never had to do anything with it. Previous owner did have to replace the intake manifold gasket, but that's a known problem with the Century. Has the perfect amount of acceleration. It not ridiculously fast but its not slow. Its got some pick up if you need it. You don't need to race in a Century. Once i got the alignment and tire fixed the car rode like it was brand new.  Heck, it drove nicer than my brand new Kia Soul did.

At 100K I replaced both axles, tie rods, one brg and did the usual 100k maintenance.

But, our 98 Century is holding up remarkably well considering she's about 18 years old. The Odometer went out @ 154k about 9 months ago. These cars are known to have faulty wiring problems, as we have to have the driver door and another door open to control the windows, which is dangerous if you drive off forgetting you had a door partially cracked open. Otherwise, doing regular engine maintenance has kept her running like a dream. The maintenance guy was even like ""Wow! Your cruise control still works. A lot of these cars don't have it anymore because they didn't take good care of the engine"". So yeah if you take moderately good care of this car it will take VERY good care of you. Our buick gets very very hot in direct sunlight which is great for winter time. Also, if you have decent tires on yours, you can outdrive most AWD vehicles in the snow. And it's awesome. We were being told the engine might go soon, so we went out and bought a 2002 Regal LS to have for when this car goes out.  But, honestly, since the mechanic fixed her up I think she's gonna make it to 200k hopefully, and we can just have the Regal sit in the parking lot for 4 months and use ole reliable to pay off new reliable.",5

While it's average looking, it's the most comfortable car I've ever been in.  The seats have the perfect amount of cushioning and when driving on the highway you'd think you were sitting still it's so quiet and smooth.  I felt absolutely no bumps ever, which I suppose is expected of a Buick (it's famous for floating down the roads). The interior is basic, but if you're looking for a stylish car you shouldn't be going toward a '99 Buick anyway.  The controls are easy to get to and understandable, and you feel like there's plenty of room in the front seat.  Very recommended.",4.25

She's almost at the 100,000 mile mark and the only problem I've had was the breaks went on me, but even then it performed admirably and got me home safe. Pretty good handling and very forgiving, but it will also move when you tell it to. The overall exterior is designed more for a conservative buyer, but the unremarkable looks actually works to your benefit if you pass an officer of the law a little too much on the expeditious side, as opposed to doing so in a more aggressively styled car.

To spice these models up- you must get them in sante fe red!   Covers bumps in road like ship with lots of suspension float (this may have been less noticable in earlier days) but it mostly handles like an old rolls royce.

It could have scored higher marks but I am 6'1"" and when I am in the back seats there is not sufficent head room.

The other thing is that I would like for the radio sound to be able to be adjusted infinitely, not to click on to the next sound level which may be louder or softer than I actually want to listen to.  Overall, a pretty good buy, but I have had it less than a year.",5

It only had 369,000 miles on it - barely broken in. It had some minor rear damage, some dings, a tear and an excessive wear spot in the leather on the driver seat, and a few other minor things, but hey, I was buying a used car. It didn't have the power of my Regal, of course, but it was no slouch either. All-in-all I was happy. I paid cash for an ""AS IS"" car but they chose to give me a 90-day warranty because they ""liked"" me and I paid cash. Two weeks later I brought it in with a few problems. The dealer charged me an outrages sum of money and would guarantee it would fix my problem - it didn't fix my problems and my 90-day warranty was a hoax. I no longer use that dealer - found an honest one up north. I have discovered that the previous owners did not take very good care of their car. I have always lived by the premise that if you take care of your car, it will take care of you. I'm down to fair-wear and-tear items now. The engine has never skipped a beat! The 3.8 has been a solid workhorse since 1961. It's a real shame they stopped making it. As for the rest of the car, once I fixed a problem, it stayed fixed!!! I expect to get at least 350,000 miles out of this Buick now that she's happy again. I have NEVER been disappointed with my Buicks!",4

I use this car for an office on wheels.  It had 36k when I bought it.  It has 146k now.  I had to get the air ride repaired.  Put on one rotor which was my fault and light bulbs.  THAT IS IT except for oil filters, brake pads, air filters and the normal maintenance stuff!  This car goes well in the snow.  Not as good as a 4wd but with a little sense it gets you there.  This car stops very well on dry roads or in snow and has never thrown a surprise my way.  Down on the coastal plain I can get 32 mpg highway if cruising steadily.  Stop and go traffic kills the mileage.  In the hills if I'm not trying to stretch mileage I get between 24 and 25.  This is a big car and the ride is wonderful.  The car is quiet unless you run with a window down.  Front struts now need replaced to help ride but I haven't got around to it.  Speedometer is broken so I use the Garmin.  Car does not have rear headrests in case of accident.  This seats 6.  I wish I could find another with 50k on it.  I would buy instantly!  Update: The car now has 173K.

I get it serviced every 3-4,000 miles, rotate tires often (3rd set in place at the moment) and drive it daily (127K and still going strong). My only complaint is a dashboard squeak I've had for ages and can't seem to locate. I wish they still made this model for when I'm ready again.

833, on 10/05/15 20:45 PM (PDT),PJ DAY ,2005 Buick LeSabre Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 4A),I finally had to let her go....," I bought this 2005 LeSabre in Oct. 2013 from a dealer in Blue Ridge, GA. She was a 1 owner who was no longer able to drive so her husband traded the car in.  I named her Betty Buick. She had just under 92,000 miles on her and was in absolutely pristine condition. Had always been garaged and I thought & was told, well maintained. Literally driven by a ""little ole lady"".   I paid just over $8,500 for her and was glad to find her. Back in 2013 these 05 LeSabre model cars were at a premium and hard to find. Us baby boomers wanted the wide front seat instead of cramped buckets and the ride and weight of a hearse. This Buick provided that and more. Talk about a hwy driving car, this baby was built to take long trips ! However, my husband passed away and trips never happened. She was not driven too much. I had to replace the battery and then the problems with the transmission began....Just a little slip here and there and then it was any time she was asked to climb a slight incline...skip, skip, skip and it was getting worse. The engine was terrific and gas mileage out of this world but the tranny must not have been well maintained and it was going out....I also began to suspect the crankcase filter issue that is well documented on this model was a possible problem for erratic stalls that fell into no particular driving pattern. She would eventually crank back up but she could stall out at 65 mps....total loss of power....I began not to trust her even for short trips into town.   So even though she looked just like she came straight off the show room floor, she needed to find a good home and I had to let her go. She only brought $3,000 on trade with 94,500 miles in on a 2014 GMC Terrain. I will miss her ride. Smooth as silk and quiet, quiet, quiet ! They do not make 'em like this any more unfortunately. I'd have replaced the crank case filter but the transmission was just too expensive. All things being equal a fabulous car !",4

My aunt owned a 2005 buick leSabre and loved the car because it drove good, it was good with gas miles, the interior had plenty of room. Yesterday my aunt was driving the car coming back from Taylorsville, Ky. and she reached about one mile west of Mt. Washington,Ky. and mom and husband was in the car with her when my mom yelled at my aunt to stop the car because it was on fire. My aunt pulled off of the road and was yelling for help and yelling for everyone to get out of the car and the back seat under on the driver side was burning out of control. In a matter of a few minutes this car was completely destroyed by fire and it is believed the cause of the fire was from the battery which sits underneath the rear seat on the driver side. I am so lucky that my family is alive, but it could have been much worse. I want to make everyone aware if the battery is under the rear seat you will not want a car that is not safe. My mom was with my aunt and she was in the back seat on the passenger side and saw the seat in flames and yelled to my aunt to stop the car because it was on fire. If my mom had not been back there to see the seat burning and my aunt was in the car, this could have been worse. So, think twice before you buy one of these cars because next time it may be you, your children, your parents, or some other loved one.

So far it gets better mileage than cars previously mentioned.  The only problem is getting one.  Now that they are heavily discounted, they go off the lot as soom as they are delivered. It's funny that when GM finally gets the price right they are terminating a hot seller.",4.625

884, on 09/03/15 21:02 PM (PDT),Chris ,2004 Buick LeSabre Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 4A),best car I ever owned.," Second owner, bought this car in 2009 with 55000 miles. Vehicle is extremely comfortable to ride in and loaded with a ton of great features. My favorite features were the seats, heated and adjustable enough to accommodate a driver with very long legs and a short torso, a problem I've had in all other vehicles was getting comfortable on a long drive. Front bench seating is easier to keep clean than a center console. Interior features were well ahead of its time and comparable to expensive luxury vehicles of the same age. Even with rust and being beaten half to death by being stored outside in one of the worst northern climates in the states and not cared for very well, the paint hasn't faded or lost its gloss she still turns heads with classic styling and a blue soft top. Car handled better through some really nasty winters with cheap all weathers than my old Jeep with snow tires. Vehicle was a steal at $12000. I got my money out of her, and I'm very sad to see her go. Car needs significant work any vehicle would after going through what she's been through, but the vehicle is still solid beyond my expectations and capable of another 60000 miles at least.This is a great low maintenance vehicle perfect for a family, and would be a good choice for a winter rat. Gas mileage isn't great, but decent for a full size sedan. My only complaints is that the gear shifts are kind of laggy, sometimes it'll hard shift. GM's 3.8 is a tried and true engine, but the four speed transmission makes for a boring ride. Car handles well and is easy to maneuver but the suspension feels a little rough on highways. Dash lights, passenger climate control, and one of the heated seats burnt out. The only repairs I had in seven years besides standard maintenance and rust related repairs were a blower motor going ($200 with a used motor), an ignition problem (estimated $75), an EVAP leak that has engine light on, and a small coolant leak ($180).",5

After driving it for only a couple of months the transmission started acting up so I took it in. The transmission had to be replaced and they actually had to install it twice because the first one was ""defective"". Two years later and only 50,000 miles later I had to have the transmission replaced again. It seems as though the transmissions they chose to install in this model are just expensive junk.

You wouldn't think so when you first sit down on the seat as it is well padded.  I had trouble with the dual climate control system.  The driver's side quit working and was cycling hot air-cold air-hot air, etc. The car drives nice going straight but very poor at any kind of spirited handling.

Also, hard shift every few days (1st to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd). Guesstimate from dealer on repairing both problems = 900 bucks. Two front chrome mag wheels leak air around the rim unless you get tire store to sand and goop up the rim. Overall car is good transportation given that I gave $5100 for a 4 year old car.

Because of this, the tires could not be balanced, so 3 new tires had to be ordered, also the radio had to be replaced because some of the features did not work. My dealer is an excellent dealer and took care of the every complaint without any problems. This my third car that I purchased from them.

Other than replacement of front wheel bearings, I have had no major repair costs.  Yes, it does ride like an American built late 20th Century auto.  It doesn't handle tight curves as well as my wife's Volkswagen.  But it is, for me, extremely comfortable and durable.  I have never been disappointed with my General Motors cars.

952, on 12/27/16 07:37 AM (PST),JC ,2002 Buick LeSabre Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 4A),Shockingly poor reliability," I wish I'd had the experiences I'm reading about on here. I owned two Buick Lesabres prior to my 2002 Limited-- a 1993 Custom with 223,000 miles and a 1999 Limited with 200,000 miles at trade-in. Only standard maintenance was necessary with each, never a single major repair, so I expected the same results with my new Lesabre. Basically, I got to 133,000 miles, but not before spending thousands upon thousands in repairs. I bought the car new, so everything was fine while under warranty, but soon thereafter the nightmare began. The first to go were the brakes on all four wheels around 40,000 miles. These were about $500. The next to go was the hard shifting transmission which lasted about 80,000 miles. This cost around $1500.  Somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000 miles I had a the greatest number of problems, mostly electrical, but some other issues too. Exterior lighting/wiring went bad with turn signals and tail lamps. This was about a $400 fix. Lights started burning out on the climate control buttons, then the radio and steering wheel buttons. This couldn't be fixed at all short of replacing head units and switches and it would've been so costly I decided to just forgo it. Brake lines rusted out (and don't ask me how since I live in California)--$500 more. Leaking fuel injectors, poor performance and hard starting, $800 more. The blower fan  stopped working--$200 more. The dash began to peel around the opening for the window defroster. I never bothered to replace. The passenger door panel started coming loose and I didn't bother with that either. Gas cap needed replacing because there was a vacuum leak. That was $90 more. The final straw was at 103,000 miles when the engine had an internal backfire in the intake manifold. The engine essentially imploded causing the plastic intake plenum to shatter, the heads to leak and the oil cap to bust off of the filler neck. If I hadn't been on a long trip and stranded in the middle of Wyoming, I'd have bought another car; instead, I had to repair at $3400. By the time I got to 133,000 the suspension was weak, the car rattled and shimmied, needed more engine work and the AC overhauled and I couldn't take anymore. Surprisingly, I didn't have the problem with window regulators like everyone else mentioned. On another note, this model of Lesabre, while having the same dimensions on paper, seemed smaller on the inside and larger on the outside than my two previous models--more trunk and good, less overall interior room--not a good move if you ask me. Road trips were not comfortable for backseat passengers and the front wasn't much better. It also seemed more plastic and cheap overall and the ride quality not as soft or cushy. The value was great and resale value excellent, but I think the 36,000 mile warranty was skimpy. I left Buick for a number of years and came back with a 2011 Lacrosse that now has 131,000 miles and runs like a Swiss watch with no repairs at all. THAT is what I expect from a Buick and my 2002 Lesabre just didn't deliver. Maybe mine was a lemon?",2

Then the right rear failed, it is being held in the up position with a piece of wood jammed under the regulator arm. All 4 have failed for the same reason. They are running a metal cable over a plastic pulley wheel and using a plastic spool on the motor. When the plastic pulley wheel breaks the cable misalignes on the spool and the window wont go up.

Only option is 16 inch wheels.  It's a couple of years newer design.  Not one problem or complaint so far.  Yesterday I drove 380 miles roundtrip to see a Spring Training Baseball Game.

1009, on 11/29/17 13:13 PM (PST),Andi ,2000 Buick LeSabre Sedan Custom 4dr Sedan,Great for poor students," I am a second year college student and have owned my 2000 Buick Lesabre for over a year now, getting it when it had a little less than 123K miles and I now have over 130K miles on it. Even though everyone tells me it is an old person car, I love my Buick. I have driven it over 600 miles one way to college (with a trip back to home and then back to college in-between) and I haven't seen many problems. Recently, my mass air flow sensor went out and it started driving horribly, but I bought the piece for $150 and it took me less than two minutes to replace it and now it drives great. I love how smooth of a ride it is and how comfortable the ride is. I also love having the bench seat up front in-case I need to drive five other people somewhere. My few complaints about the car include the broken fuel level sensor (I've gotten accustomed to just keeping track of how many miles I have driven and just fill up every 300 miles), both rear window regulators went out (I was able to buy the parts for about $150 each and replaced them myself), and the front passenger control arm was rusted out pretty bad (I had this replaced by an auto repair shop). The fabric on the roof of the car is starting to fall, but I just put adhesive on it and called it good. It is a hunky car, which I am not a fan of, and it does not turn well at all (I end up having to do Y-turns or multiple turns). I love the trunk space, especially to haul everything to and from college. Overall, I love the car, I got it for pretty cheap at $1300 (great for being on a college budget and having no help in paying for a car) and it has done its job of getting me to different places and it is pretty reliable.**Update: Unfortunately, I had to scrap my Buick about two months ago (June 2018). When I brought it in to my mechanic to see if it would make a long road trip, they noticed a 12 inch hole in my structure near my front driver's side wheel. Because of this, my mechanic said that it was a very unsafe car to drive much further than local driving. However, this isn't because the car was not built right, it's because I live where it snows and ices very often, causing the car to rust from salt and snow. I still loved that car and was extremely sad to let it go.",5

Typical cheap GM plastic interior is to be expected with these cars and window regulators often fail, but other than that; it's a great car. Runs strong, can take a beating, and gets pretty decent gas mileage for almost 270k. You can pick one up fairly cheap and it will last forever. Highly recommended vehicle.Update: Car has been sold since 11/2016, but is still driving around town. Last mileage recorded before the sale was around 291k. As an estimate, it has probably already hit 300k miles, or will very soon.",5
1011, on 04/12/16 19:54 PM (PDT),Jason Waddoups ,2000 Buick LeSabre Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan,Great car.  Very solid," This has been a great car.  Purchased at 135k previous care unknown.  Currently at 245k, runs and drives great.  22/32 which is great for its size.  Rebuilt transmissioin at 180k, starter, vacuum hose leak, battery, tires, gas guage was out when purchased.  Use trip counter for fillups.   Dual climate system on passenger side would randomly stop working, then start back up again.  No repairs done.  Center console flip broken hinge.  Of the 3 keys, two of the chips went bad and the car stopped recognizing them.It has been a very solid car.  Always starts, never left us stranded.  The engine is strong and shifts smoothly.  If is fantastic in snow and ice.  Went through snow covered mountain passes every winter without problem.  Does better than friends Outback and MDX.  The ride is smooth and only the biggest potholes are felt.I have never been in a car that rolls as well as this one does.  When I take my foot off the gas, you can't tell.  The car keeps rolling without the noticeable slowing experience in other cars.  At 80mph, on a flat road, it takes about 30 seconds for the car to slow to 70.  It is like there is no resistance.  It gains speed on any and all downhills.I never thought I would enjoy driving a Buick. It is now one of the top companies for customer service and reliability.  Brother has a 2006 Rendezvous that is about to hit 250k and has been very reliable.  Maybe I'll try the Enclave next.",5
1012, on 03/08/16 22:39 PM (PST),Richard ,2000 Buick LeSabre Sedan Limited 4dr Sedan,Thank god we only inherited it!," We were given a 2000 buick lesabre back in 2008 by a family member that was no longer driving. It wasnt our number 1 choice but since it was free, we took it. It had about 50k miles on it back then. Now we're on 8 with about 105k mIles and this car is an absolute dog! Every interior piece that can wear out or break, has! The soft, dash top has started to lift up, on it's own! Then there's loose interior parts with huge gaps, acres of hard, hollow, cheap plastics, only two horribly designed  cup holders for the entire car which are broken by the way! The two cup holders are put so close together that you can't fit anything bigger than two water bottles there. If you've got a bug gulp, you're screwed! You'll have to keep it between your legs and risk spilling it all over the car. The back seat passengers have no where to put a cup. But there's ashtrays in the back seat? That ""wood"" trim you see is actually hard plastic! The climate selector switch broke once. That's another cheap plastic part. Every window regulator has either failed or been replaced.  The front drivers side has been replaced twice. The front passenger has been replaced once. But now (the window is stuck partially open) and the rear windows have gotten stuck a few times but have been fortunate enough to get them up. There is no permanent fix for this. The power front drivers seat works when it wants to. The seats are not supportive at all. The fuel level sensor dosent work and hasn't for years. I can't even tell how much gas is in the car. That's a $1000 fix. No way we're paying that for a car that's probably not even worth that. I thought that a car that's supposed to be an upper scale entry level ""luxury"" car that, the interior pieces and features wouldn't be so flimsy. But it is an American car through and through (bad quality). A Chevrolet Avalanche and Jeep Wrangler we had all had bad interior quality. The rear, air suspension has never worked right, still dosent work right and is costly to fix. Overall I have to say, the engine and transmission hasn't given us much trouble yet but that interior and feature quality is pathetic. No more american.",2

The car was still operating on the factory battery.  This car is a horse.  Cons, service engine light comes on and it usually is a air senson gone bad, which is minor repairs.  People need to understand that when you buy a Buick, it is meant to be driven smoothly. This car is not to be driven like a Grand Prix or Monte Carlo. Once you get over 120000 miles I'd recommend getting your oil changed a month earlier than scheduled because it will always be a quart low.

The drivers seat does not have a single scratch or tare on it. The previous owner took extremely good care of this vehicle and preformed regular maintenance religiously. It just goes to show if you respect your vehicle and really take good care of it the. It can last more then 20 years and look like it just came out of the factory. I paid $2,000 and have spent about $150 more flushing the dex-cool so now the coolant looks brand new. It took me about a week using the hose and adding cleaner/ flush to the system. I can not stress the importance of having clean coolant. The crud that builds up after 20 years will destroy the engine, even with regular coolant changes. After some new plugs and wires the vehicle is ready to last another 20 years. It is better to do preventative maintenance then to do repairs. What a jewel this car is.",5

The reason being is because so many things have been done to it to keep it running, and in decent shape.  Those of you who own one are familiar with the LeSabre problems.  I have replaced the upper and lower intake manifold gaskets,  upper plenum, valve cover gaskets, oil pan gasket, transmission pan gasket, the window motors and regulators,  fuel filler pipe, front lower control arms, CV axles,  inner tie rods and tie rod ends, struts and shocks, water pump, fuel pump, alternator, radiator, AC compressor.  and a host of minor things to numerous to mention. Hood pistons, sensors, brakes and rotors front and rear, tire's,  so many things.    All in all it's in perfect shape, but only because of all that's been done to it.  You can imagine the cost of keeping this beast running if you had to take it to a garage for the work.  I do my own wrenching and all the part's are from EBAY, except tires.   That's a huge saving believe me.  Much more than several thousand dollars.  If you can't do this work it's probably not worth keeping the vehicle.  It's probably no better than any other vehicle it competes with and may even have more problems than some of them do.  You hear about how great the 3800 engine is, but consider everything that has to be replaced around it, and on it,  to keep the car on the road.  That said I think I'll squeeze some more miles out of it, and replace more things as needed.",3

I purchased one due to the fact that my mom also owned one and has been very satisified.  I've also been very happy with mine.  The only complaint I have is that the ABS light comes on, and I was told the whole component in the wheel hub needs to be replaced at my Buick dealership.  It cost about $517.00.  I don't feel that this should have gone so soon, since that light went on a week after I got the car.  I think that they need to improve their ABS system since my mom's car has had the same problem from the time it was new and hers is a earlier model.  They're great, roomy, comfortable, and for the most part very reliable, but pricey to repair. ",5

This car has kept my mechanical skills sharp as I have had to repair this car more times since I have owned it than any other car I have owned. From the usual intake manifold/ gaskets issues to fuel pump, plastic cooling system components failing, weird shifting transmission in warm weather, engine misfires, and the usual ""old car"" problems like rusted out brake and fuel lines which I would expect on an old car. The car is cheaply made both in the interior and the chassis. The steel for the chassis is so thin you have to be careful when jacking up this car. When these cars have seen some salt, the engine cradles rust out thus dropping the engine. There are so many transmission ""mods"" on these available in the aftermarket to deal with GM's cost cutting measures with the transmission.

He put a new belt, compressor and battery in it. I paid $3,500. It has been two years and 10,000 miles. I don't drive too much and under the hood is the best engine ever made. As my co-worker said they stopped making them because they last so long and they can't get anyone to buy a new vehicle! I work at an auto shop now while in college and have only done preventive maintenance. At 110,000 miles now she still starts up everytime. I drive city and get between 17-19 mpg unfortunately.

This is an excellent highway car. The ride on the open road is very smooth and power from the 3.8 liter V-6 comes on strong when you need it to.

The seats are large and comfortable, and the radio controls are large and easy enough to use. For a car this size, the itsy-bitsy glove box is a bit of an embarrassment.

Up here in the north, it has some serious flaws. The Lesabre is poorly designed for corrosion resistance. The left and right rocker panels have rusted completely through. The body shop manager said this happens on every Lesabre he sees. He attributes it to poor body design. The tires throw slush and salt into the rocker panels. The salt water can't drain easily, so it stays and causes rust. The inner wheel wells have the same problem. The front anti-sway bar often breaks in this model. Salt water accumulates at several points, causing it to weaken from rust. Mine was broken on both sides! The A/C compressor doesn't last long.",3.125

Very smooth ride and acceleration, beautiful looks, and very reliable. Unfortunately, things changed all of a sudden when the car reached 60,000 plus miles last November. I heard a warning bell and lost engine power all of a sudden, the engine light turned on, and I got a strange message, ""Reduced engine Power"" on the dashboard. I stepped on the gas, the car hesitated, and then  got up to about 40  MPH but it  didn't feel  right, like the engine was lacking its usual power. I took it to my reliable local mechanic, he changed the throttle body, but the next day the dreaded message came on again. I took it back and this time my mechanic changed the accelerator sensors. Just when I thought everything was good, I got that bleeping message a  third bleeping time! My mechanic this time said there may be a problem with the throttle body wire harness. He took a look at the wires, which were a little damp but otherwise ok, and  cleaned and tightened them. This seemed to finally solve the problem. I'm just hoping I never see that horrible ""reduced engine power"" message again. I'm retired and have high property taxes, getting a new car is out of the question, so this Lucerne has to last indefinitely! If I should ever get another car, though, it won't be a GM vehicle. It'll be a Toyota Camry or a Subaru Legacy. When I was a kid, buying a GM car was like buying a piece of the rock, whether it was a Buick, Oldsmobile, or even a Chevy. Not any more.

It is the only drawback, in as far of not getting good gas mileage.  But one has to expect that when you have 275 horses to pull you around.

The Chrysler 300 in that price range is incredibly spartan in the interior and has a seriously underpowered 2.7L V6.  While the 300 and Toyota handle better, this is clearly due to both vehicles' wider stance and lower profile tires, which necessarily create a rougher ride.

It drives and rides like a dream and is the quietest vehicle I have ever ridden in. The drawbacks: visability is poor - can't see where the front or rear is in the case of parking - windows too high obstructing visibility in tight parking areas, can't see parking slot markings. Don't campare vehicle with it's competition in close proximity because the rough sounding 3800 V6 just doesn't sound like something coming from a real classy car.

It has good safety ratings, but some of this safety comes from thicker roof pillars and side and curtain air bags. The side and rear window size has also been reduced compared to older cars, probably for styling purposes.  The result is reduction in safety due to big blind spots, especially at both  the front and back of the door pillars. Unlke the car we replaced, the front mirrors don't have adequate range of motion to see into the side blind spots . Buick has side blind zone alert avaialble as an option.

Ride has softened somewhat with break-in, but the magnetic ride control is still firmer than in my DTS. Knew I would have to replace the standard Bridgestone tires in order to make the ride acceptable. Replaced tires with Goodyear Assurance Comfortreds (235/55/18) which adds about 1/2 inch to the tires diameter and about 1/4 inch to the car's ride height. The tires made a big difference when compared to the hard riding and noisy Bridgestones. The car, at 2,600 miles, gets about 18 mpg combined vs. 20 mpg with the DTS.

Have driven Lincolns (Mark series), Taurus, Mercedes, and a Caddy.  Must say that this is the most comfortable car I have ever driven.  With the Northstar V8, it is very quick to accelerate  - I had to get used to the electronic gas pedal as it is instantaneous, but the power and smoothness make it fast off the line and it easily and extremely quickly accelerates to highway speed.  I took it for a test drive before I bought it and when I ""floored"" it on the highway, I was truly impressed.  It's got more power than I will ever really need.  I've gotten 17.5 MPG around town and 25.9 on the highway for a combined total of 20.6.  Not great, but not bad for a full size, powerful luxury car.  The interior is soft, roomy, and has easy to understand controls.  Trunk space is great, and my front bucket seats are extremely comfortable for any length trip.   While the turning radius is very large, because I have driven many large cars and trucks/suvs over the years, it's something that didn't take long to get used to.  Fit and finish are incredible, and the Harmon Kardon stereo system is top notch.  The quietness of the interior is amazing and the engine is very smooth and ""purrs"" softly - even under heavy acceleration.  Heated seats, heated washer fluid and heated steering wheel are great extras, especially in the northeast where I live.  I love the lines of the car and it really does look sporty.  I had always thought that the Buicks were for the old folks - luxurious but lumbering cruise mobiles for the geriatric set.  Boy was I wrong.  Not that this car would appeal much to anyone under 35 in my opinion, but it has a sporty style and a lot of power with all the bells and whistles.  Could not be happier with the purchase.  Next car I'll definitely look at the top end Buicks again.  Best features - cooled seats, heated wiper fluid, ride, sound system, styling.  Worst features - turning radius, a few blind spots (but the blind spot assist is a very good aid)",5

Our Lasabre was a super great car with excellent performance and fuel mileage and reliability . The Lucerne is a 2008 and we have had this car for three years now . While we have had this car the water pump has been replaced and we have had numerous issues with the engine light coming on . The first few times were due to squirrels chewing the spark plug wires on the backside of the engine . After the third time of replacing them I covered them with wire loom and wrapped them with black tape . Then the squirrels chewed a couple other wires on the intake air temperature sensor . I soldered these wires and used heat shrink tubing over them . While I cannot blame the car or manufacture for these issues this was just the beginning of the issues . The engine light keeps coming on for numerous times for electrical issues . It came on due to emissions , traction control , abs and more emissions issues . All of these issues seem to be problems with poor connections at the wire plugs . After the connectors are taken apart and very slightly crimped back together , the issues with those particular sensors go away and a new one comes up . I have been chasing these issues all summer long . The only replacement parts I have put on this car is the water pump , which is a part of normal maintenance . I love this car even mainly for the bucket seats in the front . It doesn't ride or handle as good as the Lesabre did . And it certainly isn't as reliable as the Lesabre . We put on well over 100,000 miles on the Lasabre and had NO issues with it whatsoever . I'm sure this Lucerne is one of Buicks few that is full of electrical issues but I still love this car . The fuel economy is not as good as the Lasabre even though both cars had the famous 3.8 engine . One day I will get all the electrical connections taken care of . It is a little inconvenient to take care of these electrical connections , but it is something I can take care of and it doesn't cost anything but the time to do it . This puts a sour note out there for Buick , but I have had other Buicks with no issues at all .",4

The seats hug you to eventually offer a simple release. The layout of the interior really makes up for the slight flaws found in the car. This would be my 3rd vehicle and previous owner to a Chevy HHR. The good definitely outweighs the bad with this car. The bad: one of the many terrible reviews on this car is the shiny chrome cover surrounding the gear shifter. Be careful, because at a stop light or pulling through a drive through a bright white reflection may beam you right in both eyes, causing you to cover your eyes (with dark window tints, not so much of the sun makes it into the car which is not so bad). I am 5'8"" and about 190lbs (I'm not too big of a guy), but getting into the car, sometimes I knock right into the lower part of the dash. Because I put my right foot in first and proceed to sit down, is maybe the tale tell sign of getting in the car wrong? But I tell you, if forgotten about, it can hurt like hell getting into the car. The acceleration has a bit of resistance also. Given that the car has adapted the eAssist concept of efficiency over power, I would say that its not a deal breaker. At times the media center in the dash can freeze/run slow/display the wrong information (which again, is not a deal breaker because it has happened maybe 5 times out of owning the car for 7 months). Of course not having much trunk space is a downfall. The battery from the eAssist takes up a quarter of the trunk which doesn't play out too well if you like to store lots of tire size objects in your trunk. The rear seats still fold down so that is a positive outlook on it. Speaking of seats, some of the threads are coming out of the leather in the back of the drivers seat, which has me baffled because neither I or the owner before are big guys. The pieces of leather are literally separating, giving a view of about 3 cm wide into the darkness of the inside of the seat. Also the matte material on the door panel (covering window switches and pieces on the steering wheel) have began to chip. I'm not sure what the previous owner did to start it, but it is not pleasing to the eye. The matte material is brown and under is black. So it really looks like the car is cheap when looked at closely. Luckily it does not flake up but only get bigger when scratched (which I assure you, will be kept to an absolute minimal). I am now done nit-picking every issue I have with the car. Honestly, isn't that much. Which is why I rated the car a 5* overall. All issues of mine are cosmetic (other than lack of acceleration, if I wanted power, I would've gotten a Dodge Challenger). I enjoy taking my Regal on a short drive to the grocery store or even hours away to a nearby city. The Regal hasn't failed me so far and has managed to slightly surpass my own first impression/standards of the car. I look forward for years to come with her.",5

All is not well, however.  The shiny chrome on the gear shift lever can shine in your eyes badly enough to be a safety hazard.  The infotainment system was ""okay"" but the controls are poor.  Particularly irritating was the fact that every single time (!) you'd turn on the ignition, it would ""automatically"" (but not wanted) start to play either (a) Bluetooth songs from my wife's phone or (b) songs from the USB flash drive that I brought along.

It is very underrated by reviewers. My Buick Regal is a 2015, Premium II with some added features like sunroof. This car has outstanding acceleration while achieving overall 26 MPG. Driving comfort is fantastic with the most comfortable seats. Controls are well placed. I saw reviews mentioning the window button placement and heated seat buttons, these are overstated complaints and are non-issues. This car is sporty with the patented Buick smooth ride. Great road feel but with top of the line ride comfort. The car appearance is understated and classy. I love the front end grill. This car has all the bells and whistles you can ask for. Standard bumper to bumper warranty of 4 years, 48,000 miles. Buick dealer service is outstanding. When purchasing, dealer was willing to work with me on price. Excellent value. If you are looking for a quality mid size vehicle, you cannot go wrong. Compare to the overpriced BMW, Audi, Acura, Infinity, Lexus and you will appreciate the quality and value of the Buick.",5
1442, on 10/27/15 14:13 PM (PDT),Karina Espinoza ,2015 Buick Regal Sedan Premium II 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),"Good Car, but some Disappointments"," I'm about 8,000 miles into my 2015 Buick Regal (Premium II) class and I've had it for about 7 months now.  It drives really well and feels comfortable enough behind the wheel; However the interior has a few problems.  In order for me to access the window/lock buttons I have to contort my body a bit and bend my arm considerably (I'm 6' 1""), it's not natural.  Also, for me to access the storage console in the center, I have to reach back and put my body and arm in an awkward and uncomfortable position to open it... Basically, should not do this while driving as it can be dangerous.  My other cars allowed my arms to comfortably go off the steering wheel and to the window switch with ease rather than have to start bending and contorting... Same with the center storage console.Visibility while backing up and changing lanes is not so good.  You really have to depend on the camera; However, the camera in my vehicle is too bright during the day and has poor detail, so it's not very reliable.Finally, the ""Infotainment"" console has had some glitches in just the 7 months, which makes me feel it's just a matter of time before something goes bad:1) Within 3 Months the temperature gauge stopped working consistently... it takes about 10 minutes to start gauging the right temperature outside.2) twice I've entered my car to a loud buzzing sound that stopped once I turned the vehicle on.3) twice I've pressed my ignition button and the car wouldn't wouldn't start (as if the battery was dying).4) Several times when I've turned my vehicle on, the console has ""glitches out"" shut off and then turned back on.5) Once, after reversing and going into drive, the parking camera stayed on for the entire time I was driving and never switched back to my radio/console view.6) Many times I've adjusted the volume and it switched my radio channel instead.7) When my front windshield gets fogged up, the ""defroster"" seems to not work AT ALL.  I've tried different combos of settings, but nothing seems to work.I took it in once for a minor issue and told them about the issues and they said there was nothing they could really do about it yet.",4
1443, on 10/25/15 06:51 AM (PDT),Daniel Wal ,2015 Buick Regal Sedan Premium I 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),First Buick after five Cadillacs," UPDATE:  10/26/2016 - it's been 18 months, my Regal is still going strong.  Lifetime (40K miles) MPG is up 30 - amazing for a sporty car that loves being revved.  I didn't mention previously, but one of my favorite features is OnStar Remote Link - being able to track where my car is, start it, check vitals, etc. from my phone is such a convenience - you'll wonder how you live without it. Lately, we've noticed some squeaking coming from the dash - it's not too bad yet, and we have put a LOT of miles on this car.  Next time she goes in for an oil change, I'll ask dealer to take a look/listen.Dealer service department is A+ - Premier Autoplex in Livingston - couldn't be friendly or provide better service.  I don't take my vehicles anyplace but the GM dealer for servicing.  The price is in line with competition and they know their vehicles better (I've know people who've tried to 'cheap out' and ended up ruining their cars because their ""Average Joe"" mechanic didn't know enough about their vehicle to maintain/fix it properly).   Like all GM vehicles, the Regal suffers from being 'unknown' and American.  So many people are devoted to Honda or Toyota that they won't even test drive other vehicles - and they lose out.  I am pleased every time I see, get in, or drive my Regal - it's just about the perfect car... Great gas mileage, excellent road manners, fast, comfortable (if you'll notice, we put on about 150 miles every day... we're in the car well over two hours every day, so comfort is important), very well equipped for a $30K vehicle, and reliable.  Update: 4/2016Well, it's been a year with my Regal and my first impression hasn't changed much.  It's still an awesome car.  As luxurious as my previous Cadillacs, but with a much easier to use instrument panel (real buttons!!!).  MPG is up to 28.5 - and I don't have a feather foot in any way, although we do a majority of our driving on the highway (about 150 miles, round trip daily).  The only quibbles:  1.) The computer that senses the remote had to be replaced (under warranty) - it wasn't recognizing the fobs - worrisome in a car that was less than a year old;  2.) The interior has a few squeaks - not surprising with a sunroof, I guess, but there are some annoying buzzes that we can't locate.  We still love the car's power, handling, braking, and of course, the outstanding fuel economy.  We routinely see over 30 MPG, average.  It's too bad this car doesn't sell better - it's one of the best vehicles GM sells, for that matter, any manufacturer.  It's a great buy, in my opinion. Original Review:So, after five Cadillacs (3 STSs, and 2 CTSs), I decided to try the Buick Regal.  I liked the size and fuel economy (we commute 150 miles daily).  I couldn't stand the CUE interface in the Cadillac and was a little dismayed that the same basic system is used in the Buick.  I have to say, though, that it works much better in the Buick - there are hard buttons for the climate controls and radio - very nice.  The individual temp controls and seat heater controls are a weird touch-panel that doesn't work very well - Buick should have just used hard buttons like the rest of the climate controls. The front seats are very comfortable and there is plenty of room.  The center console is a bit small, as is the glove box, but this is a fairly small vehicle so I guess that's to be expected.  The back seat looks nice, but it also looks very cramped although my 5'6"" mom doesn't complain at all, even when she sits behind the driver seat (I'm 6'4"").   The trunk is spacious and the Premium I package includes almost everything my Caddy's had (except, alas, ventilated seats). Driving dynamics are great - she's fast, fluid, and agile.  Passing is a piece of cake, the brakes are monsters, and the ride is well-controlled (definitely not grandma's Buick).  The Navigation, like CUE and other GM products is flaky - we end up using our phones more than the car's nav.  Also, the split functionality (between the nav and the instrument panel) is a very strange design - sometimes the system initially 'finds' a destination, but then the navigation system cannot... routing is also terrible... more than once GM's Navigation systems have tried taking us down non-existent roads. Fuel economy is great for the size and performance.  The 2.0 Turbo is plenty powerful and we always use premium ""Top Tier"" gasoline.",5
1444, on 07/24/15 12:54 PM (PDT),Mike Trainor ,2015 Buick Regal Sedan GS 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Jury is still out," At only 700 miles, it is hard to judge a brand new car. So take that into consideration as you read this. And, it will be helpful to know that I was NOT shopping Buicks - at all - before I bought this. In fact, I wasn't shopping ANY car that had an MSRP more than $30K, and this Regal GS was stickered at nearly $41K. So what happened here?I had been driving a 2012 Hyundai Elantra Limited and wanted a car with more HP & torque, better handling and more tech features. First looked at the new Elantra's - nope. Looked at Mazda 3s - nope. Cruze, nope. Mustang... well, not more than $30K so that was out of the question anyway. Not interested in anything Toyota had, nor Honda for that matter. Wife mentions Buick one day. BUICK??? Oh... yeah... the Verano! So, I decided on July 4 to shop them, not really expecting the dealer to be open. They were.Before I knew it, I was test driving a Regal T premium, but didn't like the interior. Saavy sales rep finds a GS out back and convinces me to drive it. Sure, why not drive a freakin' $40,000 car!!! Anyway, to sum it up, I bought the thing. Not that day, but later next week. So, enough on how I got into this car, here's my summary review:Overall:  4 stars because 3 wasn't enough and there's no 3-1/2. It IS a NICE car, but some things are missing.Performance:  I don't have a great basis for comparison. Last ""fast car"" I drove was '74 Chevelle SS with a 454 v8. But... the Regal does move and moves quickly - once you get past the turbo lag. The acceleration and power curve are quite nice after that. At slower speeds, 25 - 35 say, it can hardly get out of its own way unless you put your foot into it. Steering and road holding I think I very good - feels solid, good feedback. BMW drivers might find it dull and lumbering, but for me, it is more than adequate and would not fear driving this car 120 mph. Especially because the Brembo brakes are confidence inspiring. What kinda sucks is the tranny when you shift on your own. I'm still learning where this car needs to be on the rpms, but it is SO quiet, and quick, that I didn't realize I was up to almost 4000 rpms and still in second. She didn''t like that very much. in more normal driving, ahem, I found while the shifts are smooth, there's no audible feedback from the engine. keep your eye on the rpm guage!! but... see... you need your eyes on the road and your ears on the engine. other than that, shifts fine and you can toss this car around pretty well. but she's heavy. this, of course, coming from being used to a featherweight Elantra. just driving as an automatic, shifts are smooth and about where you would expect, and want, them to be, even under heavy acceleration. Comfort-Interior -- For the money, she's quite comfortable. Seats are firm(er) in the GS model which has an upgraded seat and leather package, but they fit me well. The car fits me well in fact. I'm 6'0"" and about 180 lbs. The front is a bit narrow, but I still have plenty of elbow and hip room. Seats provide thigh support right where I need it. Headroom, even with the sunroof, is fine, plenty of clearance. Someone at 250 might not fit as well. Controls are all relatively well-laid out, similar in some ways to the Elantra, so i'm not having any issues in finding where things are, and everything is within easy reach. except two things.....Nitpick alert! One negative about the interior design is where the window controls and outside mirror control are. In the Elantra, resting my elbow on the door grip in a comfortable spot at my side, my fingers fell right onto those, with only a slight reach forward to the mirror control. In the Regal, I have to bring my hand back almost a full hand-length and LOOK as to which button do I have, front window or back window?I also find quite annoying where the door grip is. The interior features a nice swooshy grab bar in fake metal. it's okay to use when closing the door. but when opening it, the grip is a bit far forward, making an already heavy door even heavier because you're pushing it open too far forward. and here's the gotchya - there is no grip in the elbow rest part of the door, no place for your hand. Cheap, GM, very cheap.As noted, this car is quiet. In fact, I've never been in a quieter car save for a fun little drive in an 80s vintage Rolls Royce. But also noted, that's a negative when it comes to hearing the engine, or exhaust.Visibility is mostly okay, but out the back and over the shoulder are tougher. The B pillar is pretty wide... you'll quickly learn to use, and appreciate, the blind spot warning in the mirrors. Rear is smallish and narrow, but hardly an obstacle. The Mazda 3 hatchback was much, much worse.As to instrumentation, well, there's a learning curve there, but it's all there if you want it, including oil temp and pressure, friction bubble (wha???), and a whole mess of other stuff. Not the easiest to use and could stand a bit more ability to customize, but I find it complete, easy to read. ###",4

Reminds me of my days during Vietnam squirming into a Navy fighter. This Buick is fast, powerful, quiet, rides well and has all the bells and whistles. Acceleration with the turbo will blow most other cars away. Shifting by the Auto transmission could be smoother, and I did not care for the ""auto-manual"" mode available by slapping the gear selector sudeways. The car is VERY quiet at speed on the highway, I recommend using cruise control so you do not creep up to 120 mph like I did once in Arizona.

Several pieces of the interior started flaking making the inside look like crap!  I had the onstar antenna replaced twice.  My headlights fill up with moisture and water, which by the way is not covered under warranty, so I have to have crappy looking headlights.  I had an oil consumption problem as well and at 45000 miles the pistons and rings had to be replaced!!  Now at 46000 mile the transmission is acting up again and needs to be fixed!  If I did not purchase an extended warranty I would have been screwed!!!! The total cost is at $3000.00 to fix it.   I have a warranty till October 2019 and after that this car is being traded in!!!!

It was my first car and I fell in love with it. Not even a few weeks later I started having problems and a lot of recalls. My AC was broken and had gotten fixed. Now it has this terrible smell to it and i cant turn on the heat or the AC while in parked or when i am stopped somewhere because then my engine will make this terrible loud noise that sounds like its gonna break down. Also my trunk broke less then a year of having it so i was having to use my remote car key until that also broke too so now i cant get into my trunk anymore. My key ignition is also broke and keeps making a dinging sound when i have my door open even when my keys are not in there. I've had to have my car towed so many times for my computer shutting down and having to be restarted and another time finding a lot of water in my fuel tank. Then driving around and my car is always making noises and doesn't want to accelerate. But my main problem here is that when I'm driving my car it will completely lose power on me and shut off. I've had it happen 3 times so far and 1 time i was driving 65 in the middle of the night when i lost power, my steering wheel locked up and all my lights shut off and didn't want to start back up. I was so scared i was going to get hit luckily a few minutes later it came back on. I told GM about this the 1st time and they said they fixed the problem it was also under warranty at that time. A few months later the same thing I took it in and they said that my warranty ran out and they need to replace the pistons and the head gaskets and pretty much replace the whole engine which was gonna cost me a few grand. They said my car is burning through so much oil way more then it should be so i had to have them document it so they could send the documentation to GM so they can cover some of the cost since my warranty just ran out but then after all of that they said its burning way more oil then it should be but it still says its up to GM standards i couldn't believe it what a joke. I've also had so many more problems with this car and its costing me so much money. They wont do anything about this until i die in an accident. I am so scared to drive this car but i have no choice i still have 4 years to pay it off and i cant afford to trade it in. I just wish GM would take care of their mistakes. All i know is that i will never buy a GM vehicle ever again.",2
1507, on 08/23/16 17:20 PM (PDT),John H. Wilde ,2011 Buick Regal Sedan CXL 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Good ol' Bruno," This is not most people's idea of a Buick. Our chocolate brown Regal turns heads! When I loaned it to my daughter co-workers asked her if she'd found a sugar daddy. Even my teen aged granddaughter's friends said it looked like a good ride. But the Regal is more than just a pretty face. Seats are long distance comfortable, and the passenger seat has lumbar support, something that a lot of pricier cars don't have. (Wake up Lacrosse.) The interior is tastefully elegant. Fit and finish are excellent. Quiet, especially in regard to wind and engine noise, firm but comfortable ride that keeps driver alert. Handles nicely. Engine is adequate for my needs. Good brakes. Easy on tires. Reasonable gas mileage if I drive conservatively. I didn't know how to answer the questions on technology since I don't give a flip about navigation, Bluetooth etc. I don't even use cruise control. As for entertainment, I hardly ever turn of the radio. I'd prefer a manual emergency brake, but I can live with the electric unit. Few complaints. Visibility could be better, the headrests are too big and exterior mirrors too small. And I'm thinking of installing a backup camera. Rear obstacle sensors are useless. For some reason it's hard to keep the exterior clean. Back seat is a bit cramped for anyone over 5'10"". I can't understand why this car doesn't hold its value. I've owned over 85 cars, starting with a 1929 Model A Ford, and I'd rate the Regal in the top five.",5

It was  a GM showcase car that sat in a wear house for 3 years . We got a great deal and loved the car .It has great looks with its Mettalic black paint and a great black leather interior. Even 5 years later we still get compliments on it is looks . Not long after we had it ,the engine started making a horrible noise. We found out there was a recall on the timing chain . Our local dealer took care of it and Buick provided us a rental car for the entire time . We have had our local Buick dealer provide all scheduled maintenance on it . Again after a year the noise came back and again the timing chain needed to be replaced.  While still under factory warranty GM took care of it . Soon after our factory warranty ran out. Regretting that we did not purchase a extended warranty. Since our last GM cars have been great and with no issues .Now after 34000 miles our transmission went out and had to be totally rebuilt.  Luckily Buick was able to cover 60% of the 3400. dollars that it was going to cost us . Now I am concerned about the reliability of this car and considering trading it in .  Since it was a chilly night my wife and I both turned on our heated seats . We soon found out that the heated seats quit working . Then my wife went to move the power seat forward and we heard a grinding noise and the gears underneath the seat stripped out . I am convinced we now have a lemon . We are very disappointed since we both like the car but do not trust it anymore. With less than 35000 miles on it. We a now very concerned.",2

The sportiness and looks and features are great. The radio is too many buttons and they have changed it on newer models. My 2015 F150 Supercrew 2.7 Ecoboost (twin turbo) mileage advertised is 19/26. I averaged 18 all around but mid to high 20's on highway. I would have thought this tiny regal would do better just looking at it's small size. It looks almost exactly like the Verano until you see the swooping curve on the side is opposite. It feels compact but labeled a mid size. Nice to drive, fun even. I like it but many other cars loaded similarly do better on gas and the larger buicks can even beat it. Overall happy I just did not expect truck like gas mileage but it is a lot easier to part. 13K for a 2011 with 48K miles. I was shopping for a Cadillac CTS but when I saw this I jumped on it. The European styling similar to a BMW/AUDI is nice. Overall happy and trying like crazy to keep the foot pedal off the floor for better mileage, the first fill up the average was 16mpg....",4
1511, on 11/11/15 15:25 PM (PST),Newton Farmer ,2011 Buick Regal Sedan CXL 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Fun Car," This is a fun car to drive.  It would be great if it had a little more horsepower.  However, the 4 cyl. turbo has enough kick to be fun, and the sport transmission setting stiffens the handling enough to give the car a 'Corvettish' feel and like you are driving more than a family sedan.  The gas mileage in town is average probably because I like to ""goose it"" for the thrill of the turbo kicking in.  However, the trip mileage is phenomenal at easily 30+ mpg.  The back seat room is a tad small and the car sits really low.  However, I knew this going in and like the low slung look with the stock, wider than average tires.  The only real gripe I have about the car are the dash gages.  They are set back fairly deep in their chrome housings and maybe the lenses are not angled as well as they should be.

My Buick was made in Germany.  In the rest of the world it is an Opel Insignia which has been a European Car of the Year several times.  I also drive a Volvo, which in my opinion, has the best seats of any car maker - hence I can't laud the Buick's seats.  They are comfortable and I can drive for hours without any discomfort.  The technology takes a bit of time to learn.  If you can read a manual, watch a DVD and Google you can learn these electronics easily.  I DO NOT like the electric parking brake!  Call me old school, but I would be happy to have a mechanical interface return.  In emergency maneuvers, the car rivals any vehicle I have owned - BMW, Volvo, Audi, Saab, etc.... In some ways it is even better with the Stabilitrak stepping in to direct the car accordingly and allow one to avoid potential accidents without relying on anti-lock braking.  The brakes are also stellar.The interior is exceedingly quiet.  I have found myself speeding more in this vehicle then probably any other I have owned.  It handles well and in Sport mode is very tuned in and fast.  The headlights are also incredible - almost like daylight.  I also want to praise the Harman Kardon sound system, quite amazing.I think driving the car will speak for itself.  As a certified vehicle there have been no maintenance or out of pocket costs and my local dealer is super.",4

It's still in great shape and I take good care of her; she's never let me down.  I highly recommend this vehicle.  The back seating area can be a little tight if the front seats are pushed back.  The trunk is enormous.  I just wish it had 8 way power seats rather than 6 way and that the a/c vents had the 6 way vents (up, down, left to right, on-off wheel) like my Oldsmobile had.",5
1591, on 04/05/17 09:43 AM (PDT),Dre Waters ,2002 Buick Regal Sedan LS 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 4A),Pontiac engine... not much though., Our grandmother gave us this car because our 94 Plymouth Voyager finally gave out. She only drove it to the country club and the store. They took a Honda CRV for road trips. Now my family travels alot. So we took it down to florida and the car couldn't get over 55MPG comming back. O2 Sensor or MAF sensor would go out alot so that would stand us at a intersection. It has a basic looking exterior and interior. Has Monsoon Speakers in the car so they have some good sound.  Handlebars and cup holers are really cheep so they break easily. Taillight replacement is a pain in the but trying to replace the four trunk ones. The Dashboard killed it's self and that had to be replaced. (I think 2000 to rebuild or replace) I wouldn't buy this car if a person does not want to pay money to replace a lot of things. (Many more issues I cannot remember)   No bluetoth or MP3/Aux Input. It's getting traded in today.,2
1592, on 12/17/15 19:31 PM (PST),Ryan ,2002 Buick Regal Sedan LS 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 4A),Long Term Review," My family owned this car for around 9 years.  It was my first car and I took a lot of pride in it as it is a car to be proud of.  We had a special edition style and handling package with two tone paint and firmer, more reactive suspension.  While the car isn't particularly special in the curves, it felt awesome until you near the limit and realize how front heavy it is.  The engine was plenty powerful to have fun with, and consistently gave me 29 mpg HWY without fail.  ABS worked great.  Traction control worked surprisingly well even in deep snow up to the bumper.  Never got my car stuck in the winter except for once when it was practically buried overnight.  We did have some problems over the course of the ownership.  The worst one was the ignition switch which shut the car off in heavy traffic.  Other than that, we also had to replace the swaybar, a window motor, window switches, AC clutch, 3 wheel bearings, fender rust and well that's about it.  Pretty good car, but still nickle and dimed over the years.  Probably cost less then 2k for everything over 9 years.  It was really built well though.  Maintained it perfectly and it was still driving like new at almost 170k.  There were no weird squeaks, rattles or anything which is amazing considering how high quality the monsoon radio and speaker system was.  YOU WANT THE MONSOON!  The only wear it showed were a few chips on the aftermarket hood, some fine cracks in the leather, and a light tick from a lifter in the bullet proof Buick 3.8L until she warmed up.  Car was broke in but showed no signs of slowing down.  I trusted it fully to the day I sold it.  It wasn't babied either.  Maintained and  serviced well was not used lightly.  Ditched during winter twice, but no damage was ever taken.",4

Looks and runs like new, great power, luscious leather interior (spotless), one of the finest sound systems I've ever heard, hugs the road like a bear. I absolutely love this car. The only other car I loved this much was a 1974 Volvo that we put 360,000 miles on. I don't know if I'll get the same with the Regal, but I do know that maintenance is key to vehicle longevity.

Amazing gas mileage, only spent around $200 from RI to South Dakota, with gas around 3.50. Bought this car a year ago, at 3k with 115 thou.

This year we decided we would get a used car and I was searching the net. I found our old Buick at a dealership about 40 miles from here and it had less than 60K miles on it.  It had aroudn 32K when I traded.  The dealership had bought it at an auction, but the car was still in great shape.  We missed car after getting the LacCross and are very happy we found it again.

Also, my Low Coolant light came on, I took to my garage and all was fine, reserve was low but not empty, radiator was full.

I have enjoyed driving all these cars.  The 1998 was leaking oil (small amt.), but ran so good I did not want to get rid of it.  I decided that updating to 2002 was a wise move. I tried a 2006 Chev. Impala, but liked the ride and performance of the Buick so much more. Having just purchased it 4-13-06 I have to drive it more and see if it compares as well as the l998, which was excellent.

Then once I drove it was so quiet and nice and the acceleration for a 4 cylinder was amazing compared to the Equinox that I was driving before. My only complaint is the storage between the seats. When someone is with me there is no where to put my purse, or my dog who likes to sit on the console.  Getting in and out at first was a change for me from a SUV. But if you put the seat in the highest upward position it helps a lot. The trunk is amazing, more room than my suv by far. I would of liked to have the beeping on back up along with the camera, which I had before letting me know I am getting too close.  But it gets great gas mileage compared to my 4 cylinder SUV. I average around 26 MPG, with the Equinox I got 21. The leather is nice on the seats, it has a clothed material around the edge to keep the seats from cracking from ware like transitional leather seats. And the inside trim is accented with a nice chrome color.  The Touch screen is wonderful also.  I have about 7,800 miles on mine so far, acceleration still wonderful on it. Also the AC is nice and cold. I have a White Regal with Black Interior, the AC cools it pretty quickly as July has been a hot month. Also, this car is not for Middle Class and Retirees only.

Sporty and strong describes this engine.  Pulls hard up to 100 mph.  The interior design is classy and tasteful and all the controls are easy.  Riding in this car makes you feel like you're in a much more expensive , luxury sports sedan.  It's ""Buick"" quite, but gives you the feedback you need to drive it hard.  The seats are nice and comfortable and there are no blind spots to speak of.  I'd put this car up against anything germany or japan have to offer and if they beat this car in any category, you can bet that it would be by one that cost $20k more than this Regal.",5

I still love the look and feel of the car. However, it needs to be a V6. It really whines when you floor it to get up to speed. The infotainment system is AWFUL. Slow response to finger touches or voice commands. Drops blue tooth calls. voice activation is terrible. It never understands what I am trying to say. The best feature is the adaptive cruise control. I must have on any car I buy in the future.Overall, I am still satisfied with the car. I enjoy getting into it and driving everyday. However, for $40+k I expect a better electronic system.",4

1640, on 02/18/17 05:27 AM (PST),Judy ,2000 Buick Regal Sedan GS 4dr Sedan,Best Used Car Purchase EVER!," Today is 8/26/17.  I bought my Buick Regal GSE Supercharged on 9/26/16.  It had 116,102 miles on it.  It now has 140,343 miles on it.  (I work 45 miles away from home - one way.  I travel to work 4x a week). Including the owner that I bought it from, it had 3 prior owners.  The original owner was a elderly lady that drove it to the local grocery store and to church; a family member inherited it but didn't drive it much; then the guy that I bought it from owned it.  Before I purchased the car, I did a Carfax on it and got a buy back guarantee through Carfax.  I also got every single maintenance record on the car since it's original purchase.  During the prior owner's possession, he had regular maintenance stuff done plus a new blower motor for ac and heat, the engine valve cover (which was covered under warranty), tie rod ends and wheel bearings hub assembly.  At 118,212 miles- I had to replace the EGR valve  ($334.60).  At 126,863 miles- I had to replace the radiator (502.99).  At 135,965 miles- I had to replace the Mass Air Flow Sensor on it (I left for work for lunch one afternoon, the check engine light illuminated and the car acted like it was going to die, then it surged and sputtered then died.  It came back on and did it again - so I had it towed to my mechanic and they did the diagnostics on it and determined it was the MAF sensor).  I also replaced the serpentine belt replaced on it at the same time ($494.22).  The car runs great!  What I don't like are two things:  1) the cup holder in the center console is annoying to use.  I usually don't use it.  2) and I hate this......the Power Steering Pump reservoir is a pain in the buttocks to access and fill!!!!!!  I had to get on a stool, stick nearly my entire arm down in the engine just to get the cap off.  Then I had to use TWO long neck funnels to get the fluid into the reservoir without spilling it everywhere.  I have been very pleased with this car.  She is pretty quick too.  :)  Handles well and rides smooth.  I currently have Yokohama tires on it.  I did have Michelin Defenders but had to downgrade for financial reasons. :)",5

I bought my LSE after getting fed up with being $1000'd to death by Mercedes and BMW.  Thought I'd give a Buick a try, but wasn't really expecting much, considering it was a, well, BUICK.  Boy, was I surprised!  This is my favorite car ever, and I don't say that lightly.  Gets 32 mpg on long trips, has the touring suspension and corners like it's on rails.  As most Mercedes owners will admit, the cruise control and A/C are unreliable at best.  This dual zone automatic climate control is faultless, EVERYTHING ALWAYS WORKS as it should, and this car is really loaded up with options like a Cadillac.  It is absolutely reliable, smooth riding, good power, and fun to drive.  Mercedes could learn a thing or two from this car's reliability, so could BMW.   IF you find one of these LSE models and you don't buy it, you should kick yourself hard.  So it's a 2000 model, you'll get tired of it before you'll ever sear it out.  The only weak spot is the front wheel bearings which you will need to replace by 100K miles. It's a simple DIY job. Dont buy the cheap Chinese aftermarket bearings. Go for the Timken.",5

This is a very reliable car! It never broke down or left me stranded. There is one thing that you must fix if you buy one of these cars with the 3.8L, and that is the lower intake manifold and gasket. I had mine fixed at 94,000 miles and never any problems. The only other thing I changed out was the front and rear brake rotors due to warped rotors.  Do the scheduled coolant and transmission flushes and it will serve you a long time.

Mileage on long highway drives goes over 25 MPG. It left me on the road only twice. Once with a blown water pump three years ago and more recently, something with the supercharger and I had to cut away the tangled belts and limp to a repair station with no power steering.

Most recently the drivers door window (power) went out and it cost me 550 dollars to have it fixed. The motor worked but the cable broke. On an earlier situation the front end drug with any dip and the result was a damaged oil pan. Little things like only partial LED digits on the radio and dashboard readout. According to the computer my mileage of 20.1 mpg in city driving is actually questionable as my computations never reached that high. I have a very light foot unless I find myself in a bind and need power to escape a challenge in traffic. No more Buicks for me.

When this car starts costing me too much in repairs, I'm buying a Honda,  We've always bought American (GM, specifically), but have come to the realization that they (GM)still don't know how to build true ""quality"" products.

From the first day I drove it I was impressed with its comfort and performance. I have had it for close to a year now and I cannot picture driving any other car. To be honest, this car feels about as close to a Jaguar as GM will probably ever get. However, the exhaust is a bit wimpy and a Pontiac Grand Prix exhaust would be perfect for the Regal. Also the headrests are very small and do not support the head whatsoever. I'm searching for Century headrests to put in so I can feel safe if I get into an accident, God forbid.

This car provides me with generous torque and really moves around town when the super kicks in.  I was expecting a little bit softer ride from a Buick, but the comfortable seats compensate well.

I'm gradually developing small quibbles over the traditional American build quality, but nothing that taints my overall happiness with this vehicle.

And it looks fantastic, especially with the 18"" or 19"" rims. Content is good too, for the price. Now, the issues: first, the mileage for the eAssist hybrid I have is WAY overstated - I drive 70% highway and never get more than 24 MPGs. Lack of power and harshness in non-Turbo engines is noticable. Quality control still has a way to go, e.g. paint flaws & loose trim. If I had gotten the turbo or GS, I'd rate it a solid A.

1748, on 03/25/18 08:57 AM (PDT),Jonnyess ,2012 Buick Regal GS GS 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Where do I begin??!!," This is my first ""American"" car in estimated 1M lifetime miles....Toyota, then Nissan, always had what I wanted to drive...6 speed, coupe, leather, sunroof  etc. Well, that all changed in recent years and I didnt want to splurge on an Audi simply because prefer a manual transmission. Doing some research on my next vehicle after my Altima Coupe turned into a money pit at 155k, I stumbled onto Buick and the redesigned Regal with its 6sp turbo. I did tons of consumer research before purchasing, and all indications were favorable.   Fast forward 2 years this week, and here's my laundry list: MPG has never approximated the published EPA estimates - Turbo lag is very pronounced in lower gears...-front axle and wheel bearing needed replacing at 30k (CPO warranty covered)  - trunk light fixture failed at 30K (not covered)...the GPS SD card fails intermittently, system reboot needed to recover...bluetooth will randomly disconnect from my Android, has actually completely redacted itself from the vehicle on 2 occasions...lack of rear camera is mind boggling at this price point (as others have mentioned)...the rear trunk will randomly fail to open...the OEM carpeted floor mats are comically thin and low quality...the interior lights will randomly fail when opening car doors in a dark garage....the passenger visor tension rod failed at 40K, cannot be repaired: $120 for replacement. The drivers side seat heater has failed at 57k...the stereo IQ reverts to default settings once the car is turned off...received 2 CEL codes accompanied by loss of power, white exhaust, rough idle at 50k...warranty had expired due to date of vehicle initial title...fuel injectors were replaced ($900) and dealer advised ""we spoke with GM tech support, and that white smoke from exhaust MAY be due to cracked piston...""  !!??  Received 2 different CEL codes within 24 hours, brought vehicle back to local dealer, {who was in the process of going out of business, but checked the vehicle}, advised gratis the problem was not the ""throttle body"" as indicated, and suggested I bring to another dealer for a deep dive. After 2 days, dealer called and advised I need new engine or complete rebuild, as there ""was no oil in pan...it was throughout the system"" and the exact cause simply could not be pinpointed. GM refused to extend the expired warranty, despite my arguments re low mileage, finally agreed to meet me halfway and the engine rebuild subsequently cost me $3300, on top of the $900 I had just spent on the initial problem. Unlimited mileage/12 mo warranty. The car now drives beautifully as one might expect after this type of spend. The handling and ride have always been top notch, and the design is clearly a head-turner. GM is the problem here, and this will likely be my last purchase.",1
1749, on 07/22/15 08:35 AM (PDT),Josh ,2012 Buick Regal GS GS 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6M),Fantastic Driver with some Shortcomings," I purchased this car over a year ago to replace a 2010 Mercury Milan Hybrid that had recently surpassed 100,000 miles. I wanted something that would be fun to drive and that had a manual transmission.  This car checked (most of) the boxes for my needs, after a year with it, however, this will be my last GM for a while.The good: The turbocharged motor and manual transmission combination is great! Clutch and shifts are smooth and engage easily. The torque band is very wide and pulls the Regal up to (and over) legal highway speeds, quickly and quietly. The interior is quiet and comfortable around town and on long trips. The bad: Trying to use/figure out the buttons on the steering wheel/center console/touch screen is miserable and very confusing.  Voice recognition only works for certain functions, much worse than the SYNC in my previous car.  No rear-view camera, on a vehicle at this price point trying to compete with entry-level luxury cars, a rear-view camera should be standard.  The graphics for the navigation are acceptable, at best. QUALITY (or lack thereof) - my car has been in the shop 6 times in the past year for small repairs, blower motor on the climate control randomly cuts out, 4 rear light bulbs (no access panels in trunk, have to remove carpet surrounding the trunk to replace), sun visor mirror cover shattered apart, and grommets holding the floor mats to the floor sprung apart.   The plastics on the interior feel cheap and look cheaper.  The lack of storage space for front seat occupants is disappointing. Buick has done a fantastic job with the styling and the performance aspect of this car.  It looks and drives fantastic, now if there was more focus placed upon quality and interior components, I'd be fully satisfied.  I'm glad I purchased the Regal, but I'm ready to get into something else.Update: 7/23/2016; 67,000 miles. The car continues to disappoint. I've now been through 6 sets of brake pads/rotors (it's a stick shift, I rarely brake hard). Several more tail light bulbs have burned out. The check engine light is on and the car is trying to stall out upon every shift. There's zero power upon acceleration despite the turbo engaging. I've actually sought out and bought another 2010 Milan because I hate this car so much but owe too much on it to get rid of it. This will definitely be my last GM product for a long time.Update: 1/25/2017; Still own this heap due to being underwater (thanks GM depreciation).  Up to 75k miles - problems mentioned above were fixed at least GM extended the warranty and covered the issues (exhaust gas sensor, cam sensor, and a couple of other misc. issues).  Recently got approved for a personal loan to finance the negative equity - can't wait to sell this car.",2

I chose this over an Audi A4 Avant Quattro (wagon).

At first I liked the Buick much better, but, as time went on, problems made themselves evident. The engine was quite powerful but, in spite of the much-hyped HyPer strut front suspension, torque steer was very pronounced under hard acceleration. In addition, the driver's seat, although comfortable on short jaunts, became a source of torture on long highway runs. The bottom bolsters seemed to be too tight, causing intense hip pain.

Love this car.," We owned a 2012 base Regal with 73,000 that saved my life in a high speed side impact traffic accident. We found a 2016 Regal Tii Premium II with low mileage at our local Buick dealer and took it for a test drive. We were immediately impressed with the obvious improvements in the Buick Regal Tii. We were amazed at the quiet and comfort and the added horsepower of the turbo was a great plus. The Bose stereo system, navigation, blue tooth, Wi-Fi and such and this feels like the car of my retirement dreams. An American brand car that looks better, maintenance affordable and better priced then most of the Audi, BMW etc. over priced foreign models.

My 2011 was not a turbo & it was a dark gray with black  interior.  My wife and I wanted a lighter color outside with a light color interior also.  We bought it in July 2016 when Buick was giving 20% off on certain  models.  We used our GM points from our GM card and the discount on the car listed for 31,000 we paid $23,300 for it. I could not pass up that deal up. The color was   Champagne Silver with cashmere  leather interior. I love the changes  &  improvements they have made since 2011.  My 2016 drives smoother and is quieter & the turbo engine is great. It is real easy to use all of the features this car has to offer. I can get in this car & drive it on a long trip & feel comfortable the whole time. This is only one the second Buick I have owened. I have been driving  since 1972 & have owened a lot of cars & trucks over the years both foreign & domestic.  We have 5 vehicles  now & the Buick is  by far my favorite to drive.  I have test driven other mid sized sedans  but I like the Regal best.",5

Now I don't want the repaired car- at79 years old I don't need the hassle of another problem sometime in the next 3 years of the lease.But of course Buick and the dealer make you sweat blood to get a new one, so I guess I'm stuck,AVOID MY MISTAKE!

1778, on 05/30/17 19:43 PM (PDT),Chayton ,1998 Buick Regal Sedan LS 4dr Sedan,"Evelynn, My Love"," I purchased a 1998 Buick Regal LS for my first car for $3000 with 133,XXX miles. What caught my attention was how easy it was to drive. The car practically drove itself! You could steer with your pinky finger and the ride was so smooth. I loved the heated leather seats, the Concert Sound system, and the whole car in general! I only had 2 issues with my Regal- 1. The MAF sensor and a vacuum hose had dried out so my car would stall going between 30-40 mph, but once these were fixed the car was the love of my life. The seats were so comfortable and the suspension was so supple yet could act swiftly if necessary. Legroom in the front and rear were great as well as the gas mileage (31 MPG highway OMG!). The second problem was my rear brakes failed. I had stopped at an intersection and noticed my brakes felt a little spongy out of nowhere. I made my turn and I was going 38 in a 40 and the woman in a Wrangler in front of me slammed on her brakes. When I slammed on mine, the nose dove down and the ABS activated but a split second later I could feel the brakes quiver and give out. I tried to steer out of the way but couldn't and ended up slamming into the back of the stopped wrangler at 34 MPH. My airbags went off and I hit it hard enough to make me black out for 30 seconds. I had to kick my door open and saw the front end had slid under the Jeep and the passenger compartment almost slid under too. Without that Buick I would probably have been more injured than just having airbag burns and a bad back (from my backpack slamming into the back of my seat). That car that I had loved more than anything had saved my life. I was forced into a Lexus after this but once the Lexus is gone, I will forever only buy Buicks and Cadillacs for the rest of my life.",5

It was well maintained, and never gave me any problems at all. The driver window motor did eventually go out, but that was really the only problem I ever had. It felt like a luxury car, and the supercharger made it really fun to drive. I put 30,000 miles on it in a year, but it drove like brand new. It got pretty good mileage (I averaged about 23 MPG) It was a safe car too, someone rear-ended me on the freeway doing 50 and pushed me into the car ahead of me.

Just took it on a 600 mile trip and the car does not have a single rattle or shake anywhere, cruise control and comfort of the seats on that long trip were amazing. This car still drives like a new one, and Buick has made a lifelong customer out of me, don't miss the Toyota at all, this car is just better in all aspects.

Have owned GS and LS. (98&99)  Love the supercharger but it has added to service costs.  2X CD failures in factory radio. Change oil every 3K and service transmission + filter change every 2 years and this car will get you down the road in comfort plus tight handling (GS).  LS fast enough just have to stomp on gas to get the performance.  Electric Windows are the biggest weakness.  I just lost my GS to freakish but major engine fire.  Something shorted at firewall after my daughter got home from church.  Even with freakish engine fire will likely replace this with another Regal. ,4.75

I try to keep my cars forever and 'over maintain' them, but 10 years is about the limit for a 90s GM car, unfortunately.  Little things start adding up:  sealed headlights are starting to fog up as moisture gets into them, trunk seals are failing somewhere letting rain in, plastic exterior trim pieces are starting to show their age and lack of quality.

I had a Cutlass Ciera before this and the Regal way outclasses that as you might expect. I wanted a cruising-type ride as I have a long freeway commute every day, and something that would handle IT tech calls to businesses with comfort and classy style. Back then ""Government Motors"" could sure build 'em. 96K miles and routine maintenance only. This is a tank-- solid and safe and substantial in every way. Not sportscar handling, but that's what Pontiacs (were) for. This will float you down the interstate in a plush cocoon, and deliver you calm and relaxed. It's automotive comfort food, nearly perfect.

Very smooth ride. Warning, flush dex-cool out right away. If not flushed, it will slowly rot out intake gaskets.  It's not severe but your gasket will start to seep if you never change your coolant.

Mine is gone now - the victim of a side impact directly on the B-pillar from a Dodge 2500 truck.  I miss the car but most importantly, it was built well enough to save my girlfriend's life.

To make a long story short I replaced a transmission solenoid, rack and pinion steering, and fuel pump at my expense (at various times after the warranty ran out). The headlights started getting hazey at about 60,000 miles by the time I sold the car they were almost opaque. The power rear window regulator went bad and it was going to cost $328 to buy the part.

The little extras like access to the air compressor make it sweet. I test drove Honda, Toyota and Nissan - no comparison to the solid, quiet feel of the Rainier.

It was a Dealer certified used car.  I have put nearly 200,000 miles on it to date and other than a few issues I have to say its one of the best cars I have ever owned.  Other than normal maintenance items, unexpected repairs were a catalytic converter at just over 100,000 miles (thanks Baltimore for all the potholes) and a failed A/C compressor clutch mechanism.   The compressor was working great but the clutch would stop working after about 20 minutes of driving.  Other than those 2 unexpected repairs I have only had to do normal maintenance items and repairs for wear and tear.  That's to be expected on a car with over 200K miles.  ** Likes**  Comfortable, quiet and handles like it's on rails.  Lots of power and the AWD will not leave you stuck in the snow.  **dislikes**  wish it had more headroom for the driver.  At 6'2"" my head is almost touching the ceiling.  Wish it also had a manual AWD lockup switch.   **Final thoughts**  It's a great car, fun to drive and for a V8 AWD SUV I get an average combined MPG of about 17 commuting in Washington beltway traffic which I do not think is bad.   One last comment:  After 13years of salt and winter driving the car has No RUST. Paint still shines and the body is in great shape, other than a number of rock chips on the hood.  Well made car :-)  Would definitely buy it again if I could.  In fact, I am keeping an eye out for a lower mileage one now.  The V8's are hard to find.",4

I am very tall and need a long seat, the Japanese SUVs were too short seated to give me proper leg or hip support. The ride is quiet, quiet, quiet. I love the XM/CD/ radio/nav system.

We took a hunters trail over a 9000 foot mountain which included crossing creeks and traversing glaciers etc. No Problem for the 2 wheel drive Ranier. The six cylinder engine moves out very nicely.

Drove a few of them and liked it.Most dealers seem to charge 6-8k for these cars but that is way too much for this car. It has a history of tranny and other issues so you need to figure that into the price and bargain them down. This car has been fine. Quiet and smooth on the road. Has some downshifting issues that are well documented on the net but so far mine is manageable. Only 4 speed. Needs 5. Mileage is 17 and 27 just like the sticker says. So far glad I bought the car after 10000 miles of driving. Note: This is my first car with ""leather"" interior so I bought some leather conditioner/cleaner stuff to maintain it. But guess what ! It's actually 80% vinyl. Which I found out is typical of ""leather"" interiors these days. Go figure.At 108,000 still running fine.",3
2068, on 05/20/16 20:01 PM (PDT),Seth ,2007 Buick LaCrosse Sedan CXL 4dr Sedan (3.8L 6cyl 4A),Satan's Buick," So far this has been the 2nd worst car my family has ever owned.  We once sent a neon to the scrap yard with 60,000 miles on it.  This car gets poor gas milage.  On a good day I can get around 22mpg.  I've had at least 3 v8 cars that could get around 25 mpg, and they all had a lot more power.  There is a clunk in the steering that can't seem to get fixed.  There is also a vibration in the front end that won't go away.  The front sway bar snapped.  The drivers door leaks in the rain.  The headlights are always burning out.  The transmission slips and then suddenly slams before it takes off.  It has needed a four wheel alignment.  It was just eating tires.  The writing has rubbed off of the buttons for the radio and the heating and air.  The letters fall off of the outside too.  It just say la rosse.  The CXL is totally gone.  The back seat is very cramped even for children.  When you pop the trunk it is difficult to open unless you have really skinny fingers.  The air bag light goes on and off as you drive.  The traction control and ABS light come on and go off whenever they feel like it.  That doesn't bother me though because when it's slick out the traction control and ABS gets in the way more than it helps on this car.  I like having traction control and ABS usually.  This car is downright dangerous in the snow.  The ABS comes on almost as soon as you touch the pedal.  It will make you miss turns.  Then when you get back on the gas the traction control is there to cut the power.  I feel safer in my 2 wheel drive ford ranger pick up in the snow.  The brakes are not powerful enough even on dry pavement really.  I'm ready to junk this thing with only 120,000 miles on it.  The ranger by that way has 200,000 on it without skipping a beat.  I have tried hard to maintain this car, but its useless.  To me it is obvious why GM needed a bail out and Ford did not.",1

Exterior looks great with chrome package, except rear end is too bland. Interior is typical with fake wood from Buick. More road noise than I expected.  Handles well with a firm ride, not plush, you feel the road. This is not an old  mans car.  The 3800 series 3 is an outstanding motor despite its unrefined feel.  Most of the reviews are, as usual, from newbies and problem cars.  For those of you with steering/pulling issues please consider replacing the intermediate shaft.  There some bad tires out there but tires are frequently a symptom of another problem. Note the difference in alignment with a loaded vehicle if there is a persistent alignment issue.",3.75

Driver side door leaks in rain. Dealers are as frustrated with GM as I am and no relief in site. GM is not authorizing the proper repairs. I think they know what the problem is and are just dragging their feet trying to wear me down. I traded a 1995 Avalon XLS with 263,000 miles and no real problems on this piece of junk.

Car looks great from outside and interior styling is beautiful BUT  Front view, the two forward posts create a very bad blind spot that makes it difficult to see sides in front of you while turning.

Next, I'm small stature 5'5 with all the seat adjustments I still cant get a comfortable seat position, as my knees are always too high. If this seat pivoted forward by a couple of degrees then perhaps it would help. No such problem ever on my Jap cars.          Next. The audio and temp controls. These buttons are small , so fat finger  OH OH is common and getting used to them will take a long while. Also the chrome bezel around the unit glares into your eyes and need to wear sunglasses especially when the sun is in the ten o'clock position. Finally put black electrical tape over it.

It is large, comfortable and quiet inside. We easily fit what are now 3 teenaged girls in the back seat, and my very large husband has no problem getting comfortable behind the wheel for long drives. We have taken the Lacrosse on several 1200-1400 mile trips, and have put about 57,000 miles on it. It accelerates smoothly and is responsive to my admittedly ""lead foot"". In the back, the fold down seats have proven to be handy when bringing home items from the home improvement store, and there is plenty of room for groceries in the trunk. LOVE the Bluetooth for the cell phone! The ambient lighting along the dash at night is a great touch. The interior finishes are great, and are well maintained 5 years later. Gas mileage is ok with the V6 engine, but I do a lot of city driving, as well. I didn't get the backup camera, but wish that I had. A couple of Cons: the Lacrosse has a major blind spot so you do have to be extra careful if you want to change lanes or back out of a parking spot in a crowded lot. The one USB port is inconveniently located. The only problem I have had is with the electronics for the entertainment system, and it didn't happen until the 3 year warranty was up. The stereo/phone system in the car has randomly shut off and on a few times while in use, but for less than a second. Due to it's low profile, if you are very large like my husband, getting in and out of the passenger seat may prove to be annoying. I do still get compliments on it's appearance, interior, and smooth ride. Overall it is a great car and I do not regret purchasing it at all.",5

Materials are top notch, and many of my neighbors who drive foreign cars have expressed their admiration for the interior and exterior design of my LaCrosse.    Safety ratings are in the top 2% of vehicles, which is a primary reason for my purchase.  The HUD (Heads Up Display) is exceptionally well designed and keeps my eyes focused on the road and not in the cockpit.  Active articulated headlights provide superior visibility along the visual line of site, and the radar for parking and lane change is great for enhancing safety.  Cabin is spacious, especially with legroom.  Open-through from trunk and fold down rear seats provides great cargo space. Highly recommend the LaCrosse, although the price point of newer models is out of my price range.  As a 1-year old used vehicle with low mileage, I walked away with an extraordinary value.",5

Sitting inside makes you feel special, its sleek, well appointed, and so very quiet.  Bluetooth and OnStar work flawlessly.  Even though the trunk is small, the pass through seats really help and the front seats are so comfortable with plenty of leg room and comfortable seating for back passengers.   The 2.4L eassist combination has remarkably good pickup for pulling onto the interstate or passing, however the stop/start technology makes it sluggish from a dead-start.  I wouldn't really put the LaCrosse in the same class as a typical hybrid, I would consider it a semi-hybrid, but the regenerative technology is cool.  I am ok with the mileage, I think I will get a little better when I figure out the best driving strategies.  Things I don't like; I found the only usb and the mp3 plug in hidden under the center armrest  which is inconvenient; and the arm rest sets too far back and is very small.  The tilt / telescoping steering column could have been better engineered, as it blocks the speedometer when adjusted to the point I like and it does not adjust nearly enough.

The panoramic power moon roof,  rear camera, rear parking assist, blind side and lane change alerts and 18"" chrome clad wheels all make driving much more fun and safe. Trunk space is generous and, with fold down back seats, the cargo storage area becomes very large. Maintenance is at a minimum with only regularly scheduled service. Overall, a great car from Buick.",5

I don't think this is limited to the Lacrosse.  We didn't notice it on test drive, and I bought the car for my wife because we wanted the Delphi safety features on the high end trim package.  The headrest is too far forward a problem that owners have complained about for years on forums.  Dealers will do nothing to help.  Buick doesn't care.  This is one of the cars traded in most within one year, and I don't this is the reason.   My wife, who is short, refuses to drive it.  Other than this and the fact that the side windows are too small, I like the car very much, but unless I can find a workaround for this, the car must go.  I did find a work around.  Without Buick's help, I removed the headrest , put it in a vice and bent it to a better fit.  The technology is too complicated, especially when I had to show the dealer how to reset the oil change counter.  The touch screen displays can be a distraction while driving. It's a very comfortable and quiet ride.",1

2144, on 11/25/16 21:55 PM (PST),Art Furcar ,2015 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Premium I Group 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Nice ride to be inside," PROS:  This thing is great to sit in.  While not a great driver's car: no steering feedback, heavy feel, slightly mush brakes- it handles very well.  My CPO car came with 18-inch Firestone Firehawk sneakers, not a great rain tire, but we live in the AZ desert, so great for driving here.  The car feels VERY surefooted, and goes right where you point it.  The suspension feels solid, and inspires confidence.  It accelerates quickly, but isn't a barn burner.  CONS: There is no GPS navigation (not requiring OnStar) in these, unless you pay at least $1,500 more.  You have to have an OnStar subscription to get the nav, and it doesn't come with the lower-level (cheaper) subscriptions).  Our car ""chugs"" at about 23 MPH, probably due to the transmission trying to choose the right gear (""hunting"").  Not sure if that's a transmission problem or whether it's a design problem that affects all of these cars.  The USB port is in the center compartment.  There's only one port.  There's a slot in the front of the compartment so you can run cables out without leaving the lid open.  But there's no good place to put a smartphone or other device, except by using both cupholders that are immediately in front of that compartment.CONS:  Seems like it's too complicated for the techs to fix.  We have had our AC compressor replaced (and that still works).  We also had the outside temp reading repaired, and it worked for about 5 months.  Now it's usually off by at least 10 degrees.  It seems to get stuck on a reading that's too low, never too high- just as it was before they fixed it.  They also replaced our battery, because the voltmeter readings jumped around between 11 and 15 volts.  That still happens.  Going back to Hyundai in all probability.  Our car now has about 49K miles.  It's still really comfortable, and drives great.",3

Just the back up warning signal isn't working.  all good... hoping for another 70k - 350k the goal.  I'll let you know.  rust over windshield slightly worse.  I should take care of that....otherwise, added tires, I use Vogue Signature Gold - very reasonable, got 92k on last set.  About 10 k into these - they ride great - definitely best usa tire value performance tire.  I think I paid $492 for the set!  Discountdirecttire.com  try it - free shipping always. Wait for a holiday and get the deals!New update - Just passed the 300,000 mark.  About 10k miles ago my transmission had a leak, turned out it was the front plastic housing - not a serious condition but glad I found the leak.  Fairly simple fix, then they replaced the transmission fluid.  The transmission has always been absolutely perfect!  Still no serious issues with engine.  My front seat is warn out - I suppose 300k will do that... but the air conditioned and heated seats still work great.   So very happy with this car.",5

Steering wheel will turn when riding over bumps, hold on to it. Dash is laid out well and the accent lighting is very becoming. The sunroof slides back evenly with the roof unlike my 2007 which tilted up on an angle and was noisy. Gas mileage is average and the ride can be a little noisy depending on the surface you are driving on. The ride is no longer that cushy ride I had in my 2007 Lacrosse.

Three months later she bought a Honda Accord and couldn't sell this piece of junk. I had a recall on my Grand Prix and got an email from Buick suggesting I consider a Buick for my next purchase. I replied that I I have an 05 Lacrosse and it junk. After a year of back and forth emails they quit responding. 1. Climate control utilizes air conditioning 100% of the time. I turn it off every time I start it to save gas but it as it comes back on when restarted. 2. Replaced hood struts. 3. Replaced rear window regulator which is rarely used. 4. Drivers mirror quit working. 5. Head lights don't turn off until driving in daylight for an hour. 6. Outside temp takes a couple of miles before going to correct temp. 7. On occasion the engine runs rough. Shut it off and restart and its fine. 8. Dash cracked four times in the first year and looks like varicose veins. 9. Wipers quit so I replace the motor. Poor design as the entire mechanism must come out. 10. When there are riders in the back I can hear the wheel bearings grind. Lots of road noise so I believe most of them need replaced. 11. Rear suspension squeaks. 12. Piece of plastic broke in power seat mechanism. Six ways power seat is now four way.  All these problems in the first two years of ownership. I drive it on occasion and now has 49K. Putting miles on my 01 Grand Prix then will put an estimated $1500 in it when I retire. I am not the type to pass on junk to others so will keep it since it is paid off. IF I EVER BUY ANOTHER CAR, IT WONT BE A ""BUICK"". Bring back Pontiac Grand Prixs!I do like the 3.8L engine.

The original tires are about shot and I intend to upgrade with premium rubber. GM needs to put better original tires on its premium models. No problems and my mechanic has raved about the good deal I got from a VW dealer. The car depreciated to where a guy with two kids in college can afford a top line car for the cost of a tin can.

Initially I liked this car very much. I noticed the problem on the first trip of about 150 miles. At highway speeds of 50-65 MPH and trying to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of me. The accelerator pedal seems to have a dead zone. It doesn't respond under normal foot pressure to maintain the speed that traffic flow allowes. As I apply a slight pressure on the gas pedal, nothing happens. As I increase the pressure, a sudden burst of acceleration is felt with the teck jumping 500-750RPM. This unusual condition is very strenuous on long trips of this constant awareness.   ",4

He was aware that the floor is a step down, but did not notice the curve near the rear seat.  The floor that the seat is resting on should be straight, not curved. This could be very dangereous.

There are three issues worth noting: (1) There is a noise in the driver seat when turning,  (2) The manual shift option has caused a problem, but that is because the way I have always driven my cars - with my right hand on the steering wheel, my fingers  accidently have touched the paddle shifter, and that causes the engine to race and the car slows down.  I have to brake to a stop, and then re-start in order to clear it.  I need to learn how the paddle system works, and keep my hands of that section of the steering wheel.  The third issue is noise on uneven pavement.  Frankly, I expected the car to be much quieter in the cabin.  On smooth roads, this car is almost silent,  Gas mileage on latest tank, around town, was 22.41 mpg.  Back seat room on this car is enormous, and the seats, front and back are very comfortable.  The car handles very well, for not being a hot rod or sports car.  Special likes: Blind spot warning system, digital odometer, back up camera,  and GPS which works very well.  OnStar is really nice and it gives me monthly electronic reports on our car.  Overall, very good except for the things mentioned, but they are minor and we will learn.

The car restarted once while I was stopped at a light because the air need to come back on, it did surprise me. However, under normal driving you don't even know that there is start-stop working. The engine is running after you take your foot off of the brake and before you can get to the gas. It does not turn off until the speedometer reads 0.

For a full size car with a big engine and beasty acceleration, I did not expect this much milage. 10+ hours of drive without much of tiredness. It is a very silent car. Cruising at 70mpg, not a noise. You will doubt if the engine is actually running. It has a very rich interior and awesome driver's seat that feels very comfortable for long rides. The dashboard is ergonomically designed with most of the buttons in reach. However, the seating is too low and will sink you down such that you won't see much beyond the dashboard for city rides.

But the seats are uncomfortable.  The seat bottom is hard so the pressure points cause soreness and fatigue to set in within 15 minutes. And the seat back lacks sufficient lumbar support even when the power control is set for maximum support.  Powertrain is smooth and quiet.  Air conditioner cold and powerful.  Gearshift control is unconventional and unintuitive - took me 5 minute to figure out how to shift into reverse.  Ironically, I find several much less expensive full sized cars have more comfortable front seats than the Buick Lacrosse, Toyota Avalon and Lincoln Continental; e.g. the 2018 Toyota Camry and 2017 on up Kia Optima.  As a potential buyer seeking ride and seat comfort, at present my favorite prospect so far is the 2018 Camry LE or XLE as it offers near LaCrosse levels of ride comfort and quietness with much softer, more better shaped seats and superb directional stability on the highway - all important characteristics for fatigue free long distance cruising.",3

We put more than 1000 miles on the car during this time. Pros: The seats are comfortable and the ride is nice. Cons: The controls and instrumentation are awful. The gear shift is very un-intuitive and you cannot go easily from manual shift mode back to automatic without going into neutral. The back-up camera comes on in reverse (duh), but it does not turn off until you roll forward for a while in a forward gear; this is distracting and unlike all the other cars I have driven. The paddle shifters are worse; it's very easy to hit them accidentally, at which point you *have* to shift via them; there is no easy way to go back into full automatic mode... you just wait until GM decides it's the right time to return to auto mode. The engine turns off when you come to a stop... sometimes... others it doesn't. The headlight controls are hidden by your left hand if you drive using 9-3 or 10-2 hand position. The touchscreen must be used for climate control and it's arcane and opaque in terms of getting the air set just right. The audio system controls on the touchscreen were such that I just turned the volume to zero to avoid having to deal with it (why no just turn it off? you ask... well, when I tried that, it turned off the whole touch screen along with the climate control). Overall, the user interface with this car is what I would expect from sophomore level design students who did not have enough time to complete their semester project. If it were simply a matter of getting used to different controls I would be more forgiving, but the controls o this car are just plain bad and would be a nagging irritation for as long as it's owned. Also, the gas tank is small and I had to hit the pumps more often than I expected. Not recommended at all.",2

On the exposed aggregate paving on roads around Seattle the road noise was so loud we could only hear the audio but turning it up to a very high level.  Now that we are back in Florida on smooth roads the ride is OK but there is still a  small vibration evident in the rear view mirror which seems to be coming through the body frame.  The interior quality is excellent and the seats are very  comfortable but the noise problem makes me regret purchasing this vehicle.  One year on after purchase and all of the above still hold true.  Had the dealer check the noise and rear view mirror vibration and he indicated they are both endemic in this model.  No fix available from Buick except to perhaps look into buying a new set of 'softer' riding tires.",3

I had the Lacrosse for a two day drive and was actually surprised how I liked it. The styling both inside and out are much better than older Buicks, much nicer materials and fit and finish. It had a great ride and with the exception of a little road noise over some bad pavement, it was very quiet. There were a only a couple complaints about the car 1) needs more side bolstering in the driver's seat to hold you in better 2) typical GM needs to upgrade their sound system, it was ok but needs much deeper sounds 3) also typical GM needs to work on electronics, the automatic climate control kept turning the fan speed up and down to keep the car cooled where as my Toyota and Lincoln can do it without blasting the fans to maintain the set temp. Just small complaints to an other wise great road trip car.",4

I got a great deal on the Lacrosse since they were running a Memorial Day special with a 16% discount. I built the car I wanted on Edmonds.com at noon and had three offers that were much less than I expected by the end of the day, the lowest of which was from Wilkins Buick in Glen Burnie, MD. The dealer was able to find the exact car I wanted and had it ready for me to pick up in just a couple of days.  I love the interior and exterior styling and the extensive technological features which were very intuitive to learn.",5
2306, on 06/11/17 10:07 AM (PDT),Larry M. Fierstine ,2017 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Essence 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Not Happy," I purchased a 2017 Buick Lacrosse Essence in Dec. 2016. The vehicle has 1550 mi., and has been in the shop twice for wind noise and rattles. The first time the car was in the shop for a recall, I mentioned the wind noise and rattles, the car was in overnight, a part was needed to fix the wind noise, a week later the part came in, had it installed , did not fix the problem, the car stay for an entire week. The jury is still out on the wind noise, but still has rattles. A plastic water bottle in the cup holder rattles. I don't want to have the car constantly in the shop, so I am driving it as is, and will address rattles at the next recall. Design flaws , my wife(5'4"") and I(6') can not get in or out without bumping our heads, roomy luxury! The pass thru is worthless, nothing can safely be retrieved from it unless you stop and crawl into the car to get what you want. The arm rest on the center counsel is to short and does not slide forward for comfort. The cubbies in the doors are horrible, your can not get sunglasses out because the decorative plastic won't allow access to retrieve them from the cubby without again stopping and reaching with your other hand to get the sunglasses. The rear window comes so far back that if interferes with the access to the trunk. Do not try to load a normal set of luggage. I noticed in your article  you used one medium bag for the pictures. One of the rear seat releases came loose, I was asked by the dealer if I had overloaded the trunk, I replied it is for cargo? To say we are unhappy is an understatement. We expected more for our $45,000 purchase. Never again, Larry M. Fierstine",2
2307, on 06/06/17 03:37 AM (PDT),Desiree ,2017 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),2017 Buick Lacrosse Pemium," Overall I absolutely love this car. I will say that even though the car is FWD, the front sits really low. I'm constantly worried about taller curbs when parking. You have to watch your head getting in the car (I'm 5'6) because the headroom is low and the seats sit low. If you raise the seat to drive, there is a chance of bumping your head upon getting out the vehicle. Thanks for the built in rear view camera because due to the shape of the rear window and the incline of the rear end, that camera is well needed. I was a little upset about the lack of a CD player. But I guess if you can learn to use the electronic trans. shifter, then you can learn how to use USB cords and the Bluetooth to play music from your phone.

Previously I drove the 2010 LaCrosse, purchased new and redesigned that year. My satisfaction with the previous generation was outstanding, delivering exceptional service and reaching nearly 80K miles at trade-in. The NEW generation LaCrosse for 2017 undoubtedly sets a higher benchmark for Domestic Luxury Sedans! In addition to its superior comfort and quietness while in motion, this model simply excels in technology and efficiency. Loaded with every safety feature imaginable, this Buick also includes the most advanced 3.6l VVT 310hp V-6 engine, that includes Auto Cylinder-Deactivation and Auto Start-Stop technology. These features collectively assure impressive gas mileage without compromising on rapid acceleration. The latest available, 8-speed auto transmission, is operated by a very intuitive, shift-by-wire control knob. Gear transitions are flawless at speed. Being completely fair & honest with such low mileage currently, I choose not to rate my experience in reliability. However, if this model meets or exceeds my experience with the 2010 Buick LaCrosse, I will surely give it a 10/10 as well. I have no doubts on the future of this car. Every Professional review that Ive researched, suggests that this Buick will indeed give most comparable Foreign Luxury Sedans a serious run for their money! ""Update: My mileage is now just over 4K; I've experienced zero issues with performance and zero warranty claims. This vehicle remains such a pleasure to drive, both on local trips as well as long distances. It is so comfortable and quiet. The rear seat has proven itself to be very roomy and as comfortable for adult passengers. I am approaching the Winter season here in Wisconsin and will be anxious to assess the performance of the AWD system. UPDATE 2/28/18: We have are approaching the 3K milage and have been through a typical Wisconsin winter. I am very pleased to confirm that the AWD system performed flawlessly and provided sure-footed traction during the wet/snow/ice conditions that we've since encountered. We have not experienced any mechanical or build related issues with our new LaCrosse and consider it one of the comfortable vehicles we have ever owned.",5
2311, on 02/10/17 13:04 PM (PST),Jerry Adamson ,2017 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Auto stop sucks," This car has an engine auto stop program in it that shuts off the engine at every stop to save gas.  The transmission jerks when it shuts off and starts up.  It feels like someone just ran into the rear of the car when it starts up.  This program will not let you come to a smooth stop before the engine stops.  Then after the engine stops and it needs to start up again to operate the air conditioning, the car jumps ahead when the engine starts up again.  Impossible to creep forward slowly.  It is very annoying, aggravating and uncomfortable feeling.  There is no way one can shut off this auto stop program.  If I knew that this was going to happen, I would not have bought this car.  Everything else in or on the car is great.",3
2312, on 02/04/17 15:46 PM (PST),Pat ,2017 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Preferred 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Good but I would wait till GM gets it right.," I had turned in my 2015 Impala and was looking for another sedan. I had driven the Chrysler 300 and the Lexus ES 350. My local Buick dealer let me take the Lacrosse  for the weekend to give it a thorough test drive. While the car has many positive attributes, there are few major issues that kept me from buying it. First the good: The engine and transmission are a dream and provide smooth, quick, fuel efficient operation. The engine has strong exceleration and utilizes cylinder deactivation on the highway. I  achieved an incredible 31 mpg highway which is very good for this size of car. The 8 speed transmission is the best I have ever driven and unlike other 8 speeds, it doesn't hunt back and forth for the right gear. It shifts so imperceptibly, there were many times I had no idea what gear I was in. Very Nice! Lastly, you can order Adaptive Cruise with an 18"", 19"" or 20"" tire so you can get a comfortable, bump absorbing tire without having to be pushed into a package of options that includes hard riding 20"" tires. Now the bad: I don't know who they are designing these front seats for but I'm a small guy, 175 lbs and the seat was too narrow for my legs and thighs. I've seen this in Cadillacs as well. Hello GM! Side seat bolsters are for THIGH SUPPORT, not to SIT ON or increase pressure on driver/front passenger legs! The bucket seat width narrows towards the seat back so much that my uppers legs were sitting directly ON the side bolsters. After 20 miles, the backs of my upper legs were hurting from the pressure.  This absolutely killed the car for me which is too bad. The seat cushion itself was pretty comfy but the side bolsters were unbearable and my salesman said he had heard the same complaint from other potential customers as well. The next issue was overall quality with the car having a ""cheap feel"" to it. The rear, fold down seat back  would not latch and lock  in the upright position. The exposed, stationary latch mechanism attached to the back trunk wall (with grease all over it)  was locked in the closed position so it couldn't engage with the seat back. I looked at it for several minutes trying to figure it out but could not get it to release. Looking into the trunk from the rear I saw polyester white foam stuffed in behind the trunk wall and the seat back that was coming loose and falling out. I have no idea where this foam was supposed to go or what it's purpose was.  The morning I was supposed to return it, the battery died and I had to charge it. Then an error light came on referring to  a transmission problem. This car had only 700 miles on it and cost $43,000 +,  you just shouldn't have these kinds of problems!  My 15' Impala was perfect and trouble free for the duration of my 24 month lease. It's seats were wide, supportive and comfortable. The car was quiet, and had great build quality and materials. I wish I could take this advanced engine and transmission and put it in the 2017 model I ended up purchasing. The bad thing about the Impala (again, Hello GM!) is I got pushed into a 20"" tire to get my adaptive cruise which I will  be quickly trading out for more comfortable riding 18"" tires. The 20"" tires transmit every road imperfection and make for a very hard, uncomfortable ride. I know, they look very cool but to me, it's not worth the sacrifice in comfort.  I've researched how the adaptive cruise works and talked to my engineering friends in the auto industry  and contrary to popular belief, you can change tire sizes without any problems.",3

Also if I want the nice ""Bose"" stereo I would have to buy a ""package"" that would include Navigation and a bunch of other useless ""safety"" features you really don't need if your paying attention. They don't put michelin tires on their premium sedans anymore. Really? I'm done with GM. I currently drive a 2015 lacrosse. I really think they took the wrong direction and that new gear shifter. Its the same one that they put in the Cruze I think.?  I am now looking at the new Continental. They have little ""package"" games too. If you compare a loaded Lacrosse which is $50k to other competitors I think the decision becomes much clearer. If I am going to spend $50k on car it isn't going to be a Buick. Sorry GM.",4
2315, on 12/14/16 17:54 PM (PST),Scott H ,2017 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Rides like a rock," I have a crimson red premium with the 20"" wheels and tires. What a mistake. I drove the 18"" version prior to getting mine and it was a floater. This one, equipped with RE97s rides like a go kart. And in sport mode it feels like you have no suspension at all. Now true, I'm a sporting sort of guy for an old geezer, but this car rides harder than a Vette or Z/28 that I've owned and its not in the same universe as my Pontiac G8 GT. At 500 miles I replaced the tires (at my expense) with Continental Extreme Contact DWS 06 and that helped a little. It still doesn't cure the issue that the suspension tuning is way off the charts. It's never still, never smooth.  Going to the dealer service dept. tomorrow, but I highly doubt there's anything that can be done as it's just the way the car is.  True, big wheels, but still a 40 series tire just like the 19s"" on my G8.  Why can the G8 ride light-years better on far more aggressive tires (RE-11s)?  Other than the above, no complaints.Update:  I did take the car to the very helpful dealership because GM wouldn't talk to me unless I did.  Checked out 'nothing wrong' and 'to spec'' as expected.  I also got a chance to drive another new one with the 20"" wheels and tires with the hyper-strut and adaptive damping.  It was just as bad if not worse (as it had the OEM RE-97s).   I've asked the service manager to run this up the ladder with GM regional service folks to see if we can get engineering to take notice.  Hard to believe that they put this car out in the captured test fleet and this wasn't noticed, especially on Detroit streets.Update at 1,300 miles.  Now that I'm getting a few miles on it, the suspension isn't quite as brittle as it was before.  Just got back from a 500 mile trip to the Detroit Auto Show where cruising at 80 mph up and back I got 30 mpg or just under.  Detroit city streets took the edge of of the ride a bit.  It's now in the range where I can tolerate it.  Comfy seats for long trips and extreme quiet help.  I got up there much more rested than past trips.  I may end up liking this car after all.",4
2316, on 12/09/16 09:42 AM (PST),Richard Stewart ,2017 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Good value for retired folks," Being retired, I was looking for a quite comfortable roomy car with easy to use controls and lots of safety features for my wife and me to use for travel.  The Lacrosse fit the bill. I was impressed with all the safety features (love the heads up display) and the ease of use of the entertainment and navigation systems.  Most luxury cars don't have touch screens, which to me was a distraction.  The simpler the better.  The trunk on the Lacrosse is huge so no problems getting luggage stowed.  On the road the Lacrosse is very quiet and comfortable with plenty of power when you need it.  I was impressed with the overall mileage on the first fill up at 29.4 mpg with a 200 mile trip to PA and the rest mixed driving.  Some things I found troubling was there was no sunglass holder in the overhead (can use the space under the shifter, but still...), the visibility is not as good as I would have liked out the front when making turns and parking, and the transmission hunts a bit at low speed going up twisty hills (can shift into manual to smooth out).  People complain about the electronic shifter, but I found it easy to use once I got used to it. Overall I find the Lacrosse to fit my needs just fine and look forward to many miles of comfortable quite travel.After 7500 miles the Intellilink display went blank then started a reboot that took two hours.

Nothing else except oil, oil filters, air filters, and brakes has been replaced, and the original factory brakes lasted well past 52000 miles.  Replacing the brakes stopped some shuddering of the front end during hard breaking.  The shuddering did not interfere with the car stopping very well.  Overall this has been a great car to own.

The Lacrosse was a stellar performer in all respects. I owned a 95 Buick Regal GS and a 95 Camaro Z28 previously. Both were awesome cars for their intended design; highway cruiser vs sports car. All cars are compromise vehicles, as a result, you cannot have a sports car that is as comfortable as a family sedan.

The dealership has been wonderful at making me comfortable in my LaCrosse. The front 2 tires were worn and they put new ones on. This is by far the most comfortable ride of any car I have owned.

The LaCrosse had 14,000 miles on it, but besides my trade-in, the LaCrosse cost an add'l $18,000.  I realized I'd made a mistake almost instantly, but was assured that I would get used to the LaCrosse and like it.  I still don't like it and regret that I bought it.  I won't get another Buick.  GM has sacrificed too much in order to have higher profits and the consumer gets stuck with the flimsy trash. The LaCrosse is smaller than the Century and uses more gas, too. ",2

The car handles beautifully and is fun to drive. The back seat could use a bit more head room and the trunk lid needs a handle. Overall,  this car is excellent. I have owned three Buick Lasabres and they all got 30mpg or better highway driving. I drove from Mcintosh, FL to Franklin, NC a distance of 540 miles on one tank of gas.

It is very quiet, comfortable, it behaves well on the road (it does not float the way oldie Buicks used to but it won't treat you to a nasty choppy ride either) and it is very safe (tested great on the government crash tests). Plus, you have added security and convenience of OnStar, XM radio, handsfree phone right on the steering wheel. I even found a comfy seat setting for my back - something that didn't quite happen even in Audi A6.  The steering is just right, not too hard, not too wiggly and it adjusts to your speed.  ",5

The 2001 was a vast improvement over the 1996 model but I feel the 2006 LaCrosse is not much better over my 2001.  The handling and road ride is much better and improved on the 2006.  The big difference I noticed is the standard options were reduced on the 2006.  I thought in keeping up with the great Buick name that a safety option like heated mirrors would have been standard, also dual controlled heating and air would have remained for a standard option.  A problem with my car is when I first start out and then turn my front tires/wheels make a sort of growling sound and then it goes away after I'm moving. ",4.375

The sleek black exterior with chrome appearance package is very sleek.  The gapping on all the panels inside in out is up there with the best in the industry.

My only regret was that I didn't get a higher trim, as the Base model that I got did not come with heated or memory seats, navigation, nor a sunroof. The latter 2 I could deal with, but the memory seats were an issue for me, as my 2 former Buicks had memory seats, and it was a nuisance resetting my seats after others would drive it!

After MANY back-and-forths we agreed to let him at least look at it before deciding on a course of action.  He said that they didn't follow the service bulletin properly and pointed out the instructions state to remove glass from frame BEFORE reseating sensors, aligning the frame then reinsert glass.

When reviewing, take in consideration the model and also the wheels.  The CXS has the bigger V6 and the Touring package comes with 19"" tires which will give a more sportier AKA rougher ride.  The 18' wheels are chrome and don't look small at all.  I did NOT want the Touring package because I prefer the softer, quieter ride.

When I'm driving fast and changing lanes on the highway I feel like I'm taking my life in my own hands. The armrests are poorly designed, and the door handles are awkward.

It takes some getting used to but consider getting back up assist and blind spot alert. It has a sporty road feel without a punishing ride. The seats are very comfortable.

2538, on 08/26/15 16:45 PM (PDT),Sam ,2012 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Premium II Group 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),2.0 Stars!," So updating this after almost 15000 miles on the car.Performance:  Acceleration in this is excellent, watch out for the torque steering in this.  If you hammer it while even turning slightly like to pass someone it will yank the steering wheel back straight.  Fastest stock V6 I have owned bar none.  There are a lot of reports on transmission issues with the 2012 and surrounding years.  The way this is geared it's going to shift high especially that 2nd to 3rd shift.  When you go from 2nd to 3rd it will literally drop only about 500 rpm.  When I bought this it was shifting 4000-5000 RPM on that shift. 3rd to 4th was only slightly lower.  This was unacceptable to me.  So after fighting with Buick for months (While under factory warranty.) I finally got a significant answer as to how to fix this.  These are adaptive transmissions.  They learn how you drive.  If you take off fast it's going to learn to shift at a higher RPM, which over the long term is not healthy for the engine or the transmission.  Eventually I got them to flash the Transmission Control and wipe the memory clean.  It took about 2 months for the car to 'learn' my driving style but now it rarely shifts over 3000 rpm.  If it does it is because I have it in Manual mode or I've got it floored.  Anyone out there having ""Transmission problems with their Buick Lacrosse"" don't let the dealer tell you this is normal.  It takes them about an hour to fix it...In regard to comfort... If you are tall or a big guy/woman getting in and out will be uncomfortable.  The way the seat sits even back as far as it goes still puts a significant amount of your legs beyond the front of the door, thus making you pull your legs back and spin in the seat before being able to put your legs on the ground.  I cannot count how many times I have smacked my knees on the steering wheel ""even with it adjusted as high and far into the dash as possible.""  The advertisement they do of Shaquille O'Neal sitting comfortably in one of these is so much BS.  That said, it has a comfortable sporty ride once you are actually ""IN"" the car.The interior is decent.  I have noticed that some of the chrome 'coating' on some of the accents starts peeling off.  I did like the LED highlights in the car, and the leather is supple, soft, and comfortable.As others have posted, the car has some visibility safety issues.  Blind spots are a HUGE issue.  If you are backing out of a angled parking space, best of luck you're not going to be able to see a vehicle or person approaching.  Backing up is difficult in the car period, lane changing requires a full head/body turn to see if someone is near the normal blind spot.  A simple though not a thorough fix is to buy 2 stick on blind spot mirrors, and put them up in the top outside corner of your normal mirrors.  This helps tremendously in traffic.  If you live in the North.  THIS IS NOT THE CAR FOR YOU!  The traction control on this has to be the worst traction control on any vehicle I have EVER driven.  Works wonders on dry pavement.  Get in an inch of snow you're not moving.  The traction control has a rev-limiter on it.  If you can't get traction you are literally dead in the water!Reliability is good overall.  I've only had one other significant issue that so far is unresolved in this vehicle.  If you read Buick forums they are famous especially during the winter for having the evaporator drain get plugged up.  If it's not dealt with immediately it has the potential to get moldy.  Evidently mine wasn't dealt with immediately.  I've had more problems with a moldy acrid scent when running the heat, it is especially bad when run on recirculate.  Once this happens there really is very little you can do.  My next step will be replacing the pan itself to see if that will help.Value is about par for the course for a mid sized sedan.  The cost is a little above what I think it should have been just based on safety alone.  But overall it is pretty economical.The car is E85 capable.  Running E85 I average about 22mpg on a 70 mile round trip mixed city/highway driving.  On Unleaded with 10% Ethanol I average betwen 24.5 and 25 on the same trip.  If you keep this car at 65mph with relatively few stops over long distance it will push out high 20's low 30's mpg.",2

If I am at a stop sign several seconds pass before I have visibility of a full sized car or truck coming from my right.  I have to lean forward and backward to avoid that blind spot.  There is no way of viewing a car when merging or changing lanes except with the side mirror.   If I look over my left should all I see is the b pillar and the c pillar and a tiny slit.",1.625

The rear doors have smaller windows, which are fairly high in relation to a person sitting in the back. The cabin design, the side and position of the rear windows contribute to diminished visibility and nasty blind spots.The rear-view and the side view mirrors are incredibly small, also contributing to the limited visibility. The front driver seat, while being electronically adjustable, gives a driver the feeling like they are sitting on a moving platform. It is impossible to see the front end of the car no matter how high the front seat is positioned. The car has two control clusters, both in the form of a digital screens. The instrument cluster displays your speedometer and other options controlled by the steering wheel, while the second screen is in the center of the dash for the entertainment system. The left, up, right, and down directional buttons on the right side of the steering wheel navigate through menus displayed in the instrument cluster.  However, since there is no dedicated back button it is really confusing figuring out how to get out of them. The steering wheel has a very smooth feel which makes driving and parking effortless. The V6 engine seems fairly responsive and has a decent power output. However, It is paired with a transmission that sometimes gets confused in what gear it wants to shift.

My fault and I regret not ordering and waiting patiently. But the vehicle beckoned to me, and the killer price (Buick promotion 15% off, plus a bit more on this particular model as 2017s were rolling in) made me an easy mark. Very happy from the get-go with this car. Astonished by the value, and I love it more each day. I rent a great many cars on business and this one is more luxurious than any of them. The quiet is so effective it's almost offputting. Near silence even at 50 mph, and then only the pleasant hum of the tires. Handles beautifully. There is but one drawback: Tye poor visibility I mentioned. Thick posts obscure forward view at 10 am and 2 pm, rear view no treat either, and blind-spot is wretched. That's why I miss the driver confidence package, which dealer says cannot be retrofitted. Sure wish I had the head-up display, too (!) But adding up the other pluses: Heated seats rock, interior lighting is legant, the surfeit of USB ports wonderful. Love the remote car starting, memory seats and even trunk storage, which though somewhat cramped, turns into bat cave by lowering of back seats. Love the push-button parking break. The V-6 engine is plenty beefy for any circumstance, When I need to pass I tickle the gas pedal and--whom!--I'm gone. Buick nailed so many details with this model. Headrests are perfect...seats hug you like firm glove; nice balance between cushiness and support...unlocking of door with push of a button is a minor miracle, and entire layout of controls is very sensible.

2564, on 09/23/16 18:51 PM (PDT),Steve H. ,2016 Buick LaCrosse Sedan Leather Group 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Look Elsewhere," The Lacrosse was a potential candidate to be a retirement gift to myself in a year or two.  I decided to rent one for a week to take on a 1,000 mile trip.  It is now off my list.  The first shortcoming is the cramped driving position.  I'm 6 foot, 190 lbs and the position is much tighter than it has to be.  The console flares as it approaches the dash reducing valuable seating real estate.  My right leg was constantly fighting the console trying to get my foot squarely on the accelerator pedal.  The foot well size is reduced by the intrusion of the wheel well.  The seat went back far enough, a big plus.  The dash seems to be close to the seating position and it curves as it approaches the door.  I hit it the corner twice during exiting.  Then there is the road noise.  It is unacceptable for a car of this supposed caliber.  The noise is intrusive starting about 35 mph on anything but smooth asphalt.  At highway speeds, it is a constant nuisance.  Thankfully, the wind noise is minimal, as it should be.  Handling was very excellent and the ride was OK, nothing worth noting.  Brakes, OK.   The climate control worked very well and the controls were easy to understand.  The entertainment system was another weak area.  The screen was a nice size, but distracting because of the scarcity of buttons on the dash.  The screen is tilted and so is the bezel which made is difficult to push the smallish station preset icons.  Everything has to be done via the two knobs and a couple of buttons or the touch screen.  Either way, it causes the driver to divert their attention from the road.  The sound was excellent and it was not the premium radio.  The powertrain (V6) was excellent, as was the gas mileage.  I averaged just over 30 mpg (calculated) for highway (mostly), suburban and in-town driving.  The trunk was nice and big and the fit and finish were excellent.    By contrast, I'm leasing a 2015 Verano which is superior in several areas.  It does not exhibit as high a level of road noise as the Lacrosse and the entertainment system is easier to use because it has buttons for things like the radio presets.  The driver's position is not as cramped, even though it is slightly smaller overall and the pedal feel of the brakes is better.  However, it is smaller and does not have the same ride comfort as the Lacrosse which runs 10-20k more.  Maybe the redesign will improve many of these deficiencies which would put the Lacrosse back on my list.",3

This is not the case with my Terraza. We bought it new in 2005. First 2 years were good, no repairs no problems. From the third year to present we have had nothing but problems. First problem luckily was still covered under warranty. The van kept dying on us or, would not start intermittently with, this issue we had it in the dealership 3 times and, once to a very good independent mechanic. first 2 times dealership replaced fuel pump, computer, multiple relays, and the computer a second time. We took it to the independent the third time he said he could find nothing wrong and, we need to take it back to the dealership since it was under warranty and, charged us a very minimal fee. The dealership replaced multiple parts. I DO HAVE TO COMMEND THEM as, there are clearly issues electrically and mechanically from the factory that are extremely difficult to solve. CV joint failure, big time suspension issues in the rear witch the dealership worked on three time the 3rd year, they never got it right, road like a buckboard for months. They finally got the rear suspension to feel like a 3/4 ton truck witch was a big improvement. constant traction control issues, stability, rotor,, rear dvd player, headlights, taillights, dash cracks ,broken door handles issues, trim falling off, doors not opening or closing, interior cracking breaking falling apart.  My god man, I need to go back and change my review, until I started listing the issues I did not realize what a true P.O.S. this mini van really is, mechanically. I have been working on it myself for the last few years there is no way a person could justify shop rates for as many times it needs work. I am a pretty fair hand at fixing  cars and, I'm here to tell you this thing is a nightmare. never, never, never, consider buying one, don't even take one as a gift you cant afford the repairs. With this being said, it is a very sharp mini van with good power and mileage. We loved everything about it I, bragged to my friends and family for the first 3 years. It could have been one of the favorite vehicle's that I had owned, if it had not turned into a unbelievably unreliable basket case. Great concept poor execution G.M.",2

It is so comfortable and seats 7! The kids can watch movies or hook their xbox up to it.  It has 2 household plugs in it, a compressor with an air hose!  No matter how much weight there is in it, it adjusts in the rear and it is never sagged down.  I have folded the seats down and put a full size refrigerator in it.  It sits up high like an SUV, but, I LOVE the sliding doors in parking lots and the garage.  It is front wheel drive, but, goes through snow like a charm!",5

Fiats, Alfas, Jaguars, etc.  The Buicke Terraza, which we purchased new in 2005, has been the worst by far.It now has 145k miles on it.  I would have unloaded it years ago but after each expensive repair you think, ""what else can go wrong?""   The Terraza never fails to answer that question.In the years since we have owned it, let's see.It has had the transmission fail twice.It has used about a quart of oil every 1,000 miles since it was new.  GM says that is is within normal usage parameters.  Hmm, I have had other vehicles with 300k on the odometer that use essentially nothing every 3k miles.  Have replaced every single suspension component, front and rear, at least once.Front brake rotors are essentially an annual replacement. Dow not matter what brand rotor or pads, the rotors eventually warp.Let's look at the components driven by the serpentine belt.  Water pump, AC compressor, alternator, power steering pump.  Yup, every one of those has been replaced.All sorts of electrical issues almost since new.CV axles.  Yes. This as well.Exhaust. Ok, that lasted a long time so not too bad.Heater core leak.  Been there, done that.Leather cracking at front seats and arm rests.  Yes, also a crack in the dash.Steering rack.  Yes. Last month as a matter of fact.Engine mounts.  If your Terraza has lots of noise and harshness, these arprobanpy shot.I maintain all my vehicles extremely well and they tend to last a very long time. Frequent fluid changes, interior / exterior detailing, etc.   Who knows what other problems this lemon would have if not maintainedIt is reaonably quiet.  Engine is harsh and could use a few more HP.  Highway mileage is decent, around town about the same as my V8 SUV.  Front seats are comfortable, rear seats have terrible leg room, third row is difficult to access.  Front cup holders fall apart, few poor outlets poorly located.my experience with the Terraza has left me saying, never again to GM.",1

The car came loaded with all the accessories (DVD, electric heated leather seats, electric doors).  It does have a good engine, and nice acceleration but other than that, it's the worst lemon of a car I've ever owned. We bought this car used and have had nothing but problems with it.  The DVD player stopped working after about two years.  The steering leaks, one sliding door doesn't work at all anymore, not even manually!  The fob stopped working (even with a new battery), the strap to close the back gate broke, the warning bell that a door may be open goes off when you go over a bump and there's NOTHING you can do to make it stop.  The door lock button had to be replaced, the driver side window fell off its track.  The catalytic converter needs to be replaced.  The rear gate leaks.  Climate controls are HORRIBLE.  It's impossible to keep the windows free and clear of frost in the winter.  God forbid you try to change a headlight or turn signal on this thing yourself.  It truly amazes me that I don't see more people complaining about this car.",1
2583, on 08/20/15 17:38 PM (PDT),Noah ,2005 Buick Terraza Minivan CX Fwd 4dr Minivan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Typical Early 2000's GM Quality," This is the car my family bought used a few years ago, and I wish they had done research first. It is better than the '98 Venture we had, but not by much. I will address build quality first, and frankly the build quality is disappointing. Basically the whole interior is hard plastic (the dashboard of my grandmother's '96 Bonneville is softer), and there are noticeable gaps between many of the panels. There is padding on the upper door panels, but it is very minimal. Fortunately, we have not had problems with the power doors like other people have. We have, however, experienced the very common light flicker problem.This car drives poorly. It crashes over bumps in the road and the entire interior rattles. There is also a lot of wind noise at highway speeds. Acceleration isn't actually that bad, because although the engine is somewhat underpowered, it can get the car going if you just push the RPMs a little. Another thing, though, is that the transmission isn't particularly smooth when shifting.Interior comfort isn't terrible. The third-row seats are kind of stiff, but I don't think they've ever really been used. The other two rows of seats have full-size cushions, which is nice, but there is no lumbar support and no kind of adjustment for it. Additionally, like I mentioned before, padding on the front doors is minimal. Legroom in the second row is barely enough, and the third row actually has more legroom than the second.This car has also developed several problems that compromise safety. The wheels are beginning to corrode, I believe, resulting in a slow tire leak (a common problem here in Minnesota, where we heavily salt our roads in the winter). We had to have the steering done because it was starting to leak fluid. The most recent problem is one that we've had before. The brakes go crazy, the traction control kicks in when it's not needed, and sometimes the ABS/traction control lights come on and the information screen flashes ""service ABS"", ""service traction control"", and ""service stability system"".Other miscellaneous things include: somewhat sub-par gas mileage (about 17 mpg), the unimpressive CD player (randomly stops working), and visibility (hindered by full-size rear headrests and thick C-pillars).This car has not aged well while we've had it. Being a minivan, of course it gets driven often. But that also means problems can develop more quickly. The problems I mentioned aren't even all of the problems we've had since we got it. Those are just the recent problems and I fear we may encounter more. Even my mother, who mostly just wants a car that will get her from A to B, is getting frustrated. If you own a Terraza, Uplander, Montana, or Relay, please be careful and, if you are able, maybe find a different vehicle?",2

This money pit pulled its last joke on me after leaving me stranded in a Walmart parking lot with a seized starter. I went out the next week and financed a brand new Mazda and kick myself for not doing this sooner. I lived in denial for far too long that this was a good van for the low price I paid for it. I recently tallied up the amount I spent on repairs/maintenance in my time owning it and was shocked to discover I spent more keeping it on the road than I did purchasing it. If you love troubleshooting weird and unending vehicle problems, this van is for you! Otherwise I’d say just walk away... you couldn’t pay me to drive another one of these. I’ll leave my earlier reviews up as they list a lot of the issues, and you can also see my enthusiasm dwindle down to pessimism over time lol. Good riddance Terraza!  Oct 2016 update:Transmission packed it in at about 170,000km (approx 106,000miles). Rear callipers have a parking brake component that seized and needed a full caliber replacement on the rear. After the transmission rebuild ($2500) it seems to be back in action and running well. I guess I'll wait and see what falls apart next on me.  UPDATE:I've owned it for 2 years now and I still love it. It has had a few problems though. This chassis (terraza, relay, Uplander, and SV6) is apparently notorious for wheel bearings going. I've been through two bearings on each side of the front, and both sides on the back have been replaced once. Ridiculous right? I'm handy enough, so they're easy enough to change, but come on.... seriously? Twice in 2 years?! Also, I had an ongoing issue with the ABS/traction/stability system light triggering. Took me a while to figure out - but it ended up being as simple as changing the wire harness that runs from the wheel hub to the computer. The wire is cheap and gets brittle over time and even though it looks ""ok"" the tiny wires inside fray and trip the system - haven't had an issue since replacing a couple years ago. The stereo had weird road/static noises and I didn't like the stock deck anyway so I upgraded to a Kenwood GPS/DVD deck and it's been fantastic ever since as the stock speakers/sound is actually really decent. This also solved an issue with the side sliding door alarm ringing ENDLESSLY. The stereo DVD deck I installed bypassed the door chime so I have sweet, sweet silence now! Hope this helps other owners. Despite the problems I really do still love driving it. Everything else about it has been great!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I just bought my Terraza recently. It has been maintained so well that I'm pretty sure a family of ghosts drove it. It smells like new car, not a stain or a worn spot to be found. At a low 90,000km it looks as though it could have 10km on the clock - so I'm very excited just at how clean it is. In my time driving it, my only complaint is the transmission. Sometimes it doesn't seem to know what it wants to do. I stomp it for power on the highway and it launches into 6000rpm and sounds like it's about to explode. A little scary - I don't want to face a tranny rebuild so soon in the game. Aside from that, driving around town and so forth, she's the smoothest ride I've ever owned.",2

The interior and exterior styling are very sharp and it has plenty of standard options like dual climate control power sliding doors, power seats and a dvd player.

A little disappointing to the Buick line.  Overall, it's been fun to drive. Though the cruise control does not work very well either.  GM is still working on this issue.

Access to the third row is great if your name is Pegleg with the table folded flat.

I had 3 keyed entrances before (both front doors and the rear hatch), now I only have one, the driver's side door. The Oldsmobiles had little compartments for coins, pencils, etc.  plus small storage bins with lids in the back, there are none in the Terraza, except for the comparment on the rails sys.

It may not be as powerful as the Honda Odyssey, but the ride is much better, the fuel economy is also better and has more standard features than its sister the Chevy Uplander. Standard leather seats with cloth inserts and standard electronic load leveling and dynamic styling along with a great price led us to purchase ours in April of 2005.

Buick hit it right on the money with the look but I'm pretty sure they could have used better quality interior pieces.  The compartments do feel cheap and are sometimes hard to close.  It would have been nice if the back windows can roll down,  but over all its worth the money. We shopped around & compared prices.  With all the standard options it comes with a Honda or Toyota would have been at least $37,000. With the red tag sales you'll probably pay about $28,000 for a Buick Terraza.  $10,000 less.

Parts replaced included 3 water pumps, 2 alternators, a starter, entire brake system (minus master cylinder...thats still original). The CD player went to I had a cheap one installed. One set of tires (Cooper) I got 105,000 miles out of. Had the front wheel bearing assemblies replaced at 250,000 and just had the drivers front wheel bearing replaced. Still the original exhaust system. It has some annoying oil leaks that I really don't care about. Original paint job is my only complaint. Wore off in a few places.",5

I loved the leather interior with the single heated seat(only available on the drivers side.) It was such a smooth ride at first but once I hit 165,000 it wen't downhill. The Transmission blew and had to drop $2,500 unexpectedly to fix it. The door handle broke 3 times on the drivers side, keep in mind that the factory one is around $250. Issues with the crankshaft sensor and suspension happened around 190k miles. I managed to get it up to 220k miles....I'm honestly going to miss the ride and comfort but I am not going to miss the headache. ",3.875

Buick only produced 1956 Rivieras in its final year of production with the last 200 being the Silver Arrow editions. These included special embroidered headrests and floor mats. A custom car cover. A Silver Arrow badge for both sides of the exterior and dash.  My online search took me to a Buick chatboard where I found one in Detroit. The previous owner was looking for someone that would appreciate this car as it is and not lower it, put 20's on it and kicker speakers. I was their man! After some negotiations I found myself with a one-way ticket to Detroit to bring this rare find home to Kentucky. I had found a 15 year old ""new car"" with only 6538 miles on it. Today I have 33,300 miles on it because I have decided to drive and share it and not hide it under that custom cover in a garage.  Aside from window tinting, Bluetooth GPS Stereo and LED headlights, this is stock as it rolled off the line. This Riviera Silver Arrow is one fine ride~~",5
2733, on 05/29/16 21:07 PM (PDT),Warren Kendrick ,1999 Buick Riviera Coupe Supercharged 2dr Coupe,Patience ... It's a Future Collector's Car," This car has classic, superior styling reminiscent of Rivieras dating back to 1955. When I drive it, it still turns heads and people are amazed that it is 17 years old. I have decided to park it, with a car cover, and drive it perhaps 5 or 6 times a year, maybe take it on an occasional extended trip. Why all the fuss?Only about 1,900 1999 Rivieras were ever manufactured. It was the last model year. Time becomes an enemy and friend as more and more of these cars are in accidents, rust out in the northern states or whose dashboards literally melt in the Arizona sun and whose paint and clearcoat fade. As they age, there will be fewer and fewer for collectors. I was blown away at how much the 1950's models are going for.There are other plusses and minuses:+++ Styling. Its looks far surpass most current models. +++ 3.8L SuperCharged engine. This is an almost indestructible V6 as long as the owner has the oil changed and has other maintenance performed. The SC snout bearings wear out but repair kits are widely available. Expect to get 150,000 miles from the engine before you get it overhauled or rebuilt.+++ Surprisingly, this car does quite well in highway driving, about 26MPG. If you are chasing the fairer sex, it should get 10 to 12 ""gals per mile"" in city driving.+++ The rear bench seating is surprisingly roomy for a coupe, and it is as comfortable as a first class seat on a commercial jet. - - -  2 door coupes have been out of favor for years. That tends to hold down resale prices if you are currently just looking for transportation. It's a price you pay for head-turning styling.- - - Premium fuel is recommended, but I ran a 1995 SC Riviera on regular gas for years with no problems.- - - All GM cars have had trouble with the use of cheaper, thinner leather that starts to show wear about 80-90,000 miles and on some Buicks the leather cracks and you are looking at a $300 reupholstery job for each front bucket seat.",5

In the 1980s and 1990s the Riviera became something of a highly decorative boat anchor, but with the supercharged 3800 it jumped into the performance car category. The 3800 alone is the best engine out there and to supercharge it , you have the combination of performance and reliability.

2749, on 08/12/18 19:21 PM (PDT),willie ,2018 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Much Nicer Than They Say," I just bought one of these, and regardless of the negatives that people point out, I absolutely love it. My wife loves it, and my daughter loves it. Much more room and comfort than in the BMW 4 Series we drove. So much is standard on this car. It is roomy, comfortable, and does everything I want it to do. The rear seats are actually usable for average-size people. I can fit a set of golf clubs into the trunk if I take the woods out of the bag and put the woods in the back seat. You can't put the clubs in or out with the top down, though. I put the clubs in, then lower the shield and the top. When I get to the course, I raise the top and the shield,  then remove the clubs. I love that the rear seat backs fold forward to increase the trunk space. As for being a dog, it really isn't. I used to own a Pontiac Firebird 400 4-speed back in the day, so I'm no stranger to a performance car. 0 to 60 in 8.3 seconds?  So what? I never do that, and I doubt that you do either.  I go from maybe 20/25 to 70/75 up an acceleration lane to merge on a highway, and it handles that just fine, thank you. Passing on the highway? Again, no problem. The turbo handles that with barely a touch of the gas peddle. The other knock is all the buttons on the dash. These buttons are redundant functions found in the on-screen menus. Well guess what?  When I want to do something while driving at 70 mph, I much prefer pressing  a labelled button to drilling down through on-screen menus (even though the Cascada responds to voice commands for calling, changing radio stations, etc.). And secondly, on a bright sunny day with the top down, the screen can be a little hard to see, like your cell phone in the sun. So again, give me those redundant buttons. Once you know what they do it's no big mind-boggling confusion factor like everyone seems to think. Someone did mention that with the top down and no one in the passenger seat, the passenger seat belt clip rhythmically hits the door post and it's irritating. Well it does - lol. I took care of that by putting a thin strip of self-stick furniture pad on the door post. No more noise.  My only knock is I really, really don't like red interior lighting on the dash. But I wasn't going to not buy the car for that. As for the ride, it is nowhere near as harsh as I expected with the 20-inch wheels. And finally, since I started looking for a convertible a couple of years ago, I see so many BMWs and Audis. It's nice to stand out from the crowd a bit, and everyone that sees it tells me what a beautiful car it is. Oh, sorry, one more thing: I chose the 2018 instead of the 2019 because they changed the backup camera. They went from a nice big view on the dash screen with guidelines to a tiny video in the left corner of the rear-view mirror, without the guidelines. I hated it, and it was a deal-breaker for me and my wife. So that's my 2 cents. Color me a happy camper.",4

Acceleration from dead stop ok, but is quite good from 25mph and up, great on freeways and interstates. Steering quick, tight turn radius. Ride is firm but not harsh, cornering stability good. Noise level surprisingly good.  Rear visibility with top up is marginal with passenger headrests up, but is adequate otherwise. Fold down rear seats great. Gas mpg on new engine 27.5at prolonged 75-85 mph, 22mpg suburban travel. However, interior controls need redesign. NAV system complex, redundant, voice recognition a joke, back up/NAV screen too small, very difficult to identify features function button while underway. Took it in for first for visit at 3000 miles...unable to get tires to balance, to be replaced, top has two small tears, to be replaced, after 32 days of ownership.

2759, on 07/06/18 08:23 AM (PDT),Colorado Dave ,2016 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Very stylish convertible; very affordable luxury," I purchased my 2016 Buick Cascada in October 2017 as a pre-owned car, but it only had 5k miles and still under factory warranty.  We got an amazing deal since it was ""used"" and since it was coming into the Winter here in Colorado I think the dealer wanted to get it off the lot (who wants to buy a convertible in the Winter in Colorado?)  I've been wanting a convertible my entire life and have been obsessed with the Cascada since I saw the commercial debut during the Super Bowl.  I am extremely pleased with this car!  We recently took a 3,000 mile road trip this summer from Denver through Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, California and back.  The cabin is very comfortable for both city- and long-distance driving.  When driving long-distance with the top down, we made sure to put on plenty of sun block and I was worried about it being too hot in the summer with the top down, but we discovered that with the windows up and the air conditioner on, there was not any issue with wind or temperature.  It's so amazing driving through the mountains and cities with the top down because you get a panoramic view of everything.  It's incredible what you get to see with the top down!  I am very impressed with overall performance of this car on the highway.  It keeps pace with other cars even going up/down mountain passes.  The handling is very smooth.  Since we were on a 2-week road trip, I was concerned about luggage space, but since it was just the two of us, we folded the back seats down and had plenty of room for our luggage.  It was super convenient loading/unloading the car with the top down.  Pros:  the top goes up/down very quickly and operates with one button; great handling in both city/highway driving; love the heated leather seats for cool drives with the top down; very stylish overall and we've received many compliments - great conversation starter with other motorists (yes, we get a lot of ""that's a Buick?"" comments!).  Cons:  as others have noted, the center instrument panel is more of a ""cluster"" and can be confusing/overwhelming; the infotainment and some of the technology seems dated; gas mileage (even on the highway) is just okay but nothing special; there are no locks on the center console or glove box - while the top goes up/down quickly, it would be a nice feature to have locks on these for a little extra security when parking with the top down.  I'm so in love with this car that I don't have a problem looking past the cons!",5
2760, on 05/12/18 12:57 PM (PDT),Dan Shaw ,2016 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),"Happy,happy!", We are very happy so far with our used 2016 Cascada. It only has 2900 miles on it so we can’t judge long term reliability. It accelerates and handles great. We read some reviews that rated it low on acceleration but I think you need to see for yourself. It looks great inside and out and has pretty good electronics. One minor exception is that it does not have a built in garage door opener.,4

Everything is great in this car, comfort is top notch in these seats. They hug you and I love the lumbar support. I love that it is front wheel drive. My last car was a mustang convertible and winters in the Midwest can be very icy and snowy. I haven't had a winter yet with this car so hopefully it won't disappoint. The sound system is awesome and I can talk on Bluetooth even with top down. The passenger seat does bang on interior if not buckled when no passenger is in car. Easy enough fix. I do notice a difference with the wind guard in place. No leaks and very quiet ride with top up. My recurrent problem is AFL lamp/ headlamp leveling malfunction. The Buick dealer service dept has been awesome! They have replaced the sensor part but within 2 weeks, the warning showed up again. I took it back, which they always offer a loaner, and of course, the warning didn't show up for them. They calibrated the sensor(which had not been done when part replaced) hoping that was the problem. The warning came on the day I picked it back up(figures). I am now scheduled to take it to a closer dealer as the one I purchased it at was a little far for the frequent trips I was making. Hopefully, they figure it out. However, it is not affecting the performance of my Cascada, I just don't like having any issues on my new car. I'm over 9000 miles and am just in love with it. I get a lot of compliments which coming from an orange mustang gt convertible is surprising. You will not be disappointed!",5

I had taken back to the dealership for this and  a rear view mirror that was poorly tightened at the factory. The mirror was fixed but the speaker still buzzes on AM and Bluetooth phone conversations. The radio has a whistling interference noise when the brakes are applied.The top had started rattling on the driver side rear and that was fixed to be replaced by a rattle on the passenger side rear now. To add to that when the front pieces of the dash were removed now the plastic creaks and rattles with every b ump. This car is just a nice looking Geo Metro.",1
2764, on 08/22/17 07:22 AM (PDT),Robin ,2016 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Baby boomer heaven," Leased 1 year ago. Love this convertible. The only things I  dislike is when I  use 3rd gear to go down a very large hill near my home. It doesn't hold well and I  need to use my brake too much. My Mazada held much better on the downhill. There is a Blindspot, as in most cars, with trim alongside front windshield.  Could use more safety features. That was the only thing I  really missed when shifting from Mazda6 to Buick Cascada. Would have loved the auto braking and also better monitoring for highway driving, even if just in the side view mirrors. Back up camera picture could be sharper images. Love the parking assist, crash warning and also the cross center line warning...this is a very good thing with distracted driving at its peak these days. All in all, I  had to have this mid sized convertible. Can't  and won't  do the little verts due to dangerous road conditions, mostly other drivers, and after driving an audi convertible, I  wanted another vert but not that price, and mid sized for sure. Love it, however, when putting other b.boomers in back....forget it. All complaints. So, save the back seat for the young agile people!  Maybe offer in a 4 door? I am very comfy and love driving this car. No complaints with filling up the trunk and popping down the back seat for more space when needed. Very simple. Went thru one new england winter, no problems,  but then i stay home in bad weather. Cold weather not an issue with rag top. Noise level also low. Had a little problem coming up my driveway,  which is a slight hill, not paved, so gets pretty slushy and icy at times. Just had to get a small head start! If I  had to drive to work daily in it and the weather was snowy, I  would be nervous driving. All in all, I  plan to trade for another when my lease expires!",4

2767, on 12/21/16 18:45 PM (PST),Steve ,2016 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),It makes me smile," I understood the Cascada was an Opel, introduced about 3yr ago. As such, I realized that the electronics and safety features would not match my wife's 2016 Subaru Outback with the eyesight pkg., an outstanding and versatile wagon.                                                 What the Cascada does is it makes me smile. Style, great. Handling, the HiPer Strut up front and Watt Z link rear suspension makes a taunt but comfortable ride. The top goes up and down quickly and at a reasonable speed. Economy, town about 20 mpg hwy - filled up in Dallas, two stops, cruse control @ 70, and arrived in Conway Ar. with 33mpg. Very happy. Seats, adequate. Nav., again probably 3 yrs old. Nice touches, rain sensing wipers, and heated steering wheel. The car is quiet for a convertable, and the sound system is great.                                                                                                                                                                             The car is a cruiser, and designed for a sunny day, with the top down, traveling down two lane back top roads in Arkansas,        (insert your state). It will make you smile.At the end of a year, I still look forward to driving the Cascada. Absolutely no mechanical problems. Minor annoyances, cup holder area is too small for two full sized cups, and the device too hold either doors open is not strong enough to stop them from trying to attack my shins. Truthfully, this has been a problem with each two door car that I have owned. But......If you are ever on I 40 in western Ark., and see the exit to the ""Pig Trail Scenic Byway"", take the top down and enjoy. I did. The eventual prize is Eurika Springs, a great destination. But the most fun is in the journey.",4

Nice design, comfortable rise, and easy to use ragtop.  I live in the South and have lots of opportunities for top down driving.

2771, on 07/31/16 05:10 AM (PDT),Tom in Pittsburgh ,2016 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Still a Great Looker and Enjoyable to Drive," I enjoy driving the car more and more each day. The ride is smooth on good roads, a bit bumpy on uneven roads (sport suspension). Our roads are hilly and windy here in Pittsburgh, but the Cascada handles the road exceptionally well. Seat and steering wheel adjustments are very accommodating. Initially I was concerned about the rear view visibility and the enclosed feeling with the roof up, but have no problems. The curvature of the two side mirrors is such that half of the lane behind me is visible in each of the side mirrors. Although the rear window is small, and is at an angle that reduce the visibility even more, between the rearwiew mirror and the two side mirrors visibility is pretty good. I have always had cars with sun roofs or panoramic roofs, so I was not sure how a solid black roof over my head will feel. I guess because of the huge wind shield and all the surrounding glass, there is absolutely no enclosed feeling. The trunk is small with the roof down, but that was expected with a convertible. It is a good size with the roof up except for the trunk opening. I am not a golfer, but I do not think that a golf bag would fit through the opening; of course there is always the back seat. In other reviews there have been a lot of comments about outdated dash, and too many buttons. True, there are a lot of buttons, but most of them are duplicates of the touch screen buttons.  Just have to get used to when to use which button, touch screen or dash. I particularly like the ""Destination"" button on the dash, it eliminates going through several menu selections for selecting destination. The other feature that I like is that you can have the navigation displayed on the small screen between the speedometer and the tachometer, leaving the main display for other things, radio, CD music track and the like. It is cleverly designed, in addition to the voice instructions the direction of the next turn is displayed as an arrow and there is a progress bar that gets smaller as you approach the turn, very good. There are numerous technological features on the Cascada that you have to pay extra for with other cars. Blind spot monitoring is not included, but there is parking assist, lane departure warning, collision prevention warning, back up camara, road following headlights, cornering lights and several other safety and convenience features. Some reviewers had issues with the collision prevention, parking assist warning and low resolution back up camera. Both of the assists worked as intended for me; I just have to remember to turn off the parking assist before going through a car wash. As for the low resolution back up camera, let's be realistic, if it shows and alerts the driver that there is an object behind the car that could possibly be hit it did it's job, hi-res is great watching movies, but a pavement?? I have had several convertibles, and they all leaked going through car washes. Now granted, cars are better built nowadays, and car washes came along way in improving how they clean a car, but my the Buick Cascada does not leak. In my opinion it is a very attractive car with the top up or with the top down. Acceleration is exceptionally good considering the weight of the car and the engine size, yes there is room for improvement, but remember you get a lot for what you spend. So far I am very pleased with my Buick Cascada. If my review is still up on the website by the time we get snow here in Pittsburgh, I will update the review on how the Cascada handles winter driving on hilly windy roads and on cold temperatures features, heater, defogger, heated steering wheel and the like. Update: 8/7/2017. Still love to drive my Buick Cascada. Have had no problems, no breakdowns and no miss-giving's. Handles very well, agile and lot of fun. Still gets a lot of looks, questions and ""wow it's a Buick"" comments. I had trouble last winter with the car not making up the snow covered driveway.Update: 8/9/2018. The car is still enjoyable to drive; had no mechanical or electrical breakdowns. Routine maintenance is all that have been performed. Researching all season tires for the Cascada, need one that has more traction in snow than the original tires have.",4

Even if they are stand alone options this needs blind spot/cross traffic monitoring, and adding automatic emergency braking to its forward collision warning. I would gladly pay 2 to 3 thousand greenbacks more for these options.  They already have part of this on the Verano.  I will be replacing my Mustang convertible with another one, loaded with all the tech (including adaptive cruise control) available now.  If more is added in the next two or three years to the Mustang or even the Cascada (I don't need a fast sports car) I will trade.  Smart folks my age want the driver assist tech, because as Clint Eastwood put it so well, ""A man's got to know his limitations.""  A tech assist comfortable cruiser is in order.

Showroom car looked beautiful in and out. I wanted to see the trunk but it couldnn't be opened by anyone in the dealership. Trunk has no keyhole (does not use a key to open)  or open lever or switch  inside the car, the only way to open is to press a plate on trunk hood. Problem, is that the battery was dead and that wouldn't work!  Disappointed the driver seat has no memory! More consideration for back seat passenger as seat stops if knees are hit. Problem is that I don't ever have passengers in the back seat. Fake alarm system above front windshield. Was told 2017 will bring an alarm sensor for when the top is down. Liked that however Started think I should wait for next model. Hands free microphone worked ok with top down. Radio speaker quality is very poor. Top went up and down amazingly. Not having to use latches to lock the top is a great feature. Premium accessories include a windbreaker that has to be manually attached each time to avoid draft on driver/ front passenger bak and same for back seat.  Didn't like the sound of that. I didn't test it though. Really enjoyed the ride. Acceleration is ""underwhelming"" in that the downshift is slow even though it did pick up speed better than expected. Overall, I really want this car! This could very well be my next car and first convertible. But I will wait for next year's model with improvements I hope will make me want to drive right out of the show room as soon as possible.",4

The convertible top is faulty.   I initially took the car in due to a very odd knocking and popping sound coming from the rear of the vehicle.  My first dealership said it was road noise and I had to deal with it.  This was literally metal on metal banging...    After I insisted the dealer attempt to diagnose the noise concern, a technician somehow broke the interior panel but didnt tell me, nor replace the actual part.  I then received a message once again stating the knocking was just road noise and body-flex and couldnt be fixed.    After contacting Buick, I was connected to another dealership which took the time to review the knocking and found the broken panel, and also a screw that wasnt seated properly.   Drove home in complete quiet.  Three days later...The knocking was back and this time I had a leak on the opposite side of the car.   Back to the dealer...    They adjusted the top and replaced the seal as the dealer stated the seal had managed to fold incorrectly and formed to that shape and had to be replaced.   Further adjustments to the top and the knocking was gone again.  A week later...The banging and knocking is back.  The interior panel that was replaced has again disconnected and is flapping around constantly.   Adjusted, reseated, no more knocking.   A week later...banging is back again.    Returned to the dealer and had a technician drive the car.   After a day in the shop the technician decided to replace a guide pin for the top cover.   Noise gone again.   3 days later...    Knocking and clacking is back, I have a leak, and the chrome trim was gouged by the service team during the last service.   Being returned to the dealer.  At this point, the 2016 Buick Cascada has become the biggest let down / regret of my car purchasing life.   Though the service team has been polite and helpful, I didnt buy the vehicle for it to be in service more than I am able to drive it.    Definitely regret the whole purchase at this point.UPDATE:    12/14/2016     GM and I reached an agreement that included a buy-back of the Cascada.",2
2777, on 05/19/16 19:02 PM (PDT),Bobw ,2016 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),In its own league," Bought this car for my wife (she loves it), and to be fair we have not had it but for a few weeks. I was looking for the great American convertible, something like a 1960s Buick LeSabre or Pontiac Catalina, but alas the big, roomy American verts are long gone. I was going to get a 2 series BMW (tiny back seat) or a CPO E350 (same price, 4 years old) convertible, but I went to see this car, too. Glad I did.This car has a comfortable, adult-sized back seat, big trunk for a vert, drives well, has wonderful front seats, and looks great (blue with the cream interior). It feels solid. Despite some of the pundits' reviews, the car feels plenty quick if not sports car quick (this car is not a sports car but a cruiser, which is what I wanted). The top works like a dream and the car is very quiet with the top up. Bose stereo is solid. The few negatives are no memory driver's seat; the low profile 20 inch tires can be jarring on rough pavement; rearward view with the top up is poor; and it is not really an American car, despite the nameplate. Some others have complained about the gadgets in the car like nav and lane change assist, but I have an I-phone for nav (although the Buick's nav works okay) and I can drive without some electronic nanny steering my car. As far as they go, these gadgets work okay, but I do not need them or want them on this or any other car. If you want a relatively affordable convertible that looks great and makes you smile, this could be your car.Update: Have had the car for about six months and we have loved every minute of it. Great car.Update: The car now has 26,900 miles on it. So far we’ve had two unscheduled maintenance issues, one being a tire puncture and the other being a windshield washer motor that went out, and which was repaired under warranty. We still love the car and would recommend it.Update: This is more of a suggestion for owners. Buick recommends a very high 35 PSI (cold) for tire pressures, presumably to enhance gas mileage. I have run the car at between 30 - 32 PSI (cold) and it makes the ride much more comfortable over rough pavement, and where I live rough pavement and potholes is the norm.",4

Updated 11/16," Our new Deep Sky Blue Cascada replaces our faithful old Chrysler Sebring JXI.  My wife loves convertibles and this car is a nice one.  So far she has logged just a few hundred miles but they have been surprisingly enjoyable.  The turbo 4 has better then expected performance and the handling is crisp.  Not a floaty ride like Buick's of yore.  Much has been made of all of the buttons on the dash, but most are only used occassionally and you quickly get used to the layout.  The seats are comfortable and the convertible top, and it's mechanism, are awesome.  So far we haven't found  much not to like about this car.  Styling is extremely attractive from every angle and the car gets a lot of compliments.  At $37K, the price seems reasonable for what you get.  Our old Sebring listed at $27k when new back in 2000, and it is no where near as well equipped.  The car has some nice Euorpean touches, like the redundant set of tail lights when the trunk is open and the side signal lights on the front fenders. As for fuel economy, we recently averaged 28.6 mpg on a day trip here the DIC showed an average speed of 46 mph city/highway.  We are looking forward to enjoyable summer driving with this car.Update:  November, 2016 -  Enjoyable summer with the Cascada.  Fun car to drive.  Current mileage is around 3,000 with no problems encountered.  Still getting a lot of positive comments.Update: May, 2017 - Still enjoying this car.  No winter problems and no problems with the vehicle.Update: May, 2018 - Two winters, no problems.    We still really like this car.",4

I just recently bought the car in Graystone Metallic with beige/black interior.  The car is extremely attractive, and I can't overstate this.Aside from how it looks inside and out, I love the way it drives.  The handling is very impressive as it seems to hug the road tightly.

I owned a Lotus Elise, but that was too small as we aged, so we were looking for something a little bit more. We looked at the Audi A3, but if it had the features of this (German company Opel) car, it cost $12K more. I didn't buy it to turn heads, but to be honest, it gets a significant amount of attention. Maybe not like the Lotus did, but it's a very good looking car. It's not fast, but it handles well, I love the front end suspension that handles the vagaries of the road and stops the odd bump from pulling the steering. Very nice feature. Overall this is a great touring car with an amazingly quiet interior even with the top and windows down. It's also got super spousal support, a moderate price, and solid overall performance. Take a look, I promise you won't be disappointed...IF you are willing to keep an open mind and realize a Buick can be pretty cool.",5

Front window view is blocked by sensing equipment. Rear window visibility is about 2 feet by 10 inches. Forward collision alert is useless. It doesn't do anything? It should be stopping you, but doesn't. If I had to rely on the alert, I would have hit the object by the time I heard the alert. Same thing with Lane Departure Warning. It beeps if you drift into another lane? What is it's purpose? If there is a car then you've already hit it. I think Forward Collision and Lane Departure Alerts are a waste of money. Autonomous Cruise Control and Blind spot alert would have been a better option. There are no widow locks like there is on my Chrysler and the top down and window express down are on the console. My dogs are constantly rolling down my windows. There is very little storage space in the car. I thought my Chrysler Convertible was bad, this has 1/2 the storage. The engine has more power than I thought there would be. The turbo and 6 speed gives it plenty of pick up. I'm not impressed with the navigation system. The 6 year old technology on my Chrysler runs circles around the Buick. Voice recognition is useless with the top down. Love the Rainsense, Auto on/off headlamp control, and the climate control. Never have to touch them. Backseat pass through is great. Backseats are useless. Would have been better to make the car a 2 seater and add more storage space to the trunk.Car handles extremely well, reminds me of my Corvette. Nice car, I like it, but way over priced! I own 2 convertibles and my Chrysler is a lot more car for about $11,000 less. If your buying American, forget it. The transmission is made in Mexico, engine is made in Hungary, car is built in Poland and distributed from Germany. Its an Opel with Buick emblems. The car is a Vauxhall Cascada in the UK, a Holden Cascada in Australia, an Opel  Cabrio in Spain, an Opel Cascada in the rest of Europe and a Buick Cascada in the U.S. and China. Same car different emblems. Overall I like it, but it needs some improvements as mentioned above.UPDATE:I have now had the car for several months. Tried to put the top down using the key fob as stated in the manual and as instructed by the dealer. Windows retracted, but stopped at that point and the top wouldn't go down. I took it to the dealer and they worked on it for about 2 hours. They called the manufacturer when they couldn't figure out the problem. Long story short, GM decided to not install the software until the 2017 Cascada (it is on the Canadian version). Called and complained to GM, but even though the dealer thought the software was there and the manual states it's there. GM won't fix the problem. I thought GM emerged from bankruptcy as a new and improved company. Not so, same old crappy customer service, last GM I will own.",3
2784, on 03/31/16 13:32 PM (PDT),SydC ,2016 Buick Cascada Convertible Premium 2dr Convertible (1.6L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Classy convertible, Had the Cascada for a month now and it is a joy to drive.  It has a classy design and great leather interior that is extremely well designed.  We recently went on first road trip of 1100 miles and it was great.  We encountered strong winds in New Mexico and the Cascada went straight as an arrow while other vehicles were all over the place.  We held the speed at 80 MPH and got 26 MPG which is actually pretty good considering all the headwinds.   Cascada allows the user to get extra room in the truck if the top is up by merely pressing forward the device that holds the top in the trunk.  We had lots of room for a very large suitcase and three other carry on type bags(also could easily hold a set of golf clubs in this mode).  The sound systems is top of the class and can be easily heard because the road noise is kept at a minimum on the Cascada(yes even at 80 MPH).,5

Quality of interior material is about as cheap as it gets in this price range & below (Think Pontiac Sunfire).  Now, the EOS is FAST FAST FAST! 0-60 in 5.5 seconds, faster in the Sport model due to 18"" wheels coupled with Pirelli P-Zero Nero's. Cornering is flat on the EOS, & the Hardtop/Sunroof combo (The ONLY ONE EVER MADE, Period) is much more solid, quiet, warm in cold climates than any ragtop. Great gas mileage too. Ok, this sounds like a VW EOS review, so all I can say is TEST BOTH, & YOU WILL NOTICE A HUGE DIFFERENCE! At around the same price (And MUCH less for a Used, certified EOS, this car just must be passed by!) I cannot justify reviewing a vehicle when at the same price there are other vehicles that are MUCH MUCH better, in just about every way! Even the Mazda Miata, albeit much smaller & for no one over 6 feet tall, BLOWS THIS AWAY BY LEAPS & BOUNDS! But, the best Convertible, Lb. for Lb., maybe ever made, is the overlooked, very well made, extremely safe & reliable (Proven) VW EOS. And, IT DOES NOT LEAK A DROP (That was the very 1st model year, since fixed with better seals)!This Buick can best be described in total as a ""Pontiac or Chrysler Sebring Convertible redux.""

It handles very well and holds the road/corners really well.  It is not a high performance car, so if you want one get a mustang or camaro.  The 4 cylinder turbo moves you down the road really well but your not going to use the car at a drag strip.  All the controls are there in front of you and I like that it has a key to start. I'm not a fan of start buttons, kind of brings back the 50's with the starter on the gas pedal.  Everywhere i go people are very positive about the cars looks and should bring in lots of traffic to the dealership.  It's fun to drive and that's what it should be about.  It's a great go for a drive car with the top down and on those really hot days the a/c works really well and keeps you comfortable.

It now has 78,000 miles on it. Last week my engine light turned on and shortly after that a repetitive almost clicking noise came from the engine when it was running and it would have issues accelerating and decelerating. The engine light would also come one and off and the noise would decrease a bit when it was off. I called my dealership and made an appointment. I was told my lifters needed to be replaced and also that I had a crack in my front exhaust. My dealership said for how old my car is this should not have happened. I also take in my car regularly for maintenance check and oil changes. My change oil light has never even come on. I had my dealership do the repairs and $1,000 later my car seems to be working properly again. I called Buick and opened a case to see if there was anything they could do. I was also told by them that the lifters should not have gone out. I received follow up today and was informed there is nothing that can be done. The powertran warranty is what covers that and since it only goes until 70,000 there is nothing that can be done and they cannot extend the warranty. I asked if my car only had 72,000 miles on it if that would have made a difference and they said yes. So basically because my lifters decided to crap out for no reason at 78,000 and that's not close enough to 70,000 I am stuck with those repair costs. I will never be buying a Buick again. I don't know a lot about cars but I do know that I had a used Oldsmobile Alero for 10 years that I took way less care of and never had a single engine issue.  I would not recommend buying this car and I have read a lot of other people's issues with Encores and problems that should not occur and having to pay a lot of money out of pocket for them.",2

And the more it strains the less MPG it gets.I also am concerned with the air intake design beings this car stalled out on me while driving one crappy winter day in ND.

All Leather Group Encores that were available right now had chrome wheels and you can't change it. This is an addition of $1,000 to the total car price that was forced down my throat by some schlub on Buick's payroll who decided that's what the first batch of Leather Group Encores should have.

We already exchanged the vehicle (so we're on our second one) and really appreciate the dealership's cooperation with doing their best to make the situation right for us. Both vehicles have the same problem, in fact the 2nd one is worse and I wish I had kept the 1st one.  While entering and exiting our driveway (with the steering turned left or right) which has a normal drainage dip (water canal) between the road and driveway elevation, there are thumping noises coming from the suspension. Of course as is typical...the problem could not be duplicated at the dealership.  I have driven many many cars on my driveway and never heard this type of noise from any other car. I owned 4 GM cars over a 20 year period through 2009, and finally gave up due to the consistent need to pour money into repairs after about 4 - 5 years of ownership.  I thought things may have improved and gave it another shot, but I guess I was dead wrong. I feel terribly let down and like I made a huge mistake.

It is built on a car chassis, and not designed to be a heavy workhorse.   That being said, I have been amazed at what can be transported in it, when the rear seats are folded flat, and the passenger front seat is lowered.   This included a large chest of drawers I hauled over 100 miles, with many other items packed around it.    It is a perfect ""empty nester"" car, economical and easy to park and drive.   The pluses are a competitive initial cost, very good warranty, good fuel economy (30 mpg overall), and a very quiet ride.    The negatives include a somewhat cheap plastic interior, brakes that ""moan"" sometimes when cold, lack of a built in garage door opener, and lack of a power rear gate.   I would also like them to have thought of designing a ""scuff plate"" below the rear gate, so the paint on the bumper is not scratched when moving items in and out of the back.

The buick is a nicer car than a volt, in that it feels like there will be a lot of problems, but if you are handy you should be able to resolve most of them. The MPG is poor, best i could see was 18City, and 25highway, which is about 5MPG less than the 4cyl rav4 my wife has. The Interior is actually pretty nice, but there are a lot of creaks when going over uneven pavement. They used very cheap bushings on the suspension, which doesn't wear well, and clunks in the cold. The Car has a lot of midrange power, it's a decent highway cruiser, though it is terrible in the town, and city. It's not easy to see out the back of, and the automatic transmission is terrible, since there is zero low end torque.  This little SUV is what i would call a luxury version of a Geo Tracker, but honestly the tracker at least knew what it was.. The seats are very narrow, and i am 6'3"" tall 175Lbs, so by no means fat, but my narrow behind doesn't fit between the bolsters of the seat. The seats however are pretty comfortable for short narrow people, or if you are 9, because the seat bottom is very short, so if you have short legs, this might be OK for you. The cargo room is about 1/2 the size of the Volt, and the driving position is about 4in too far to the right of the steering wheel, you actually can't position yourself dead center or you will be sitting on the door panel. The electronics are actually pretty good, the smart cruise control doesn't work, and the lane departure stuff thinks that over passes are cars immediately in front of you, and locks the brakes up when you approach them, but the radio is fantastic, the navigation is google good, the bluetooth is easy to use, and simple to setup, the climate control however, is slow, it takes about 20min to warm up in the winter, and about 30min to get to maximum cold on the AC, which maybe i have been spoiled by the EV volt, which takes about 2min on each, but it's still a long wait. The Auto Stop feature is interesting at lights, but honestly a 1.4ltr 4 pot doesn't need this, if anything it will eventually prematurely wear out the starter, and in a GM it's just one more thing to break. The Car isn't terrible and is a really good attempt on what a small SUV should be, but it was just not done well.. It feels like the designers wanted one thing, but GM lawyers wanted the cheaper option, and the dealers are caught in the middle.",1

The back seat is not meant for tall people. The bench is pretty narrow, but I don't often have passengers riding in the back.  What can I say about cargo space other than it is a compact car, and therefore space is limited but still offers plenty room and hight.  If I need more space I can always fold the backseats down.

Over the mild winter of 2016-2017 the AWD system shut down on me on 2 different occasions.  The first time the dealer had it within the hour of the occurrence and let me know this is normal, the system shuts itself down if it overheats.  The solution- wait for the AWD to cool down then resume driving.  It was a medium snow and I had been driving about 3 minutes when this happened.  The second time it was snowy again I had new tires on the car and again the AWD shut off.

2836, on 02/06/16 11:48 AM (PST),Christian ,2015 Buick Encore SUV 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Downsizing to Premium Luxury," This is a review of a loaded 2015 AWD Premium Encore. We have put over 500 miles on it. We had originally decided on an Encore but were dissuaded from taking a test drive by professional reviews which were critical of the power. Our family is accustomed to driving powerful and speedy vehicles (Volvo S60 T6/Ford F-150/Toyota Sienna AWD) with the exception of a four cylinder Ford Fusion (reliable but slow as molasses). The Encore is replacing the Sienna and the Fusion is being handed down to the newest teenage driver (slow is good here). Neither of us adults wanted to drive a car that struggles to reach speed or climb hills.  So we explored other options like the Ford Escape, Nissan Murano and even considered another Sienna for its excellent comfort and unsurpassed people and cargo comfort/capability and low price for an AWD. (We need AWD). However, the Sienna AWD is loud- annoying on long trips. So we had forgotten all about the Encore but on a trip to the dealership decided to take one for a test drive, ready to be underwhelmed and sorely disappointed. The salesperson encouraged us to take a long test drive on the interstate expressway, which we did. We were very surprised and impressed with the acceleration of this little 4 cylinder, and while we weren't winning any races, acceleration to traffic (65 mph), merging and even passing was more than acceptable.  The turbo clearly making a difference. Once at cruising speed the cabin is exceptionally quiet and peaceful. The leather seats are very comfortable, with lumbar adjustment. Two adults have ample room and comfortable seating in the rear for long trips. A third adult can fit for shorter trips (1hr or less). The Premium edition is jam packed with technology and features that almost defy belief in a vehicle which we negotiated for just under $28k (Navigation, heated steering wheel (can never go back) and seats, rain sensing wipers,  power seats, voice controls, blue tooth, wi-fi, Sirius radio, On-star, rear camera, blind spot radar, rear traffic crossing alert, lane departure warning, ambient lighting, Bose stereo, remote start and more.)  The heightened ride height of this SUV gives a nice view of the road and enhances one's feeling of safety. The Encore is extremely nimble and shines in city and supermarket lot driving and parking. It is an all around relaxing and stress free drive in mixed driving conditions. We are so happy with our choice- one we almost missed out on.  If you have any doubts just take one for a drive.",5
2837, on 02/05/16 16:31 PM (PST),tucsoncacti@gmail.com ,2015 Buick Encore SUV Convenience 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Excellent CrossOver," First off let me say this, if you have not researched this vehicle class, then complain about speed and ""pickup"" it's your own fault. If your going in knowing your buying a heavy vehicle, that is sporting a turbo'd 135+ HP engine good for you. Guess what, it's not going to launch from a full stop at a stop light or stop sign. Something very evident when you test drive the car. BUT, getting up to full speed, or highway speed is quicker than you would expect. Also passing on the highway is smooth and effortless. So all that aside do I like my purchase? HECK yes I do! I went from a V6 300hp Nissan to the Buick, and while I miss the HP, I love the Buicks quiet smooth ride, excellent Bluetooth hands free setup and recognition. Sirius XM sounds wonderful compared to my wife's 2014 Chysler 300C, and having a 120gb IPod classic, setup was a breeze via the USB. (You could also just use a USB stick if you want to change your music more frequently) Night time ride is nice, with minimal blind spots for lane changes, and excellent head light beams. The 4GLTE wifi works surprisingly well but can get pricy really quick on larger GB plans. I do mostly highway driving, and average 31mpg and an average of 69 to 83 mph. Only real draw back I feel I am missing is the dimmed rear view mirror which I feel is standard on cheaper model vehicles, push button start, and door handle push button lock/unlock (this usually comes standard with push button start vehicles). Overall I would give this and overall score of 4.5, with forgoing the bells and whistles of other vehicles in this price range for quietness and a very smooth ride.",5

2845, on 09/06/15 08:39 AM (PDT),Mark Hamilton ,2015 Buick Encore SUV Premium 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Hey Guys...a great small SUV from Germany!," Yes it's true, this car was designed and engineered by the German Opel division and marketed as a Vauxhall Mokka for the UK and an Opel Mokka / for the Europeans and rest of the world. This South Korean made and assembled vehicle is called a Buick Encore for the American market. This mini SUV handles very well in the typical prowess it has been bred with. Great economy with about 36 mpg on highway if you stick to lower speeds, lots of airbags including the standard all important knee air bags, excellent safety alerts,nice leather, love the perfectly located driver's arm rest and all the standard trip monitor system. The seat is very comfortable and perfectly sized. Acceleration is decent and adequate for highway passing. Free maintenance for two years. The eye catching size and design is a type of vehicle and market that Toyota started with their little 167"" RAV4 some 16 years ago! GM cleverly re-invented that class of SUV that was abandoned about 10 years ago by the main players as they had all grown about a foot! The 1.4L Turbo Encore has very good looks, great interior, optimal usage of space, great economy and very good power for it's size and class. A great SUV for younger, older folk or empty nesters. Critics have stated a 'lack of power and space', what?? This IS SUPPOSED to be a 168"" SUB Compact SUV, not a Porsche, if you want more power and space you can easily jump up into the 180"" (15') Compact SUV class! For 2016, Buick has released the more powerful updated 1.4L Turbo DI engine with 153 HP and 177 ft/lbs torque, available as a Sport Touring which should make the power hungry drivers happier. Bear in mind, a lot of the other sub compact SUV's have the mindless whining belt and pulley CVT transmission system and the Encore is one of the few still using a lovely smooth 6 speed automatic. No doubt the best looking and one of the best choices in the Sub Compact SUV class.",5

Certainly not built here nor does it have a majority of American made parts. Point is the Buick dealership wanted our business and had a smart, sharp looking vehicle to offer us. A week in to it and my wife and I both love it. Plenty of space for the two of us, empty nesters, and plenty of pep to get us around town and so far to where ever we want to go. Looks, feels and drives like something that will last us for years to come. At our age we have driven alot of new cars. This does not feel cheap. On par with more expensive vehicles we've owned. And alot of features you'd look for in higher end cars and SUV's. I have no reason to suggest not buying or leasing a Buick Encore.....so several months into it.

With kids now in their later teens and no need for large car but with seating up higher, the Encore was selected. The ride performance from the smaller turbo is better than most pro reviews in that their expectations for 0 to 60 are only satisfied when buying an eight cylinder Camaro or that ilk of car. The comfort and quietness make this a great ride. The luxury features with the saddle leather and roof make it seem a lot bigger than it is.

I liked everything else except the engine and transmission.  It's programmed for gas mileage, which was 27+ the entire trip, but not performance and there is no Sport mode to keep it tight.  This was a vehicle I had been looking at as a potential replacement for mine, but after renting it, I would NEVER spend that kind of money on this vehicle.

I remembered it was quiet, smooth and just felt good sitting inside one, but I didn't buy one because of its stigma of being something grandparents drove. The last car I had bought was an Infiniti G37x. It's definitely a nice ride, but a premium gas guzzler. Recently I had a suboptimal customer experience during my last service at the Infiniti dealership, so bit the bullet and went across the street and test drove a Buick Encore, and never looked back. It's still the same as I remembered Buick as a child- quiet, smooth, and now that I'm driving- great visibility, handling and safety features...just a very nice comfortable ride in a highly reliable car. I am not a car mechanic, so safety and reliability are important features to me in selecting my vehicle. Plus, I'm now saving more than half at the pumps with a bigger crossover than my last sedan.

However, there was one glaring problem: the drivers side and center rear seat belts were partially missing.  We thought the missing parts were simply down beneath the seats, but extensive efforts to find them were fruitless.  We reported the problem to the rental car company when we returned it.  The car had only 700 miles on it when we rented it and was otherwise was fine, except the rear doors sometimes required a second hard slam to close them.  Beyond the apparent careless construction, the vehicle was just fine.  It was rather noisy on the highways, but that is likely due to the rough concrete highways in southern California.  The seats were comfortable and the controls relatively intuitive.  Parking, as expected with such a small vehicle was easy.  The engine had to work hard to get the car up to highway speed, but it was adequate.  The car was equipped with Apple CarPlay, which worked well with my phone except for seemingly randomly altering the volume.  Overall, the Encore offers a lot for the price, which appears to top out in the low thirties fully equipped.  There were several Encores on the rental car company lot, so it is likely that the car sells at a significant discount over sticker price.  We averaged 30.5 mpg over about 1,050 miles of mixed driving if the computer in the car is accurate.",3

Price, without rebates, is excessive.  No passenger armrest is unforgivable.  Cargo area is a bit tight and I wish it had a bit more room for things.  Everything else is good or great, mostly great.  Front seats have helped with my neuropathy by supporting the back of my legs.  Car holds road at well over speed limit, handles great, and is like when I owned my Mini Countryman - like driving a go-kart.  Shifts great.  Enough power.  No complaints.  Everything has worked as it should and provides a good value when you consider rebates.  I would recommend this car to everyone and anyone.....most don't realize it, but this is one amazing car and will fit the bill for many even if they don't know it yet.  Headlights with fog lights on are simply amazing.  I've never owned a car I have enjoyed so much and am so glad to have.  Quiet ride.  Great radio.  Too many goods to mention.  We purchased this about a week ago.  We've logged over 500 miles and while it is a good car in lots of ways, some basic things seem to have eluded the engineers at Buick.  Note, this is made in South Korea, not in the USA as would be assumed if it has the Buick name.  The biggest complaint I have to start out with is the lack of a passenger armrest, and the almost completely useless one attached to the driver's seat.  Come on, really, no center arm rest?  We didn't realize it during our short test drive, but it is very annoying.  Two adults sitting side by side in the front, are sucking up each other's oxygen.  The cabin feels cramped.  And that you could deal with if there were a stupid center armrest.  Many things about this car are great - gas mileage is about 27 mpg with mixed driving, and a quiet ride and decent handling of bumps.  Steering is easy and accurate, and easy to get into a parking spot.  The A/C and heat work well.  The car has a decent feel about it, not cheesy or junky.  It is smaller than other SUV's, and I'd say over priced for the size and functionality of this car.  BUT, we needed a less expensive car and still wanted an SUV, with AWD.  This, coupled with the 16% off from GM, it turned out to be the answer for us to downsize our car payments.  For the pricepoint of $25K after discounts, you get an SUV, with AWD, and a host of features that you could not get on other SUV's.  So, it fits the bill.  Awesome LED daytime lights, which double as parking lights and turn signals, LED tail lights and brake lights, which is really amazing.  Plus, fog lights.  Auto on/off lights.  Navigation.  Carplay (although it is buggy).  Side blind spot monitors in the mirrors.  Upgraded cool 18"" wheels with nice tires.  A real spare (mini spare, but not a can of flat fix).  And the car is overall a good value for the money, compared to the SUV I have for my use.  Without the 16% back,  I would not have bought this as it would have been out of my price expectations.  It isn't perfect, but for what it is, and what it cost, I'd say it is a decent value.  You have more leg room up front than you'll need.  This helps the back seat passengers, who could not fit unless the seats are slid forward.  The cargo area is small, but the rear seats do fold down and that opens up alot of space.  This fit our plan to shrink our car payments and provides a decent value with the 16% off sale.",5

The once upon a time in disclosing that the car ""used to belong"" is just about the best way to turn around and leave any dealership.  I have owned my car for 11 month and in the beginning it was just want I wanted. although the price in paying off the mother in laws issues is not worth it, I felt I could afford the thing which has turned in the creature from the black lagoon. I have had it towed to two different Buick dealerships 6 times and i just waiting for the 7th the pop up any day now.  The service departments have replaced the batteries 4 times and one was a call back and I don't even remember what the other issue was.  None-the-less the surgical attempts failed and I am stuck with the grayest lemon in the city of Massillon, Ohio.  I have reviewed several other reviews from individuals who shared having the same problem and the results were the same unresolved by Mr. GM  and the dealership.  At one point, there was contact with the dealership  that was made but being told to take it somewhere that services Buick was fine, but no offers of support were ever issued. You know you have a semi-lemon (semi because it will work on occasion) When a opening statement of regret starts as ""Well."" Alright you have been had kiddo, lights out, party's' over, pig's on the griddle and you have been cooked.  Why is there not a legitimate complaint division for cars? and true  justice for a lemon. Yes I do I understand the lemon law but who's to listen.  Such unrequited trust in what we count as justice, until those who we count on to deliver justice is wearing our size 9.5's.

What a treat that was! I am used to driving in a 2005 Chevy Cavalier. I always had to clime off of the floor of that car. I deliver pizza's for Domino's Pizza, and I can deliver up to 30 deliveries in an 8 hour day. That's a total of 60 times I had to crawl out of that car, and hit my head on the roof  getting in, and out of that car. But enough of the Cavalier. Now I finally found my ''Dream Vehicle'' for delivering. Easy in and out. I just step in, and out with no effort at all. I am impressed. Just Imagine having to just step out of the car now. My knees, and back are thanking me to the hilt! Other wise it is a Quiet and comfortable car to drive. The handling is perfect. I need to make sudden U-Turns in my job, and this car can do them on the dime. Did I mention Quiet? Wow! It's Buick Quiet all right. I stopped at a traffic light to make a left turn the other day, and a car stopped next to me in the right lane. Business as usual right? Well I turned to look out my passenger window, and I saw the lady next to me get out of her car, and go to the rear or her car. She was mad all heck about something. Then I realized another car had hit her from behind. The other car behind her was smashed into  her car. To think I didn't even hear a thing. Now that's what I call Buick Quiet! Any way, I love my Buick Encore. And I recommend it for all the people that need head room, leg room, easy in and out, and a car with all the fetchers you would ever want for comfort, and safety.

The visibility is not that great, but it does have a back up camera and blind spot detection so that helps.  For a very small car with a 1.4L engine it is pretty zippy from a stop so that is nice.  Never felt like it bogged down like some of these cars can.  I have put about 30,000 miles on the car since owning it and have had regular maintenance done ( great systems for reminders built in to car).  One day last week my engine went out in rush hour traffic.  No warning, no lights, no nothing.  It was working one minute and then the next just unable to excelerate and TONS of white smoke.  Luckily I was able to pull off as I was in the outer lane and could coast.  AAA picked me up and took us to the dealer for repair.  Still under warranty so no problem there and everyone was nice, helpful and got me in a rental and on my way quickly.  About 3 days later they called me with the news that there is a factory defect in the 3rd piston that caused it to break unexpectedly.  They are currently replacing all 4 pistons and SAID that they checked all other parts in the engine and everything else looks fine......I am not convinced as that amount of smoke had to cause some type of damage to the rest of the engine.  I won't get my car back for several more days,  but now I am terrified to drive it and afraid that they will just draw it out until the warranty runs out.  I am not basing this on anything  but fear as they have been great so far.  Mine is a 2014 model - not basic but also not fully loaded.  One of the cutest cars on the road in this class, but now I am afraid of it.  Ugh.Update:  I no longer own this car.  I went through some post tramatic stress after it almost got me killed on the freeway and I traded it in on another car.  Hopefully it's next owner has better luck with it.",2

I've had several small cars that were so noisy when driving, I tried not to go on long trips in them. First day I had my Encore I had to make an emergency trip in pouring down rain with several tornado sightings for 200 miles. Driving that far is hard for me as I have spinal issues, but I wasn't hurting when I got to my destination. My Contessa has enough power to go up hill with the air conditioning on, handles well in the rain, and is getting a consistent 28.4 mpg. The air conditioning works well in the Texas heat, Thank The Lord! The only complaints I have is, I was hit by another car going 10 mph and had $1400. in damage to the drivers door. The body repair shop told me that the parts are very expensive. The back seat was not made for car seats either, it handles a booster seat well but for a full carseat facing forward, the back of the car seat will not sit against the back of the car seats and that concerns me for anyone with small children.

The only cons that I have about it are, as mentioned in other reviews, it doesn't have the pep you'd expect with turbo; I find that braking isn't as good as I thought it should be; and rear view visibility is impaired by the back seat headrests.

Plenty of controls for the driver seat position, even lumbar support, but the seat was feeling a little hard after only an hour of highway driving.  The main screen is bright and clear with intuitive controls.  Only the driver gets an arm rest.  It's odd, but there are only three vent configurations: foot, dash, and windshield.  The interior has a refined appearance with a leather wrapped steering wheel and soft-touch dash.  An auxiliary jack and USB are easily accessible.  Plenty of storage bins and cubbies.

It's the Swiss Army knife of small SUVs. It does everything we want it to do.  My husband drove it across the country last summer with our dog. It has been a great road trip car. Quiet and smooth. It also feels very lux inside.  It holds way more than its small size indicates. For example, So we have hauled ( at different times) a power washer, a 55"" TV, and 3 large dogs. It's very easy to fold both back and passenger seats. I would like it to get better mpg, but that's my only quibble. We have had no problems of any kind. I understand the new ones have push button start and improved rear camera with guidelines which improves an already great vehicle. I'd buy it again. I bought this car 2 months ago and we are both liking it more and more every day.   I love a small car that's quiet and it has a high quality interior.  Reviews about its lack of power are misleading. It has plenty of pep with the turbo and it actually gets better gas mileage than I thought it would.

The 'On-Star' feature with Buick is incredible:  If the vehicle is stolen, contacting On-Star allows them to disable the vehicles engine wherever it is.

I blame myself for not having done any homework to find out its features. The salesman told me that the engine was a 1.4 liter turbocharged engine. He said ""1.4"", but I heard ""2.4' , which is what I was used to. He never mentioned the Auto Stop/Start. Basically this feature stops the engine at a traffic light when the car comes to a stop and the foot is fully depressed on the brake pedal. This feature is supposed to save a minuscule amount of gas, therefore conforming to some government set fuel efficiency standard. It really bother me that such a thing could be engineered into a car. The only way to keep the engine form stopping is to shift to manual or neutral. If you shift to neutral, you can shift back to drive and the engine will keep running. If you shift to manual, the engine will quit when you return to drive. The problem with manual is that if you leave it in manual and forget that you'll have to shift manually, you'll run the RPM up to the red line before realizing that you forgot to go to drive.                                                    This is a good car for around town, except for that feature. The gas tank holds only around 14 gallons, so that it appears to burn more than it does.",4

At first this feature was intriguing but after 5 mos of it starting and stopping all the time at traffic lights etc it became a real nuisance. The  A/C also changes temp and gets hotter and fan slows down..also on heat as the compressor also shuts off.  I decided to take it to the dealer and have it disabled...unfortunately that isnt possible..for some damn reason?? Software issue or program design bug? Dealership and Buick wont offer any allowance for my gruntled issue on a new 2017 w/o this stupid feature either. So be damn sure you understand what this does before you get stuck with it on an Encore. To save 50c a week this isnt worth the BS to have it.

2919, on 10/29/16 01:53 AM (PDT),Kent ,2016 Buick Encore SUV Convenience 4dr SUV (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Really nice vehicle ... but," I came real close to buying a Buick Encore.  I really like the styling and trim.  And, the size is perfect for me.  I do question the 1.4L engine.  Turbo chargers do not favorably impress me.  Just something else to go wrong.  I finally took one for a test drive.  Did not seem to be as spunky as my 2.0L 2000 Tracker but maybe I could get used to it.  The Tracker is 17 years old now.  I bought it new in November of 1999.  I really do need a new vehicle now.  Sadly, I had to walk away from the Encore because of the dark tinted glass.  I am older now, don't see as well as when I was young.  Always have had some trouble seeing at night.  It gets worse when you get older.  You will understand that later.  Tinted glass is a real pain for me.   I don't care if people can see in.  I need to be able to see out, in every direction, front, back, and sides.  That is what is important and the Encore fails in that respect.  The Encore does not seem to be available without the dark tinted glass in the back.  That seems to be the case with most of the new SUVs.  Even the front glass is a bit dark for me.  I guess I am going to have to keep on driving my 1994 and 2000 4WD Trackers.  They go in the deep snow and on the ice.   And they can pull your boat and trailer out of the water at the lake shore.  The Encore can't even pull a small trailer.  And they call it a SUV.  I don't  know that AWD would be as good.  My Trackers do have very light tinted glass.  Don't even need that but it is tolerable.  Clear glass would be better.  I know the dark tinted glass is only in the rear but it reduces the available light throughout the interior of the vehicle.  I really need a new car but I can't find anything acceptable to me.  Everything has dark tinted glass and they all seem to have way too many buttons on the dash.  I can't drive and read the operator's manual at the same time.  I don't text and drive.  I like to be able to find the controls by touch.  I don't want to have to look for them.  I have to keep my mind on the road.  I don't want distractions.  This is all insane.  Aftermarket tint is readily available for all car windows.  Why do the automobile manufacturers have to force tinted glass on all of us?  It definitely is a serious safety hazard.",3

The Encore has enough power to accelerate into the highway with no problem. I could have used folding side mirrors and the knob that adjusts the mirrors was much better on the Tucson than the Encore.

This concerns me, for it would indicate there is no feedback to the factory that there is a potential performance issue with the current Encore design, not to mentio the fact that if this symptom gets worse with time, there is no reference as to the fact that it was exhibited when brand new.",4
2929, on 07/08/16 05:23 AM (PDT),Jody ,2016 Buick Encore SUV Sport Touring 4dr SUV AWD (1.4L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Plenty of Acceleration," I read quite a few reviews that suggested that the Encore is a bit sluggish. Though I would not take it out on the autobahn, we were very happy with the Sport Touring trim (new for 2016) that has a slightly more powerful engine and AWD. During the test drive, I practically demanded that we take the car out on the freeway and drove several miles out of the way to do so. I'm so glad I did as acceleration was more than sufficient to deal with traffic on I-95 near Philadelphia (if you know the area, you will know that is no small feat). Remember, this is a compact SUV - you don't need a 6- or 8- cylinder engine to pull this weight. In terms of interior comfort and size, I am more than impressed. There are plenty of storage options, totally flat-folding seats, and a 60/40 split bench seat that grants an extra amount of flexibility. We have a pretty good-sized dog and her accompanying crate (24""x36""x36"") and we were able to get the crate into the car on the 60 side - thus keeping one seat in the back still open. Everything else has been great thus far and Buick has joined the rest of the car world by offering free maintenance for two years. All in all, we are quite pleased with the purchase.",5

However, for safety reasons I did not want a car with ""Push Button Start/Stop""  or electronic parking brake. So my choices narrowed down to a few models. However, test drive of the Honda Accord was a complete disappointment because of the cheap materials used inside for everything including side panels, fabric etc. Plus the car was extremely noisy which I never expected. So I started research on all the other cars available out there that look beautiful, have a reliable history, used quality materials, and satisfy my requirements I mentioned earlier. Based on photos and reviews, I kept coming back to Buick Encore which I decided to buy outright after test driving it. So far, I have not been disappointed. My husband who was a little skeptical earlier loves the car too and so do my kids. Also with 20% rebate from Buick + dealer discount, I got a great deal on the car.",5

The price is right.  It's one of the few cars that might convince me to buy American again (it's been more than 20 years).

Maybe in 15 seconds with a tailwind -- which is going to cause problems getting on California's freeways and squirting in and out of traffic -- perhaps it's enough for states where they drive slower and more lawfully, but not here.  And this is on the increased-horsepower sport/touring model.  The base model is almost undriveable.I know that GM has better engines in its lineup.  There's no excuse for not having the option to put 200-250 horses under the hood (look at the VW Tiguan and BMW X1 to see this done well).  That change would make all the difference, and it's an absolute shame how much the current powerplants completely ruin the car.(I'm also one of the tiny minority of people who would prefer all cars to at least be available with a manual transmission... but for vehicles in this class, I know that will never happen)",2

I wanted a compact car where I can sit slightly above the road and getting in and out would be easy on my lower back. I am a recent graduate and due to less credit history, most dealers rejected lease but the folks at Buick were great - they offered a 2-year lease at a decent price. The car is extremely comfortable and the driver seat comes with electronic adjustments and excellent lumbar support. I cannot find words to stress on how comfortable the driving experience is! It's interiors are great for a base model with leather accented seats, generously sized dashboard buttons and good leg room in rear seats. It also has OnStar care and satellite radio. It's modestly powered by a 1.4L turbo engine which does the job for a FWD. Major concerns about this car is external noise, horrendous bluetooth music playback(the rep told me that bluetooth is for voice only) and flat, muffled sounding speakers.Due to the external noise, i need to turn up the music volume and the speakers just sound bad (remember, this is a base model without the Bose active noise-cancellation setup). Music playback via AUX, radio and CD sound better. I didn't realize that the speakers were bad during the test drive but I've leased it for 2 years only. Overall, I highly recommend this car in the subcompact crossover segment if you're not too particular about brands or you don't mind a less sporty car. This car scores over all others for driving comfort which mattered the most. If you're thinking about leasing this for 2-3 years, i'd say it is a definite go, but get the higher end model with sunroof and bose speakers as it's so much more fun and exciting to step into your car!",4

The basic design of the Encore is overshadowed by a ton of unnecessary  glam. An overpowering front grill and a lot of randomly placed chrome has basically turned the car into a distasteful quinceanera dress. And don't even consider having a front seat passenger that weighs more that 150 pounds as they will not fit in the seat.Think long and hard before buying a car and then go and purchase one that you will get compliments on.

I was intending to buy a Buick Regal, but was unhappy with the lack of visibility in my previous Buick sedan. The salesman suggested I test drive an Encore as well as the Regal. I loved the Encore! The visibility was much better, I enjoyed sitting higher up, and it was easier to park. Granted the trunk is rather small and there probably isn't much leg room in the back seat, but I rarely have a rear seat passenger, so that is fine. Also  important to me is that it has OnStar with Turn by Turn navigation and hands-free calling. This is a perfect vehicle for a retired lady who enjoys a certain amount of luxury in her car.Now that summer is here, I'm finding the air conditioning very comfortable and responsive. There is no cold air blowing on my hands. When I turn the temp higher or lower, I feel the difference immediately.I now have had my car 13 months. I do miss the large trunk I had in previous cars. I often end up putting things in the back seat because they do not fit in the trunk. Also I find that I hear quite a bit of road noise when driving. I often have to turn up the radio because of the road noise. When I drive through a puddle, there is a loud roaring sound. The first time I heard it I thought my tire was falling off or something. These are things I can live with and the overall good looks and easy handling of the vehicle balance them out.I did have one huge disappointment. A few months ago I drove over a pothole at the side of the road and ended up with a dented rim. In nearly sixty years of driving I have never before had a dented rim. Then I found out that, because rims these days are made of an aluminum alloy rather than steel, it could not be repaired. I ended up paying $500 to replace the wheel. This was not covered by the warranty. This failing of materials used in the wheels I cannot accept. This is wrong!",4

The rental used a diesel engine that ran great and got great mileage, I don't  know the US engine.  I had never even heard of Vauxhall and was looking for information on this car here when I found it was the same basic car.   We drove all over the highlands, narrow winding roads at highway speeds, small towns, and some city driving.  This is one of the most comfortable cars I've ever driven.  It handles really well on windy roads.  The parking aides and sensors were really useful as this is a big car for a lot of UK spaces.  The passenger space is really roomy and comfortable.  The storage space is incredible.  I wouldn't buy it without test driving the US engine, but everything else is top notch. I've seen reviews try to compare it to Subaru wagons.  Its not an off road vehicle, it's a much nicer drive for anywhere else.",5

I had an AWD Cadillac Sport Wagon before and would have bought another but they discontinued it. Frankly the TourX is better in every way. Although powered by a Turbo 4 it has enough oomph with the 250 HP & helpful 295 lb.-ft. of torque to move nicely, abet, more HP would always be nice. We have the Black with Shale interior, Essence trim - all options and the MSRP was around $41,600. Comparable wagons like the BMW, Audi and Volvo are much more $$. The fact that this is an Opel is actually good as it's made in Germany and known to be a good car. We don't have many miles on it yet but our 1st impression using it is it's a very roomy and good looking wagon that handles and rides well. No dislikes as of today.",5

Was impressed by the feel of the brakes and steering as well as the ride, which was not wallow-y at all.  However, I did not drive it hard so no conclusions there.  Low speed ride was solid, steering and brakes responsive and not over servoed.  Felt the engine was a little bit tepid for a car of this mass, I could see having to mat it frequently when picking up speed.  Also has the expected turbo lag down low from a stop but nothing too objectionable.  Quite roomy  inside, tons of cargo space.  Controls, during my short drive, seemed logical and easy to operate. Overall I would like to spend more time in it and drive it a little harder to see how it behaves.  One note, there was a small rattling noise over bumps, I suspect it was the sunroof but could not verify.",4

I've had the car for approximately 11 months, and it's proven a reliable and very comfortable vehicle, equal or greater then several luxury cars I've owned.  Acceleration is punchy, braking good, though handling is very floaty and steering lacks feedback.  Front and rear seats are equally comfortable, and with the bench seat I can comfortably carry 6 passengers to dinner or around down.  With 5 passengers it's common for all passengers to fall asleep - the car is quiet as a church mouse and very smooth, although the tires do allow for some poor feedback on rougher roads.  The interior and driving experience is very 90s American, comfortable, unapologetic, and almost lackadaisical.  Interior quality and ergonomics are adequate - if I place a loose object on the passenger seat while driving alone it will almost certainly fall between in the space between the top part of the seat and the bottom.  Cupholders are too few and too flimsy.  Technology is what you expect from a 2005 - no Bluetooth, navigation or active safety to speak of, but the steering wheel audio and cruise controls, AM/FM/CD/Cassette radio, dual power seats with memory, automatic headlights all make the driving experience easy.  Getting in and out is easy - I have a disabled family member who can get in from a wheelchair easily.  Reliability has been great - have replaced tires.  Value is excellent, there are a lot of good examples at much lower prices - it's really a comfortable, safe, spacious vehicle - the ride is as good as any luxury vehicle out there!  PROS: Ride quality, value, space, comfort, reliability, smooth power-train.  CONS:  Dated interior materials (even for 2005), ergonomics,  big car to park.  Highly recommended for its value and comfort, the 3.8 liter V6 is exceptionally smooth and reliable - I've had it in several vehicles with no issues.",5

You need to press down all the way on the gas pedal to get it to accelerate. Steering! To make this car make a sharp turn, forget it. A sharp U turn it cannot do. A sharp turn into a parking space, after 3 to 5 up and backs you can get in the parking space. This is not a Park Ave Ultra. This is a car that was thrown together and put out to sell. I still have my 99 Park Ave Ultra and I will take it over this one any day. I leased the 2005 for 3yr. I wished I bought it so I could get rid of it .",3

Fits my tall frame well, and is so comfortable to drive, whether in town or on the Interstate, smooth riding, easy handling. Have even considered getting a second one, just to have available. Did put aluminum wheels on when the original chrome wheels began to peel a bit - that resulted in even better handling. Buick would be well advised to produce an anniversary edition in commemoration of the introduction of this model. The highway mileage is great for a luxury car of its vintage - get 30-32 mpg at Interstate speeds. Want to keep it forever.  My son wants it after that. My mechanic does too. Even fairly good gas mileage around town. Hit a deer while night driving on an Interstate, took front end damage, drove to the berm, was towed to a great body shop, and two fenders plus a hood and windshield later, it rides as well as ever.

It has only had two major failures both of which had to do with the plenium (intake manifold) rupturing and dumping water on the pistons.  Neither instance seemed to have harmed performance in any way.  The only other problem--last week the power steering unit fell off.  I do not remember any specific thing I may have hit in the road that could have broken the bolts, but the car has had a couple of jolts from things which I ran over at high speed.  One of which was the recap off a truck tire at night.  It did warp a rim.  It's cranked right away (179,000 miles) and it has been a great road car. ",4.625

3120, on 03/17/17 17:26 PM (PDT),Ray Grib ,1999 Buick Park Avenue Sedan 4dr Sedan,The last of the really great American gunboats.," First off, I think this is the best looking large American luxury car ever designed. It is rolling sculpture with beautiful curved lines and nothing over-stated. You would think Buick commissioned Jaguar and Italian experts to create this elegant masterpiece. Modern Cadillacs are ugly abortions with hard angular lines and boxy styling. They lost the concept of the big American luxury-liner by trying to compete with German luxury/performance brands. Well guess what...who cares about road ripping performance? The truly great American luxury cars are all about the big floating ride and lush comfort, period. Buick nailed it down right in every category with the Park Avenue. If the yuppies snicker about big luxury-liners, let them buy their BMW's and carve up mountain roads. I'd rather sensibly cruise down the road with one finger on the steering wheel and totally surrounded in luxurious, living room comfort. With that being said, the Buick has enough power to get you around in style. This car has enough electronic features to make you take college courses just to understand and utilize them, but a downside is they were not thoroughly designed and some may go bad over time. The trunk is cavernous and can hold major groceries. Passengers totally relax in the big bench seats like a limo. The stereo is adequate, but you can really improve the quality with aftermarket upgrades (Hint: the trunk is perfect for a large subwoofer box firing towards the rear. This gives concert hall bass performance). Nothing on the road today feels like this bygone masterpiece of cruising on the open sea. This is a ride that we saw a lot of as kids in most American cars, but now is basically extinct...what a crying shame. So get a Park Avenue if you want total old-fashioned American luxury and don't care about racing with Euro cars. If you are like me, every time you get behind the wheel, nothing can wipe the grin off of your face.",5

The 3.8 L engine is easy on gas and provides adequate power in typical driving conditions.  The only negative I have experienced with the car is that the front brakes require above average maintenance.  Overall, a small price to pay.

While the Grand Prix is sporty, it doesn't hold a candle to the size, ride, mpg and trouble free driving I have experienced with the Park Avenue.  I routinely get over 30 mpg on the highway and over 20 mpg in the city, that is better than my 4 cylinder pick up truck! I purchase my current Buick with 57,000 miles on it and now have over 112,000 and have only had to perform routine maintenance on the vehicle.

I feel safe in this car, performed very well in crash testing. The large interior space is well thought out, wind and road noise are very hushed.

I bought this mid-size from Fitzgerald Chevrolet in Frederick, MD. It was a one owner car with 150k miles. So far, I have put over 1,500 miles on this Rendezvous mostly highway miles.  I like the spacious cabin and outward view of the road.  I have put two bikes in the cargo area with the back seats folded down.  The 3.5 liter 6 cylinder engine runs well though slightly underpowered going up steep hills.  Gas mileage is acceptable on the highway. This  was a one owner vehicle which had 150k miles so I was a bit concerned about buying the car.  However, one reviewer a reporter from Chicago wrote an article about his Rendevous that has over 300k miles doing just  routine maintenance.  Other reviewers have expressed concern over reliability of the Rendevous and these may have been from particularly earlier model years.  Nonetheless, I am taking a chance expecting to keep my Rendevous as an interim car for travel and biking.Update:  as others noted, the brake system in the Rendezvous is problematic when turning the wheels causing stuttering and anti lock braking problems.  The windshield wipers locked up once which was unnerving  The vehicle started leaking oil.  As this vehicle was high mileage, we took a chance on it knowing we would drive it until problems surfaced.  We did like that it had lots of space for our bikes and used it for one vacation trip.

Should the seatbelts reliably ""lock"" when needed (not proven), children are at risk for severe injury if they are not sitting upright or if the belt literally ""snaps"" them backwards.

I'd buy one again if they still made them. My teenage step daughter drove the 2004 for a couple years and it held up through all the teenagers being hauled around. She loved the vehicle and wanted her own when she moved out. I know people are talking about all these issues they have had but I can honestly say we own two and they still to this day drive great.,5

It is a 2004 AWD and will soon celebrate her 14th Bday.  I chuckle at the Buick commercials about 'not your grandma's Buick', as I have grandpups.  Such a smooth ride.  I love driving it.  I sorted reviews in date order prior to mine, the man mentioned a wet floor. If his came off same line as mine, that is a factory defect, I learned this in 2014. Always had wet carpet but I had a garage. Then I moved and it was outside, got very wet.  I think because i lived in Iowa and had snowy feet, went thru 100 year floods about every year,  and lived on a  muddy gravel road, i chalked it up to that. The seal was not tight on the window. The GM dealer had the window guy work on it, not a problem.   I live in Iowa, in 2016 I drove it to Pueblo, Colorado to my sisters for Thanksgiving.  On the way home I hit 170,000 miles in Lincoln, NE.  Averaged about 20 mpg.  Prior to that (with high mileage) I drove it to Mall of America twice. I loaded it up with stuff my daughter wanted from IKEA and it fit in the back end well.  I have never worried about reliability.  Repairs have been wheel bearings, which is a known problem to GM on this model. I think at about 130,000 the differential fluid dripped off the back, so some gaskets or seals were replaced - since took it in right away, no major damage done. Had the tranny fluid and radiator flushed at this time.  At 160,000 the oil pan was replaced along with the transmission fluid lines.  In 2016 a new tire rod on on right side (pot hole side of the road)  and in 2017 a muffler.  Registration is $51/year,   runs like a dream and I will keep it for a very long time.

Some minor issues with the hatchback, and the rear wiper motor had to be replaced already. Handling is good except in tight high speed turns where it feels top heavy. Over all I love the vehicle, especially the all wheel drive in winter. I would buy another if they held thier value better, but after losing half the value of the purchase price in one year I would advise against buying one unless you plan on keeping it around for at least 4 years.

My mileage has been between 27 and 28 mpg on trips.  It is very quiet and comfortable.  It feels nimble and responsive.  Only one minor repair, low fuel warning not working required reprograming the computer.  The sound system is very powerful.  The large outside mirrors help for backing, otherwise visibility out the rear window is restricted due to high profile.  The center console is the best I have ever used, many useful compartments.  Front wheel drive gives better performance and mileage, and reduces repair bills. ",4.875

All in all this has been a good car for us and on many occasions had the need to use the 7 available seats (which doesn't leave a lot of cargo room). When the two back seats are hidden there is plenty of cargo room and when all seats are tucked a lot of cargo room but only two people for the front seats can ride. Only gets approx. 14 miles per gal. for a 6 cylinder. My gas gage has been broken since we purchased this vehicle but I am able to use the set (gas used) to determine when to fill up. The AWD light has been intermittent and/or on most of the time since we have owned this and always no one can figure out why... drives better when on (ha ha), breaks will sometimes grind when coming to a stop when the light is off, but no one see's this when testing... uggh! Repairs mostly normal wear and tear as with any vehicle oil, brakes, filters, battery and now alternator (we think). Early on we did have to have the head gasket repaired that was over $2000. Can be a bit expensive on even the smallest of repairs. Hate having to go to dealer to fix as they are always the most expensive! The alternator repair could cost over $450 unless I can find someone else to repair at a lower cost...uggh thank god for having a second car for the moment!",5

Sadly over 4 years the wiring went out underneath the car which made it stop... mid drive.I replaced the radiator, there were yearly replacements to a wheel bearing, and my fuel level indicator crapped out so I regularly ran out of gas.Finally the A/C drain hose pretty much ruined my interior with mold and I finally had to trade it in.",3.5

Has a high-quality feel to it.  Has a good amount of room inside for the fuel mileage.  Larger utility vehicles like the Trailblazer get much worse mileage.

Unline the Highlander and competing vehicles, the Rendezvous has a third row seat capable of comfortably holding two adults.  I've even sat back there, myself.

What vehicle doesn't? But, they are too minor to mention.  Consumer reports called the interior 'cheap', but I found the Toyota Sienna had a much more cheap feel.  I think CR really has an anti GM bias.  The Rendezvous doesn't do anything excellent, but for me it does everything very well I bought a prior rental with 9850 miles and saved thousands.

Seats are very comfortable, but rear seat leg room is easily decreased, if there are tall front seat passengers.  The trunk can handle a good amount of luggage or cargo, and even more if the rear seats are folded down.  In summing this Buick Verano up... this vehicle has luxury, functionality, quality and style for a reasonable price and it looks so sporty, even when just sitting on the driveway.After 8 months of loving this Buick Verano, needed to trade it in for a larger SUV to accommodate transporting grandchildren and young nieces and nephews when moved to Florida.

People complain about the grill but I think it looks expensive and unique. My younger brother thought it was a Bentley at first glance. In my opinion, the grills on the Asian cars all look the same. The size of this car makes it easy to maneuver and park. Smooth quiet ride that Buick is known for. However, the acceleration is lackluster. I preferred the 2013 Regal Turbo but I couldn't afford it. The Verano is just fine otherwise, but if you have an extra 3K to spend, get the Regal Turbo.After 1 yr of ownership ive put an additional 11k miles on the car, ive had to change the front driver tire twice. And the fake leather seats on the convenience trim stain really easily, not very convenient. One day, the car died on me and i jumped it. One hour later it died again and i had to jump it again. It didn't die on me again after that but i took it to the dealership the very next day. And they said they couldn't find anything wrong with it and there was nothing wrong with the battery.

This Buick attracts a lot of younger people that want luxury car features at an affordable price.  The Verano is a sporty car, but also a great family vehicle.  The upgraded package can includes leather heated seats, a 9 speaker Bose audio system, heated steering wheel, electric seats, rear backup camera and a push to start ignition. While the basic package is well-received, the upgrades are worth the extra money. These upgrades can bring the price to over $25,000.	The 2013 Buick Verano comes with two different engine sizes. The base engine is a 4 cylinder 2.4 L able to produce 180 horsepower at 6,700 RPM’s. For a sportier feel the upgraded engine is a 4 cylinder 2.0 L with a turbo for and extra boost of 250 horsepower at 5,300 RPM’s. With a base engine, I noticed that you barley have to hit the gas for the engine to get up in speed. The Verano only comes with a 6 speed automatic transmission that shifts very smoothly through gears.  Even know you might think the smaller the engine the better gas mileage,  this isn’t true. Buick has put an eco-friendly engine in the Verano. Both models come with a fuel tank capacity size of 15.6 gallons. The fuel economy is rated at 21 miles per gallon in the city and 30 to 32 miles per gallon on the highway. I drive 30 miles round trip 6 days out of the week  and have noticed excellent gas mileage.	Safety and security features are another great aspect of this car. The Buick Verano includes a driver and passenger airbags. There are also rear side-impact airbags and overhead airbags, for a total of 10, that make passengers feel safe in case of an accident or if the car was to roll over. Other people may wonder if the Verano is secure in weather related conditions.   I would say yes, because it is equipped with traction control, ABS brakes and break assist. The Verano is front wheel drive which helps in snow because the weight of the engine is in the front pushing the tires down to grip the surface.  In a crash test,  the Verano tested 5 out of 5 stars for its excellent safety features. The car also comes with security features such as a panic alarm, 4 door locks and immobilizer which will prevent the wrong key from going in the ignition to keep thieves away from stealing the vehicle.	Safety, security and high tech features are why I would suggest a Buick Verano to anyone that is looking for a reliable car to get them to point A and B and back. The only con I had with this car is its limited backseat room which is not that big of a problem.  Overall I would rate the 2013 Buick Verano an 8 out of 10 stars.",4

The car gets good all around gas mileage in the mid 20's and really good mileage on the highway (low 30's).  And it's a looker too!  Ours has the Pearl White paint and we have received many compliments on the car. I really like the waterfall grill and the chrome accents really dresses it up.  Our neighbor assumed it was a BMW.  I told him it was better!  This car is actually FUN to drive!  It is so easy to get around town and to park.  It is a Goldilocks car - not too big, not too small - it's just right. The trunk room is huge.The only things we would change if we could would be to add a little more rear seat leg room, however, if the front seats are not pushed back all the way, there is enough room. The seats, front and back, are very nice and comfortable.  The front seats are electric except for the back adjustment which is manual. Don't know why they cut that corner.  The front nose of the car could be made about an inch higher to better clear stop bars and curbs.  I know they keep it low on newer cars for aerodynamics and fuel savings but I think a little more height would be appropriate. We have really enjoyed this car over the past four years.

UPDATE - 2017:  We are on our 2nd Verano and still love it!

We had to call roadside service who had to use a slim jim to open the door from the inside just so we could pop the hood and jump start it.

The Verano fit the bill perfectly. Tasteful two-tone interior, understated exterior styling, and perfect size for an empty-nester or young professional. The base motor is only average in terms of power and MPG, but the overall goodness of the car for the price is undeniable. The well-equipped base model seems to be the best value, if you can do without the Convenience or Leather packages. 2016 update: Still enjoying this car. Extremely reliable, no issues or repairs needed during the past 3 years. Quiet, smooth running, upscale feel without a high price to buy or own. Minor nitpicks: no trunk release on trunk lid itself, thick A-pillars on windshield hamper visibility somewhat, electronic steering feels a bit vague and disconnected. Overall, still a nice car!2017 update: Interior materials and exterior finish still holding up well. Still no maintenance issues, except for a single recall fix for airbag warning. 2017 update after owning for 3 years: my original review still applies for the most part.

Unfortunately I couldn't really justify to myself why I needed that large of a car. So they showed me this Buick and I fell in love! Truthfully at first I didn't think I was going to fit in it. I'm 6'4 so I get very skeptical over vehicle size. I pushed the seat all the way back and was shocked! I couldn't touch the pedals! So on with the test drive. I was averaging 40mpg on the test drive and I was ready to sign the papers before we got back! Now, I've owned the car for 3 months now and I've put 12,300 miles on it so let me tell you what it's like living with it. I took it on a trip (360 mile round trip) and I only used 8.5 gallons. That's 42 mpg! And it was so comfortable and quiet! The interior is holding up well, however if you have the black and gray interior, expect some frustration. Anything on the black materials you touch with turn white. It's like some sort of chemical reaction happens and suddenly you have white spots everywhere. Make sure you don't have an older style iPhone (I have a 4s with THOUSANDS OF PICTURES) as plugging it in will freeze your radio, causing it to stick where it is for about 10 minutes before restarting just fine. Not a big deal, it just gets annoying because you'll never know when it's going to happen. The back seat is just about unusable. Really. Unless you have someone up front who is willing to compromise on a little leg room, it's really too tight back there. I really don't know how the engineers didn't notice this. Once I meet someone with three inch thick legs, maybe I'll understand. You cannot get fast food and expect both the driver and passenger to get soft drinks as they both won't fit into the cup holder at once. This is a pain too. They can, but it's just in the way and they have to be at an awkward angle. Lighted glovebox is something I haven't seen on a car in 20 years, and it's very nice. The car is quick, although it doesn't feel like it. It will get you into trouble because you'll think you're doing 60 when you're really doing 90. But all in all I really do love this car. It's comfortable, economical, powerful, smooth, beautiful (especially in the dark gray I have) and just all around nice! Also I got $7,000 off on the price which swayed my decision a little bit too.",5

I took my car back to the dealer. They did do a free analysis in my car no codes came back. I was told that nothing is wrong with my car. I told them I didn't feel comfortable in my car.

Mileage remains good, just had the transmission fluid serviced and car shifts like its brand new. Still comfy and enjoying the car. This a sleeper car that really shines. 6,500 on the odometer now and I have to comment how impressed I am with this car. We would have never bought a Buick, but after riding in one, before you buy something else you need to take this for a ride. Easy to get in and out of, comfortable seats, large trunk, lifetime 30MPG per the OnStar app, no issues at all, well laid out interior, nice fit and finish, and the engine and transmission work well together. We have the LEather group and the keyless ignition is awesome. This car is loaded with safety features, and when you compare to other models, and the price, you can no go wrong. Lane assist, forward facing camera, all the airbags, blind spot monitoring, self-dim rear mirror - all for an affordable price. I drive an Acura, a Jeep, Honda Civic, and another GM product, and this car is THE quietest of all of them. Reliability we'll wait and see, but so far not a single warranty claim. We're in for our first oil change in about 2 weeks, complements of Buick. Someone posted there is no back seat room. I'm 6'4"" and I don't need the front seat all the way back to be comfortable, and yes, someone can still sit behind me when I'm driving. Sure, I can push the seat all the way back, but it's not needed. This is no large 4-door sedan, so for the size car we're talking about, the interior room is impressive.Don't pass this model up.

Built on the same platform as the Chevy Cruze, and that's where the comparison stops.  Buick designed a completely different body and shares few interior parts.   It is conservatively styled and elegant.  When compared in looks to its siblings the Verano fits right in but as a compact.  It has a classy quite interior with comfortable seating.  The rear will be a little cramped for some.  The 2.4 180 HP engine with 6 speed automatic transmission is refined and smooth.  This is the same engine used for the larger base Regal.  I average around 23 MPG, not great but considering the ride and smooth shifting transmission it's no sacrifice.  The cabin environment is very inviting and features 10 airbags.  I have the convenience group in mine, it adds auto night adjusting rear view mirror, partial power drivers seat, lane change warning, frontal collision warning, heated seats, side warning system added to the standard back up camera, all this added to a long list of standard equipment.  There is a pretty user friendly  infotainment system with voice command blue tooth, standard.  The dash has some clutter but glows light blue at night.  18"" alloy wheels are standard.

On last my last trip I hauled a 600# trunk load of books, plus luggage 3,000 miles up and over mountains, around sharp curves, and the car responded beautifully! One of the design choices I enjoy is how the transmission is setup ... when you touch the gas you get immediate acceleration noooo lag and touch the brake the transmission down shifts to help brake the car. It took playing with the electric drivers seat settings to keep my thighs from getting pinched and sore.

While the natural aspirated 2.4L engine isn't a power house, it has sufficient on-ramp acceleration for merging with freeway traffic without protest.  I would probably opt for the 2.0 turbo engine if buying again;  but I was used to V-8 power prior to this purchase.  I typically get 31-34 mpg running the 75 mph speed limits on the Oklahoma turnpike, and 33-35 on secondary highways at 65 mph.

The red color with cream seats is irresistible and it is very responsive in its steering, with a sporty feel, It's actually fun to drive.  The seats are a combination of leather and fabric in the basic version which I have. Gorgeous!  There are couple of suggestions I'd make  though if  you're considering it: Take a long drive make sure seats are comfortable. I thought at first they were but he middle of the front seat which is fabric sinks down and is very hard compared to the surrounding soft leather. If I had it to do over again I'd get the all leather option. Also the gear shifting at low speeds is very noticeable, even jerky at times.  The instrumentation panel is a bit confusingly laid out, at least for me, though it's gorgeous with an innovative design. The phone system is the exception &  easy to use. In summary, I am still enjoying this car very much.  I recommend  it for those who'd like a small, fun, beautiful car with responsive handling.",4

It's been looked at twice by the dealer's service mgr, who says he called GM about it, and there is little that can be done because it has to do with valve timing.

It is also my personal weekend car as well. It is extremely comfortable and very competent on the road. I do all scheduled maintenance as recommended by the manufacturer. I currently have over 37k miles on it and not a single issue of any kind. I absolutely love this car and I'm glad I chose this over the others that I drove. I feel that for the price I paid I received an excellent value. My only irritation is that on occasion, the car cannot figure out what I am telling it on the in-car voice-controlled entertainment system. I'll ask it to tune XM CNN and it will say tuning XM 47. I'll ask it to play song title Jack and Dianne, and it will say playing I'm the man. A bit more work on voice recognition would have been nice, but it's not a big deal. It usually gives me a laugh when it makes some crazy, not even close, mistakes. I purchased a separate set of rims and tires for winter. This car NEEDS to have winter tires in New England.

While it isn't super quick or powerful, the 2.4 base engine is more than adequate for passing and maneuvering in city and highway driving, especially for commuting. The gas mileage is pretty good as well -- about mid 20s overall. The ride and handling are surprisingly composed and even nimble at times. While not a sports sedan, the car has precise steering that feels very well matched to its transmission, making it fun to drive despite its weight. As for the interior, I find the driver's seat to be comfortable and supportive, with good bolstering, and the soft-touch materials and aqua lighting are elegant. To me, the only real downsides are the number of controls on the dash (they're pretty logical after a while), the side window sills (which affect frontal visibility somewhat), and the small back seat (which is not an issue for me and is offset by the spacious trunk). Update: After 4,500 miles, the car remains solid, reliable, and very practical. The only service needed so far was an oil change. Overall, the Verano is a very good value for the money. Second Update after 7,500 miles and 14 months of ownership: The car remains solid, reliable, and very practical. The parking assistance features have been very useful when backing into spots.",4

I always wanted to step up to a new Buick, and my Sport Touring does not disappoint.  The car gives the driver a smooth, comfortable, roomy, solid feel.  I just love driving it.  The 2.4 L 4-cylinder could use a little more pickup, but it's more than adequate for Long Island highways.  I have also gotten a lot of compliments on the styling of the car. I particularly like the Buick design cues, such as the chrome ventiports on the hood and the five-spoke rims. The only major complaint I have is the infotainment system in the center stack...it's a bit convoluted, and not as intuitive as it could be.  It took about a month before I was really comfortable using the radio and navigation.  But once you get the hang of it, it becomes quite easy.  I sat in a new Buick Cascada and the center stack was quite simplified in comparison.  The back seat can be a little tight for some, although you get a big trunk in this car.

Overall I am very happy with this car, I just wish I had the turbo engine on the sport touring model.",4

3642, on 09/07/16 07:54 AM (PDT),Marc R ,2016 Buick Verano Sedan 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Would Highly Recommend," I went from a 2014 GMC SUV to the Buick Verano.  I wasn't even interested in looking at a Buick when my dealership asked me if I was interested in Buick.  They took me out to the Verano and I was impressed with the way that the exterior looked.  I have to say that it is a sleek looking vehicle and it looks like a luxury sedan, without the luxury price.  I then sat inside, and I have to say my first thought was WOW, Buick did a really good job.  Now after driving it for a month, I have to say that the ride is pleasurable, it's quiet, the entertainment features are great, and the car is a joy to drive.  It's considered a compact car however I feel like I'm driving in a full size sedan.  I just don't feel like the car is that small.  The interior design and layout is of great comfort and looks very classy.  Everyone that has been inside my car says, wow this is nice.  Buick really did a great job making this sedan look like a luxury vehicle.  My girlfriend jokes with me that I bought a luxury vehicle.  The car handles well and I do a lot of city driving and with the help of cruise control when I can use it, I'm getting 27 miles to the gallon in the city.  So you can stretch the MPG if you drive sensibly.  Overall I have to say that I am happy to be in this vehicle.  It certainly feels different than driving an SUV, but I was ready for a switch and am enjoying Buicks Verano.",5
3643, on 07/12/16 15:45 PM (PDT),Ron ,2016 Buick Verano Sedan Premium Turbo Group 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great Car to Own," Owned the car for over a year now. No problems with it whatsoever. Paint, finish, no rattles, quiet as ever. Love the power of the turbo engine, sad to see that it's no longer available. Like the Sirius availability and OnStar. Accidentally set off the alarm and was notified by them of it and what my options were (a mistake or if needed to be reported). The interior is very comfortable, and the automatic ventilation system works very well. Only wish that it had available the automatic wipers, front sensors, and seat memory features. No issues with the dealership.",5
3644, on 05/04/16 16:06 PM (PDT),Neward Thelman ,2016 Buick Verano Sedan 1SV 4dr Sedan (2.4L 4cyl 6A),Among The Best In It's Class," The Verano is based off the same GM platform as the Chevy Cruze Limited, yet it feels like a completely different car. Driving it you feel greater power right off the bat. No, it's not sports-car-Camaro power, but I disagree with the Edmunds review that acceleration's merely adequate. The Verano feels more powerful than either the Cruze Limited or the new Cruze for 2016, possibly because the entire car feel much more solid, thus dissipating less energy in parasitic vibrations. The Verano gives you a sure, solid feeling on the road. An important contributor toward that end is the stark difference in streering and handling between any of the Cruze models and the Verano. The short of it is that the Cruze - particularly the newly redesigned 2016 Cruze - feels incredibly insecure and unstable during fast accelaration or highway speeds, while the Verano is almost the opposite of that. It's steering and handling feel stable and secure, with only a mere trace of lost of control to clue you into the fact that it's built with electronic - rather than traditional mechanical - steering. To take the point further, compared to any of the [now many] Cruzes, the Verano is rock solid. With the handling nicely under control, the suspension provides and excellent combination of road feel balanced against absorbtive comformt. In other words, it handles beautifully, without turning you into scrambled eggs while doing so. The interior is, as you'd expect, at or near luxury car levels. It's quiet and plush. Some might object to the two-tone white-on-black color scheme [Buick calls the interior grey - but it's pretty much white], but that seems to be the thing with luxury cars. The designers of the Verano did, however, make one major mistake. The steering wheel blocks your view of the instrument gauge cluster. No matter how far you tilt it up or down, you're just not going to see the speedometer, nor much else of your guages. Having taken such apparent care with the design of the car, how'd they screw that up? Good luck with speed cops on the road.A more minor issue's one of personal taste. I found the front grill to be almost aggresively tasteless, with Buick taking its vertical design a bit too far. The grill extends upwards and folds into the hood, and it's made of plastic. So, you get a lot of plastic grill in your face everytime you approach your car. Overall, I thought the Verano was very nice small vehicle, that - at least as far as driving impressions go - leaves it's stablemate Cruze well behind and makes the Corolla and the 2016 Civic almost non-competative [especially the almost shockingly crude, cheap-feeling, and sounding Corolla]. The other question is, of course, reliability, and it's only on that measure that the latter two may [or may not - who knows?] have an edge.",4
