0, on 04/19/18 05:08 AM (PDT),gaboy ,2017 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Best deal i've ever gotten," I have a good friend who has a 2014 version under the old nomenclature, and while I originally thought the car was a little odd looking (i still do), i really enjoyed riding in it.  I finally decided to get a new car in 2017 and after looking at all the midsize SUV's available, i drifted over to the Qx70 because i wanted something fun to drive and the car had gone out of production so i felt i could get a good deal on one.  I actually got a spectacular deal on a CPO with 4400 miles on it ($36K for a car with a $52K sticker) and 42 months of mfer warranty left.  It was a corporate owned vehicle used by a Nissan exec.  My gain points out a negative- this vehicle really depreciates in its first year- so if you buy one you need to keep it.   I purposely stayed away from the sport and limited because the 18 inch wheel has a lot more air and rubber on the wheels vs the 20/21 inch wheels - it makes a difference in softening the ride. I think the big wheels look great but i wanted a more standard issue tire.   The technology is old but proven- no trips to the dealership for bugs in the driver assist functions or transmission. Nav has both touchscreen and button panel- its a little far away for touchscreen when driving but buttons are intuitive.  The car drives wonderfully.  The responsiveness is off the charts and the rear-wheel drive acceleration is smooth and powerful.  I just love driving it and it is more comfortable than i expected.  The biggest negative is the fuel economy- 17/21 with premium fuel adds up.  But i knew that going in and the deal i got will pay for a lot of fuel!   GREAT CAR!!!",5

2, on 09/17/17 17:45 PM (PDT),Justine ,2017 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),My 3rd one!," I love this car so much, I've owned 3.  Although the 1st two were the FX37, my 3rd one, the QX70 is the same vehicle with just a name change.  The only thing I would like to see would be an upgraded technology package to stay aligned with its closest SUV competitors, the BMW and Volvo.",5
3, on 05/13/17 05:46 AM (PDT),Ron ,2017 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Love the look. Hate the car, Ride is stiff. rattles my dentures. No room in the rear. I'm a big guy so this has made my car a three seater. Not enough space between brake and accelerator. my foot often is partially on both which is a hazard waiting to happen. The gas mileage  sucks. I'm only getting 10 mpg. Well below the advertised amount. This was my dream car since the FX35 first came out. My dream has turned into a nightmare.,4
4, on 01/30/17 09:24 AM (PST),JWK ,2017 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Meh...not really that impressed," I rented this car and spent 900 miles in it (I got in with 8 miles, returned with 908).  Overall, I was expecting better.  Cabin was nice and well appointed.  Buttons were easily placed and generally everything was intuitive and easy to use.  Given that it was January and I was in northern Minnesota, I was impressed by the stability control intervention, which was quick and predictable when cornering and the rear started to break away.  Kept me on the road pointed the right direction, and there was no tire spinning or anything.  As with a lot of Infiniti SUVs, the cabin is a bit claustrophobic and outward visibility is below average.  I really had to crane my neck to look over my shoulder and around blind spots.  If road conditions were at all undulating, the ride was very jumpy and uncomfortable.  You could really see it when the headlights were on; they were bobbing up and down and all of that was transmitted into the cabin.  The USB integration was sporadic.  Sometimes it would start up right away, others it would get stuck on ""reading file"" and require a lot more monkeying around with it before music would play.  But what was most noteworthy, in a negative sense, was the gas mileage.  I drove the 900 miles in less than a week, so my driving was mostly highway.  Yet it returned below 20 mpg as an average.  For a 20+ gallon tank, range was *barely* 400 miles.  I'm not a rocket accelerator, nor do I drive like a speed demon (on the interstate, I have the cruise pegged right around the speed limit).  Add to that the engine requires premium gasoline.  In this day and age, for a smaller SUV, that kind of mileage is flat-out poor.  On the same route with my Cayenne and driving the same style, I get 24-25 mpg.  As a result, I would say that while there are some things to like about the QX70, there are much better options out there.",3
5, on 11/28/16 20:07 PM (PST),Don Finley ,2017 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 7A),2017 QX70 Limited," Owned a 2004 FX35, was the best car I've ever owned, had 240K mi when I hit a deer squarely front and center, airbags deployed, and insurance totalled the car.  Besides cosmetic damage after hitting the deer while traveling 75 mph, there was no structural or mechanical damage. I drove it home with the deflated airbags flapping.  Would not have survived in a smaller, lower vehicle. This is the first time I've bought the same car again, just a newer version. The car is gorgeous, powerful, loaded and comfortable. Already took it on T-giving trip from FL to KY.  Technology is well placed and easy to access, phone is sync'd via bluetooth, and USB cord adds all my music on board. SAT, AM, FM and aux are a simple push of a button, all with great sound. It doesn't lack anything I want, except the middle retractable cup holder on the floor in the back that the FX35 had. The gearing is growing on me; it revs high at start out in low gears, near 3000, then shifts to around 2000.  Different from the FX35, but still smooth and powerful. 21 inch tires on dark grey wheels looks awesome, and handles like a sports car.  Very happy!8 months later, I wouldn't change a thing, except the phone via bluetooth . . . it takes voice commands, then asks me to verify it got it right by picking a number, and it displays 5 names from my contact list, and the one I want is always #1.  I wish I could bypass the verification and have it just call.  I also added 3M clear bra to the front, mirrors, and door handles.  Great product, protects from bug chips and can't see it except up close if you're looking for the line across the hood.Just over a year later, still love it.  Some quirky anomalies have started with the music / phone interface, but I haven’t been able to get it to the dealer to check it out. Still works, but sometimes differently than it should.  Just over 29K miles, and with oil changes, tire balance, rotation and front end alignment every 5K miles, it drives like new, still looks brand new, and my daughter says it still smells new.  Lost count of how many strangers have commented on how beautiful the car is.  Just bought an ‘18 Mercedes GLA 250 for my wife, and the salesman had to go outside and drool over it, and he had a $337K Maybach in his showroom.  This Infiniti QX 70 Limited, in my opinion, is the star of the entire Nissan/Infiniti menu.",5
6, on 10/10/17 10:05 AM (PDT),HD ,2014 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (5.0L 8cyl 7A),Fastest naturally aspirated SUV (still!)," 0-60 in 4.8 seconds.  *This* is the first stat potential FX50 or V8 QX70 owners should consider.  Handles like it's velcroed to the road, especially in the rain.  Firmly pegged on the ""Sport"" end of the SUV spectrum, these unique finds benefit significantly from a more involved driver's hand.  While clearly geared toward fuel economy--I've observed a surprising 19.5 MPG over three months'-worth of mixed driving, the seven-speed's ""Drive Sport"" mode is a must-engage when turning onto the twisties.  But only full manumatic, keeping RPMs above 3k, unleashes the bionic cheetah within.  This is my third Nissan-sourced V8 and a more Ferrari-esque take in terms of factory tuning for horsepower over torque.  That said: you will feel the extra hundred foot-pounds of twist, compared to the 3.5 or 3.7 sixes, with any significant change in elevation. And despite a somewhat CX-yawn exterior, the 2014's enlarged grill (masking dual engine air intakes), 21"" custom Enkei rims, and 5.0 side badges subtly communicate that this beast shares 370Z & GT-R DNA and would best be left to prowl far afield from the minivan-ified crossover herd.",5

8, on 11/19/16 05:13 AM (PST),StasB ,2014 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (5.0L 8cyl 7A),Fantastic vehicle," This is not my first Infiniti, I had over 190k on my old 09 fx35 and never had any issues with it, I am very confident in my choice over others. From my impressions this vehicle offers very engaged driving experience which no other car in this price category can offer, very unique and beautiful design inside and out in my opinion, and great performance to back up the package. Avg mpg on 5.0 v8 is 18.2",5

12, on 08/31/18 06:45 AM (PDT),Aaron ,2016 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Overall good quality," My QX70 came with AWD and Premium Package. I find the front seating and ride very comfortable. It's actually fun to drive.  I rate handling and the feel of the road as excellent. The instrumentation and controls are also excellent and easy to live with. The heated leather seats are nice for cold weather. Exterior fold-in side mirrors add a nice touch and are easily adjusted using the inside controls. Cons: No LED daytime running lights unless you get the Sports Package with the upgraded front bumper. That's just sad! The lack of hidden enterior storage under the rear deck. There is just enough room for the temporary spare, lug wrench and jack but no room for a small tool bag, pliers or a screw driver. Lastly, accepts only Premium gas.",5
13, on 05/25/18 08:48 AM (PDT),DS Russell ,2015 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),"Big, Sporty SUV"," I looked at a used QX70 in comparison to a QX50.  Was originally looking at 2015 models or earlier. The QX70 was nice, but just too big for me (I'm 5'-4"" & at 63 y.o., I'm not going to get any taller) It was just too tall for me to step into.  Once I found out that the QX50 was lengthened in 2016, thereby giving it an extra 5"" of legroom in the rear seat area, I opted for that one. My family has owned (& still own) several Infiniti's since 2003 & we have been extremely satisfied with the styling, acceleration, road handling, low maintenance & convenience options.",3
14, on 09/30/15 11:57 AM (PDT),A Fritz ,2015 INFINITI QX70 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Great Performance Hampered by Horrible Technology," I owned three Infiniti FX cars - 2006, 2009, 2012.   Was finalizing purchase of 2015 QX70.The majority of the really important things on a car - safety, drive, handling, reliability - all of my cars were excellent.   There were a few areas of concern over the years, and since the model doesn't seem to have changed in over a decade, they continued to be issues.    Rear seat room was adequate, but due to the shape of the rear doors, getting in and out was a problem for some passengers.  Kids should be fine.   Rear cargo capacity was fine for me -- but this isn't going to provide the mega-capacity of some SUVs.Most recently had a car in Midnight Mocha with brown leather interior - a nice deep root beer color.   The metallic exterior paint appears as a deep, eggplant purple in many lighting situations, including daylight/sunlight.   The basic interior choices for the car are either graphite gray or light wheat.   The brown interior results in a hodgepodge incomplete look - a sort of cheap, half-finished shortcut.   Seats and parts of the dash are substituted with nice brown leather, but all other leather and trim remains the standard graphite - such as the doors, portions of the dash, etc.   Brown floormats over the basic graphite carpet looks odd.   That's poor attention to detail reminiscent of a half-finished job or a cover-up.  Since all other exterior color combos provide for graphite or wheat interior, this issue should only occur with a Mocha/brown leather equipped car.  The car was fun to drive, and had great exterior styling.However, for any driver who finds technology to be important - the FX and QX70 miss the mark by alot.   ALOT.    The software and user interface for Navigation, Bluetooth, and audio entertainment are bad.   Just plain bad.   Test other cars, and almost all will demonstrate much better controls and interfaces.   Only one USB outlet in the car, voice interface that works poorly and freezes are some of the problems.   Limited information display when using your own devices via bluetooth or USB, and even for the Satellite radio.   No ability to control music selection with voice commands.  But the most astonishing problem is the severely outdated navigation dataset loaded into new cars.   Whatever source Infiniti uses for nav-data is horrible.   Roads and business in existence for several years simply don't appear in the Infiniti's Nav.   Not even brand new cars.  As I prepared to buy the QX70, my fourth Infiniti, I decided to pay particular attention to the Nav/entertainment system.   I tried several different automobile brands.   I found that design and software varied from manufacturer to manufacturer - with many aspects of the Infiniti being the worst.   I made a list of several destinations, all established in early 2014 or in prior years, and then tested the 2015 cars from several manufacturers.   Even tested the 2016 QX70.    Not one business from 2013 or 2014 was found on the Nav dataset in the 2015 or even the 2016 QX70.   At least 80% were found in all of the other 2015 cars, and often 100%.If you don't care about user toys/entertainment/navigation --- then the QX70 is a fantastic car.   If driving a relatively high-priced premium automobile with horrible technology, out-performed and out-designed by many budget cars will bother you.... avoid the QX70.   Or, at least test these systems in the QX70 before finalizing a purchase/lease decision.   After 9 years, I decided it bothered me too much, so I switched to another manufacturer's crossover.    I'll check back in on the Infiniti when I'm ready for a new car in a few years - if the technology is updated and comparable to other manufacturers, I'll probably return to being an infiniti owner.",3
15, on 02/09/18 11:49 AM (PST),Jeff ,2004 INFINITI I35 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Yet to find anything better," I love my I35. It has great power for a V6, comfortable and reliable. I tend to drive this car pretty rough and it has held up to everything I put it through. I purchased mine used with 96k miles, I've owned it for 8 years now, going past 235k miles and have only made minimal repairs (power steering hose, oil cooler gasket, alternator(due to not being careful when putting oil in the car and it dripping down onto the windings), and the radiator(due to a minor accident)). To say this car is reliable is an understatement. I try to work on my own cars whenever possible and this car is very easy to make repairs on, when needed. When and if this car ever kicks the bucket, I will definitely be looking for another one as a replacement.",5

Replaced the radiator recently due to cracks.  Replaced the struts assemblies. New BF Goodrich Tires only have a few thousand miles wear. Have recently replaced the factory stereo with a new Kenwood (Excelsior model) CD, stereo with all inputs, jacks.   All major maintenance performed at Infiniti dealership. Oil always changed every 3,500 miles.   Paint is still terrific. A few dings. Interior leather has a few small tears.  This is a really good value.

(again, I don't drive like a grandmother and I live on country roads) and an engine gasket. Everything else has been regular maintenance.  Drives great in snow, I've only been stuck twice in my country driveway.  I don't usually keep cars this long.. I get tired of them, but I haven't found anything better for my money.

I took the car and bought it out after the lease was up. It's 2010 and I have 46,000 miles on it and it drives like the day I got it. This car has been great. It's a big cushy ride with a huge interior and trunk, a monster of a 3.6 liter engine that goes like a bat out of hell. Only con is the mileage but all of the Nissan 3.6 liter engines are beasts and don't get good mileage. Otherwise, the car has been flawless.  All in all, this was Infiniti's version of a Cadillac and I expect to have it for a long time barring any unforeseen breakdowns. I guess I'll get a G37 when the interior breaks down.",4.25

I now have 66,000 miles on the car. I think the car has ample power although I would have liked to see more. I would expect better gas mileage, I drive mostly city and get only 17 MPG.

The 3.5 engine has plenty of muscle for me, the car looks great, and the ride is extremely comfortable. Great sound system, excellent climate control system, the heated seats and heated steering wheel have spoiled me this past winter. Huge trunk, fold down seats make carrying my 88 key digital piano a breeze. Cruise control is smooth, radio controls on steering wheel are easy to use. These cars are so dependable and maintenance costs are reasonable. I have never taken my Infiniti to a mechanic for repairs and been shocked by the cost of the repair.

This car had a lot of luxury for the money!  I was skeptical about rear wheel drive car in winter of the G's and the G had a much smaller cabin and fewer standard features.   No regrets!  Very speedy off the line if you jump on it, We get 28/29 mpg on highway, 20 commuting around town. Comfortable over over long distances, huge trunk.

I fell in love with the car immediately, the first driving experience I had with a real car. It handles very well, drove on ice the couple times I drove, and was just shocked at how well Infiniti does with building their cars. Everyone gets to drive these cars up to 150,000 miles+. I had every intention of doing this. Unfortunately I was stopped at a red light and a kid on his phone hit me going 50 mph. Again, the car did very well and all I got was a sore couple of weeks.

I purchased this Infiniti about four months ago. It's a 2004 white and I bought it with 45,000 miles on it. The Bose sound is great. The car performs great with ample power.

Even compared to today's cars, this car was designed beautifully. The V6 is smooth and has great acceleration and brakes. The XM radio option is great for a 2004 car.

The ride is so smooth, the comfort is amazing, and the features never stop pleasing. I regularly drive from New Haven, CT to Boston, MA, (about 2 hours) and I never get bored or get stiff. The climate control kicks in immediatly from cold to hot or vice versa. It accelerates quickly even at highway speeds. There is a huge trunk and plenty of rear space for normal sized people. I cannot stress enough how pleasing this car is. Go to a dealership and take one out overnight, and you will understand what I am talking about.",4.625

Compared to my 1997 I30, this car has better seats, more power and sharper handling with the 17 inch wheels. There's only one glitch so far - an irritating rattle in the dash when going over expansion strips or sharp bumps. Other than that it's clear that Infiniti seriously believes in the concept of continuous improvement.

I bought the car with 128k, few cosmetic issues but over all seemed like a pretty nice ride. The second day after purchasing the car it would not start, had it towed to the dealer and they told me i needed to replace some battery harness cable, starter, alternator, and a few more items, honestly cant remember them all. After all that the car never went more than 2 weeks without the engine light coming on. Blew 2 ignition coils, catalytic converter, a few sensors. Car had many oil leaks. The car is very expensive to maintain with high miles. Spent roughly $2500 in repairs over the course of a year. But some how you manage to overlook all the faults the car had, because you love this car. Yes it broke down all the time and costs you a lot of money to maintain, but when you drive this car you feel like a million bucks, even with the paint fading, and the bumper falling off, the light smoke slipping out of the cracks of the hood, the duck tap covering the huge rips in the leather.

While sitting in any car for 15 hours straight is painful, the I35 was a pleasure to drive. I got 29.3 mpg averaging 58 mph (traffic slowed me down). Phenominal numbers for any V6 engine.

I was in for service today and told I have to pay $90 for tire rotation every 7,500 miles because the sensors have to be recalibrated in order for the tire gauge on dash to work. That means I would have to pay nearly $400 before I get a new set of tires. They do not tell you this when you buy a car. This is a bad design for a luxury car and undermines the marketing effort of the company to consumers. I have had 11 BMWs and nothing like that. This is nickel and diming the consumer in the service department. Bad news. If I find this with other services, I am going back to BMW. They cover your service including tire rotatio",4.75

Why then can't I control some of these amazing features? For instance, I must have the doors lock when I'm driving. No override. I can't use my telephone phonebook when I'm driving. It's much safer to pull out my phone and try to read the number than to use my large screen nav system. No override. I can't use my nav system when I'm driving. Guess I'll be stopping a lot on the freeway to phone and navigate. However all my electronic safety equipment such as blind spot warning, front end collision avoidance, etc. turns off when I stop the car and I have to remember to turn it on or it won't function. So why is that safer? There is no alarm for not wearing my seatbelt. So why is that safer? Also the music box doesn't seem to be able to read most CD information so all my CD's, artists and songs are just the date and time recorded. Not too convenient. And speaking of the nav system, I've been living in my new house for three years, but my nav maps don't even show my neighborhood. I was told I could buy an update. Mighty kind of Infiniti. Speaking of nav systems, the nav system on the Infiniti sucks. It's difficult to use and technologically out of date. My old 2004 Acura TL had far superior nav capabilities and voice activation years in advance of what Infiniti has now. Infiniti touts the voice activation for the phone and nav as safer than pushing buttons. Might be if it worked! The voice activation is practically never right. Extremely frustrating. As for performance and appearance the car is spectacular in almost every way. My only complaint is that the gas mileage is horrible (15 around town and 22-23 on the highway, even using the Econ mode). My problem is I am so frustrated by all the quirky electronic annoyances every time I try to drive that I just want to take the car back.",4

The M35 was the best car I ever owned.  The M37 feels like it was rushed out by Infiniti in an attempt to get a prettier looking car on the market quickly.  Furthermore the M35 was cheaper than many of its competitors and the new model loaded comes in on the expensive side of the competition.   I've had many problems with the car already some pretty major.  Major flaws were apparent in the GPS after using it for 30 min.  I was stupefied that Infiniti put the car on the road without these kinks worked out.  Apparently I hear there's a lack of processing power needed to run the GPS properly.

The first is that for some unknown reason Infiniti decided to police their customer's lives. You cannot enter an address in your navigation system or look for places close by unless your car is stopped regardless of whether there is a passenger in the passenger front seat. This was not required by law. It is actually more dangerous because on a number of occasions we have had to stop the car on the side of a highway or in a dangerous place along the road so we could enter data to get us to our destination.

Our black M is covered with orange peel in the paint. From 10 feet everything looks perfect, but up close and from a angle the peel really stands out.

Needed something I could drive all year but was still fun and wouldn't beat me up for longer drives. Tried a similar year FX and was sadly disappointed. Its possible it needed some front end work as it was used but the salesman who showed me the Ex said he thought I would notice the difference in handling over bumps in the road. He was right it was huge. The Ex also felt quicker and being smaller easier to change directions with. Both vehicles felt miles above the same year Bmw x3 which felt slow and harsher over the bumps. I am single so always just leave the rear seats folded down so the back seat room is  a non issue for me. Not sure about the handling in Winter conditions yet as my tires need replacing and hitting icy spots is kind of scary right now. The EX3 is so nice on the highway when I want to pass another car as it accelerates really well. I just wish there wasn't that slight lag before the power comes on but its reasonable. I will say that the old gti with the little turbo was more fun to ring out going up the mountain passes here. The 3.4 6 banger might actually be faster if I want it to be but it just doesn't like to be revved to the max like the little turbo and isn't quite as fun going around the turns but then it is a lot more comfortable doing it. Owned for about 9 months now. Still no problems and still liking it.,4

I average 22mpg in heavy city/hills driving so that's not bad given the 305hp V6 performance.

The storage space is really limited and the gas mileage is worse than expected.  Infiniti is also a pain to deal with--even as my car was in the shop with problems, Infiniti was more focused on selling me another car than solving my issues.

A lot of what drove me to the G in particular was it's similarities to my prior car, RWD (the G37x is RWD unless you're slipping, then AWD), power, a non-CVT transmission, and refinement. I like the AWD capability if I need it, but really enjoy receiving my power from the back end the majority of the time. Car will not slip in the rain no matter how hard you damper the pedal in AWD only mode. Had moderate snow last year, it plows through even with old tires.The G so far for me has been a pleasure to own. After working out some kinks that were covered under warranty, I have yet to spend a dime outside of oil and filter changes. Warranty eventually covered a leaking bank of my VCGs, but that's nearly regular maintenance. I did pay for a belt change, which should be the only time I needed to do this for the next 5-7 years. I may need a new bearing, but it will be covered under my remaining CPO powertrain warranty. Overall, nothing out of the ordinary. The dashboard does have a bit of a rattle at times which is likely anecdotal, and one thing I've noticed with mine that's happened to others is a whistling wind noise at 85+ mph depending on the wind resistance. Rather annoying two sounds that don't affect the performance, reliability, but do hamper the enjoyment a bit at times. The car however is now nearing 6 years old with nearly 70k miles, so some cleanup on those two issues is likely warranted.I bought it with 44k, currently has 68k. I have many 3-4 hour trips and a 12 hour ride on the odo so far, along with daily commute.Everything is great outside of very low speed bumper to bumper traffic.  The 7spd transmission is a bit cumbersome at very low speeds (0-15mph) during traffic. The cabin and driver's position really lends you to feel confident driving it. Great visibility, and the feedback on the wheel allows you to ""feel"" the road. The steering is crisp and has great radius. The weight of the car causes a bit of ""rolling"" in corners, but I upgraded to sportier all season tires (in lieu of some softer/plusher all seasons) and it nearly eliminated roll, even at 80+ mph. In an emergency situation while traveling 70mph, I had to jam on the brakes and even while sliding I felt in full control (made it out of that situation just fine, there was a huge blown out truck tire in the road I didn't see until I was right in front of it). I could be 300lbs and 6'4 and feel comfortable in the car. Currently 220 and 6'2. I'd say the car fits 4 comfortably, without the rear passengers sacrificing any leg room. Main downside is the 7spd transmission. In regular D mode, it will ride in high gears to save fuel. You can use the SD mode or full sport mode for manual changing that eliminates this issue.Overall, the value is the best aspect on the car for what you're getting. The power, interior, exterior, options (when purchased used), are all accounted for for the least cost. Couple sacrifices being the torque rating, engine noise at high revs, build quality (don't confuse with engine reliability). Build quality can be seen in the door panel fastening, seat fastening/flimsiness, and materials used. As a tip, A couple I looked at gave off a rather strong oil smell from under the hood with very few miles, which led me to believe a lot of the used cars weren't broken in properly (manual states driver must not exceed 4k rpm during first 4k miles). Generally, the used sport models were beat up, at 35k miles and above. This could have been somewhat related to them sitting on the lot, but either way, the one I settled on didn't have this problem.Some caveats: Tons of different options and packages and the pricing was not very indicative of what options the car was sold with, so it paid to do homework on what I wanted. I was looking for all the options outside of sport model, as it was more aesthetic changes than anything else (the sport model had slightly larger brakes, which results in higher bills when they need to be replaced). The premium package (including sun roof), and 18"" wheels were a must, I don't like the 17"" wheels for some reason even though they are only an inch smaller. Also I feel the wood grain interior is a must as the aluminum didn't seem to match the rest of the vehicle IMO.",4

You don't want a car that is numb (BMW, Lexus etc.), unless you are driving in the city a lot, in which it's pointless to have a 3.7L V6 engine.

VERY good AC and heat (Heated seats do wonders in the winter time).  Controls and technology easy to navigate through and access to tech is very ergonomical.  I've heard that some complain about engine noise from the cabin but really it's not that bad.  If you find comfort in quiet drives, this car will still do it for you as the engine really only gives off a low hum or 'purr'.  The V6 is awesome.   MORE than enough power for any tight pinch, and still decent on gas.  The downside is that this car TAKES PREMIUM FUEL as this is a performance engine.  Due to this, it can be scary at the pump.  With premium gas currently around $3.60/gal, expect to pay approx $60 per fill up (18 gal tank).  I had a total of 2hr/day commute and was spending roughly $400 a month for gas which was really hurting. However, I was getting 26-27mpg due to all the highway miles.  Also, value drops surprisingly quickly for such an awesome car.  Bought at 201k last year.  1 year and 30k miles later,  i'd be lucky to get 14k for it.

And I don't much care for the cheap hard plastics located by the steering column, should not be expected out of a 40000 dollar vehicle. But that is all the problems with my Infiniti, but I'm just nick picking the best I can, the list of complaints is much smaller than my Beamer. It also has much more space when really it's only a foot longer than the BMW. The BMW feels faster but the Infiniti is by no means a slouch. The ride quality is so much more refined in the Infiniti and it's also quieter inside the cabin. If your looking for quality, dependability, reliability, and the most value for your dollar, and inexpensive running cost with style and elegance. This is the car for you.",5

I like the unique color called 'Blue Slate' which is a combination of blue/grey depending on the light of day. The standard '6' speaker sound system is fine.

Drove about 1,000 miles over Wyoming and Utah, exposed to city and country driving. Interior: Very comfortable but the quality and fit/finish doesn't match up to the Germans. It actually doesn't match up to the quality of fit and finish of my 2012 VW GTI. Exterior: FREAKING BEAUTIFUL. This has to be most beautiful and attention grabbing design within the 50-60K price bracket (save for a Mustang). Everyone takes double looks and it definitely appears like a 100K car. Performance: Straight line performance is amazing, could have a nicer exhaust, but there are several aftermarket solutions without making it sound ricer. Now for the part why I would NOT recommend this car - Steering and Safety: The steering has a mind of it's own - I was constantly making minor corrections on a straight piece of highway doing the speed limit (70 MPH).  It seems like the adaptive steering tries to second guess the driver, but as the driver, you don't expect the car to make that correction by itself so you either end up overcorrecting or jerking/lurching the car. Lane changes on the highway became difficult. THE WORST PART - When doing 70MPH in moderate rain, this car almost wiped out. This was again, on a straight piece of road, the steering system twitched and sent the car into a near wipeout, as I almost lost the rear end of this AWD car. I ended up bringing it back in control, but never felt comfortable driving it again, especially since I had my wife in the car and wiping out at 70MPH would have definitely injured (or worse) us both. Absolutely do not recommend this car - I have driven econoboxes that would do better in the rain at these speeds (including my elantra, civic) as well as my amazing (now even more so) VW GTI",3

My wife and I like the brand a lot. We had two EX35's (too long in the tooth now despite some recent upgrades), and a Q50 sedan (one of the first). The sedan suffered from excessive wind noise from around both front doors....very irksome on the  Interstate after a while. Apparently many Q50's suffered a similar problem (the Q60 suffers a bit but I can live with it). Apart from that the Q50 was an excellent car with great performance. Lease was almost up and Infiniti offered to make the last three payments for us if we got another car. What I like about Infiniti (and Lexus also) is that their designs are so good that they don't need to keep changing them. The previous coupe was around for a long time so if you keep the Q60 for 6 years you still have a current design. We leased again. My wife is a realtor and wants to look professional when she turns up for appointments. My opinion of the design of the new Q60 coupe....gorgeous; the only way to describe it and better in the flesh than in the photos (where it still looks darned good). The proportions are perfect, the stance just right, the alloy wheels....stunning. We have the pearlescent (Majestic) white which looks just awesome. Definitely better in a light color because of the beautiful dark allows which pop against the white paintwork. Perfection on wheels. I was concerned about poor vision and blind spots in the coupe but actually it is not an issue at all. The car is a joy to drive with the 300hp engine. It sits purposefully lower than the sedan and rides on 19in wheels so it is a little firm but the steering is excellent (the Q50 was a little lifeless and vague) and the car is plenty responsive. Minimal turbo lag. Too early to comment on gas mileage but I don't expect much of an improvement over the sedan. Most of our journeys are fairly short so that will do us no favors. At the end of the day, the 3 year old Q50 sedan only had 19000 miles so we will not be high mileage drivers even when my Mazda lease is up and we don't replace it to become a one car household. I work from home exclusively now so a second car is not required. Anyway, we love this Q60. Any car that brings a smile to my face is going to be good. That doesn't happen too often. My Audi S3 in England had the same effect. So, anyone in the market for a hot-looking coupe with more than enough power and refinement, get a Q60. You won't regret it...totally beautiful car.",5

Unless you have a stage coach, having a feel for every pebble on the road  an be cumbersome, on long trips. The Q60 is a Grand Touring style coupe.  It gives comfort and performance in one package. I have leased the 2017 and 2018 red sport models. The first a rwd and the second awd.  The Bose sound system is great. The collision avoidance works very well, and the pro pilot assist greatly reduces fatigue on long road trips. Whenever I drive a car without the electronic steering it feel very tedious to drive. I suppose those that don't like it or compare it to a playstation or xbox, just haven't had enough time behind the wheel of a Q60 to realize that it is a good thing.  The acceleration in this car is very very nice. It is a beautiful car that brings admirers everytime I go anywhere. Mercedes style looks boring, Volkswagon interiors are cheap and BMW doesn't bring the bang for the buck. Hands down the Infinity Q60 is a worthy successor of the G35 and G37 of yore.  This car drives at 160mph as smooth as 20mph. Anyone looking for road feel should drive a hydraulically assisted steering vehicle on gravel roads.  I like my drive smooth as possible without having to fight the steering wheel. Way to go Infinity!",5

I know because I've owned most of them. I've been driving the Red Sport now for just under a year... and I'm very, very pleased with the purchase.  It's a beautiful car.  Inside and out.  Fun to drive.  Fast enough.  In general terms, there aren't many on the road here in Chicagoland... so it gets a ton of looks and comments.  I also splurged for the lit front logo, which really pops the car at night. Very sharp. The other thing that separated this vehicles from similar options was the AWD.  It handles like gem in poor conditions.  Sure, sharp turns on a road with four inches of snow is going to create some sliding (like yesterday with my wife yelling at me) but all in all, it handles very well in bad conditions.  I have a steep driveway which looks menacing in snow... and it conquers it like a Jeep during each snow storm.  Heck, I pass Jeeps in the snow in this car.  So, no problems or worries in bad weather.  Yes, there are some imperfections.  There's some repetitiveness with controls.  Also, while the car does have a backup camera, there's no sensor.  Since the vehicle is a sports car... there are times when it's difficult to see what's behind you... and without the sensor... near impossible if another car or person is rolling through a parking lot behind you. One more thing, the car is really beautiful, however, I think they should have added a few more external design options to clearly differentiate it as a Red Sport.  At first glance, it really looks the same as other Q60's--and it's not. That's pretty much it. I love the car and would highly recommend it to anyone interested.",4

I test drove the 300 hp version (for a week) and I decided to buy the 400 hp version.  The 300 hp VR feels similar to the 3.7 VQ engine in overall power (I had a 2014 Q50); with more low end torque on the VR that runs out of juice at around 4.5K, while the naturally aspirated VQ is still going strong to 6.5K.   The VR will be quicker off the line, and will feel faster when driving around town.   The Red Sport version, on the other hand, is an entirely different animal.  Much quicker from stop and awesome when needing to quickly merge with oncoming traffic on highway ramps in Chicagoland.  There is a slight turbo lag right off the line and the transmission can be slightly sluggish when shifting in lower gears.  Using the paddle shifters make this issue much worse, so I'd just keep the car in automatic and in Sport + mode for the quickest shifting.  The only way that you even notice any of this is because the VR engine in the Red Sport is so much quicker off the line than the older VQ engine; which had the same 7 speed auto transmission.   I would make three suggestions with regards to choosing options for the Q60.  First, you'll want blind spot monitors and driver assistance features; as it is saved me MANY times from changing lanes into a car that was riding behind me in my blind spot.  The Q50's visibility was fine without this feature, but the more sexy Q60 profile has one major limitation; massive rear quarter blind spots.  Also, the around view monitor allows you to park this car effortlessly, without curbing your wheels.  Second, if you enjoy performance oriented driving, I'd skip the Direct Adaptive Steering.  Version 2.0 is better, but it still needs further refinement.  The standard electric steering is quite good; much better than the older VQs hydraulic rack.  Most reviews of this car that complain about the Q60s steering have a fully loaded Q60; with the DAS option.  What a shame, as the standard rack is excellent.  The only trade off is that you do loose some additional features that are packaged with DAS (adaptive cruse control, lane keeping, etc.).  However, Infiniti still gives you 2 settings for the electric steering; standard and sport, which is great and fine for most people.  Third, please consider changing out those horrible run flat OEM tires!  The handling, ride quality, steering, and braking all improve significantly.  A tire change completely transforms this car.  You have no idea how well this car can perform with better tires.  The Run Flats on the Red Sport can kick the back end out of the car when you take a sharp turn and it will hydroplane in heavy rain.  I wouldn't even attempt to use these in the snow.  Cornering also feels unstable with stock tires and the steering is way too heavy.  Did I mention that the ride is brutal with the Run Flats, even in the ""comfort"" mode?  Before I changed the tires, I considered returning the Q60 due to the very harsh ride quality.  This would have been a huge mistake!  As with the DAS optioned on almost all test cars, all reviews that I've read that complain about both the handling and the ride quality... are also using the OEM Run Flats.  (Continental DWS 06s go very well with this model).  Also, I must say that I am happy the the gas millage.  I average 23 mpg with mixed highway / city driving.  I got 21 mpg with the 3.7 VQ.  Mileage actually improved with the addition of 72 hp!  Thanks twin turbos and better cooling.  Lastly, if you shop around you can get some really great deals on this car.  (A well-optioned Q60 Red Sport AWD can be had for the mid-50Ks).  Cross shopping, I felt that I would probably need to jump to around 80k+ to improve on this car's performance.  Even then, you may not be able to match the Q60's good looks.  Yes, I'm looking at you Lexus LC!   Oh, one last comment, the sport seats in the Q60 are amazingly comfortable compared to my older Q50s, and even the current Q50s, seats.  No back problems at all on a 750 mile one-day drive!",4

It's appalling that Infinity could turn out such a sloppy product.  Might look flashy but is rather ordinary and not superior to a Honda or Nissan.  Lots of sleek technology but it's not useful.  Car feels too big and gas mileage is terrible.  Dealership in Bayside Queens is the worst:   too busy with too many people around with no identifiable responsibilities.  They will not call back or follow through with any of your problems.   Car was released not detailed properly with several obvious flaws and not that clean.  Happy to take your money and then they're done with you.,2
467, on 03/17/17 15:03 PM (PDT),Jon Michaels ,2017 INFINITI Q60 Red Sport 400 Red Sport 400 2dr Coupe (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7A),A wonderful GT car with a dual personality," I am a month in to owning the Q60S Red Sport 400.  I have owned BMWs (740i, 540i & M5) & Audis (S4 Cabrio and S5 Coupe) in the past as comparison. The exterior appearance is stunning. Like truly breathtaking. I find myself walking backwards away from the car so I can look at it more. The interior design is very well done. The front seats are magic. Just outstanding from a comfort & lateral stability standpoint. Engine performance can be described as a giggle machine with a start button. Just mash the throttle and laugh. The 400bhp & 350ft/lb of torque are available from 2500 RPMs all the way to redline. My favorite move is when I am on the open freeway & impatiently slogging along behind some snow bird doing 55 in a 65 zone. I lightly tug the downshift paddle twice to take me to 5th gear and bury the boot. Good lord, the acceleration is instant and fantastic! Within a few seconds I am doing 100MPH and rushing quickly towards 120MPH if I'm not careful. I've had the car up to 125MPH so far and the stability & smoothness inspires a ton of confidence. The car just seems to sit down on its haunches the faster you go. I set the ""Personal"" mode on the Infiniti Drive Mode to ""Sport+"" engine with ""Standard"" steering and suspension.  This gives me the truest GT experience with instant throttle response & a nice, soft, cushy ride. If I know I will be on the twisties, I'll choose ""Sport+"" mode across the board. The Bose sound system is hands-down the best sounding system I've heard in any car. I know, I know. No highs, no lows, it's gotta be a Bose. That may have been true five years ago, but this system, in this particular car is brilliant. So perfectly clean, with large bass response (no annoying rattle) and crisp highs that just sing. Maybe the Mark Levinson system in the Lexus LS600H is better, but then you're paying $120k for a sedan, so... Handling is so good to the point where it's annoying. I cannot seem to get the car to oversteer or understeer. It just corners with complete neutrality. If I turn off the dynamic anti-skid nannies I could probably get the car to slide some, but I am reticent to do that until I have a better feel for the 16lb/ft of turbo boost coming from the twin chargers. You don't want to get into a slide and have your turbos kick in before the apex! Braking is strong and linear. I adapted to the brakes the first day, which is a testament to how well -- and predictably -- they stop. The car comes with so much safety technology, you almost have to be an imbecile to get into a wreck. I'm sure I can personally figure out a way, as I lean towards the imbecilic, but truly, any normal person is safer in this car than in Fort Knox. Ok, now for the less than stellar. First, the steering. The DAS steering is as vague as everyone says it is. It's really designed and set up for long trips where comfort and low-fatigue are more important than feeling connected to the car. I wish there was a way to turn it off. Shift response is inconsistent. Downshifts under light acceleration come when they feel like it. Downshifts under hard acceleration come fairly quickly, but if you've ever driven a Porsche with the PDK dual clutch, the Q60 Red Sport ain't even in the same universe. Again, you're paying less than half the price, so... Still, for $62k, you'd think a less awesome dual clutch auto-trans would be mated to this terrific engine. As lovely as the interior is, I have a few nits. There are some very specific areas where the materials chosen are just plain cheap AF. The lower part of the interior door assembly for example. Cheap plastic. The inside of the glove box, center console storage and cigarette lighter opening... The cheapest felt-like substance known to man. Like those 1970s glow-in-the-dark posters with the black fuzzy crap? Yeah, that stuff (they still make that shizz?). The rocker switch for the aforementioned Infiniti Drive Mode, and the Audi-like circular mouse control are made of hollow chromed plastic that don't feel stout when you're pulling, pushing or twisting them. Guys, really? Use real aluminum for these things for goodness sakes! We have seat heat and steering wheel heat, but we do not have seat ventilation/cooling. This is a big deal to me because I live in Phoenix, AZ. I almost didn't buy the car because of this. Infiniti offers seat ventilation on many of their other models -- as do Honda, Toyota, Ford, Chevy, Opel, Kia and Hyundai. I love these seats, but I won't have a sexual relationship with them until they have ventilation. Lastly, the exhaust note. There really isn't one. When you first start the car, there is slight growl that seems promising but once the engine speed dies down to idle, the car is almost as quiet as a Tesla. If you put the car in ""Sport+"" mode, Infiniti figured out a way to pump some exhaust noise into the cabin to remind you that you have hair on your chest, but it's just not aggressive or loud enough. I'm sitting on 400HP baby! Remind me!",4

I came back because I absolutely love the quality of their dealerships and the way they treat their customers. I've been driving my Q60 Redsport for over a year now, and it's still incredibly fun! The sport plus mode is insane, and I love using it on long country roads...BUT, I live in Chicagoland and the snow in the winter made my GT Mustang spin in circles- not this car. It grips the road and I feel completely safe (AWD). I can't say enough good things about this car. It's comfortable (even on long drives), fun to drive, not bad fuel economy...the tech they use in the center console is only average, so that's my only negative. I haven't had a single issue with this vehicle, and it's a first gen 2017. I'd buy this car again and again! Just FYI, I do not have the adaptive steering in this car and it's very responsive. I swear the brakes on this car saved my life once...and it looks HOT! People come up to me when I'm gassing up and ask me about the car. Sweeeet!",5

I've owned many cars and this is by far the best. AC on off switch is toward the right side of the vehicle which is awkwardly place.  Interior otherwise  is stunning.

474, on 11/30/17 10:28 AM (PST),In-fan-iti ,2017 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),More SSUH Than SUV," I consider this a good point as it gives me lots of flexibility, and i don't need a large vehicle with massive cargo. It is still an unusual vehicle, and knowing the gas consumption, you are silly to buy it if that is a primary concern. I know in the past I have gotten better than rated mileage on this particular engine/setup (3.7L, 7 speed auto) as it has been very responsive with a feather touch on the gas, and I have a lead foot. I call it more a Sport Sedan Utility Hatchback, than a full fledged SUV. Remember hatchbacks? They had a higher cargo area you could expand if you needed to haul things around that were odd sizes, like a bicycle. the cargo area is a really good size by my standards, but smaller than some I have seen, but you could still carry quite a bit. As far as the packages, which were mentioned in the Edmunds review, they come pretty well loaded for a $35,000 SUV (the base, RWD model). I added the premium and premium plus packages for the upgraded radio, navigation, and several other features. The premium Pkg is $500, the Premium Plus is $1,000, but requires the Premium Package. I also got, just because it was closest to what I wanted, the 19"" wheel package for $800. Pretty cheap as far as packages go. The babysitting tools and other things I had no interest in are in the Technology Package, which has an awful lot of stuff in it for $2,000, including all the babysitting tools. That covers ALL the packages offered. The only other things are little accessories (most you won't need), and of course I wanted AWD. As far as the engine, I would gladly take the V-6 over many of the turbocharged competitors, and it happens to be a very reliable V-6 at that. I will be extremely sad to see it go from most infiniti vehicles in place of turbocharging, and the totally new engine for 2019 for this car. I sat in the back seat to try it out, and pushed the front seat farther back than I usually use it (I am 5'9"") and found the rear seat not a bad place to be for two adults (I would not ever put an adult in the middle because of the hump in the floor for the drivetrain), but the back seat has it own heat vents (under the seat) and a/c vents that can be turned off and adjusted (back of the center console). I actually found the navigation really easy to use and input addresses, as well as to control other settings for the car. And I LOVE that the Radio and climate controls are separate (though you can also use the unit for the radio or the steering wheel.  As far as bluetooth, yes, it does work for voice and for audio media, you just need to make sure it is set for both, otherwise it will only search for voice bluetooth systems. As far as driving, as I said before, there is tons of power, a sport driving mode, and manual shift on the stick, not on the wheel. Personally, considering how little I shift an automatic manually, they are more a hindrance than help on the wheel. I don't think it matters for everyday driving, but I have AWD. I have taken corners faster than I probably should have given it is a slightly higher center of gravity, and it drives very well on curvy roads as well as the highway. Since it is not the fastest selling of Infiniti's vehicles, you can often get a great deal on them, and unless you need more room than a compact vehicle will provide (again, remember it is compact) will provide or fuel economy is a huge priority for you, I say definitely test it and buy it if it suits your needs. Infiniti dealers are giving darned good discounts. I would say, depending on level of equipment (they max out around $45,000 MSRP), you can save $5,000 to $8,000 off sticker without much haggling. I saved $7,000, plus got an infiniti Loyalty Rebate good for another (I think) $1,000, and i really did not haggle.... I picked a car, and the saleswoman went and came back with the best price, then added the rebate, and I said great.  So keep that in mind when comparing ""sticker prices""... they will come down on them quite a bit especially now while they still have 2017 on lot and know 2018 is last year before major changes.",5

I had hoped to own it for many years but I am highly disappointed in some things that are important to me that will prevent me from keeping the car.  The fuel economy does not exist, the SUV is a gas guzzler and in a time of fuel efficiency, it's really poor.  The navigation system is the absolute worse.  You can't see the current traffic status unless you set/enter a destination, that's so 90's.  Just to simply drive to work/home you cannot observe current traffic, so I'm stuck using Google Maps or Waze on my phone after spending nearly $2k for navigation.  You can't get Bluetooth without the navigation pkg.,  and you must have a Sirius XM package for the system to work, again this is archaic.  Only 1 USB port, and all information is in a list which is incredibly unsafe & a huge distraction so you can't use it while driving.  The directional compass is a tiny arrow, you never know what direction is N,W, S or E without searching while driving for the arrow.  There is no power button for the trunk, there are no cup/bottle holders in the doors and the duel cup holders in the center console are too small for more than one cup at a time and it blocks the gear shift!",3

When I drove this car, I would say that I can only think of two drawbacks. It does not have a very tight turning radius. For example I had a Volvo V50 station wagon for many years where you could make a hairpin turn in the smallest of spaces. Second, the designers of this car must have not taken into consideration that some women buy cars like this one. The brake pedal is the only brake pedal in a car that I have driven where my foot could not rest of the floor and have the ball of my foot on the break.

Very comfortable and plenty big for my needs.  Drove the BMW X1 and was completely underwhelmed.  This handles better and felt faster - no comparison on the interior......BMW felt cheap.  For the money nothing can touch this level of performance and comfort.  Only negative is the gas mileage but it is ""premium recommended"" not ""required"".....",5
491, on 12/29/16 06:27 AM (PST),Jeff ,2016 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Its Just OK," I came out of an Acura RDX and truth be told, this car has it all over the Acura which was cheap all the way. The QX50 is small, so small that you cannot fit two coffee cups in the cup holder at the same time. Size aside its relatively comfortable on trips, the mileage is ok and it drives well, plenty of power and the handling is a strong point. Had it for part of a winter and its pretty good in the snow. Now for the down side: The blue tooth is poor. We have iPhone 6s and the integration is not good at all. If you google this issue with infiniti there are pages and pages of complaints about problems with iPhone integration. Given that there a billion iphones out there, pretty strange. In addition, the voice transmission is poor, very noisy even when you have 4 or 5 bars.  The GPS is adequate at best and frustrating at times, to the point where I use my phone and google maps. No data available in addresses that come up in the search menu, that sort of thing, if you abbreviate street or avenue, sometimes it works, sometimes you have to spell out the word, again, not what you expect from a car that touts itself as a luxury suv. Again, its an OK car but, the devil is in the detail and Infiniti needs to work on some of the amenity type things that get under peoples skin. The price was right, the dealer did a good job preparing the car and they treat you very well when you return for service with free loaners etc. All in all, its fine but, some issues for sure",4

Wanted a strong V6 not a turbo 4 banger (Long Term Reliability!).  Seems many are complaining about gas mileage.  With just 2,500  miles I am able to get around 16 MPG in town and a solid 26.5 MPG on the highway.  Achieved a high of 28.2 MPG on a recent trip.  I am using lighter Mobil 1 5W-20 so this may help slightly in the mileage.  Great vehicle and value.  My regrets is lack of an auto lift gate on the rear also lack of Apple or Android Auto.",5
494, on 07/24/16 19:18 PM (PDT),bill p ,2016 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 7A),A sports car marketed as an SUV," This is a great car priced thousands below the competition. This is our third EX/QX50, and we bought this one for the technology package, and the extra 4 inches in length. The car has not disappointed. You are essentially getting the equivalent of  a fully equipped Porsche Macan at essentially half the price. The 0-60 time is just short of the Porsche Cayman. The reviewers are critical of the cramped cabin, outside visibility, dated interior styling and the package pricing. To them I say do they criticize Porsche over a cramped cabin and outside visibility? Have they ever attempted to build a Porsche online, where seemingly even the steering wheel is extra? Package pricing should be a welcome addition. To me simple is better, and that includes the interior styling and lack of complexity. In the QX50, you can actually turn on the radio, and change the volume and the station with one push of the button - how novel. And in comparison with the same class of vehicle, where is the consideration of cost and reliability? This car is not perfect. It now needs a power lift gate and better fuel economy, and the Navigation System needs to work better. We use our $400 Garmin Nuvi instead of the Nav. Also, the power rear seats are a joke. But, all in all, a great car, which we would/and have bought again in a heartbeat. Somehow, Nissan, having been in this segment since the beginning, has not marketed this vehicle correctly, and that is a shame. We’ve since acquired a 2017 which had to be ordered from Japan because the specific color and packages were not available.",5

Very comfortable car. Leased 2 of them. Deal was so good that the 2 cost me $100 less a month than my 2014 X3 which I purchased/financed in 2014 and quickly sold the day before picking up the Infinitis.,5
496, on 05/10/16 12:09 PM (PDT),Honey Badger ,2016 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Great sporty crossover," I was looking for something very specific: the utility of a crossover (not necessarily luxury) while maintaining the sporty quality that makes me happy in daily driving. To get sportier in this segment, you would have to move to the Porsche Macan or the Mercedes GLA 450 AMG, neither anywhere near my budget. For the money, this is the best deal out there, given the specifics I was looking for. Some specific details below.- The expected good: Powerful engine, faster linear acceleration than my previous GTI. I pull out of traffic stops faster than most cars, without really trying; Nice interior feel, comfortable and understated luxury; the AWD is fantastic, the rear wheel traction makes for great handling on dry road, and in rain or snow it makes it easy to drive with minimal adaptation. It feels like you can throw anything at it, and you can take the car anywhere. - The better than expected good: the 360 view camera and the navigation were pleasant surprises, after review complaints about the design being outdated; A ton of room in the rear seats, makes for nice comments from any passengers you take along; Infiniti customer service is so far superb! The dealer over-inflated the tires (actually forgot to lower the pressure after delivery), which, combined with new owner paranoia, made me worried about long term effect on suspensions after driving on it. After just one email, Infiniti promptly extended the suspension, direction and breaks warranty, no questions asked, and followed up to make sure I was happy. Nice change from the VW customer service…- The expected bad: fuel economy is poor, if you drive it in a sporty manner. The V6 begs you to do just that, and expresses its satisfaction nicely with a lively low grunt. I expected this, and can live with it; the Bose sound system: the greatest scam in consumer electronics. I know a lot of people will disagree, because TV said Bose is good, and most people cannot tell the difference between good audio and bloated midrange that distorts well-recorded music and dupes 95% of the population into thinking ""it sounds good"".- The unexpected bad: less storage space and room around the driver than my much smaller GTI! I adapted to it though; The thing with the overinflated tires on delivery (see above) took some of the new car elation away, but both Infiniti and the dealership have been very prompt to address it. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase. I miss some of the fast turning of a sports hatchback, but the peace of mind driving in any condition, the comfort, satisfying acceleration and smooth highway performance make me forget I'm in an SUV instead of a sporty car. The price makes this car an excellent deal, as all the competitors in this ""luxury"" small SUV/crossover segment are all both pricier and less athletic! If I were to do it again, I may spring for the extra cost of the Journey package to get the larger wheels, for an even better handling. 6 cylinder rear-biased vehicles are on the way out, and I am happy I managed to get one of these before they disappear.",5
497, on 04/29/16 15:42 PM (PDT),Jay Deubel ,2016 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Very happy with this 2016 QX50," This is a sports car masked as a crossover or smaller SUV. It handles like my former BMW 335i coupe, but with much more room. The technology is very good, with an amazing camera system named Birdseye view. You can see entirely around the car and when you pull into a parking space you can simply push the camera button and see everything around you, including what's in front of you. The interior is very upscale and the technology is simple to learn. It is much easier that my former BMW and the Mercedes E350 that we currently own. Everything works great including Bluetooth, navigation, phone, voice control and temp control. The gas mileage is not great at about 21 mixed and 24 to 25 on the highway, however, we were looking for performance with luxury options, not an underpowered vehicle with a boxy appearance. This vehicle has styling and turns heads with a flashy dual exhaust and a throaty yet refined sound when you start out or get on it. 0 to 60 is in the low 5's, and passing gear is smooth and powerful. Inside is spacious, especially the back seat with the added space, new in 2016. We are very pleased so far and by reading reviews, we expect maintenance costs to be very low. Lastly, a deeper center console box is needed along with a USB port on the dash instead of in the center console box.",5
498, on 04/21/16 12:09 PM (PDT),John E. ,2016 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Excellent Value," I'm relatively new to Infiniti/Nissan.  My first Infiniti was a Q50 that I REALLY enjoyed driving.  It was quiet (except for the growl during start up and acceleration), incredibly fast, and it looked like a James Bond escape vehicle.  For my lifestyle, however, it wasn't very practical as I kayak 4 days a week.  Trading off between my Jeep was getting a bit much.  I wanted to capture a similar driving experience in an SUV.  Considering all vehicle makes, I went back to Infiniti for the QX50.  It shares the same 3.7 liter V-6 as the Q60 which I loved, has a rack and the ability to store items in the back.   Where the Q60 would jump off the line, the QX50 has a more subtle acceleration.  The QX50 will perform when you want it to, though - both in acceleration and handling. The QX50 is also much easier to get in and out of the cockpit of the Q60.    If you want a sports car, but your life demands an SUV, the QX50 is a very solid choice.",5

I also own a 2015 C300 Mercedes Benz AWD.- Bluetooth audio is not standard! Not only that, you need to get the premium package plus to able to get it. They do that to force you to get the navigation with it. Its competitors don't scam you like this. This is a feature that should be standard on all models. - Except the audio system (what is it good for if you cannot connect the music of your phone into the car?), the technology in this car sucks. The voice recognition is slow and unless you pay 2000 for the premium plus package it only works to make phone calls. - Make sure you live close to a gas station because this car does 17/18 combined mpg. Really poor compared with its competitors.",2
500, on 03/10/16 11:27 AM (PST),Penelope Quintero ,2016 INFINITI QX50 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Great Crossover," We were looking for a vehicle that we could keep for many years. Looked and drove MANY crossovers. In the end, we really liked the known reliability and power of the VQ engine. The crossover drives like a fast car, I have no problem passing cars at high speeds and it gets up to speed effortless when entering the freeway. The seats are very comfortable and the interior has more of a ""classic"" feel to it. Electronics are average, nothing out of the ordinary. Technology is great, parking with the 360 cameras makes the job much easier while having the front sensing brakes gives you peace of mind. At around 10mph, we had a child jump in front of the car unexpectedly and the vehicle stopped automatically. Can not speak of reliability yet but required maintenance mainly includes basic oil changes every 6months and brake flush every 2 years. There are many different options out there but we chose this crossover because of the sporty way it drives, the known VQ engine, and the options it has for the price. We are very happy and will considered buying an Infiniti again in the future. 3.24.17 Update: The only downfall is that the AC developed a wet dirty rag smell like mold. I took it in and they told me there was nothing wrong but they had cleaned it and put some smelly thing on it. It only masked the musty smell but did not fix it. They suggested I turn off the a/c and let the vent blow just air to dry the vents as this sometimes happens. We did research and apparently other people were having the same problem. I don't think it's reasonable to ask me to do something special with the A/C for it to work appropriately especially on very hot days when I really need the A/c to work properly. It's embarrassing to have people in the car when I have to turn it on because of the smell. Besides this though the car is great.",4

This is a great car but it has a couple engineering flaws that even Infiniti acknowledges.  The first and most important is the outside temperature reporting.  It's always wrong!  Infiniti knows that the problem in placement of the temperature sensor next to the radiator.  So, why not fix it? The outside temperature then drives the automatic temperature control in the vehicle.  Another problem is blind side visibility.  It's addressed with an add-on package at the factory, but cannot be added once you take delivery.  Not to be a Scrooge, this vehicle deserves justice for the facile buggy it is.  Fast, fun to drive, responsive and it has substantial room for luggage, garden equipment/supplies and dog cage used for our trips to the park.  I'd buy it again, but engineering needs fine tuning, as alluded to above.Comment after 1 year: The new buyer comment is still on the money.  Great car with above caveats.",4

It is a terrific car and lots of fun to drive.  The ride is smooth and quiet.  The M35 has amazing power for a 3.5L engine, and has every bell and whistle you could ask for (except an interfaced iPod). Being 6-6, I am particularly impressed with roominess - plenty of headroom and leg room.  The surround sound is fantastic, the keyless entry/start is great fun, and the Bluetooth works flawlessly with my iPhone.  The only negatives I would mention are the headlights (narrow lighting area at night), middling gas mileage, and the lack of an iPod interface. (BTW, you can play the iPod via the rear L/R inputs.)

Instrument panel is easy to read both day and night; blue-oriented night feature is a nice touch. Only negative: Noise from engine acceleration -- this is no silent hybrid powering up when the light turns green!",4.875

I've owned an Acura TL- Type S, a Lexus GS300-Sports and an Avalon Limited, Each of the cars drove me nuts with rattles and phantom noise.  Although these were fine cars, none delivered the driving experience of the M. I'm also thrilled to report that my M has been rattle free with no phantom noise.  The seats are incredibly comfortable and the lumbar support is excellent.  This was a huge factor in my purchase decision because I suffer from back and neck issues.

I know looks are subjective but I love the look of this car. Have looked at and tested ALL models in this class (Audi A6, BMW528, GS350, Jag XF, Acura RL, E350 and even Hyundai Genesis). Each of them has their strengths and each of them has their weaknesses. M35 - Much more car for the money! The interior is great and very Spacious inside, the outside is soo sleek.

My car was awd but bought with 164,000 miles under its belt. This lead to the obvious wear and tear of the vehicle, the cost of repair was a bit ridiculous so if you don't want to blow a ton of cash out of pocket I'd suggest finding a cheaper more reliable car. As for gas per mile, it was a guzzler, like most 3.5ls I'd fill my take premium about twice a week. I strongly suggest that even with the slightest sound or noise you hear, take it straight to the mechanic because they are built very fragile and once one thing fails so does 100 other things that go unannounced, and get your oil and tune-ups serviced as soon as the sticker states.",3

My previous car was a 1996 Acura RL that I owned for 10 years. This M35 outperforms and outclasses the RL in almost every way. Let's start with the VQ35 engine: just an awesome running and sounding motor. Uses zero oil after 104K miles with my own synthetic blend oil changes. Quality of leather and other materials is outstanding. Car has had only two very minor factory recalls, plus the Takata airbag recall. Compared to the new model, the Q60, I'd rather hold onto my M35 and keep it in top running condition. I replaced all struts and shocks with KYB Excels at 102K. My preventive maintenance on this car has served me well--no breakdowns and very few repairs in 10 years. It's too bad that Infiniti has de-contented the Q60 to keep the price down.

Nothing out of the ordinary for a car of that age with that many miles on it.  This car could seriously get you into trouble!  The acceleration is very impressive, highway acceleration/passing and on-ramp merging is a breeze.  The only thing I'm not all that impressed with is the bluetooth technology and navigation are a bit primitive, but that's only because of the fact it's a 2007.  I'm not all that impressed with the factory stereo by Bose, and would have gotten the upgrade if I bought the vehicle new.  Repairs are expensive when they happen, but frequency is very rare as long as you maintain the car and keep up regular schedules.

The dealer just isolated the issue and will replace the shock, but Infiniti will only pay for the replacement of the faulty shock, not both rear shocks. This is the equivalent of replacing one tire.

In all fairness I need to report that somewhere around 9K miles the mileage improved.  I now get a solid 21 mpg of mixed driving and 22.5 mpg highway.  This is with premium fuel and driving driven conservatively.  I still blame the AWD for a 2 mpg loss and would encourage new car buyers to press their dealer for rear wheel drive cars.  With modern traction control, there is very little real world benefit to AWD.  And given the obvious need to conserve fuel, AWD just cant be justified, in my humble opinion.

The M needs another gear (although it looks like the 7 speed will be out soon). The user interface is easy to use. The fit and finish are excellent and love the wood.

At 9,500 miles I began another long road trip.  After arriving in Sacramento on Day 1, smoke was coming from the engine compartment.  Fortunately there was a dealership nearby.  They had to replace a blown transmission seal.  In both instances, the dealerships were very good about repairing the problem, but I have lost confidence in being able to go out of town.

My 09 M35X does not work at all with these phones. Static all the time and that supposedly great Bose radio that lowers and loudens itself at will comes on and off during a conversation.

The driving experience is almost as good as the BMW 745, and it has a ton of features.  I recommend the base model because the sport model has a really stiff ride.

The suspension, gearing and exhaust all are more sport oriented than the Lexus type comfort some may anticipate.  The steering is the only non-sporty aspect of the M35.  It is overly sensitive and loose at center.  Constant correction is required at highway speed.  The V6 leaves you wanting at times, but that is why they offer a V8.  The car needs more gears.  The new FX 7 speed transmission should fix this.  The M35 cost less than some of its competitors but I think it lacks a few features if you look closely.

I passed on the 2007 model last year when car shopping for a friend but bought it for myself this year.  The interior is roomy and all controls are within easy reach.

The Navi system is among the more intuitive I've ever used, and the 14 spkr Bose 5.1 system is wonderful. The 19 inch wheels and Z rated tires take corners most cars would balk at without even chirping the rubber. The engine is great in most torque ranges, but could use a few more horses from a starting stop. The G37 engine has more power than even the M45's V8 - which makes no sense at all to me.

747, on 03/04/18 22:57 PM (PST),Lewis’ Review ,2017 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great SUV - Very Comfortable and Quiet ," Really like the Infiniti QX60 after 8 months of driving.  It’s a great SUV that is very comfortable, plush and quiet to drive.  Test drove Lexus, BMW, Audi, Acura,  Subaru, VW, Toyota and Honda SUVs before buying Infiniti QX60.  Here are some of my likes, neutral and dislikes of the QX60:Likes:- Navigation: Easy to use, extremely clear directions and touch screen works very well- Seats: Very comfortable and plush seats with soft leather - good on long trips- Quiet:  Keeps out road noise and quiet when using phone- Style: Very sporty and stylist SUV which looks great- Controls: Both push buttons and on-screen controls are easy to use and are well placed.  Steering wheel controls are really easy to navigate while driving for both radio and cruise control.- Safety Features: Blind spot warning, adaptive cruise control, auto stop in reverse when object appears and parking sensors work well and really nice to have- Camera: Backup, front and 360 view cameras are great to have and clear- Eco Mode: 2 miles per gallon extra - Auto Dim Mirrors: Like the auto dim side mirrors which really helps with the light glare at nightNeutral:- Stereo: great sound which is comparable to other brands- Engine: Lots of power in standard and sports mode.  Eco mode a bit slow to take off to save gas and resists you flowing it, but will allow with a short delay.  Eco mode takes time to get used to, I drive 95% of time in Eco and it now feels normal.- Sunroof: Standard sunroof- Gas mileage: Standard gas mileage for larger SUV (20MPG in city and 25MPG on highway) Dislikes:- Roof Bars: Would be nice to have real roof bars that you could tie rope to.  Roof bars are cosmetic unless you buy cross bars.- Navigation Settings: Safety feature that turns off address input while car is in motion.  Won’t let passenger even add it.  A lot of new cars are restricting this option too. However, it does allow previous address location to be added while driving which is a plus.",5

In this day & age you’d think the interior lights could be LEDs. The front area is poorly designed. There’s nowhere to put anything down.

We do a lot of driving by living on the east coast and wife's family on the west coast. So the need was there for comfort and drive ability on the long trips. The QX60 was a very wise choice, not only for cargo capacity but for outward visibility, quiet interior, very comfortable seats and the safety of all wheel drive. In my view I don't think there is a better seven passenger SUV on the market today for the price of the Infinity QX60. Not only do you have a luxury brand vehicle in your driveway but the feel good factor is priceless.

The vehicle drives so poorly that none of the 5 drivers in our home want to ""get stuck with the Infiniti"".  It has poor acceleration from and stop, and worse when entering a highway or passing.  To maintain speed the driver must constantly be pressing on the gas pedal as the car gains little to no momentum.   It has the same exact instruments as a Nissan Altima, at about 3x the cost.   The brake pedal will travel almost to the floor at times.    Sport mode makes little to no difference, the car drives and acts like the old go karts we all used at amusement parks.

I was told that my car had issues that are not common for most Infiniti's but as mine was made in Tennessee, it had some rare issues.  These issues started since the first few month on purchase with a moldy smell from a/c as stated by service that just wasn't built right and they are looking to correct it. Had an accident where my auto brake didn't kick in cause of another malfunction. When called customer relations, they said I would have had to call them before repairs made and I didn't know it was the car until it happened a second time. When asked the service how often I should get checked, they said never- this almost never happens.  Customer Relations still refuses to just get me a repurchase - which is basically giving me the car I paid for without the safety issues and concerns. It is sad when even my friends all know that my car is continually in the repair. It is also sad when the service department manager gives you the customer relations phone number with what to say because they feel I am there just a little too much.

Once I narrowed my choices down to 3, I had a spreadsheet to list the prominent features, including gas mileage, weight, height, leg room (my family is tall), features, etc.  The QX60 lined up pretty good with the Acura, but I thought the QX60 had a little more pizazz.  So then on to the test drive - the QX60 blew me away with that variable transmission - once into Sport mode, oh yes, it's in the wind!  It's comfortable, a great ride (nice and quiet) and we've taken it on the road in a thunderstorm - handled great.  I've used the 3rd row, though only for kids.  The kids were very happy back there as they had ""privacy"" (ha!) and USB ports.  I especially like the Bluetooth and the sound of the stereo.  I still have mine at the factory settings cause there is no need to fiddle with it, sounds really good right where it is.  I get lots of compliments especially from people who drive Vans - the QX60 is just as tall but without those weird doors you get on a Van.  There is plenty room for everyone and whenever someone is in the 2nd row, they remark about how roomy it is.

770, on 06/14/18 05:38 AM (PDT),SCP ,2014 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),I will NEVER recommend this vehicle to anyone," I previously owned an FX/35 (now the QX70) and absolutely fell in love with that vehicle.  It was perfect for me...until I began expanding my family and needed more room.  Because I had such a fabulous experience with Infiniti I went back and selected a QX60 because it is a little bigger.  The good news - the fit & finish is great and gas mileage is better than expected.  I drive 70+ miles daily in rush hour traffic & I still average nearly 22 mpg.  The bad news - there is nothing else redeeming about this vehicle or Infiniti Corp.  The battery dies every 18 months like clockwork.  And, as others have stated, within months of purchasing this vehicle (with all of 12 miles on it), I began having horrible transmission problems.  I took it into the service group 7 or 8 times to no avail because it was intermittent and the techs could never duplicate it.  I was to the point of hiring an attorney when Infiniti SUDDENLY developed a 'code' that could detect the KNOWN problem I was having.  Finally, when I took it in, they read the code and BAM - new transmission.  The problem is that I have had bizarre and random hiccups with the transmission since...including a horrible clunking sound when shifting from reverse to drive.  Again, only intermittently so it cannot be easily reproduced.  I was told that, because I had the ""newest version"" of the transmission they would not replace it again.  Infiniti must have received an incredible number of complaints because 4 weeks after I had tried - yet again - for them to recognize the horrid clunking sound, Infiniti released a bulletin that said hearing a horrible clunking sound when shifting from reverse to drive (especially first thing in the morning) is considered NORMAL for this vehicle and had to do with either the motor or the transmission mounts.  That was it for me.  I have sworn off Infiniti and I warn everyone I know to not purchase one.  Unfortunately, in my state I missed my opportunity to sue under lemon laws, but I know I will never make that mistake again.  If I ever encounter similar issues with another vehicle I will immediately hire an attorney and get all of my money back (and my legal fees!).  My favorite part was when they told me they were extending the warranty on my transmission for another 30,000 miles...wait - you mean the transmission you swear is perfectly normal and refuse to address in any way?  Right....that'll do the trick.  Needless to say, I am now in search of a different vehicle and consider the experience a horribly costly life lesson.

780, on 07/21/16 17:17 PM (PDT),Chicagoland Infiniti Purchaser ,2014 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),2014 Infiniti QX 60 Ignition Would Not Shut Off!," I thoroughly researched luxury 3-row SUVs before purchasing a new Infiniti QX 60 vehicle (in the Chicagoland area) in 2014.  The negotiated price was competitive based upon the other SUVs I researched.  The vehicle is comfortable, the interior is nice, and I love the overall look of the vehicle.  But I have had two significant issues with my 2014 QX 60 that would prevent me from purchasing another Infiniti:  (1) an issue with a gas gauge being defective, resulting in the electronic and traditional gas gauges being inconsistent and causing uncertainty as to how much gas was in the vehicle (dashboard removed and circuitry replaced within the first 30 days of owning the vehicle) and (2) an issue with the ignition start/stop button not working, preventing me from being able to turn off the ignition and lights and rendering the windows, door locks, shifter, etc. from being functional (one body control module replaced after diagnostic testing showed an error code between two body control modules).  The second issue resulted in me being stranded at night in the country on a trip with my 5-year-old son, after stopping for gas in a small town without a hotel, car rental agency, etc.  I was unable to leave my vehicle since neither the engine nor the lights would shut off, and a tow truck driver who initially agreed to tow my vehicle later dropped off my son and me in a remote area because he did not deem my vehicle safe to tow.  As the Infiniti customer service person remarked after hearing my story, ""It sounds like a bad movie.""  And yet Infiniti was unable to confirm that the same or further electrical issues will not recur/occur, and Infiniti was unwilling to provide an extended warranty for electrical issues with the vehicle.  The bottom line for me is that the car has experienced problems that I would not expect for a 2014 ""luxury"" vehicle, and Infiniti has been unwilling to stand behind its product by offering an extended warranty for the electrical issues experienced with the vehicle.",1

The controls on the dash are far inferior to many lower priced vehicles and the capabilities are inferior to most SUV's on the road.    The 2014 dash has since been replaced but Infinity continues to complicate controls, limit the range of controls and fails to connect the user the ways many other vehicles can.   The ride is extremely noisy for a ""Luxury"" brand, the features are far less than other manufacturers and I'm very disappointed with my purchase.  I'd suggest looking at other options unless a SUV is with limited features is what is needed.   The cabin is roomy and comfortable but that is where my positive reviews will end.",2

We have provided video evidence of the problem, but since the dealer's test equipment finds no fault, they refuse to replace any parts or make further adjustments.  The manufacturer sent a technical expert to examine the car, and he agreed with the dealer that without a computer stored fault no action would be taken.  After viewing the several videos, their position remains unchanged.   We have owned BMW, Porsche, Mercedes, Toyota, Chevrolet and Cadilac cars in the recent past, and in all cases have been pleased with warranty support.  This is our first and last Infiniti.

It's beautiful and comfortable and we loved the safety features.  However, we have had this car for less than two years and it is literally falling apart at the seams.  Our transmission failed at 50k miles, the seals on the roof came out and started flapping in the wind, the front console trim cracked in multiple places, the seals around the vents are coming out (not even sure how!), the driver visor broke and now just hangs, the latch for the storage compartment broke.  The car is also under powered with poor acceleration.  We got the car fully loaded and it has failed to meet our quality expectations for a $60k+ car.  We're now hoping to get rid of it before it completely falls apart.",3
785, on 09/12/15 19:08 PM (PDT),Susan Hubbard ,2014 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Dangerous Vehicle!!!," Purchased my QX 60 in June 2014. By the end of July, with approximately 4,000 miles on the car, I had MAJOR transmission problems. The car would jerk and jut, accelerating and decelerating very hard and on its own without my foot on the gas! From that day on until 3 weeks ago I had my car in and out of service every couple of months because of transmission problems they could not diagnose (it has a horrible shutter that jerks the car around). FINALLY, they put an update on my car 13 months after I purchased it and of course it told them to replace the transmission. This is a known problem that service writers, techs and many customers have experienced. I had my new transmission in 2 weeks and it did the same thing!!!!  Three weeks after my transmission was replaced they had to put in another. In addition to a horribly built transmission the adaptive cruise control, which maintains a specific distance from the car in front of it while using cruise control is seriously dangerous and life threatening. When a large vehicle, like a semi-truck, passes on the right the vehicle will brake very hard trying to bring it to a stop. When you are driving 80 MPH on the interstate you put your life in your hands because any vehicles following behind have no idea you will brake that suddenly for no reason. Again, this is a known issue with service writers and techs. It can be terrifying to experience. I am in the process of working with the state to have Infiniti purchase my car back due to the lemon laws. Wish me luck!",1
786, on 08/25/15 21:46 PM (PDT),crash ,2014 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),So far So good," The reviews I've read sound scary!  I haven't owned mine long but I've done a long road trip with it.  Others have mentioned poor gas mileage.  I don't fully disagree, but I've been watching my driving habits and my mileage has been improving.  At first I was getting a combined 16.5 mpg.  My overall average has improved to 21.5  and my last few fill ups were around the 23.5 mpg range.  I now leave it in ECO mostly and switch to sport in city traffic or when I know I'll need more responsive acceleration. I haven't had any quality issues yet with trim or paint, but do worry about that as the trim pieces do seem a little fragile or cheap.  So, I am concerned based on other reviews.  But, so far I LOVE this car.  It is very quiet which is important to me.  Its a very smooth ride too, also important.  I just returned from a 7 day, 2700 mile road trip and I find the car to be very comfortable.  I bought this car used, and had planned on buying the Audi Q7, but was having difficulties finding the right used one at the right price and then drove this and loved it.  I should mention that the one I bought came with all the packages, and I'm very pleased with all the features, especially the adaptive or intelligent cruise control.  So, so far I'm very happy, and hopefully I won't have some of the problems others mention.",4

788, on 07/29/15 18:43 PM (PDT),D.B. ,2014 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Worst purchase decision EVER!," Very disappointed in this purchase. Upgraded from a Honda Oddessey and I regret this decision wholeheartedly. IT IS THE ROUGHEST RIDE EVER AND INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE. I didn't realize how horrific the ride is while test driving because that is usually a quick ride. I am constantly yelling at my husband to stop driving like a maniac but am realizing it must be the car'mechanics or suspension. Either way, I dislike the feel and comfort of the car more and more everyday. I recall it driving slightly smoother the first 3 months we had it and now 10 months in, we're all bouncing out of the seats. My kids really dislike riding in the back seats. (I feel terrible because they weren't with us when be test drove it.) The engine is getting louder by the day. I don't care for the way this car shifts gears. Seems love it revs up very high before finally settling into the right gear.The lift hate is rusted underneath the chrome panels. It is currently in the body shop getting replaced. Let me remind you the car isn't even a year old yet!The temperature is never just right; either too hot or too cold. The back seat vents are sparse which is likely the reason for the fluctuation in temperature. I'm getting roughly 18.2 mpg but do travel frequently.15k mile ""recommended service"" is $450+. Ray Catena's complimentary car wash is a joke. Very sloppy on the cleaning overall. My car still had sticker residue on the outside after a few washed by the dealer. I took it to a car wash and paid for the job to be done right. It was like night and day.Overall very disappointed. Should have gone with the MDX.

The test of a great company is when they have to deal with a customer issue and how they resolve the issue and make the customer a long time loyal customer.  Just bought a brand new Infiniti 2014 QX60 in January 2015 with less than 525 miles (the car was delivered with the paint issues) and found manufacturer paint defect issues and Infiniti Affairs has refused to repurchase or trade out the vehicle and have not accepted responsibility for their paint defects.

Just about every trim piece, whether inside or outside is falling off or has fallen off.  Even the plastic Infiniti label on the back hatch is in the process of falling off.  The tires lasted a whopping 25k miles, and, at 20"", they are very expensive.  The rear brakes and rotors failed at 20k miles. It is under-powered, the CVT is annoying, it doesn't get particular good mileage, and the steering response feels like there is a rubber band between the steering wheel and wheels.  The wind noise increases by the day (the car is simply falling apart), and it is not due to the failing seals because the dealer replaced the seals.        ",2.375

The airbag indicator light has been ""fixed"" 3 times. The roof rail was replaced because the rubber sealing strip kept coming out at highway speed or a washing. Obviously poor construction or engineering. The dealership has certainly tried to make it right, but all the fun and pride of ownership is ruined.  Each repair visit took 5-10 days! I should have gone with the Acura MDX as my brother suggested. UPDATE: The dealership bought back the car if I would buy a new 2015 QX60. So I did.

Seriously? 2104 and all these pain in the neck repairs? what's next, I'm sure something else was fixed that I don't recall, so I decided to sue Nissan, yep I want a new car or my money back.My lawyers are asking for that but Nissan offered just $500 compensation. Are you serious Nissan? So still in pending responses from Nissan before I submit lawsuit. I'm really scare now waiting when this car will brake in pieces on the highway.

I purchased it in September 2014. My first trip a week later, it started stuttering and jerking and jumping upon acceleration. I took it back to the dealer every week for months. Each time they replaced something significant, like the transmission. I think I had 3 or 4 new transmissions. At one point, they replaced the engine. This car was a disaster. In the 6 months I owned it, the dealer had it more often than me and put more miles on it than I did. They called at one point and offered me $1000 to shut up and dismiss my claims. Um, no. After dealing with it for 5 months, the person at Nissan Corporate said she didn't realize my transmission had been replaced so many times. So they bought it back. But charged me for all the miles, most of which had been the result of the dealer driving it or going back and forth to the dealer. Then I got a notice prior to the completion of the buy back (and after they had already told me what they would give me for it) that I should make a payment since the buy back wasn't final.  I financed through NISSAN!!. I made the payment anyway. And sure enough, when I got my check, it was for the original amount and didn't include the payback of my payment. So they tried to pocket that. I appealed it and it took a month or so to get that back. The only people that impressed me about Infiniti were the service people, who REALLY tried. Everyone else was horrible, from the sell to the buy back.",1

I have always driven a Toyota so this was my first experience owning an Infiniti. The car worked beautifully for 18 months. THEN....Car starting having start up issues on July 2015. Several times a week it would take 3-4 tries to start the vehicle. I presumed it was the battery. At that time they the dealership jump started my battery which they said was still good and told me to drive my car more often. Lol! Then several weeks later problem with starting the car returns. I hold off on bringing the car in until September when the car does not start one morning. Infiniti road service jumps my car and the dealership agrees to replace my battery. Three days later my car stalls twice while driving the car in reverse and the power steering fails while vehicle is in drive. Took the car in the next morning (Monday) and they checked it and said everything seemed fine:( LUCKILY while pulling the car back from the service garage the car stalls for the service technician. At that point I was given a loaner vehicle. During this visit they noticed that a wire was loose underneath the car. I believe it was the body control module wire that was loose. For this visit they really thought they had the problem solved and return the car to me the following day. Four days later the car stalls again while driving and does not starting on the first try. I returned it to the dealership and got a loaner for the second time. During this time they replaced the hybrid battery as well as the key remote battery and they even replaced the new battery just to make sure all batteries were new at the same time. The kept my car for 2 weeks just to be sure it was fixed before returning it to me. Four days later car takes 3 tries to start so I take it directly to the dealership and got another loaner vehicle. During this visit they have been replacing both the hybrid computer and the body control module computer. They have had my vehicle for 3 weeks. The vehicle is still not working so now they think they will replace the harness! Oh and by the way, while the vehicle was at the dealership for 3 weeks parallel parked in an unofficial parking spot in a lot that is overcrowded a delivery truck backs into my vehicle and now the side bumper needs to be replaced. Estimate for damages is 4000 K! I have never has this kind of experience with a car in my life. My first Luxury vehicle is my least reliable car ever. I have started the buy back process with Infiniti and I will do my best to warn others to not waste their time or money on these cars.",1

It is perfect  when you drive the wife, 2 kids and their stuff. And you still have room to offer another family to come alone. Or like me, you do not remember when was your last speeding ticket. My last one was 17 years ago. I know we need a minivan but can not imagine being seen in one. QX60 fits the bill, plus the 4WD. I enjoy seeing 26 to 29 mpg routinely with regular gas. My record is a 38.1 mpg on a short 10 mile run. Having kids changed my perspective. I no long focus on 0-60 numbers. Someday,  I will have my sports car with no child seats.I also got 17 mpg when try to match my G35 experience.Update, April 3rd, 2016. 27,000 + miles later, QX60 Hybrid runs well.  Overall, I am at 25.5 mile/gallon, I did manual calculation for 12 month driving, recording miles at each gas fill up. I drive highway 70 miles during the week, and all local during weekends. Before QX60, we always take my wife's ML350. Now, kids just go to QX60, it is so comfortable and roomier. No issue, not a single one. I did oil and filter changes myself every 5000 miles with full synthetic. I do not go to dealer for services, other than tire rotation. My next car is either a 911, GT-R or Tesla Model S, keep on dreaming while driving +/- 5 miles within speed limit in my QX60.",4

I've had the car for 6 months, have approximately 5000 miles on it and average about 16 MPG!  The car has been back over 3 times to the dealer.

They even kept the car one day and took it on various trips on the highway, off the highway, idling in a parking lot, etc. and claim that they were able to get the car up to 26 MPG.    Since then, we've come to find out that the Hybrid does not work when the air conditioning is on.

(yay!)The car still runs the engine at stop lights, and frequently doesn't charge the battery while doing it to boot.  (what amateur programmed this thing?)The dealership is now out of business.  Go figure.  (Santa Monica Infiniti...)New Developments:- I updated my safety rating to 3 stars, as it has now had a recall for air bag issues.  I've also noticed as I go between my '04 Ford Expedition and this QX60 that the headlights in the QX60 are marginal at best.  In the dark I can only see a fraction of the distance that I can with the Expedition headlights and I the low beams don't have as wide an angle either, making tight corners in the dark scary.- It has had loud intermittent grinding noises from the engine compartment for over a year now.  Incredibly embarrassing when it does it in public.  The dealership has been unable to diagnose after 2 or 3 tries.  It goes away when we turn off the A/C, so it's something related to the A/C.- We live in Canada now, and it turns out the maintenance plan we bought in the US is no good there.  (working on getting a refund... what a PITA.)  Just for fun we looked into getting a Canadian one, and oddly enough if we get that one it'll work in the US.- Minor issue, but the dealership in our area is a combined Nissan / Infiniti and service visits are more like going to a Nissan than going to an Infiniti.  My wife will no longer do the services because of this, which is yet another PITA for me.  I guess I should just feel lucky there is a dealership at all in our area, as the one we were using before in California has closed.In summary, after the first year or so, my wife was done with it and wants something new.  Ugh.  And while we love the interior and comfort of the vehicle, we could have spent $20,000 less and got a Pathfinder with 99% of the features, better gas mileage, selectable 4WD, etc - OR we could have got the non-hybrid QX60 for $3,000 less and had a straightforward gas engine that would get better mileage and not be nearly as complex to work on.  Either way, we still feel ripped off.  Original Review:Sticker on it was 25 City / 28 Hwy.Actual has been around 16 City / 21 Hwy, no better than the all-gas version, which is $3,000 cheaper.The fuel gauge often jumps from 1/4 tank to empty, and the display goes from ~50 miles to ""---"".The hybrid battery gauge has 6 bars and a charge indicator.At stops it frequently runs the engine without charging battery, even though the charge is only at 2-3 bars.The only time I've seen the battery charged over 5 bars was on a long downhill trip where it charged with regenerative braking.Had the car 3 months and didn't even know it went up to 6 bars until that trip.The dealership has been evasive and unable to address the above issues.",4

WTF - ~15% difference?!  most of my driving REQUIRES air conditioner due to weather so this is a big issue.automated highway driving - if there is a large obstruction in middle of highway, the car not sense it and plow right into it.  its only when there is a moving object (vehicle) in front, when the car senses the manages acceleration/brakes.  if this is important to you, look into new models or other vehicles.~Jan-2014:I've had the qx60 hybrid and for about 3 mo now, 2300 miles.If I knew how poorly hybrid performs in the city (supposed to be hybrid vehicle strength) I would not have gone for hybrid.Let me repeat this, the car is great!

While I am suppose to be able to listen to my entertainment while the kids have their CD movie going I have not been able to make that happen.  So my music is missing when they are in the car.  Plus, my height is short so the seat adjustment could have gone another notch toward the roof for me.  A cushion would work.  But, defeats the look of the QX60 interior and gets in the way of storage when another driver takes over.  Also, with the rear seats view to the screens I need to adjust the headrests up to be out of my way.  The typical headrest makes my head tilt forward.  With a screen in the headrest it can not be turned around for my pleasure to make it straighter on my posture.  The GPS I can not delete the total history out of our QX60 from the previous owner.

I was looking for something that was comfortable for the driver, since my feet have issues in alot of cars with not enough legroom and awkward resting spots for my non-driving foot.  The interior was sharp, albeit missing basics for an expensive ""luxury"" car, like blind spot mirrors if not a blind spot warning system.  Same with bluetooth, no music streaming although you can connect your phone.  No nav system, for such a ""luxury"" brand, should be a crime.  The backup camera monitor was cheesy at best, and made the cheap Toyota RAV4 backup camera monitor look like HDTV.  Did it have nice finishes?  Yes.  Did it look amazing?  Yes.  I got 25 mpg on average, driving 70-75 mph, for 1000 miles non-stop in one day.  And I did it in one day on the way home too.  After spending 18 hours in the car, non-stop, you notice stuff.  You notice that you are in a luxury car, that is missing basics.  The headlights were amazing. The LED daytime lights and fog lights were very sharp.  But, it didn't have backup sensors to alert when too close, or even cross traffic detection.  For a luxury SUV of this size, I'd say that isn't fair.  All of that said, handling was most disappointing.  It had alot of road drifting, when at the highway speeds over 60 mph....it felt like the steering was jerky, and had to keep on it to keep it under control.  It was a newer car with only 5K on the odometer when I left.  I came back with over 7K on the odometer, done in two days - two very long non stop days.  I noticed a fair amount of vibration - my GPS on the dash mount was shaky and rattling alot.  That was annoying.  But I was comfortable.  And two guys had all their luggage easily fitting into the rear cargo area with loads of room to spare.   But I didn't long to drive, my partner at work drove most of the way.  He too noticed the challenging drive of this car.  It is BIG, and it takes little effort to steer, but wish it was a bit firmer steering.  A nice car in many ways, but I felt I could not enjoy the ride as I felt I was always correcting the car to keep it in my lane, thereby minimizing the experience (which I thought would be luxurious vs. tedious) on such a long ride back and forth.",3
840, on 09/11/16 04:19 AM (PDT),Almatti ,2016 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),EXCELLENT FAMILY SUV," I leased this vehicle to replace a M37x. I shopped for a new Q70 , but this vehicle had a better overall value. It is too much car for me personally, because I don't have a large at home family anymore.  But with the suttle upgrades in the exterior design for 2016, the smoothness of the ride, and the ample roominess and interior quality (and nice simple controls) of the vehicle, I was convinced to go with the QX60.  The Infiniti incentives to waive some remaining lease payments and other dealer incentives helped to get me in the door.  After seeing the QX60 fully loaded on the floor with the 20 inch wheels in diamond pearl white and java interior, I took that vehicle that day.  In retrospect, I did what I never do, completed an impulse buy without full research.",4
841, on 08/25/16 06:19 AM (PDT),Doug ,2016 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Disappointed, I have had one of these as a rental car for over a week and can safely say I dislike it more than the day I got it.  As a vehicle it has nice seats and decent room but I expected much more from it. The ride for a normal SUV is decent but not for this level of SUV. The trim looks nice but there is cheapness in nasty places. For example the plastic on the steering wheel is thin and sticks out almost cutting your hand. It has poor acceleration by my standards.,2
842, on 08/01/16 07:30 AM (PDT),Sergio ,2016 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Great SUV," After debating between the 2017 MDX and the 2016 QX60, it is definitely clear to see who the winner is. Infiniti blew us away with the use of getting to the third row and the amount of legroom in the third row compared to the MDX. I also liked what features were available on the QX60 than compared to the MDX, as the QX60 had more practical features for a vehicle in this segment in packages that made more sense than it did in the MDX. For example, the around view monitor, heated steering wheel, and USB ports in the third row require the highest level package from Acura, while Infiniti has these features offered in its mid-level package. Additionally, the service that the Infiniti dealership gave us compared to Acura was another reason to go with the QX60; I feel more at ease for any services in the future.",5
843, on 07/25/16 22:39 PM (PDT),Sudhir ,2016 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Luxury Family SUV," I bought the 3.5 AWD with all Packages except the Theatre package which I found not really useful considering we are in the age of iPads and Tablets. I test drove  2016 Acura MDX but didn't like the bland interior, button gear selector and the low driving position. For the QX60 I got the Hermosa Blue with Wheat and it looks gorgeous!!! The styling of the 2016 Model looks way more stylish and sportier than the 2015 model. The 2016 also drives a lot smoother and feels quicker off the block. The sport mode is a blast and I am amazed at the ease with which this huge car can get going on the freeway and pass other cars. The surround view 360' camera is awesome and makes parking this huge vehicle a breeze. The interior in whet stands out and adds to the overall pleasure of driving. The back and rear seats are very spacious though could have done with better lateral support.  Just love the remote start feature and helps cooling the car ahead in hot summer days.  Navigation is pretty awesome in the sense that it is simple to use and doesn't go overboard in terms of tech. All the buttons and knobs are easy to use and can be used even when the vehicle is in motion (as against the Pilot where this is restricted). Overall I am very pleased with this car and enjoy spending time inside it. Would very much recommend to anyone looking out for a Luxury 3-row crossover.",5
844, on 07/21/16 09:41 AM (PDT),Steve ,2016 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Everyday I wait to see what will be wrong next," Now Infiniti had to buy the vehicle back under Lemon Law.  I would avoid Infiniti and Nissan products and if you are in Pittsburgh PA I would completely avoid the scam artists at Cochran.  I bought an Audi after selling back the Infiniti and could not be happier with a vehicle.I have only had this vehicle for 6 months and have had more than enough problems.  There is a rattle in the front dash drivers side, but I am guessing loose or missing clips, which the dealershiponly took 2 months to correct.    City driving on standard mode is about 3 - 4 mpg less than sticker.  I do drive conservative so do not expect to get much better than that.  The seats are loose fitting for the body to sit in and dont hold you like other vehicles I have had.  They do not feel like they were built for anyone over 5' 10"".     The one item I did forget to mention is the camera system,  I think they could have used better, higher resolution cameras.  Any problems I am really finding the dealership is writing it off to  ""well thats the way its designed""  This is a manufacturer I will not honor with another purchase and Nissan the mother company has the same problems as Infiniti.",1

Rear seats are not comfortable as the there is no thigh support. Front seats lumbar does not extend far out enough.Car emits high pitched whistling noise when air is on recirculation. Take a look at this Video on YouTube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0sUMvyP6YITwo car dealers says its normal. So if you like your car to whistle then this is the car for you!Personally, I've leased 3 Infinitis in the past 10 years. Been driving 30 years, and never had this problem in any other car, so I don't think its normal. I regret my trust in Infiniti on this model.",2
847, on 06/10/16 14:32 PM (PDT),Happy Buyer ,2016 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Absolutely in Love with my New QX60," I test drove probably every three row SUV on the market before deciding on the QX60.  I had been driving a 2011 Toyota Sienna that had over 140,000 miles on it and felt it was time to start looking for a new car.  Prior to that car I leased three other minivans...two Honda and another Sienna.  It was time to move on from the minivan, however I still needed a true third row to have teenage kids sit in from time to time as well as ample cargo space.  Most of the other three row SUV's have a joke of a third row that is only meant for someone under ten years old.  I test drove the AUDI Q7 and although it's a beautiful car, the third row wasn't nearly as accessible or large as this one and to get all of the equipment I got in the QX60 it would have cost more than $15,000 more.  The same story for the Mercedes and the BMW with the BMW having the smallest third row.  I considered the Toyota Highlander, and although that is a very nice car with ample room, it's just not nearly as luxurious as the Infiniti QX60, and is quite sparce with the interior details.  I even considered the new Honda Pilot fully loaded, until I read all of the Edmunds reviews, and that car for now is a load of trouble.  Plus again, it just wasn't as luxurious as this car.  The styling of the QX60 is beautiful.  The 2016 interior has been tweaked and is now really beautiful.  I had looked at the 2015 a few months earlier and didn't love the interior which was why it initially fell off of my short list.  When the 2016 came out I revisited the car, and the decision became clear. Technology - the technology is extremely user friendly.  Everything is intuitive and so easy to learn.  The voice command system actually works and understands what you are saying.  So many of the other cars I test drove did not.  The navigation is equally easy to use and prompts you early enough to make the system easy to follow.  The sound system is outstanding.  I think they told me it's a 13 speaker BOSE system.  It fills the car beautifully with music.  I did get the top of the line model with every bell and whistle available.  The new safety features this car has are awesome as well.  I love the road departure feature and the cross traffic alert.  The car comes with a ton of outside cameras which is super useful as well when parking.  I can actually look at the side camera view with the touch of one button and see if my car is too close or far from the curb if I am parallel parking or even parking in a regular space.  I love that the car came equipped with heated seats (front and rear) and A/C seats in the front.  The A/C seats really works quickly and makes it so comfortable to drive when you get into a hot car.  Interior - Plenty of storage space.  I wanted a large center console and this one has a two level console which houses everything but in an organized manner.  The glove compartment is equally huge.   The second row is adjustable front and back and the seats recline as well.  The third row seats recline as well which makes you feel like there is more room if you are sitting in third row.  If you are a tall adult you probably wouldn't want to go on a really long trip, but an hour or so would be no big deal to sit back there.  Behind the third row there is a hidden compartment underneath to store a few things as well.  Overall this car is the perfect fit for me.  It gives me everything I was looking for...a luxurious vehicle that I can really enjoy whether driving alone or toting the kids all over in.",5

I put about 1000 miles on it, it was new.  Some things really stood out.  First, it is a beautiful SUV, seats are comfortable with leather and plenty of space. Vision is nice with few blind spots.  It accelerates nicely and the V6 is really responsive, if a little noise.  Cruises at 75 nicely and very smooth.But, for  A $50,000 car (I had a base model), it was really not much car for the money.  Bluetooth paired with phone for calls, but not for music....kind of amazing in todays world.  It did have an Aux jack in the storage, but that was not real useful.  Amazingly, it had RCA jacks too, not sure if Infinity thought I was going to hook up a cassette deck or something.Back up camera was nice, especially with a 7 inch screen, but the infotainment system was useless so it was a waste of a screen,  climate controls were confusing and not easy to use.Really much prefer my Outback, though not quite as comfortable, it does have many more features for much less money.  If it isabout looking good in a car, this is it, otherwise, I will pass.",3

This is my first infiniti and I am extremely happy with it. I got a very good deal and I got the AWD with premium and + package which is so awesome and not too fancy. I got the Hermosa Blue with graphite interiors. Its perfect!! With the premium + package you get a lot of features such as illuminated strips of Infiniti on the doors, ambient lights, door lights. They have a nice design for the 2016. It looks really sporty and interiors are very comfortable. I was thinking of using regular fuel as company recommends Premium fuel, again its upto you. I have been putting 93 and 89 octane to get a average of 91 octane as this is recommended by Infiniti if you read the owners manual. I am very happy with this car and looking forward to post a review in 6 months. I got 3 years free oil service and tire rotations from Harte Infiniti Hartford. Tires I have now is AS Toyo Open Country A25 235/65/R18. I am planning to upgrade this to 235/55/R20 with Pirellis Scorpion Verde AS. Keep smiling and live life!!",5

(I also own a Nissan Altima Hybrid.)  Standard features should include:  engine ""off"" in stopped conditions (even with AC on), ability to use ""fan only"" for fresh air without the AC activating, electronic driving in ""non load"" (flat, no hills, etc.) conditions.  Additionally, a hybrid vehicle should get better mileage than it's all gas equivalent.  This vehicle fails on all ""hybrid"" traits.  The TECHNOLOGY is outdated.  Blue tooth connects to your phone but to actually dial it is anywhere from 4-8 steps.  (Infinity forgot the KISS principle...Keep It Simple Stupid.)  Additionally, there is no way to connect to your Android phone to display maps, IM, email, calendar, etc. in a open communication method.  Infinity does allow limited connectivity using ""Infinity Connect"" for a fee but it doesn't work well.  Infinity is a car company, not a technology company...let Google do that by allowing Android Auto to connect to the vehicle technology infrastructure.  Another ""whoops"" by Infinity is only offering 1 USB port in the vehicle.  Say ""What""?      SUMMARY: If you're thinking of buying a 7-seat hybrid SUV, Infinity QX60 Hybrid is a great driving vehicle but doesn't perform like a hybrid, doesn't have current technology and doesn't offer an open interface to 3rd party applications.",4
853, on 08/16/18 16:28 PM (PDT),wgj ,2015 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Best choice in this category!," If you want a roomy, stylish, reliable, comfortable luxury SUV then this should be strongly considered.   When we compared the QX60 to everything else it was an easy decision.  No other choice gave us all of the above at this price point - and the lease deal on the 2015 model, after negotiation,  was very reasonable.  While I'd still choose this car again, there are(and maybe have been already) needed improvements.  The front seats seem too hard for long hauls and you feel it!  There is a very suttle engine vibration which I noticed the 2016 model had improved engine mounts to address.  Other than that it is mostly solid.  You can get much better mileage by paying attention to the driving modes - sport for around town and climbing and standard or economy for cruising.  This car will get up and go if you ask it so I disagree with the critics regarding sluggish acceleration.  It handles very well considering the size with decent steering and braking.   It is very quiet at speed and mostly a smooth ride.  Had a 2012 FX35 prior and it was just way to stiff and uncomfortable for most driving conditions.  The Qx60 is a much softer ride!",4
854, on 01/14/18 09:25 AM (PST),Neal ,2015 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),"It's a people-hauler, not a sports car"," Bought it used at 20k miles, now more like 50k (several long roadies this year with the kids, typically I drive more like 12k/yr).  I've read about peoples' issues with the screen, seats, etc., but have not experienced any of that.  I did a lot of comparison shopping before buying.  I looked at the MDX (smaller, less cargo, feels cheaper inside to me - and,  I don't care about a ""sporty"" crossover), the Q7 (also smaller feeling to me - I'm 6'3"", 3 bills, picture your favorite NFL center, was a little nicer inside but also more $, and I read a by lot of poor reliability reviews on the Audi, so it was out), and the BMW X5 (smaller, just generically didn't like the way it looked or felt, again for more $).  In the end, the Infiniti was larger, smoother, more comfortable (my family of four has done 15 hours of roadie in it with our gear, and it was a breeze, very comfortable), well appointed (although I'm still figuring out the need to adjust the angle of the headlights, that seems a little bit overkill), gas mileage is decent (I tend towards ~19 in town/commuting, more like ~29-30 on the highway), and I do wish Nissan would get their tech act together, but that's not a show-stopper for me.  So in the end it's a very competent people-hauler, feels good, looks good, plenty of room, and in this bracket of vehicle it was by comparison cheap.  I would acknowledge that I haven't experienced any of the electrical or build problems you may see in other reviews, though - if I had, I might not be so happy.",4
855, on 12/18/17 19:56 PM (PST),Yomomu ,2015 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),I actually drive it," I have read that others have issues with the seating.  I've read that the CVT is an acquired taste.  I've read that others get lousy fuel mileage.  I've read the car is sluggish. Not sure of any of that.  I think the seating is comfortable, maybe the head rests could tilt backwards a bit more.  I have NO issues with the CVT.  Unlike some of the newer cars with 8-9 gears, the CVT ""shifts"" (fake) very comfortably and it is very, very smooth.  I get mid 20's gas mileage on regular fuel on the highway, better than my M and better than my Hyundai Santa Fe.  I don't think the car is sluggish at all, I've had plenty of passing power and it is very responsive in Sport mode if that is what you are looking for.  What I think this car does best is act like a relatively large SUV from a functional perspective yet performs well enough to be your daily driver without getting bored.  Stereo is good, not as good as my M but decent enough for an SUV.  Interior is really nice.  It is an absolute joy in snow and ice, better than my old Mitsubishi Montero, and that's saying something.  I really like the heated steering wheel - weird, I didn't even thing about that when I bought it.  No issues with reliability at 20K miles, though that's not many miles, still no maintenance issues except scheduled.  I've had several Infiniti's - none of them have had reliability issues.  I don't really expect any in this vehicle.  I've got one rattle in the passenger door that goes away when the car heats up.  For a big car, very solid.  Test drove MDX, Pilot, Highlander, Enclave.  This car was the highest price but was on par with others on lease.  Would have considered the Highlander if it had a little more panache.  MDX nice but not as functional and new tranny was abrupt.  Couldn't get used the not having something to lean my arm on in the Pilot and the radio kept going in and out on the test drive.  No way on the Enclave - its a minivan and a drone to drive though the interior is nice.  I say buy it, you won't regret it.

What I do not love is the CVT transmission.  I bought the car (LOADED by the way) in April 2015.  We have certainly had our issues along the way, but BY FAR, the biggest issue is the CVT transmission.  It started after we had a transfer case FAILURE, but I won't go into the story.  My car started to have a vibration around 30/40 MPH when trying to stay at a constant speed.  If you do a lot of local driving like I do, you are in this constant speed mode a lot.  The dealership says they cannot 'replicate' the problem.  It gets worse, and since I drive a lot, I am in the dealer about once a month for an oil change.  EVERY MONTH I complain.  Every month, they cannot replicate it.  The last time in, I was set to leave it for life.  They got the service manager and he drove it with me in the car.  He told me that he would contact their area rep and he would come sometime later in the month (August) and we would all go out for a drive, but that his opinion is the 'definitive' opinion.  In other words, he would come out and tell me they cannot replicate it.  So August has come and gone.  My husband called the service manager three times and has not had the courtesy of a return call.  So we have been doing research.  This CVT engine has been a real problem for Nissan.  There is a class action suit for the earlier version CVT .  I think they may have changed some part of the CVT, but I am now deathly afraid to put my children in this car.  Did I mention I have 65K miles...yes, I drive a lot and we travel.  There is a rumor the new 2018 will have a different transmission.  I have been reading online how Nissan North America is not at all helpful.  As I said, love the car, but I cannot safely live with this transmission.  If I hear 'replicate' one more time, I will scream.  They use it for everything.  I had a noise in the fan area for ac/heat.  Can't replicate.  MY HUSBAND took it in THE NEXT WEEK, and all of a sudden, there was a new something needed.  My service advisor told me that Nissan doesn't care about customers, they just want to make a profit.  How about that?",2
858, on 03/08/17 06:56 AM (PST),STJHouston ,2015 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Infinite a GREAT surprise and hidden gem.," For the past 15 years, I've been in the German Luxury lines of BMW and Mercedes exclusively.  I never wanted to own a Japanese car, even the so called luxury brands.  I must say I was a snob in that regard.  THis go round I was looking to get a 7 passenger car and wanted to spend less on my monthly lease.  I knew that I would have to go outside my typical manufacturers to the dark side and venture into the Japanese lines.  I decided I'd look at everything to make the best decision.  We started with the Highlander, which would have been good but it wasn't luxury enough for me.  Then we went to Lexus and the GX is more like a truck and the third row was right against the back with ZERO cargo room.  It was also hard to get into the back, very small opening to climb into the back.  Next was Infiniti.  Wow, was I surprised.  Who knew that I could get it all with an Infiniti!!  I'm in love!!  IT has everything I could ask for.  The luxury, the technology, the best third row option in this sized vehicle. IT's not that big to drive or park!  I'm in love with my car which is why I wanted to post this for anyone looking at 3 row cars.  This is better than the Acura overall. I liked the Acura too but decided that I liked the interior and exterior much better than the MDX but the MDX was a close second.  I also drove the Tahoe and it just felt blah in the area of luxury plus it's too big for my needs.  The QX60 is perfect if you have the need to occassionally take 7 people and the extra people that we take are usually college kids that are still skinny to fit in the back very comfortably.  It's a great car and we had a super easy experience at the dealership too.  Highly recommend Infiniti!!!",5

I test drove both for about 2 hours in multiple visits and finally decided on QX60.Things I did not like in Acura MDX:- Third row seating is not as comfortable as QX60- The 9-speed transmission is an overkill - it shifts really hard in the traffic and kind of overkill- The interior felt not as luxury as QX60Things I like about QX60- Very comfortable ride, sports mode for the time when you want to a bit more acceleration and road feel- Comfortable third row seating- Luxurious interior - Less price for the comparable options on MDX- 360 degree camera with birds eye view is really goodThings I wished worked better- the back wiper is not rain sensing- lots of things in the navigation and phone controls cannot be operated when car is in motion even by the front passenger - the thigh support is less than Odyssey and MDX- MPG is not that great, I get about 17.5-18.0 with premium fuel",5

These range from minivans to Jags, Lexus and Mercedes. The QX60 is bar far the worst vehicle we have ever owned.  Our VW Routan minivan, which we traded for this car,  was much more comfortable. The primary issue is the seating.  While the materials used is satisfactory, the seating is incredibly uncomfortable, particularly on the front passenger seat.  Anyone with even very mild back issues will be unable to ride in the car for any length of time.  The problem is that test driving it will not allow you to realize the problem.  After about forty minutes of driving, however, the problem is more than noticeable.  In addition, the rear camera is the worst I have ever seen in any car.  It does not provide a clear image.   At night, the image is bright and incomprehensible.  The only real warning when using the rear camera is the sensor, which does work adequately.  In addition, there are multiple rattle is the dash which the dealer has yet to eliminate, which adds to the frustration. Perhaps I have been spoiled by other upper end cars, but this car falls woefully short of what it is portrayed to be. I think many are impressed because of the badge. I now realize the real reason Infiniti gives such a good deal on this car.  Ours has only 5,500 miles and we are trying to get out of it, even though we know we will take a financial hit. If you have an urge to buy this car, conquer it.  Buy an Acura MDX or Audi Q7 instead.  Even an Acadia or Explorer are far superior vehicles. So, too, probably, are Hyundais or Kias.",1

This is the perfect travel vehicle...very comfortable on our frequent 720 mile round trips to our second home.  We really love this car after an accident on the interstate yesterday with an 18 wheeler.  The tractor trailer lost control when the driver locked his brakes and he slid sideways into us at 60 MPH.  My husband said the Infiniti was steady, rock solid and he was able to maintain control until we got away from the tractor trailer,and come to a safe stop.  The whole right side of the QX60 will need to be replaced, but we are all OK.  Love my QX60!",5

869, on 08/10/15 10:46 AM (PDT),mkgcmc ,2015 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Upscale Family Hauler for the Minivan-Averse," Three years ago, my wife and I were looking for a premium/luxury three-row crossover to help avoid the minivan stigma. We cross-shopped the QX60 and the Acura MDX heavily, but in the end, the Infiniti was more family-friendly, felt more upscale for the price, and had a far better dealer experience. As we approach the end of our lease, our opinion hasn't changed much. The QX60 is still a nice, upscale, family-friendly vehicle, and a great value when you consider real-world selling prices. Being able to tilt the second row with a car seat attached to get to the third row is invaluable for anyone with three children in car seats - I'm shocked that it's still the only luxury crossover on the market with this feature. That said, the infotainment and overall interior are definitely looking dated - Infiniti made some updates to both in 2017, but nothing has changed significantly. We still mostly have the M interior from a decade ago. We still have ugly, yellow, halogen interior lighting on a $50,000 luxury vehicle. We still have Nissan buttons everywhere. For those cross-shopping something like the XC90 or even the CX-9, the interior may come off as a bit of a hard sell during a test drive.It's only when you take the QX60 on a long drive with multiple kids in the car that you can appreciate how quiet and comfortable the interior is, especially on the highway. It's why we still have the QX60 our our short list for our next crossover - and that really says it all.Pros:- Extremely quiet and smooth, particularly on highways- Leases much better than its MSRP suggests- Second row can move for third row access even with a child seat installed- Excellent third row that is usable by adults (at least for short trips)- Cost to own/lease should be low - you can use Nissan dealers for scheduled maintenance at a lower priceCons:- Dated interior design and infotainment system- City/mixed gas mileage isn't great - we never got close to the EPA average (this has been improved in the 2017 refresh)- Headlights are weak (this has not changed in the refreshes, even though they look better)- Slightly more jarring than expected on potholes given the class of vehicle- Nissan-esque packaging of options (a hands-free liftgate requires a $7,500 package? Come on...)",4

I thought I'd miss the creature comforts of a minivan, such as its sliding doors and the full 3 rows. But, I'm enjoying the driving experience in our new 2015 QX60 far more.  This crossover is functional, has a plethora of safety equipment and gives you at least a taste of the Infiniti driving experience (we have a 96 I 30 that still runs like very well).The interior is very functional, but practical and is pretty intuitive. Despite the clamping about the CVT transmission, ours has been pretty smooth so far. I LOVE all of the safety features and technology and I am already spoiled to the multi view cameras.  All in all, I am pleased with the vehicle. It offers good quality for the cost and my minivan is slowly but surely becoming a find but distant memory. My line gripe is gas mileage. The QX69 is a bit thirstier than the Odyssey.",5

Shopped comp. hard. XC90 is loud, has lousy suspension and you cannot put feet back in typical 'squat' position because of a wall that gets in way. MDX has an amazing website for an amazingly complex vehicle. They can keep it. No 360 monitor. Lexus has cream suspension but you sit up too high. And style? Any? Can't adjust display brightness?Mercedes is cream, but small and rocks you back and forth side to side. Some others have reliability issues. This car does not. Power-train warr. is 7yr. 72K. Michelins. Hood does not go down to grill like all competitors. Gorgeous hood.  This car is the one and only. You can't beat this. Style, comfort, excellent performance.

We are and have been Honda/Acura owners and currently own a Ridgeline and love it, but decided to venture out and go with the QX60. The MDX didn't feel as roomy and the two screens and the touch features were overkill for us. The third row seating in the QX60 felt roomier too. I like the 360 degree camera, blind spot warning system, driver seat memory and  bluetooth connectivity - incoming phone calls are very clear! The interior combination of leather, wood and brushed metal accents are spot on. However, it has been less than a month, so perhaps a bit too soon to rate it but, so far, we have absolutely no regret and simply love it!",5

In some ways, it's almost like a self driving car. It alerts you when you get too close to someone, and the auto braking is amazing. There is no excuse if I ever rear-end someone! The parking assist with the birds eye view is fantastic. Lots of space in the third row for passengers, but not much cargo space when the seats are full. The gas mileage is not what I expected - fluctuates so far (under 1000 miles on the car) between about 18-22. Right now it says 20.3 average; which is a long way from the 26 advertised. I am driving in the regular mode, I felt the Eco mode, where you can probably get 26 mpg, was very sluggish. I was committed to buying a hybrid and there are very few that seat 7. This was my favorite by far, and I'm very happy with my purchase.",5

879, on 06/13/18 12:58 PM (PDT),Nivcogn ,2018 INFINITI QX60 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),Daily Car for a Growing Family," We needed a bigger car for our growing family.  The Q5 can only fit 2 baby car seats in the back.  We looked at Yukon XL and Expedition, but realized that it is not a great car for daily drive since it is too big.  Those cars are great for long road trip and can be rented at any time.  Audi Q7 is a nice car but just way too expensive.  Our choices came down to VW Atlas, Infiniti QX60, and Honda Pilot.  What is nice about the Atlas and QX60 is the ability to get to the back seats without having to remove the baby car seats.  The exterior styling is what sold the QX60 to my wife even through the Atlas has a nice panoramic sunroof similar to Audi's (QX60's is lacking...not as grand/nice).  The other reason to go with QX60 is Infiniti's lease; they give really affordable leases that I don't think anyone can match.  For zero down (only first payment of $479), we drove away in a 2018 Infiniti QX60 AWD Premium Plus that has remote start and heated steering wheel.  Our lease is for 39 months with 12k miles/year.  I don't think we could even lease a Q5 for that price.  The ride and handling is not as nice as our Audis; however, it is pretty good.  We are not fond of the CVT and don't really care since it is a lease.  Overall, it is a great choice for our family.  Great car with most of the things we wanted at a relatively affordable pricing.",3

It's smooth and quiet around town and on the highway.  Front seats are comfortable and supportive.  The CVT transmission works very well -- none of the annoying hunting for the proper gear, or downshifting one or two gears when all you want to do is go just a little faster.  And it works like it has 7 discrete gears when in manual mode.  Fuel mileage is beyond our expectations at 21 mpg in the suburbs with some freeway, and 24-26 mpg on highway trips, even at 75-80 mph.  Things we don't like: Small and somewhat dim numbers and letters on the trip info display between the speedometer and tach.

Good take off from a stand still but runs out of steam after 75mph. Transmission shifts good but could use the 2009 7 speed transmission.

So much fun to drive you just dont want to get out. Powerful and smooth acceleration at all speeds. All controls are easy to operate. Im 64 & fit very well in terms of head and leg room.  The M45 was the right combination of power, ride quality and technology goodies for me. The Bose sound system is wonderful. The M45 sport was just too stiff a ride for me. The M35 does not have the same power, only 1 MPG difference anyway. I bought the Infiniti extended warranty (bumper to bumper) till 100k miles or 2014. Infinity also has the best car loaner program.

The Tech package of the M is awesome.  Love the 3D GPS, voice activated controls, rear backup camera, A/C control seats (could be better), and overall looks.  But from the very first oil change, have noticed using oil; not leaking, not smoking, but I have added from 1 to 2 quarts between changes.  Also, moonroof leaks in any car wash, have had to have the AC serviced each year.  Heated and cooled seats do not compare to the BMW. Ride is noisy, low-profile tires look great, but makes bumpy ride.  If battery dies, no way to open the trunk (for jumper cables).",4.125

The initial test drive with M35 wasn't quite satisfying, so I decided to test out the M45. The V8 on the 45 version has a great compromise on the bulkiness of the sedan. The car takes off like a rocket. The thrill on speed is just one of the best features, the stability is probably the second biggest accomplishment for this car. Body roll is minimal when serving through the lanes in high speed on the freeway. The manual shifting is precise and quick.

The car runs fantastic with every possible feature, DVD, Bluetooth, navigation with voice recognition, etc.  However, the roads here in New England make sense for stronger sport rims as they are built too soft and have twice caused major cracking to the wheels which had to be replaced.

The Infiniti M45 Sport has exceeded all my expectations. My only complaints would be the poor fuel mileage (what did I expect in a 335 hp hot rod?), perceived need for a six-speed transmission, and the non-effective high-beam headlights. But these complaints would not deter me from buying this car all over again. I probably should have sprung for the Bose 5.1 surround-sound system, but the regular Bose system is certainly no slouch.

This car handles and drives better than the competing 5 series models I drove and leaves most luxury sedans in the dust. It wasn't the value that drove me to buy this car (it is way cheaper than the beamer) but the overall package.  Even the much more expensive BMW 550 doesn't deliver the luxury this car delivers, and I prefer the interior of this car.

Major deciding points:  M45 was priced similarly to the 335xi, but had more power, better features, and much better interior than any of the BMWs.  If I were driving in Europe, I would buy the BMW, but in the US, the M45 Sport is a better package and it is cheaper!!  By the way, the 328xi and 530xi do not even compete with the M35, let alone the M45.  If you are seriously considering any version of the 2007 328 or 2008 530, do yourself a favor and compare it to the M35/45. Infiniti clearly beats these cars!",5

However if you drive this car on the highway at night, you need to know that the design of the headlights is faulty.  The high beams are focused so high that they do not illuminate the road in front of the car at all.  There is a single adjust for both high and low beam lights so if you take your car to the dealer they will misalign the low beam focus if you complain of the faulty high beams.

Thankfully the 4 wheel discs slow with authority.  In winter or slick conditions it's smart to be gentle on the throttle and I had no worries when winter tires are swapped in. Having never been stuck in Minnesota winters is a tribute to the predictable nature of the chassis and good driving skills. The biggest drawback is fuel economy, followed by rear seat leg room.

The seats are sports car seats, not plushy cushy seats.  The suspension isn't soft or cushy either but let me tell you, hang onto your hat when you give it the gas!!  You don't really need to slow down much to take a corner.  There just isn't any body roll and this car can deliver.  I grew up with the 1960's muscle cars and everything that went with it.  I am female and a great grandmother, but I do enjoy driving in a sporty manner.  Since I live in So Cal, I can drive the freeways with ""authority"".   My M45 is 15 years old now and has 137K miles on it.  Have NEVER had a repair on this car.  Just the normal maintenance stuff.  Now that it is older, there are more road noises that I hear and my CD player quit working but what would one expect at this age?   The M45 doesn't like our dirt roads much and it doesn't absorb the stutter bumps very well but it does love a mountain road and a remote road where you can loosen up the reins and let her run.  When you have it in the manual mode, it seems to lunge forward and you need to be prepared for that at a stop sign.  Alot of people think the manual mode is worthless, but they don't let it wind out enough.  Honestly, you need to have this car for a while  and really learn how to drive it.   In the years that I have had the M45, I have seen only 2 others like it.  When I have taken to get tires or an oil change, the comments you hear are ""This sure is a nice car and you don't see M's on the road""  It is a very capable car especially for its weight but that is something I like because you feel like the car is solid and ""on the road"" not ""floating above it"".    If you are looking for a strictly luxury car, then you probably won't think it's all that but if you want a combination of luxury and high performance, this is the one for you.  The instrument panel some people find confusing but all you need to do is read your owners manual and you will see how easy it really is.  There are multi-function controls so you need just to touch the component you wish to control and then look at the buttons numbered 1-6 and push the one that is appropriate.

Our air bag light has been on since a hair over 50K mi.  The warranty is good up to 7yr/70K, but they wouldn't fix it.  The oil issue stinks.  Due to the bad service, I won't buy again.",4.125

If it dies the dealer is either to fix it or lower the price. Nissan speaks for itself. It even has a low rumble RRRR. The tires are 18/low profile so expect to pay more. People shouldn't compare this to a sports car because it's on the same lines as a GS.  I owned a 97 Camaro SS.  Fast but it's a luxury sport.  Classy car.

Road noise level is also on extreme side, I sometimes think my windows are open but they aren't.Another issue is - no parking sensors in the middle of the car, so if something is exactly at the center you will not get any warnings, and if you video cams are out after a heavy rain (they are covered with water so useless) it's a real safety issue.",3.375

The seats were extremely comfortable. I truly loved and looked forward to driving it. Even when I had it I always said how could Infiniti create such a perfect car. The sticker new was 49k and after two years when my lease was up the buy price thy gave me was $41k, so I thought I would find one cheaper used but they took so long to go down in value! They really held their resale value well. After the FX i bought a 745i which i hated and sold, then leased a Z4 3.0si which I enjoyed, and bought my dream car which I will be keeping a 95 Hellrot 840ci. But out of all of the cars I've ever driven and owned I have never been happier driving my 06 FX35. I recently test drove a 2016 QX70, while it was nice it still wasnt the same.

LOVE the chrome wheels as well as the red color (which they stop making in 2004).  Its an eyecatcher!  The only problems are the squeaker brakes and a noise when I turn the car to  left.  Gas mileage isn't the greatest either.  The seats also tend to split from the heat.  Other than that the car was awesome to own and fun to drive!  Unfortunately my lease is up and I opted to buy another SUV instead of leasing a 2009 FX.  But I have SUPER great memories and I will hate to see this car go!!!!

1266, on 07/29/16 22:51 PM (PDT),Driving Enthusiast ,2010 INFINITI FX35 SUV 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 7A),Impressive All Season Sportscar," I would call the FX35 an All Season Sportscar (I wonder why Infiniti didn't call it that...). You don't buy this car because you need room or utility. You buy this because you want a sports car that can be driven year round and in adverse conditions.First of all, the styling. While it might not be for everyone, I don't think anyone can argue it's bland. It is a striking design, and it is rare enough on the road that they really stand out. Kudos to Infiniti for rolling out a production car that actually looks like its concept sibling.Now onto performance, what this All Season Sportscar really excel at. I've had the pleasure of taking a high performance driving course with this car, and the theme of the day was ""Underestimated"". The brakes may look small next to the 20"" wheels, but they are surprisingly powerful and resilient. After a day at the track, the factory brakes were still going strong. And did I mention how strongly the car pulls and how good it sounds doing it? It's almost as if it's bending the laws of physics to do it. Handling is superb as well - it never once felt like I was driving tall heavy SUV through the slaloms and the avoidance maneuvers. The only thing that gave it away was the ride height - you won't be fooled into thinking you are in a Miata. The suspension is stiff enough through corners that the vehicle never feels ""soft"", yet for everyday commute it absorbs imperfections nicely. The car is much more capable within its performance envelope than any of us that day gave it credit for. However that doesn't mean you should get reckless behind it though - once you kick past the envelope and the laws of physics kick in, you're in the next zip code over before the 4200lb+ All Season Sportscar comes to a complete stop. Utility, storage volume in particular, is probably the Achilles' heel of the FX35. The spare tire under the rear cargo area bumps up the floor considerably. Couple that with the rakish coupe roofline, you have a low and wide opening that makes it next to impossible to load crates. The rear seats do fold down nicely, and the roof is considerably higher above the rear seats if you want to play some back seat tetris with your cargo. On a plus side though, because the roof is rakish and the hinge of the rear hatch is located so far forward, you can back the vehicle into a garage, and the hatch can still open even with only about a foot of space to the wall. Try doing that with other SUVs.In terms of utility off road, it does quite well light offroading, such as snow, mud, gravel or inclement weather conditions. With a good set of winter tires, the vehicle can handle snow covered mountain forest service roads without any drama (I have AWD). The interior is also a very welcoming and cozy space. The ambient lighting in the door handles is a very elegant touch, particularly if you have the maple accents. There are actually footwell accent lights too, but they are so dim (unless you swap them to LEDs) that they are not visible other than in the darkest of nights. The seats are very comfortable and well supported - no fatigue or butt cramps after long drives what-so-ever. Surfaces you are often in contact with are covered with soft leather material that just makes the whole cabin very luxurious-feeling. The backseat can recline to a very comfortable angle.The technology in the vehicle also leaves very little to be desired. I do not have the adaptive cruise control or lane departure warning systems, so I can't speak to those. The surround view camera though is absolutely brilliant. I call it ""cheat mode"", because it allows you to park the car in tight spaces with such confidence and ease that you'll passengers will be screaming ""Aww that's not fair!"". The Bose audio system is crisp, and if you're an avid CD listener you'll be happy to know the car will happily gobble up all the tracks on your CD and store them on its harddrive, so you never have to carry a stack of CDs with you. The navigation is also well voiced. Voice recognition is fast, although it can't take in a whole chunk of address at a time (i.e. you got to say the house number, wait, street address, wait, city, wait, etc). Unlike those OCD German car designs, the screen is a touchscreen, and the recessed setup makes it easily legible even in bright conditions. Another interior feature (somewhat useless) I really like is when you first get behind the wheels and turn the vehicle on (the push start button is supposed to pulse like the beating heart by the way), the steering column with lower and move towards you while the seat slides forward to your set seating position. The sequence is reversed when you get out of the vehicle. Really makes it feel like you're getting behind a X-Wing or something. Overall, I can't be happier with this All Season Sportscar. After about two years, it still brings a smile to my face every time I get behind the wheels, and I still catch myself admiring its lines.",5

Please take the time to read all of the consumer reviews at Edmunds and at various Infiniti web forums.The transmission up shifts too quickly so in essence you are in 7 gear by 38 MPH, thus getting up to speed (downshifting) in a passing situation is trying and thus a safety issue in my humble opinion.I am not please with this vehicle and it will be scrapped very soon.

I was also concerned with going from our amazingly powerful FX45's V8 to the 35's V6 but I have to say - this is noticeably quicker.  I didn't necessarily like the ride of the 45 they've apparently worked out all of that with the redesign because this thing rides very comfortably.

The FX35 beat the Audi Q5 due to the price, larger size, better reliability, & outside look. The FX35 has a bold outside look and you will either love or hate it. However, I can testify that the car is a head turner. You will also fall in love with the interior.

In my honest opinion, this has been one of the BEST vehicles we have ever owned over the last 35 months (4 months to go on the lease)! My wife does NOT want to give the FX35 back. She says everyday, she looks forward to driving it. The FX35 has NEVER been in the shop, runs/drives like new to this day. Even with the 20""wheel/tires the ride is sporty, but not harsh. MPG is usually right at 19 (mix) and 25hwy. Great SUV!",5

It drove a little erratic but that was due to the Goodyear Eagle RS-As which were replaced within a month.  Those tires were terrible; I replaced them with Yokohama Paradas and it is a totally different drive.  Love the sound, the handling, the experience.  Not for everyone as it is really suited for four.  Overall, love it as it is the best of all worlds.",4.75

The trim around the windows has started to fade after 2 years & the vinyl part of the seat (the sides) are starting to crack on both front seats. The wheels are also discoloring; dealer says its something we applied (the car wash I've used for 10 years changed their products all of a sudden? really?!!!) So other than those minor & annoying issues, this is a fantastic vehicle. I am concerned w/ long-term build quality. Our brand- new looking 97 Toyota Land Cruiser was chiseled out of granite, so not sure Ive got a balanced view (you should only return to the dealer for breaks, oil & to buy a new one after 300k miles).",4.625

When it came down to it, there wasn't anything else out there that (IMO) topped the FX35.  The FX just sticks to the ground. You don't turn a corner, you THINK the car around the corner. Steering is tight and 6cyl engine is powerful.  Can't imagine why anyone would want a FX45?  A little heavy on gas. Though premium is recommended, no problem on regular.

The engine is smooth and torquey, my gas mileage in Houston's freeway traffic has averaged 21.8 mpg, surprisingly. I love the Autumn Copper color for this vehicle. It seems to bring out all the lines and compound curves this vehicle has to offer.

I was thoroughly pleased with my G35, but have to say the FX35 has exceeded my expectations.  I will continue to purchase Infiniti mainly because of the excellent styling and reliability I have found in both vehicles.  The look and styling of the FX35 is in a class of it's own.

The coupe with 15k miles felt like it had 80k on the odometer.  The FX is fantastic.  I missed an SUV, and this car feels just like a (brand-new) heavier G35.  It even handles better IMO.  Whereas my coupe lost its composure over anything but the smoothest roads, the FX retains it on rough pavement.  The sport package is a must-have for its looks alone.  Not much to differentiate it from an FX45 except the chrome surrounding the side windows on the 45.  Although to me the ride feels smooth coming from a sport packaged G35, others may find it harsh with the sport package.  I can easily tear up an exit ramp in this car, no complaints!",4.75

Can't call it a car or an SUV, it is truly a crossover. A lot more sport than utility. Has some areas where there is obvious form over function (e.g. analog clock and steering wheel controls). The clock is cool, but there's a digital one in the display so it isn't functional. The steering wheel controls are not ergonomically placed for operation while driving; I've adapted. The ride can be harsh on rough pavement, more so with the sport package, but the FX handles the bumps with confidence and grace. It stays planted on the road.

You either like or hate the looks. Its that simple. The ride,handling and feel are superior to any crossover out there. From past experience the reliability should be great.

In short, this car was definitely ahead of its time when it came out. The exterior design, while polarizing when first released, has held up to the test of time. I still get frequent compliments on the vehicle and when I tell them it's 8 years old they're in disbelief. The around view camera is a feature that makes it easy to maneuver into any spot that can fit the dimensions of the vehicle. The engine still runs strong with zero oil burn, an issue that has plagued this motor in other Infinitis. This car still hauls donkey when floored. The transmission was never great, sometimes it's slow to shift, but it's an issue I've had since brand new so I've learned to adapt to it. The interior has held up well, no bubbles on the dash (parked outside in the sun from 8a-5p at work), leather (maybe it's pleather?) has held up very well and all the interior lighting is still functional. Reliability wise, the engine wouldn't start once but that was due to a dirty intake, now they're cleaned at regular intervals of 15k miles. Other than that, and this being a first year model, I've been very happy with how reliable the vehicle has been.                                                                                                                Couple notes on my vehicle: 1) always and still use synthetic oils at 7.5k intervals, 2) transmission oil, while the manual says forever, always changed at 60k miles 3) differential oils changed at 60k intervals as well 4) my vehicle is black with a factory aero kit, never took it to a car wash always self washed or detailed so the paint still looks great. 5)I have an Invidia cat-back exhaust installed (still makes me smile when I floor it through tunnels).  I can only hope that my next car can hold up as well as this in the performance, design, and maintenance departments.

I have really enjoyed it but my wife doesn't want in it.  Throttle and brake responses are a little touchy, the ride can be bad on bad roads but is normally very compliant.  Drivers position, height and controls are very comfortable and well placed.  Cabin is snug for a SUV but near perfect for the Sport SUV it was designed to be.  Not overly impressive in any road comparisons to a car, yet if feels very sporty in every way and is very enjoyable to drive if you need a SUV but want a sports car.  Fast or slow I average 20 mpg and have had no problems other than a dealership that seems to think they are the only ones in town.  Cool Ride!",4.375

Only ""DS"" (Drive Sport) mode returns control to the driver and allows you to get around horrible gear ratios and indecisiveness of the computer as to what gear the car needs.  Also, brakes are VERY soft - takes longer to stop and gas mileage is mediocre.  No tranny change 2010 so if you consider buying you're warned.",3.875

While I enjoy the unique exterior style of the new SUV (as well as some of the gadgets) I must admit that the 7 speed transmission drive train leaves me speechless... in a bad way. The transmission wants to shift into high gear (7th?) at road speeds of 25mph. Even in DS mode it is not appreciably different. And if you have to climb any degree of incline at 25mph... wow... the vehicle labors vigorously. There is no downshift without pressing the accelerator halfway to the floorboard; at which point the RPM goes to 5k and the vehicle lungs forward.

I've been very happy with our purchase, my partner somewhat less so.  The car is great fun to drive.  The exterior takes a bit of getting used to, but the interior is class all the way.  There were two significant issues.  The first is rotten rear visibility - either you get used to relying heavily on the rear view and birds-eye cameras or you don't.  The second was the transmission.  It tended to search for the right gear, refuse to change quickly when floored, and just shift roughly.

Space in the front seats is limited as well, with none of the little cubby holes and slots I am used to seeing in well designed cars.  The ride is one word - punishing.

I like the improved interior and the new look, but the ride is still hard. My main problem is the 7-speed transmission. The car only accelerates smoothly when rapidly accelerating. Accelerating from about 25 mph or 45 mph is awful. It never seems to know what to shift in too. Its a nightmare when driving in traffic because it keeps downshifting and then it lags when it should up shift.

1395, on 03/20/18 04:44 AM (PDT),Richard Beckett ,2005 INFINITI FX35 SUV AWD 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 5A),Until I Die," I watched, with envy, those who drove in the Infinity FX35 since 2003.  Then in August of 2005 I drove past a dealership and saw a 2005 FX35 in a pearl white metallic with a wheat colored interior and decided if I could sit in the drivers seat safely, I would become the source of other peoples envy.  I have a back problem that requires exactly the right combinations to exist while getting in, getting out and of course sitting.  It begins with the height of the seat from the ground.  FX35 perfect. Next, the seat has to power recline and must offer power adjustable  lumbar support.  FX35, perfect.  Then, the seat has to be firm.  FX35, perfect.  Finally, power tilt/telescopic searing must accommodate my need to severely recline the seat back.  FX35, perfect.  I spent an hour and a half just sitting, then getting out, then getting back in, then sitting.  after an hour, the salesman came out and asked if there was a problem, I answered ""not yet"".  Half an hour later, salesman came out again and asked if I wanted to take the car for a drive.  I said ""It's not that important"".  He went silent for a moment, then smiled and said ""Take it for a drive"".  I said ""Fine, I will"".  Half an hour later I returned.  The salesman said nothing, he just smiled knowingly as did I.  I had come to understand what an incredible vehicle this was.  Beyond it's incredible, exciting styling, there was the growl of the motor, the ride, the firm, planted to the pavement handling and that feeling of pride as I left the dealership and walked toward the car I had coveted for 2 years, with keys in my hand and the legal right to drive away.  I have replaced the battery and tires, changed the oil (synthetic) and filter as required without incident for 12 and a half years.  Head lights were replaced due to a factory recall (no cost to me).  I have the car detailed every spring for the last 8 years.  To this day, when I approach my FX35, I get the same knowing smile on my face that I shared with the salesman and when I park it and walk away, I always turn around for one more look.  When crossing paths with other FX35 owners at stoplights or in a parking lot, I again exchange that knowing smile with others who own this rare source of pride and performance.  Hard for some to understand maybe, but you either get it, or you don't.  It was my plan to drive my FX35 until Infinity offered an FX styled vehicle with full electric drive train.  To my horror, Infinity announced that 2018 would be the last year they would manufacture the FX35.  They have since announced their intention to offer an electric model by 2022 - which effectively means by 2025, 7 years from now.  I'm 75 years old so I could be [non-permissible content removed] out of luck by then (dead).  Since I only drive 3,500 miles per year, I guess I'll probably drive my FX35 ""Until I Die"".  It's currently remains irreplaceable.  I don't have navigation or Bluetooth, but I have a smart phone I can talk to and will talk back, so I'm good.  My one and only small complaint is the relatively poor gas mileage (13MPG in town - 24MPG on the hi-way), but that's a price I am eagerly willing to pay.  Damn, that car is beautiful.",5

A few months ago we were looking to replace my wife's Honda Civic Hybrid with something bigger and safer. My first thought, VW Touareg then it went Cayenne, XC90, and even Mazda CX-7 (before I found out about its turbo woes). These were all nice but we couldn't find the right combination.  Touareg too problematic, Cayenne I'd cry with every scratch, XC90 not sporty, and CX-7 huge potential repair. Then doing other work I came across this fx35. Surprisingly the backseat fit my 6'2 frame better than any of the other cars. There was actually decent trunk space, which I thought was impossible with its sexy lines. The cockpit made me feel more like I'm in a sports car rather than a SUV. Steering is heavily weighted like I'm in a G35 coupe. I loved it! The suspension had no secondary movement, it was extremely tight with 147,000 mile. I think this is an incredible vehicle.

I've left several friends breathless when jumping on the throttle. They didn't expect such performance... especially those with the Lexus RX series vehicles. Everything about the vehicle is great. Styling, handling, build quality, comfort, intelligent cruise control, too many other things to identify. I've had SUV's, BMW's, probably more than 30 different vehicles.

This is our first Infiniti and it won't be our last.  What also makes it such a good vehicle is the dealers who were willing to work with us.  Dealers in five different cities were helpful and persuasive.  Ultimately we purchased the vehicle from a city about 100 miles away from our home.  It was well worth the salesman's extra ""touches"" that he put into the car and how he closed the deal. ",4.375

CD player has become jammed, but mostly use ipod and satellite radio.  Have only used regular fuel, but acceleration has been solid.

We're on our 3rd set of tires and have 81k mi on the car and have switched from the stock 20"" Goodyear RSAs to BFG KDWs.

The ride is harsh, but what do you expect from the sport package?  In my opinion chrome trim looks better than more expensive wood in other cars.  The center arm rest in the 2003 model seems cheap, flimsy and out of place in such a nice car. Also, the similar Murano has more trays and cubbies for your gear.

I was immediately impressed. The vehicle has the tight and substantial feel very similar to the Porsche. The front fenders even have the same sloping bulge as viewed from the drivers seat. You truly have the feeling that you are in a serious performer, and it doesn't disappoint on the road. If you like driving excitement, this one delivers. Again, I've owned many performance vehicles and the FX holds its own among them.",5

My first FX 35 was a 2005 model with sport and touring packages. I found this to be the most comfortable, fun, and stylish car I've ever had and I've owned several luxury and sports cars. I test drove many crossovers and SUVs and felt the most comfortable being a big guy when I climbed back into my 2005 FX 35. If you want a stylish and fun car to drive check out the FX35.",5

I always thought that the mileage would be too poor for me to consider.  Love a sporty driver that is practical - which defines an FX.  Wanted something bigger than my 07 VW-GTI.  Drove the BMW X6- nice but small, heavy, overpriced and lacks the fun to drive factor Love the FXs comfort, size, quality, sporty drive, high end finishes, feel of the wheel and those seats.  Big side mirrors enhance side visibility - with backup camera, I can park easily.  Haven't been this thrilled with a car since I bought my 92 Legend couple new.

I was most worried about the visibility b/c I read the vehicle has a lot of blind spots, turns out the mirrors are pretty good about compensating. My one main issue is a personal one - I am 5'5"" and having a hard time getting the right fit in the vehicle - I end up with knees dangerously close to dash in order to reach the pedals and  see well through the windshield at the same time. If I move the seat lower, the seatbelt is on my neck, if I move it farther back, I can't reach the gas pedal as well. I think it would be hard to find a good comfort level for shorties.",4.25

The FX has pep, performance, looks, handling,and a nice balance between fun and function. With the high gas prices I've been using regular and don't notice any change in performance. I get 19 mpg in city/highway driving. The vehicle is a 'headturner' since I don't see a lot where I live. The 6 cylinder is lively with a smooth 5 speed auto tranny. Styling is unique and built with quality in Japan. It is responsive whether driving aggressively or just as a normal commuter. You don't need a lot of options.

If the cruise is on and you are in a bend it will pick up cars in other lanes and stomp the brakes for you so you really have to watch where you have the cruise on. Bluetooth phone is garbage. Also the black chrome grill is all peeling off and Infiniti says they will change it once as ""good faith"" but it's my fault and not a supplier defect.",4.125

The interior is wonderfully simple, the seats are very comfortable, the stereo is loud, and the engine really sounds sweet.

The FX handles like a dream. Steering is precise and provides excellent feedback. I like the 350Z's smaller thick leather steering wheel in the FX. The interior quality has improved drastically from the early 2003-2005 models. Plastic and leather are MUCH softer. I have driven the GX, RX, X5, XC90, ML, GL and Cayenne.

I traded in a BMW 745i and as great as that car was, there is a lot to love about this car! Sporty, fun to drive, logical controls, very comfortable seats (I'm 6'5 and that is always a concern), and usable options instead of gadgets just to have gadgets! I would say luxurious as well.

By far a better value - great handling especially in windy road conditions - tons of standard features - options are reasonably priced relative to competition.  Driving comfort is second to none.  Back up camera is great feature as there is a blind spot in changing lanes looking out the rear sides.  Car is quieter than anticipated - on screen displays easy to use and make sense.  Best of all - can fit 3 sets of golf clubs in rear much like the RX - so many SUVs today cannot fit golf clubs in the rear compartment without putting the seats down. ",4.5

Coming from a BMW 3-series coupe and my wife from a Subaru WRX turbo wagon, the FX handled turns like it was on rails.  My brother has the X5 and it's on par with it.  The 3.5 engine is adequate but if you want a rocket get the 45 instead.  Fit and finish the vehicle is perfect.  All the amenities for the price makes it all worth it.  The comment by the editors about the interior being an elite Nissan, I agree somewhat but it's definitely more appealing than my BMW. Engine is smooth.  Suspension and handling are stiff enuff, so the Sport Susp. would be unnecessary IMO. You won't be disappointed with this SUV. Pull the trigger!",4.875

Nothing on the market can compare with the comfort and performance along with the luxury at this price. I purchased the FX35 in early September and have not regretted it one day.

It has ample room for cargo and believe it or not people have asked me about it and commented how sleek it looks.  All this makes me feel that I did the right move.

Some reviews complain about the limited storage space but we find it more than adequate for most applications.  Some don't like the exhaust sound which we enjoy but if it bothers you, simply turn up the fabulous Bose sound system.  We were concerned about possible gas mileage issues but are getting almost 24 mpg on highway and close to 20 mpg in town.

Overall a very fun car to have and drive, wonderful comfort, great sound system, great off-road. There is one very important limitation - bad fuel economy, about 12-16 MPG. Which means it is not for a lots of freeway driving, but rather for short commutes, small towns and off-road (which is excellent!) Some reliability issues - non specific, but after 100K miles, some small and not small parts tend to go out.  Off-road as good as it gets.

This truck is great on the highway, safe in the snow and good offroad (think skid plates and real 4wd). The important difference from the Pathfinder is the Nissan Skyline transmission and extras.

For the heck of it, I started to poke around looking at the Infiniti counter part (the Q) as I always thought they were really sharp looking. Ended up finding a low mileage 02, went to look at it, and it came home with me. That vintage pathfinder (01-04) was great (by far the best years they made), and the Q takes all that is great from the pathfinder, and steps it up a notch. First, mechanically, our Q (that we still own and is now 17 yrs old, 02 model built and sold in 01) has been nearly flawless mechanically...no, not just mechanically, overall. At 16 yrs old it was just in the need of some exhaust work (still all original) and shocks(despite no bouncing, clunking and tires still wear evenly).  She still rides excellent, and not 1 leak. Other than 1 small item (minor fix to climate control as blower was staying on) it has needed nothing. Really, nothing...and this car is loaded with options, that all still work. Just routine maintenance (oil changes, tires, etc.). Body is still tight (other than the running board supports rusting out - comon on these, but not the end of the world, easy fix - just some tiny rust spots starting now and I don't store it in the garage, and it has been in IL and WI - snow/salt - it's whole life), interior shows little wear (no cracks in leather, etc), and it is still a joy to drive. Plenty of power (240hp V6 also gets decent gas mileage), and timeless looks (still sharper looking than many new models, and not a ton of them on the road). Besides the sharp exterior looks, I believe it still has one of the most attractive and best laid out cabins (the dash, controls, gauges, etc...logical, and premium without being gaudy). Bottom line, I'd by another one if I could find a low mileage example...as anything newer I've looked at in the last 6-7 yrs, isn't an upgrade. Pick one up if you can it, and don't let mileage scare you, the Nissan 3.5L motor is one best out there (have read some reviews of drivetrains that put it in top 5 engines ever mass produced based on reliability, power and efficiency).""",5

Weed ,2001 INFINITI QX4 SUV 4WD 4dr SUV (3.5L 6cyl 4A),Great Value on a Solid Vehicle," I picked up my QX4 last year as a daily driver, a vehicle to park outside in all kinds of weather and not worry about its cosmetics.  It has proven to be reliable after I had a few issues related to age and mileage (181,000 when I bought it) addressed.  These are great vehicles--decent materials, good driving dynamics, and Nissan's bulletproof 3.5L V6--that are available for very little money.  The most serious issue on the QX4 is rust around the front strut towers (the front suspension can collapse if it isn't addressed), and although Infiniti will repair the problem under recall, it's a good idea to see whether the one that you're considering has a strut-tower rust problem before buying it.  It handles well, and the ride is good unless the pavement becomes too uneven, and then it rides, well, like the truck that it is.  Don't expect it to ride like a newer unibody crossover in all situations.  Acceleration is decent, but the engine note makes the vehicle sound as if it is working hard to move.   The brakes are also decent but are not exceptional.  The interior is nice.  Repair costs are reasonable since it is essentially a Nissan Pathfinder underneath the trimmings.  I consider my QX4 one of the nicest and best vehicle purchases that I've ever made.   I wanted a vehicle that could work, be fun to drive, and carry me in comfort: it's delivered on all counts.",5

I love the design of the G35, both inside and out.   The interior is very classy and sleek.  I think the later updates like the G37 lost some of the good looks.  The performance is fun, and though the car feels heavy on the road, it's fun to drive, and the engine sound is great.   It jumps off the line, but the AT shifting isn't the smoothest.  I've been disappointed by the gas mileage, often around 16mpg in the city and 24 on the highway.  With climate change out of control and oil companies controlling our government, I hate giving money to those sociopaths.  My next car will be electric.  You can't rotate the tires, so they don't last super long.  It has some serious blind spots you need to be aware of.   And there are a few problem areas that pop up - control arm bushings go bad, brakes don't last too long and tend to squeal, a bad cam shaft sensor recently made my car die on the freeway, truck release wire snapped, miscellaneous electrical issues, and a lot of random rattles and ticks in the dashboard that can't be located or silenced.  I wouldn't say it's unreliable, but it's not the most reliable car I've owned.  My wife has a bad back and the passenger seat isn't comfortable for her.

The automatic transmission has been reliable, although a little bumpy between 1st and 2nd.  The styling of course is unparalleled.  The interior technology package has worked well - the navigation is spot-on - a little awkward to use with the joystick inputs, but not bad for 2006.  The Bluetooth has never failed though 4 iPhones.  It connects every time, and the voice input is about 95% accurate.  The audio system - CD changer, speakers work perfectly to this day.  Electronic seat warmer and adjusters have not failed.The bad:  Interior components have been cheap.  There have been a few gimpy components.  The removable cupholder - very cheap and the spring broke after about 2 years.  The DC socket has failed about 3-4 times.  Driver window motor had to be replaced after 125k miles.  The tire pressure sensor had to be replaced after 90k miles.  After 80k miles, leather covering the door panels are starting to peel off, and after 120k miles, the leather on the side panels in the back have completely peeled off (and nobody ever sits back there).

This thing handles and performs so well that I was able to keep up with two friends on sport bikes on a twisty back road. I researched cars for months trying to find something that was what I wanted for a reasonable price. I looked in to the Audi, BMW 3 and Lexus IS 250. This car for the price won hands down.  ",4.75

If you typically drive SUVs or Accords you will hate this car. If you are an enthusiast you will never want to get out of it. Some people may have only bought it because of its sexy look and are not people who want a driver's car. It has loud tires, stiff ride and is small. In return you get a car with tight, predictable handling and a sweet exhaust note that will always put a smile on your face. ",4.375

I bought it because I liked the new nissan 6cyl altima coupe. This was just as nice and was a large percent cheaper. I have owned saab, Audi and many other euro cars. For the price this car gives great performance looks and reliability. I put hankook ipike snow tires on it and I have powered through some of the worst new England snow storms this winter with ease. All in all when this car is dead I will most likely get another or go to the G37. I love this car!",4.875

It has the 19"" wheels, sports package, bluetooth, Bose, black leather with aluminum trim interior, and silver exterior.  The day I drove into work it got noticed among all the BMWs, Lexus and Mercedes.  G35s are unique and sleek looking cars, clearly standouts.  After six months of driving in summer, fall and winter weather my rating is AWESOME! Smooth and quick acceleration, throaty exhaust, tight handling.  I look for opportunities to drive this on curvy backroads and passing cars just for the thrill.  Who the heck buys a sports car for gas mileage?

The ride quality is rough and after 15k the rattles start to be heard due to the poor construction of the cabin.  The driver's seat position is very tight leather wears quickly.  The non Bose audio system I have is absolutely horrible. The speakers and dash appointment look like they are straight out of an Altima for years ago.

I drive it every day and have even driven it from Michigan to California and back. It performs flawlessly and is a pleasure to drive every single day. While I think it deserves a more powerfull engine, it does ok with just shy of 300 Bhp. The exhaust note is like music but could be a bit louder. It is also a great platform for upgrades to performance. I am actually having a single turbo installed this week that will boost the hp to over 425 (crankshaft) without having to rebuild the lower end.

I've had instances where I have snaked the car through curvy, mountainous roads at speeds exceeding 65 mph, and have had no issues at all. The thrust this thing can produce can be overwhelming sometimes, say how about a very noticable acceleration when crupsing at 65mph. It feels like there is some stored power in there somewhere at times when you need that extra push!  The only downside to this car is the winter weather driving. Being a rear wheel drive makes it a little rough sometimes. Also, it being a small, light car has some disadv especially with the wind.",4.75

Inside materials and fit/finish is poor (I've actually looked at the nooks of the interior). Placement of storage and cupholders ludicrous.

Over the past year and a half I have noticed issues with build quality. There are many annoying rattles that have developed in the car that you hear over bumps. The sunroof creaks relentlessly and the interior plastics scratch too easily!  Am still very satisfied with the cars performance though I do wish it had stronger pull. The car seems to lose steam in 4th and doesn't pull hard in 5th.  The seats are still comfortable and the stereo has held up well so far.  Bluetooth just stopped working two weeks ago!

Got the complete package with sport suspension etc.  Rides a little rough, but the roads in Ohio leave a lot to be desired.  Also, I opted for the suspension, so I can't complain. Have 8K miles on it and can't say enough.  I thought it'd develop some rattles with the tight suspension, but nothing to date.  No complaints so far. The car is fantastic to drive, looks like a million dollars, and has the ""look-at-me"" factor we all crave.  My only concern is the summer tires.  Can't drive in inclimate weather, and replacements cost over 2 grand!  I hope they last for at least 15K miles. ",5

I test drove the Lexus GS 430, Porsche Cayenne S and Audi A4 3.2 quattro.  They were all nice, but were all lacking something. I just happened to see the G35c on the lot. After sitting in it, I knew it was the one. It was one of the most comfortable seats I ever sat in.  The driveability of Nissan/Infiniti has always been top notch. They always provide the best driver feedback and the G35c was no different.  It is so smooth to drive, there is nothing jerky about this car.

As I continued to drive there were more chip marks.  The car is red with a white primer so the chips are very noticeable.  I contacted the dealer who stated that because the nose of the car is very low to the ground it will pick up lots of road debris.  I have owned many cars previous to this one and have never experienced this much damage is such a short period of time.

Namely the new VW GTI, Dodge Caliber SRT4, Audi A3 S-line, etc. Even Honda Accord coupes with the 6 sp are faster to 60...with 40 less hp and 30 less torque?  Doesn't seem right...",4.625

Since the rear wheels and tires are larger than the fronts you can't rotate at all. The tires make excessive road noise when they wear in this manner.  My second complaint is gas mileage.  I average 15 miles per gallon and have for three years with this car. I'm an adult and while I drive sort of fast I'm far from a speed demon. Lastly is the turning radius.

OK, I'd like them to move the seat switches (and add memory seats, but I understand that's a problem with a 2-door). The trunk holds my golf bag and more, much more with the rear seat folded down.

2030, on 02/24/18 19:53 PM (PST),Genette T ,2004 INFINITI G35 Sedan Rwd 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl 5A),If you can find a good one.  Grab it fast!," My old car was wrecked, when a little old lady ran into it.  Purchased a Hyundai Sonata, which is a great vehicle.  But it is not as much fun to drive as the V6 powered coupe, I had.  After looking more than a year, I found this 2004 Infiniti G35 with only 69,000 miles on it, via a referral.  Had it checked out by a well-respected mechanic.  Told me it was in excellent condition, but would eventually need one control arm and a valve cover gasket replacement.  Using that information, I got it for a steal at $4500.  Here's the main thing I don't like about it.  It sucks gas with an average mpg of about 23 miles per gallon.  Compared to the Hyundai's average of about 34mpg.  It was expected, but it is different when you notice that you are doing fill-ups more than once a week.  It is a little bit noisy, and you can easily hear the outsides sounds.  But the purr of the engine makes it worth it.  The good things though.  Being a 2004 G35, that was a year before a horsepower increase, so it readily accepts regular gasoline.  The accelerate is smooth and strong, a very slight tap on the gas at highway speed will have me up from 65 to 80+ in no time.  Unlike the Sonata, this G35 goes exactly where you point it, sometimes it gets there before you do.  It holds a curve perfectly at higher speeds, you don't have to worry about it jumping around, even on bumpy pavement.  The cabin size feels just right, but don't expect for adults to be super comfortable in the back.  Doing switchbacks in the nearby Smokey Mountains is absolutely fun.  Last of all, if you get a little bit too happy and hit the brakes, they drag the car down to a stop very quickly.  Visibility is pretty decent, too.  Here's the 'worst thing' about this car.  The infuriating entertainment system.  It has a cassette player, multi-disk cd player and of course am/fm.     The am/fm is horrible and with lots of static.  But the craziest thing is if you attempt to play the radio, cassette or cd player, while the AC/HEATER is on, the controls of the ac/heater and/or the entertainment system, will lock up.  When you have both on, you can't change the temperature or fan speed of the ac/heater, nor can you change the channel, the volume, the track, or the tone of the entertainment system.   All of the controls just lock at the setting that you had initially.  You have to actually shut the car off, then restart it, which will usually put one of the two things in off position.  A review of youtube found this to be a common problem because the ac/heater and entertainment system both use the same circuit board.  Putting in an aftermarket entertainment system usually solves the problem.  However,  because the radio is neither din or double din size, you must buy an aftermarket dashboard insert, which cost about $200, for essentially a piece of molded plastic.  That doesn't include the actual replacement entertainment price!  I've had estimates between $800 to $1700 to replace the system.  Geez.",4

Only had it a few days, but I love the power and acceleration, have to get used to the heavy steering feel, definitely disappointed at the poor mileage (averaging 22 mpg), but I love the low level growl when it accelerates and it handles the road well.  The exterior is great, and it has some new tires, but some inside pieces have fallen off, like a leather panel on the back driver's side door.

For the first 100k I put very little money into it. Just oil changes, breaks, and tires. Then at 106k the transmission went. Figures 100k drive train warranty mine went at 106k. Dealership was great and found me a used Tranny for $3100 all in. That was a major expense but considering I hadn't had a car payment for 5 years I went for it. Other than that I've had replace a rusted out exhaust. The front end suspension especially tie rods seem to crack more than expected. (note I drive on pot holed roads quite a bit). I just replaced the rear suspension at 240k miles. I still have the same cad converter but did replaces muffler and pipes over 200k. I replaced belts, fluids, spark plugs but never any major engine issues. I have the sedan at 260hp and it's still a beast with pick up. The only other major expense was replacing the bearings at around 140k miles but after that it was like driving a new car. The leather has held up well with 4 kids. I have almost no rust just a touch under the back right wheel. I have over 265k miles and still feel safe driving this car. My negatives are no Bluetooth since it's an early model. The electronics are slowly failing my left passenger window safety relay is bad. Means when I auto roll up the window and it thinks something is stuck and rolls down halfway. I can inch it closed though by not using the auto feature. The break light in the back window is actually a waste. You don't really need it and it cost's over $500 if it fails. I have Bose speakers that still sound great but the CD player seems to have sound cut in and out (I know other G35 owners with the same problem) but the radio is perfect. This would be a great first car. The things that suck are the break dust on the front wheels and there is a plastic splash guard protecting the under carriage that gets mutilated over speed bumps or gets hooked on parking pylons. I really want to buy a Q50 but my G35 is still a great free ride. I actually keep hoping something major goes wrong so I can buy the Q50 but it keeps rolling safely.",4

But this car won't die!  And when I do get a new car, I will miss the smooth steering, tight turn radius and responsive acceleration. The negatives:  1) the tape deck never worked, and now the entire sound system sometimes goes off and the controls become unresponsive.  2) I used to go through the brakes like butter, and replacement was an expensive proposition, with new pads and rotors every ~15k miles even with a lot of highway driving.  Infiniti finally addressed this problem and brakes last much longer - and still stop the car.  3) Replacement parts are expensive, maybe because infiniti cars share parts in order to reduce manufacturing costs.  This results in incredibly expensive repairs - for instance, my elevated, central brake light just went out, and the cost of replacement was $500!  For a brake light!  It turns out that the part itself costs about $250.The positives, which outweigh the negatives by a lot:  1)  the car rides and handles as if it were new.  People are surprised that the car is over 11 years old.  I'M surprised that the car is over 11 years old.  2) Infiniti replacement parts are well-made.

It's fast, luxurious, and reliable - but it's best feature by far is its value.  BMW, Lexus, & Audi simply can't touch this car for the same price.  Although I have a few performance goodies on it, I still surprise many vehicles costing a whole lot more. As a used car value, the G35 is definitely one of the best out there.

I wondered what the big deal could be between the two.  What a mistake, the driving experience between the two cannot be compared.  The G35 is extremely agile for a 3400 lb car.  I find the interior quite pleasing, especially after looking at some 3 series BMW interiors.  The VQ motor is a jewel, not real strong out of the hole but really pulls well through the rest of the RPM range.  Cornering with the ""midship"" design platform was quite pleasing and for the first time, actually made me realize that the car would allow me to corner faster than I wanted to.

A bit of a risk for a significant G model generation change, but, it proved to be rewarding.  The 300+ hp will leave most cars gasping when you want to hit the accelerator.  The 5-spd sport stick is absolutely the sweet spot on a car this powerful (remember, the faster the track car, the LESS gears they require).  The newer 7 speeds are a gimmick.  The in-dash compact flash card (only year provided) is awesome (all of my music is on it and yes I download it all).  I am pretty tough on a car and this G35x has held up.  I do my own maintenance and it has been minimal.  Oil changes, tire rotations, and brakes is about it.  With nearly 100k miles on it, it has served me well.  So well, that I simply plan on keeping it even though I can afford a new car.  But why?  This thing drives as good as anything out there.  The only issue I have had are two:1. This car likes to drink fuel.  Despite the 25mpg avg, I would say I get closer to 19mpg.2. Although the tires have worn remarkably well for an AWD vehicle (still on the 2nd set), my right front wheel shows signs of inside tire cupping (and subsequent road noise).  I plan to put another set of tires on it and get the front end checked out; hopefully that takes care of that problem.Otherwise, I love the car.  The only reason for considering a new car is for some of the new technology that is out there such as blind spot monitoring and the 360 degree vision view (the 4 cameras).  Otherwise, I'm good.  Nissan's VQ engine won Ward's Automotive Award for about 10 years straight and this engine has performed flawlessly.  I suspect I'll need to change plugs soon, but, for now, it still runs like new (10 years later).For what it's worth, I am a Toyota man and have had Toyota trucks most of my life as well.  You can't go wrong with the Toyota/Lexus line either (although they have had some lemons like the IS250 direct port injection issue).  Infiniti/Nissan did a nice job with this car and I think the 2007 was the best year for reliability when you consider the transmission in this car (I'd want nothing more than 5 gears mated to this engine).  By the way, I drive almost exclusively in tiptronic (sport shift) mode and have not had any issues (I don't change trans fluids either; that's usually when trouble starts).",5

It's built like a rock and it's fast, capable, and just plain fun. The shift algorithm has figured out my driving style, and now does it all by itself in DS mode.  It's the kind of car that you are happy to see every morning, and that you occasionally look back at just to enjoy how good it looks. Tires are always an issue with cars like this. I replaced the OEM Potenzas (which lasted 12000 miles) with Michelin Pilot Sport AS+ 235/45R18 fronts, 245/45R18 rears. Vastly improved ride, great handling, better wet performance and a 45000 mile tread wear warranty. I wouldn't give up this car for anything.",4.5

Absolutely bulletproof reliability. Peppy motor combined with an above class grade interior. The wood is beautiful. The gauges and LED accent lights reflect a designer's touch.  The car truly needs one more gear though which I believe Infiniti subtlety acknowledged by engaging the transmission in the 08 model. I've driven both cars and prefer the 08 for this change alone.  Aside from the mileage, which is frankly poor (I average 18mpg), and the need for an extra gear, the engine does have to rev to make you feel like you are driving a true sport sedan. Furthermore, the trunk space is limited by the CD changer. In sum, super car. ",4.375

This is unacceptable for a car that has such low miles.  Also the sunroof had to be completely replaced after it froze-up for no reason.  The service experience has been average, greasy finger prints on headliner after being returned from sunroof install, broken license plate frame and other annoyances.

With 309 HP generated from a 3.5 ltr V6, it has plenty of pickup and handling. Acceleration is smooth and powerful when you need it. Steering feels tight without feeling heavy. It's a very easy car to drive. Outside, it's got a very sporty look. Clean lines make this a very attractive car. Inside its all luxury considering the price. The car looks expensive, but compared to its competitors, it's a real bargain.

You just can't go wrong with this car. The gas mileage stinks, but gas mileage on most cars this fast is not very good. I drive this car pretty hard and I get about 18 mpg. If you drive it normally, you'll get more. I have about 25k on the car and just about now will need tires and brakes, so I'm not sure about past reviewers saying they've had to do it with so much less mileage.

The navigation is the best around and the technology package is outstanding and the backup camera is a nice feature (so my wife says).  Gas mileage is about 20 avg, with mixed highway/city driving.  The only complaint is the back seat is a little cramped for my oldest daughter, but she manages.  Infinity puts Bridgestone Potenza from the factory and they stink.  I barely got 20K miles.

I replaced them with Hankook tires after 29000 miles. No complaints there. I am still on my original brake pads after 41000 miles.  I can't believe it, but I have them checked, and they are fine.  It might be due to my use of the autostick . This car is a lease, but I will likely purchase it at the end of the lease.  I drove the 2009 with the 7 speed auto and 328 horsepower.

It's blistering fast, has great handling (stable at any speed and extremely nimble), and has top class braking. It's very tractable around town in D - shift the manumatic for yourself, and it's show time. The nav system is top notch and the 10Gb music hard drive stores 500 CDs.

2184, on 10/24/16 02:57 AM (PDT),Joseph ,2005 INFINITI G35 Coupe Rwd 2dr Coupe (3.5L 6cyl 6M),"Beautiful, reliable, sports GT..."," I purchased this car in July of 2010 and have not regretted it for a single moment. I chose a diamond graphite coupe, 6MT revup, with black leather interior. I wanted a sports coupe that provided a sense of luxury and performance without breaking the bank.  When I purchased this car I was considering one of my long time favorites; the BMW E46 M3, along with the G37 coupe, and BMW 335i coupe. Though I knew both BMWs were better performers, I decided against them after extensive research that showed I would likely experience expensive regular maintenance and frequent, costly repairs. The G37 was also faster and had an upgraded, nicer interior, but the exterior left something to be desired for my taste. This car is extremely reliable, low cost maintenance, and loads of fun. I literally look forward to driving it every day. The G35 coupe is truly a beautiful car with a timeless design and I get compliments on it all the time from tuners, luxury car owners, to casual, young and old. I would argue it is one of Infiniti's best exterior designs. Concerning maintenance costs, this car has been great. I purchased it with 50k on the odometer and with it being a daily driver, it now has 166k on the odometer. My most expensive repairs have been replacing the clutch / flywheel at 150k and the power steering pump shortly after; both for under 2k... that's it! I had to replace the steering wheel clock spring and did it myself for around $50 dollars. (Used part) PROS... APPEARANCE - now this is of course completely based on ones preference, but I think this car is beautiful... and based on the feedback I get on almost a daily basis, the G35 is an aesthetically pleasing design, even by today's standards. It still holds its own next to the newest designs. It was truly innovative and groundbreaking at its debue and it still shows today with the timeless, classic lines, defining its motif. PERFORMANCE - fun, fun, fun... Strong, responsive engine. With 298hp it is not the fastest out there but still a competitive performer. This particular engine is shared with the 35th anniversary 350Z 300hp engine. The only difference in the intake assembly making a difference of about 2hp. With the 350Z 'Z tube' you get to the even 300hp mark.SOUND - the exhuast note is glorious (almost exotic) and coveted by many car enthusiasts. One of the best 6 cylinder exhaust notes around, especially in this price range. Most are either too raspy, high pitched or simply unheard. I get thumbs up all the time for the G's unique, tonal qualities. Pure bliss...RELIABILITY - The engine still runs like new and doesn't miss a beat. It does burn a little oil... about 1 quart every 3-5k between oil change intervals. PRACTICALITY - Great, especially considering it is a coupe. I have a 16 month old and a 3 month old and I can get them both in the back seat. (One forward facing and one rear facing child seat)  with plenty of room for myslef at 6ft. Trunk space is actually decent and the rear seats let down for larger items. Headroom is good up front, but the back not so much for taller passengers. CONS... RIDE COMFORT - don't expect a Cadillac /Benz plush ride. With the low stanced Nismo-tuned sport suspension, this car has a firm ride no doubt. I don't mind it much, but my wife and other passengers have stated it is less than desireable. It is smooth on the open highway, but does not absorb bumps and potholes well as you would expect from a 'luxury car'. It is slightly softer than the 350Z. NOISY Manual Transmission - On forums, the G35 and 350Z 6spd transmissions are often referred to as 'the rock crusher'. The clutch is noisy and chattery. You really notice it when sitting at drive thrus. Mine is even more noisy since I replaced the flywheel with a single mass, opposed to the oem dual mass. QUALITY / Materials - Interior materials are not the best but have held up well. An average mix of leather, plastics, and real aluminum trim that were fair and comparable for the mid 2000's. AUDIO / Electronics... The stereo sounds good but the interface is old and dated. I have since replaced it with a modern double-din touch screen that resolves this and many other technology related desires. TIRE WEAR - in its stock configuration, this car's camber setup eats up tires (inner wear) and does not have the adjustability needed to align for long wear. However, I purchased SPC's front and rear camber kit and can get a flat alignment that wears even for 40k. Anyway, I could get a lot more granular with this review but all things considered, I absolutely love this car. The pros outweigh the bad by multitudes. It has been a great car and I plan on keeping it for years to come. I am a detail enthusiast and take immaculate care of all vehicles I own, so I expect it to continue running and looking great. I would definitely recommend it to someone who is looking for a classy, reliable,  grand tourer...",5

Loved the exterior styling and the handling (still do). It's been very reliable except the drivers side power window, but I only put about 7500 miles a year on the car.  The owners manual recommends premium gas but it will drive OK on regular. Bose sound system is fine. I don't have nav.  Climate control works great. Front seats are OK, but my wife complains about them and about getting out of the low seat. Not much knee room in back. Interior materials were never luxurious but still look nice. Trunk is a little small but the back seat folds down for extra cargo space. The car sits low, which looks good and maybe aids handling and aerodynamics, but can be a problem with parking blocks, large potholes and other roadway hazards where underside clearance could be an issue.Pros: Outstanding handling and plenty of power. Very stable and fun to drive on the highway, if it is not icy or snowy. Drives well in town too, if not icy or snowy.  Exhaust has nice but not intrusive tone. Solid, gorgeous, sporty car.Cons: Road noise is high at all speeds above 20 mph. New, quiet-tread tires help some, but still noisy by modern standards; gas mileage not great even using premium, would be better if the automatic had another gear or two; terrible traction in snow with just all-season tires; have replaced drivers side window motor twice.But for the road noise and the lack of traction in snow, I would drive this car anywhere the roads are paved and good, across the country or across town.",4

My one gripe with this car would have to be the fuel economy, if your lucky you'll avg about 20mpg for a tank, compared to the 30 of the A4. But then again somthing needs to fuel that monster. You step on the pedal and your flying, before i bought this car i drove the IS250,325CI,A4, and C230. The G blows all of them away.

My hardest decision was what color to choose. Ultimately, it was the Ivory Pearl. Just stunning. On the road, this thing does not even lean in the corners. Grip is phenomenal.

This car is my daily driver.  It was in great condition and I really love the way this car drives. Especially, the roar of the muffler.  I had this vehicle toward the end of summer and now through the fall and winter. It handles well on dry and wet roads. I love the stiff suspension and the the heated seats, mirrors, power everything and cool features like the ability to (by factory remote) lower all four windows down at the same time as your walking towards your vehicle. This model came without the navigation system which was okay with me. So, I read a lot about these cars on various forums specific to the G35. Let me start off by saying my gas mileage was horrible initially. I was averaging about 14 mpg in the city and highway. So, I reset the trip computer by simply disconnecting the battery for over an hour which rest the computer. Afterward, I drove moderately around the city and on the highway. In other words, I didn't punch it at every single stop,etc... My mileage improved to over 20 mpg in the city and highway. The system adjusts itself to the driver. So, if you really push this car all the time you will get poor gas mileage. If you test it's ability on occasion you'll get good gas mileage. BTW, I suggest sticking with the premium gas. It's just better for performance.  Oil consumption happens with the engines as you get around 100k. It will burn about a quart of oil every 1,500-2000 miles. It's normal. Nothing to be alarmed about. I'm using conventional oil but will probably change to high mileage. Others use synthetic oil but I had a lot of leak issues with a Maxima when I turned to it. If your car hasn't been using synthetic I would suggest not using it when it has higher mileage. The brake issues heard about with these cars can be remedied by buying after market brakes and pads instead of the defective Nissan.  Overall, the car gives you the luxury and ride of a BMW and Mercedes at a fraction of the repair cost. After all, you're riding in a Nissan. A Nissan that was engineered to compete with those European cars. For a car thats 12 years old it's still gets looks. Now, it doesn't have usb ports so you'll have to add. I had to use a plug in phone holder through the cigarette lighter because there really isn't a good place to put your phone. And i have my usb port through it. Oh, and every instrument light in the car is amber color. Basically a light orange.  Some people hate it. Others like it or their indifferent to it. Personally, I think it's okay.I like the car too much to worry about something that trivial.  Nissan didn't make it all red because they didn't want to copy BMW and Mercedes. If you want a solid sedan with 280 horse power that won't be super expensive to fix, this is the vehicle for you. Keep in mind, with any used car you buy it's important to get one in good condition. This car can last for over 200,000 miles and I plan to keep mine for another 100,000+ miles.",5

My old car died unexpectedly, so I was in a bind to get something that looked good, was inexpensive but sporty and had four doors. I found this clean six-speed manual G35 on a used car website, the price was only $8700. It had 85K miles on it, was in great shape inside and out,  had 18 inch wheels, dark tint, black on black with leather interior and the Bose radio.  I only drive manual transmission cars, so I jumped on it, and I've had it two weeks now.  It's not perfect, but I seriously love this car. The GREAT things about it are: It's quick. Acceleration is top notch! Shifting is short and smooth, passing is easy, and the engine has a low roar that will get you in a good mood. It feels solid on the road. Handling is great. The styling doesn't scream ""I'm 11 years old!"" at all. It still looks really good.  When I tell people it's a 2005, they are surprised.  Other good things to note - the inside is roomy for a sports sedan, even in the back seat. Power outlets, three cubbies for storage, in-dash 6 disc CD changer, and an armrest that comes down with cupholders for the rear passengers. I like the location of the clock and the features like cruise control, seat memory, and the dash are easy to use and locate. As far as getting a sporty sedan with the most bang for your buck, a used G35 is the way to go. Now - the bad stuff is the same as other reviewers. The inside is a bit noisy - little clicks, clanks and creaks as you are driving. They are slight but you will notice them after a while and wish they would go away. I also don't know why the Bose audio is supposed to be spectacular because it's nothing special. Not much bass unless you really crank it. I'm already thinking about upgrading the head unit and speakers, because I had better factory audio in my old Mustang. The inside materials and design are also basic and nothing special. Also the turning radius seems a bit wide.  Overall though, unless you are really nitpicky about the negatives, I would recommend this car in a heartbeat.UPDATE...Edmunds asked me to update my review. I've had the car six months and I still love it.  I just might be an Infiniti fan for life.",4

Before buying this car I looked at a 05 BMW 3series, Honda S2000, and Nissan 350z.  For the price range, the G35 has the best value and features. It has usable back seats, 19"" rims with TPMS (tire sensors), all power options, and Navigation. Overall its a nice luxury sports car, but at this age and mileage but at this age is expected to have some issues and be a little outdated. I repaired a few things: front brakes, 6cd changer/nav, front control arms, clutch master cyclinder, and drive belts. Maintenance costs can be expensive if you don't have warranty. It only uses Premium gas but I get 19-20mpg city and around 25mpg hwy.  Update: During hot weather e.g. summer, the clutch pedal will only return half-way up after being released when you're driving in traffic. So you'll have to pop the clutch pedal back to its original position with your left foot. From my research, this is a fault of the design of the clutch pedal and also the clutch fluid line location.  I try not to drive my car when its very hot or in heavy traffic (night time driving and highway is fine though).  During the winter when outside temp is 75F or below, the clutch pedal is not an issue.On the plus side, the A/C system on the G35 is excellent and always keeps the inside very cool in the summer.  The heated front seats are great during winter as well.  The car looks great and the exhaust sound is very sporty.  The engine has plenty of power and torque for daily driving.",4

We have a lot of hills and curves in Wisconsin so I can truly say I have tested these cars. If you floor it after 3000rpm hold on tight as you are pushed into the plush leather seats.

This last time I looked at the little BMWs and Mercedes and thought why not try something different? So I looked at the Infiniti G35 and the Lexus GS300. There was not much of a cost difference and the Infiniti seemed like so much more car for the money. People complain about the mileage. I get a solid 21 mpg with 80% hwy driving.

Overall great car but you get what you pay for. Lots of power and smooth ride, most of the time. Beware of the rattles and tick noises. When test driving tell the salesmen to be quiet and turn off the so-so Bose stereo. Listen to the car over bumps and drive it on the freeway if possible. Once a noisy car always a noisy car. I have had mine in the shop/dealer for about a week trying to figure out where all the rattles are coming from. They are almost gone, almost. The phantom rattle in the center of the dash is the most elusive. Have the car inspected by a third party brake guy before you buy, this will save you later. ",3.75

I have had no problems at all with this car and I'm nearing 30,000 miles.  The seats are very comfy and the car is roomy enough even for my 220 lb, 6-foot-2 husband.  It handles well and I drive like a demon.  The gas mileage isn't great but I'll take it for the performance.  I put 2 MTX 10"" subwoofers in the trunk (and an 800 watt amp) a year ago with still not a vibration from anywhere.  The things I would change are minor.

Replaced all the window tracks in the doors at 19k, rattle in the A-pillar started soon after and still persists (I drive 80 miles a day, so pretty obnoxious). Brakes have squealed the entire time I've had the car, despite replacing the front and rear pads and front rotors. I also had to take electrical tape to the electronic rear view mirror to keep it from rattling. Of course, the dealer cannot diagnose any of these problems (and I would have to pay for them to do so as rattles aren't covered under warranty). Frankly I would rather have a german car with lots of mechanical problems that they can at least be diagnosed. ",3.5

Dealer still troubleshooting but looks like its the suspension rods. Currently 5 sets on backorder and that's just 1 dealer!  Problem 3.

I bought the G35 because I wanted a rear wheel drive car and have been very surprised. In over 18,000 miles of driving I only had a problem with the CD player, which was replaced quickly and under warranty. The car is not quite as composed in handling as a BMW but it still does well and the engine provides a lot or performance for the money. The amount of space in the car is also great and the seats are comfortable. I am planning to buy a new model G35 for my next car.  ",4.125

It's been a lot of fun to drive, great acceleration and handling.  You've heard it before, the gas mileage isn't that great.  We get a lot of snow around here and the all wheel drive has been great.  The problems have been in the quality of the car.  2nd day it was back in the shop for a new transmission contol valve (2 weeks).  Since then I've dealt with a leaky back window and now a loose ground wire in the dash and replaced a wheel bearing.  Yikes!

The ride is very smooth and soft over bumpy roads, yet the car handles aggressively when pushed to the task.  Minor defects addressed by the dealer thus far (headlight adjustments, speaker rattling, heated seat malfunction, bizarre engine hesitation attributed to bad gas).  The AWD is masked by the VDC/TCS; I usually disengage the VDC, but when driving in snow with VDC off, you can easily swing the back around, which questions how well the AWD really works.",4.625

I wanted to see how it would handle turns at high speeds so going around a corner I didn't break. It felt like poetry in car form. After the honeymoon phase of owning the car ended, I was delightfully pleased with how well the car handled in snowy conditions. I purchased Hankook Icebear 300s for about $850 all in all and it worked just fine. Excellent car. I would totally buy one again!",4.75

The gas mileage is about the same as a full-size pickup. We own two other Infinitis and no problems like this one.  Good thing the car has a good resale value.  I am buying a truck.

I drive the car as aggressively as I want, same gas mileage around 19-20 mpg mixed, or 23-25 on FWY. Installed intake and full exhaust for incredible sound and power that shocks 350z and G37 coupe drivers. Handles like it's on rails at any speed or weather, granted this is LA.",4.625

Service was initially great, but has gradually gone downhill, I think the dealer can't cope with the number of Infiniti's sold.

I bought the car used from a coworker and he showed me where the transmission had to be replaced by warranty from the dealer at 64k because it would not go in reverse one morning, so i felt like I got a new transmission.  I bought it at 66k and overall it's a fun car when it doesn't stall constantly.  They've cleaned the throttle body and this doesn't seem to fix it.  It happens around once per week where it stalls at slow speed.  There are no codes thrown so of course the dealer warranty cannot duplicate it.  The interior is so cheap too.  Coming from Lexus I thought Infiniti was similar but this is so not true.

2469, on 07/27/16 21:21 PM (PDT),Mark ,2008 INFINITI G35 Sedan x 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl 5A),Doesn't drive as good as it looks," After owning this car for two years and driving it 15,000 miles per year, I have to say that I am quite disappointed. It’s a very beautiful looking car and has stood the tests of time very well, and hasn’t needed anything yet. Granted that mine has very low mileage for its age, I can always count on it taking me where I need to be without fail. But the driving experience is lacking in so many areas. Compared to other cars on the market, it feels very “amateurish”. Kind of reminds me of Kia cars during that initial phase when they were trying to make the brand more appealing to consumers but still weren’t tuning the driving dynamics right. The 2010+ G37 coupes and sedans are better vehicles, but as for the 2007-2008 G35 sedan, there were numerous kinks that had to be worked out. The car just doesn’t feel confidence-inspiring. The whole thing is just too unpredictable and I never feel like I have proper control over the vehicle. It’s stubborn in the way it behaves on the road and the vehicle never listens to driver inputs. The thing that probably bugs me the most about the car is the transmission. The 5-speed automatic is counterintuitive, sloppy shifting, has a tendency to hunt for gears, and rarely puts you in the correct gear required for the situation. I guess I could have went for the manual but my options were limited at the time of purchase. The gears are all spaced very close together and it always shifts too early, cutting off power and denying me a large reserve of the advertised 306 horses. In stop-and-go traffic, the transmission shifts through its entire gearset during the 10 feet you’ve moved up in traffic and annoyingly holds the gears long after you’ve let off the accelerator, like you’re “stuck” in the gear. On the highway it revs at over 3,000 RPM because of the tight spacing between all the gears, making you think you were driving a 3-speed automatic. The shifting can also get pretty violent which makes driving this car a headache. Another thing that bugs me is the engine performance. Doesn’t have a linear or predictable torque curve. It’s very soft on low-end torque and needs to be revved out a great deal to keep up with other cars on the road. Engine is very loud and course sounding and because of the sloppy powerband it’s not really so much of a joy to ring out either. Most mainstream cars have more smooth, predictable acceleration and meaty grunt off the line. G35 does not have that and other cars on the road will be going faster from stop light to stop light than you. Often times I find myself missing that smooth, seamless, meaty, refined feel that my old Volkswagen had even though that car had a fraction of the horsepower. The steering feels artificially heavy, like they tried to go after BMW’s chunky/hefty steering feel but instead they put effort over feedback. Steering doesn’t feel predictable or communicative..just simply difficult to turn which hampers the maneuverability. Doesn’t have a good on-center feel and the steering doesn’t always give you a good idea of what the front tires are doing. Turning radius could definitely be better. The brakes are soft and don’t provide much confidence or linear stopping power. They feel like Sentra brakes...or maybe even a step below that. I’ve tested the brakes and the car the stopping distance is very long compared to other cars I’ve had in the past. You need to keep a big distance from other cars in front of you because the brakes probably won’t save you in a panic situation, which I find somewhat unacceptable in any modern day vehicle, especially a sport sedan. The cornering abilities are disappointing. It feels very heavy in the corners and makes you (along with your loose items in the vehicle) feel like you’re being sucked into a vortex around a slight bend in the road. After exiting the turn and getting back on the gas, literally 99% of the time the transmission won’t put you in the correct gear to propel the vehicle back up to speed.The car just drives very amateurish. While everything operates as it should going down the road, the car behaves very stubbornly and leaves much to be desired. On top of everything, the gas mileage will empty your pockets. While the vehicle has made it to 60,000 miles, I could see it needing transmission/drivetrain and suspension repairs in the future. These components of the vehicle simply feel very low-rent feel to them and I don’t see them standing the tests of time. Material quality and ergonomics are also seriously lacking. I’ve seen car interiors from the ‘90s hold up better. Storage solutions are lacking and the armrests are practically useless. My advice if buying this car is don’t be fooled by the advertised 306 horses. The car certainly doesn’t feel like it was built properly for that kind of power, and you rarely ever get to use them. Maybe skip the “X” and go for the RWD “S” model with the manual and the active 4 wheel steering...",2

I love everything about the car! Feels like I am in a grand luxury car whenever I drive it. I have leather seats and a sunroof which is great for the hot and humid Florida weather. The exhaust sounds like a bad ass (: when turning on and driving off with the car. The power is strong. Gas mileage is horrible, but listen to the other posts, its WORTH it ! The tire to road frequency is great. Tires grip the road beautifully. Boast and sound system is not that loud hearing music from the outside, but the inside sounds good. I get about 20-30 mpg on the hwy and about 19-20 on the road. I'm a female so I don't drive harshly or roughly. My car has black stripes and is silver and I get so much compliments from it. I have 99665 miles on it and it drives like new. Maintenance is so expensive that is a con! If u cannot afford it, don't buy an Infiniti! Repair is not a big issue because I have not replaced much yet except for my hoses and battery  which is about 140 altogethor And that's it. After 100k drive belts and fluids are needed to be changed 8 years later and that's it.  Hopefully it will last another decade. Brakes don't last very long and they are very expensive when u go to the dealer !!! But other then that once u drive you'll feel very confident with the car because its so perfect.  I shoudlve gave the car interior three stars because the steering wheel chips and looks nasty so I put a cover on it and the doors are chipping and scratched on the drivers side so be gentle when it comes to cleaning products. Water works just fine.  The seats are so perfect. I wipe them with water and that's it. They are so climate controlled but I think because its leather and thseres a switch to warm up that seats when its cold . A/C works beautifully . another con is that my car is sooooo low !!!! When going over bumps, u must be cautious because I could hear the scratching noise under the car! Even when going slowly. Thank god under the car has a covering.

The 306 HP engine puts out TONS of power, so much it has turned me in to one of those people who speeds anywhere and everywhere. I have driven tons and tons of cars, and have never driven one this fast. As the dealer said, it is a sports car with a sedan body. The interior of the car is equally as stunning as the performance.  All of the functions, including the navigation, are extremely easy to use.

I still have my 03 Maxima which I like alot but I let my sister drive it for now because I just can't see letting it sit (and sit it would as long as I have a car like the G).

The G35 was a combination of all the vehicles and really offers the power and luxury which could not be surpassed by any of the aforementioned vehicles.

Handling and braking are smooth.  Very tight turning radius for a car this size.  Road noise is a little more prevalent than in competitor's models, but not bad overall.  You can feel the transmission shifts a bit.  This car has a lot of power for a 5-speed.  Likely corrected with the 7-speed in the '09.

Drove the G, power kicks the 325.  Who needs this sort of power?  The brakes, lovely, the growl, exhilarating and no tranny lag when punched.

It's held up very well with no mechanical problems.  I've changed brake pads (front) and batteries twice and tires once.  I got nissan brand wiper blade replacement which are much better than anything else.  I changed air filter a few times.  Engine is so reliable that it still idles at 700, same as original factory preset.  Suspension still good, but of course not quite as perfect as new.  A/C ice cold.  Stereo, cd and cassette same as new. Steering has not lost any feel after all these years.  Clearly Infiniti built this so solidly and it was made in Japan.  ",4.75

No rattles, squeaks or electrical gremlins that plagues other cars its age - a true testament to the engineering and build quality of Infiniti.  Simply put this is the best car I have ever owned and I still get compliments on it 9 years later.

My G20 has held up beautifully over the years and I have had to turn down quite a few offers from people looking to purchase it from me. The multi-link design suspension which is similar to that of the Nissan 300ZX and Skyline GT-R has proven to be excellent under severe weather conditions.  ",5

Fuel economy @ 21/29 could have been better, for a car this size and (lack of) power. The exterior looks as good as new and as stylish after 7 yrs and has a great pleasing interior.

The performance and handling do not match the Audi of course, but so far this car is much more reliable.  You don't see too many of these on the road either which I like.

It now has almost 70K miles and no problems at all.  It still garners compliments on its looks.  It will outhandle cars much newer and costlier.  The leather seats are some of the most comfortable ones out there.  Plus, it gets great gas mileage.  I average almost 30 mpg year round in mixed driving.  Of course, I have a manual which goes a long way towards solving any perceived power deficiencies. Infiniti missed the boat with this car.  They should have given it some upgrades and put either a turbo or the 2.5 engine in it.  If you can find a nice one used, grab it.  You won't regret it.",4.875

With the G20, you get much more for your dollar - power windows, power mirrors, leather interior, moonroof, etc. People will argue that the G20 has a low resale value compared to the other models. Who cares? If you want to get an affordable used car that you intend to use for many years to come, resale value does not matter. All you should care about is reliability and in that area, the G20 is a real keeper. I'm not being biased, but I read so many great things about the G20's SR20DE engine.

Regular maintenance... I use full synthetic oil, amazing the difference it makes on performance. Great car, great value, classic Infiniti style.",5

Car has held up exceptionally well for 9 years.  If I ever had to design a car, it would turn out exactly like this.  It's too bad they stopped making it - I'd buy it again if I could.  Got over 150K miles on it and everything has held up well.",4.875

The rating couldn't have been more true.  I've owned the car over a year and a half with ZERO problems, even with a 130k miles on it.  They told me it had a chain timing belt which is good for 250k mi.  Great car, cabin noise is lower than my 25k '04 honda accord.",4.375

I researched many used cars before I found this one and I don't want to part with it.

Extremely reliable. Well built, except for the fan motor that murmurs. It's automatic. I average 23.5 in the city and 34 hwy (I never go past 3k rpm).  140 hp would be enough if they improved the low end torque. The engine is easily modified to 205 hp with $$$, but this is what it should have been off of the lot,  like the skyline, 200se, etc that use this engine.  ",4.75

Now has over 215,000 miles and is still going strong. It is a manual 5 speed and gets 30 mpg on open roads (typically cruise 80mph interstates). At 97,000 had a clutch plate issue - have replaced all brake rotors once - replace muffler at 210,000. Other than that it has oil changes every 5000 miles, along with normal maintenance. At 62 years old this will probably be the last manual transmission I will own but it has been fun to throw around the highways and byways. Note: wife had a 1999 QX4 Infiniti with over 200,000 miles also purchased in 2002 - hers had 67,000 when purchased. The G20t has been well worth the $13,000 I paid for it. ",4.875

A sporty, fun-driving car cleverly disguised as a sedan. Some lament a lack of power, but with the manual transmission, I don't notice it until I get to the gas pump (I get 28-31 mpg). It doesn't have a useful cupholder. But who cares? I've had the car 6 years and 90,000 miles, and have only had scheduled maintenance and tire and battery replacement.",5

The BOSE system is awesome. The leather interior is great. I was in love with this car until it got totaled when someone hit my mom head on. This is an extremely safe car because even though the outside was beyond repair, the inside was completely fine and didn't cave in at all. The only downfall to the car is that the maintainance costs a ton and the cup holder sucks because you can't fit anything bigger than a small drink in it. ",5

I got a very good deal, helped by the fact that I was trading in a G20 I had bought used at the same dealership.  It's been a great car.  I have had all the service done at the dealership and have never had a major problem. I see lots of pretty models on the road but can't imagine why i would trade this car in.

I had a 2015 AWD Q50 premium and decided after 2 1/2 years to trade in for something a bit bigger. The dealership gave me an awesome deal on a 2017 Q70S AWD. A deal so good actually that I ended up paying less for this than I did for my Q50. Now I know this car does not fully compete against the finest midsize luxury cars but infiniti is always running deals on these so you have to put it in perspective. Infiniti does need to redesign to keep up with the latest but it is still is a fine and comfortable driving car. You have to put it in perspective when it comes to value:I paid $42,000 for a $57,000 stickered car and for that money with AWD, a sport package, bose radio, heated and cooled seats, navigation, sunroof, great seats, a comfortable ride and many standard features it was a no brainer. Not many cars you could consider for this price point that are this fun to drive and luxurious! The Q70 handles well, has good power, is very comfortable, good space for 4 people and is an attractive looking car and has AWD. For that type of money you can’t really ask for much more...plus this car is more fun to drive and more pleasant than the Q50 (more communication in the steering, quieter/more comfortable when cruising and has a better sound from the engine). Overall an great car at a excellent value price! ",5

Got a used Acura RDX in the interim but I couldn't stand the FWD dynamics although it was a definite improvement technology and ease of entry for me.  My gently-used Infiniti Q70L is perfect for my current needs - I like to say I bought the back seats for Mom and Dad and the rest for me!  It is a truly sharp-looking car and I believe a significantly safer car for me as I burn up the highways 3 hrs 1-way back and forth every week to look after the folks.  I never lack for power or acceleration and it is truly a road warrior for me.  Blue-tooth connectivity is awful as I can no longer read or respond to texts - but I honestly think this may be Divine Intervention for me (as I acknowledge it leads to distracted driving so I've accepted it and it no longer bothers me - I just warn people that I'm trying to meet up with to call, not text me when I'm on my way).  Climate control is COLD and accurate but the fans associated with the cooled seats are loud.  I still use them all the time, however, living in the Southeast.  It's a physically beautiful car that is a joy to drive.  Quick acceleration, tight turning radius, back to commanding RWD,  a beast on the interstate, and not a pain to park in a city parking deck.",4

Audi and I don't get along hahaha. Ill start by saying all vehicles I tested had their pluses and minuses and were all really good cars. In short the Lexus GS350 was the only other one that wasn't ""boring"" to me, but it didn't have the ""it"" factor I was looking for. The BMW 535i and the Mercedes E350 felt really stale and old if that makes sense. Almost as if these would be great cars for my grandparents to drive. In steps the Infiniti Q70 Sport. Everything about this car I love. from the aggressive styling to the performance of the tried and true VQ engine. This car just does it for me. Not to mention the room inside the cabin. Being 6'5"" and 250 I'm not a small guy and while driving the Inifiniti I don't feel cramped in at all. I can also sit in the back seat comfortably without hunching over. I can't remember the last time I was able to do that in a car....maybe 8th grade??? Now I will admit this car is a touch edgy, but in a good way. I love cars and like to feel connected to the road and not taken away from it like some of the others in that class have done.

First when the A/C is on the car sounds like a jumbo jet trying to take off but can't (you can even hear it over the radio) and guests always ask me ""whats wrong with your car?"". The service department told me they can't fix it because ""they all make this noise and Infiniti knows it"". Next the car grabs every rut in the road and flies all over the place and when I say ""flies"" I mean way beyond a safety concern. The problem even gets worse when braking. Also there is a buzz noise when driving the car that you can hear over the radio but the dealer says ""they can't hear it and they can't fix it"". I could go on and on about how bad this car is but to tell you the truth I have already waste so much of my time on trying to get this car fix and trying to get Infiniti the car company to do something about it (which they won't & they have told me this one 3 different occasions) i just can't stand this car anymore. If you want all the problem you can handle and then some please buy one of these cars. I thought this was going to be a great fast and cool car but all it turned out to be was a huge waste of my time and money. Sincerely, a 3 time new Infiniti buyer and owner (also a disgusted customer of Infiniti). *******update at 39000 miles: WORST car I have ever purchased, all of the problems have persisted, A/C whines louder than I can turn the radio uo to cover it up, brakes start shaking every 3000 miles and it is not because I ride the brakes, tires wear out at 18000 miles, just a terrible terrible experience with a brand new luxury car. Nissan North America/Infiniti has refused to do anything about the concerns I have.

And this car has tremendous rear seat space, very much appreciated by our adult and very adult-sized kids.Good acceleration and handling, the mileage is a little better than expected, climate controls good, very comfortable overall.

Very good looking in a unique way (unlike it's anodyne competitors), extremely comfortable, very nimble for a large car (as in the same size as a BMW 740 or an Audi A8). 330 HP paired with the 7 speed transmission and 14"" disc brakes, 20"" wheels and the adjustable sport suspension is plenty. Also capable in difficult road conditions; last week we hammered through no less than six thunderstorms on an interstate with no difficulty. And perhaps the most important item from the vanity point of view: the valets always put the Q70S in the front row. So you've got competence, reliability, good looks, good handling, and a reasonable price going here. What could be wrong with that?******************************Update March 2017. Perfectly acceptable large sedan at a huge value compared to its competitors. Buyers who are concerned with extremely high performance (as in, cars with 400 hp and up) should look elsewhere). But the Q70S 3.7 is a supreme long distance cruiser (up to 155 mph) and is more than handy on twisty roads.  No mechanical issues of any kind.  Exterior paint is gorgeous as are 20"" wheels and show no wear. Interior materials excellent after a year in use.  A buyer has to consider what I call the shark look.  I personally like the look a lot in the S version with 20"" wheels and big brakes. It's so not anodyne as its competitors.

These are reliable cars.  As the slogan says: ""Own one and you will understand.""2nd review request:  I repeat all of the above.  I see Infiniti now has a self drive option on the new QX50.

The rear seating comfort is excellent and the transmission shifts so smoothly you almost feel like you are driving a Tesla.  The electronics and collision avoidance are Excellent!

The handling isn't as crisp as g35 but it is a bigger car and I was ready for the extra room. Still handles very nicely. I like the Sport mode best--closer the the great handling of the G35. Gas mileage is only mediocre but that wasn't an issue for my needs. Love all the tech stuff--voice activated blue tooth, nav, locks, etc.  I like the looks of the exterior and the looks, cush, pampering of the interior.

I had the chance to drive this car for couple thousand miles. It's definitely not the most competitive in the class, but Edmunds' review is absolutely terrible and biased. Their whole article screams one sentence - buy German car, don't buy Q70. ""no Q70 variant truly stands out in the crowd""??? Seriously??? Look at how many A6 and E class are on the road, and you tell me Q70 does not stand out? To be completely honest Q70 isn't the most attractive design but it has a very strong presence when you see it. Oh and I see Edmunds gave 1 star for Q70's technology. Sure the tech is not up to date, the screen is not the most crisp and the largest. BUT even for today's standards I found the system very intuitive and easy to use even for the first time, and the NAV never got me a problem. Now it comes where Edmunds lose all the credit, where in the driving aids section it says ""It's almost unheard of in this class for items such as blind-spot monitoring and forward collision warning to be optional."" What a joke. I guess you are just ignoring the fact that German cars nickel and dime you for every single piece of desirable feature? And not to mention Q70 is one of the most reliable luxury cars in the market right now! If you enjoy paying repair bills and loaner cars from the dealer -  go ahead and buy German and enjoy.",4

This is my third hard top convertible and I love it.  It's true, the trunk space is non-existent when the top is down and really not much when the top is up either but I didn't buy it for the trunk space.  The back seat can be utilized if really needed for a very short ride but works best for groceries if the top is down.  I use this car for my daily 20 mile commute with no complaints.  I love the sound of the engine, and surprised about the reviews lamenting it.  I was worried initially but my husband and I have fun driving it on the interstate, not sure what the issue was in the formal review.  Maintenance has been great, much cheaper than my VW EOS.

Very quiet with the top up or down, no rattles or rough ride, and with the top down it could not be better. I am a big guy so the mid section area left to right when driving is a little tight, but workable. The engine's performance is great and I like the sound as well, but it does get a little rougher in the upper rev ranges. My other car is a Lexus GS350 and the Lexus engine is much more sophisticated, but no more powerful.  This is a very upscale car and does everything well. It has next to no trunk storage (the back seat area can hold lots of groceries if you need it), but that's not what it was built for! You can't go muddin' in it either, so get over it.

For a convertible, it has a very comfortable ride.  Main issues are a rattling top - particularly when it's cold and the seals probably contract until the car heats up - and rear brakes that squeal after the car sits overnight and when you back up.  Probably a brake dust issue that can be resolved with dust covers.  The car is a blast to drive and actually comfortable on rides of over 100 miles.  I put it in storage for the winter months and bring it back on the road in April here in Massachusetts.  I would not advise driving it in winter conditions since it is not a four-wheel drive.  All controls are easy to use, including the navigation.",5

The QX56 was cheaper than the Escalade, bigger than the GX470 and more reliable than the Navigator.  It is a little odd looking from the outside, but looks great from the drivers seat.  And oh what a drivers seat it is...  Its like wearing new shoes WITH new socks.  So comfortable.  Passengers LOVE the second row seats.  The 3rd row, like most, is better suited to smaller kids but I could sit back there for a 30 minute ride.  Bose stereo sounds awesome. AUX input is strangely missing, but you can connect a phone/ipod whatever to the DVD input.Mileage isn't great, but it is the same for most of these trucks.  Read up about brake issues on these trucks.  Same for Nissan Titan and Armada.  Warped rotors are not a big deal to me.  $56ea at the local part store, I don't care if I need to replace them once a year.  The other brake issue is the 'delta stroke sensor'.  You will want to google that.  A sensor goes bad in the brake booster causing the antilock brakes to kick on.  Feels like you are trying to stop on ice.  I knew it was a possibility so I wasn't freaked out when it happened to me.  Truck still stopped pretty good, just had that grindy/vibrating pedal feel.  You can clear the fault by simply restarting the vehicle.  If it happens a few more times I will look into replacing the brake booster ($180)",5

The kids have enjoyed all the leg room, the captain's chairs and DVD in the back.  Cargo capacity is great.  The biggest problem I have with it is the suspension- -the car booms and shudders with even small potholes.

I have not had any problems with the mechanics or finishes of the inside or out. The GPS is very user friendly, the sound system wonderful.

Great features which supports why we bought it but the finish quality is horrific not to mention the ride quality.

Some body lean is noticed in tight turns but it's not a sports sedan.  Our gas mileage, ave about 15 mpg, is about what you would expect from a large SUV.  Loaded with tech features.  Considering the terrific incentives and compared to the other SUVs I test drove and considered prior to making purchase (Cadillac Escalade, MB GL, Lincoln Nav) the QX56 was an easy choice.

There is a recall on the timing chain which if you are thinking of buying a used QX56 you will want to make sure this recall has been done.  We had ours done at 82K.  The timing chain issue can cause the engine to 1. fail if not accomplished 2. engine runs inefficiently which fouls/ clogs the catalytic converters 3. catalytic converters if not replaced will fail early to the tune of $2500 each for replacement.  The gas mileage is overstated. there is no way the QX56 will get 20MPG on highway.  I believe the newer QX80's have the EPA sticker corrected.  My advise would be to skip the infinity and buy a Tesla model X or a loaded Chevy Tahoe.,3
2954, on 11/27/16 19:35 PM (PST),EllisFSU ,2011 INFINITI QX56 SUV 4dr SUV (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Great performance/ AWFUL RELIABILITY and COMPANY," Forum, So, I am not the kind of guy to do this. I don’t just take to the interweb anytime I get excited or angered. I don’t post pictures of my dinners; I don’t forward funny cat videos. Heck, the only time I have ever tweeted was when my 7-year old kicked me in the goods. The truth is I don’t have time between clients, kids, and trips to the Infiniti service department to be doing this kind of stuff. But sometimes, things are so bad, you are left with no other choice but to stand up and make a stink. That’s the point I have reached with my Infiniti QX56. Part of me feels the need to warn potential buyers of the hell I have suffered; a larger part of me needs to sleep peacefully knowing I did not simply submit to the will of a corporation more beholden to their bottom line than they are to their customers. I will not go into great detail regarding most of the countless problems I have had with my QX56. Just know that I felt close enough to my service advisor to send him a family Christmas card. By the way, my service advisor, as well as my local service department, has been wonderful. It’s not their fault my car has had more problems than a Kardashian marriage. Really, until this most recent problem, I was content to simply never own another Infiniti product as long as I live. Then, my paint started peeling off in king-sized sheets. I mean, it’s not flaking from rock-dings, its peeling off like clothes during spring break. No big deal, right? I mean, this is obviously a manufacturing defect, so Infiniti will have no issue paying to have it repainted, right? I mean, it’ll be inconvenient, but I have gotten used to that with this car. WRONG!!!!!!! I hope you can imagine my jaw-dropping SHOCK to learn Infiniti will not pay for what is CLEARLY a manufacturing defect because paint is “not covered under warranty.” Yes, paint is not covered under warranty and I understand why. People do stupid things with their cars, so covering paint comprehensively would be problematic. However, this isn’t the result of me driving through some brush or using a particular soap for washing my car. THIS IS CLEARLY A MANUFACTURING DEFECT I AM BEING ASKED TO PAY TO REPAIR. I get it, really. As a company of profit, Infiniti does not have to pay. However, as a company of principle, they should certainly pay. I have been told by my dealership, which reached out to the “regional service rep,” that they will not pay to cover this manufacturing defect. So, I am no longer seeking coverage from Infiniti. I am not going to beg and grovel for a company to stand behind their product. I will, however, yell and scream to anybody within earshot not to buy an Infiniti automobile. Heck, I stopped by the new car lot (after leaving the service department) and had a ""buyer beware"" conversation with a family looking at a new QX80. They were quite shocked at my paint. I told them my car was a special ""leprosy"" edition QX. Laughs all around as they got got back in their car and drove off.   Needless to say, it’s become my life’s goal (not really, but a goal nonetheless), to cost Infiniti more in future sales than it would have cost them to repaint my car. That’s how free markets work. If I am unhappy with a product, I am free to let the world know. So, I also purchased the domain www.infiniteexpenses.com and will build a simple website detailing my woes and the woes of other Infiniti owners in similar situations. (Actually, there seems to be a bunch of owners of white, 2011 QX56’s facing the EXACT same problem, so there was clearly an issue in that manufacturing run). I will then circulate that domain through as many channels as possible to get my experience out. I’ll also post this in as many relevant forums as I can find. Hell, I have even designed a bumper sticker to put on my car (if you want one, send me your address and I’ll mail it out free!). As you can clearly see, I have more resources than I have good sense, but I’ll achieve my goal of having Infiniti pay one way or another. I may take out a billboard if the mood strikes me. Again, its not the money, its the principle. Now, back to my cat videos.",2
2955, on 08/03/16 06:48 AM (PDT),Andrew B ,2011 INFINITI QX56 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Sweet vehicle," So I have owned this vehicle now for 2+yrs (traded in a Cadillac Escalade); bought it used in 2014 with 28,000 miles and now have a little over 45,000 miles on it.  Thus far, love the vehicle, it handles very well, very comfortable and smooth both as driver and as a passenger.  Technology package on the vehicle is great.  Now a few of the issues that I have with the vehicle and I am comparing with my experiences with the two previous full size SUV's that I owned (2007 Yukon Denali and 2008 Cadillac Escalade) before purchasing the Infiniti QX-56 are: (1) Backup camera design is horrible.  Visibility is very terrible during the day if there is a lot of light coming into the car (very sunny day outside).  It is practically useless.  I have to look back and listen out for the parking sensors on bright sunny days.  At night time in very dark areas (no street or building lighting around), there is also very limited visibility using the backup camera (insufficient lighting).  I never had these problems with the backup camera with the Yukon Denali and Cadillac Escalade.  I had zero visibility issues both during the day and night regardless of how bright or dark it was.  In this area, GM has Infiniti beat by a long shot.  (2) Drivers and passenger side view mirrors should be able to fold in and out after the vehicle is turned off before the vehicle doors are open.  The battery should still hold a charge for about between 30 to 60 seconds.  If you forget to pull them in before turning off the vehicle, you have to start the car back up or turn on the ignition (hit the start button without stepping on the brakes).  Another feature I liked with the GM trucks I owned.  (3) Remote start should come standard with this vehicle since this is their flagship SUV.  Again, also another feature that I enjoyed with the GM trucks I owned.  (4) This is not really a big deal but the rear panel should be able to open and close in cases where you need to put something long (ladder) back there. (5) This too not really a big deal, but the third row seating should be more comfortable (should be able to fit an adult of average height and weight).  The Lincoln Navigator's (never owned but test drove and ridden in one quite a bit) third row seat is the best; there is literally no difference in comfort between the 2nd and 3rd row seats.",3
2956, on 04/22/16 19:19 PM (PDT),Dave ,2011 INFINITI QX56 SUV 4dr SUV (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Don't Buy this vehicle!!!," I love the looks and feel and driving ability of this car. However, I bought it(2011 qx56) used at 43,000 miles and at 50,000 -60,000 it needed catalytic converter, air compressor, timing chain. Thankfully we had factory AND extended warranty that covered these repairs which probably came to over $10,000 in total. Then at about 65,000 a basketball bounced on the right hand passenger review mirror and broke it to wear it hung loose. It could not be repaired, had to replaced. A new one was $1200.00 (no warranty) because of the sensors and fancy camera it costs that much. Then when my battery died and left me stranded we went down the street bought another battery to replace it the car which evidently caused the fuse link to go bad so we had to get it towed $115, get a new fuse link $200 and after I picked it up went home and realized the headlights don't come on at all so now I have to go back AGAIN to get that fixed. Oh.....and after I picked it from getting one of the other major repairs done (it was winter and cold) and the service guys turned my heat on 90+ to help the freshly shampoo'd carpet to dry  which caused a huge crack in my windshield. So needless to say this car has been a beautifully driving headache. Not to mention the deprecitiation has gone down crazy. I have always owned Toyota, Acura, Honda. Will NEVER buy another Infiniti again. Beautiful cars and they drive great but they are not dependable as far as I have experienced. I need to note that the service tech at the dealership have always been kind, fast, professional and gave me a loaner vehicle each time which was a positive experience.",2

Test drove the new MB GL and the Lexus LX. The third row seat in both of them were far smaller, and didnt handle as good. The GL did have a nicer center row, but was inferior elsewhere.

We have owned many Porsche's, BMW's, Ford Expedition, etc. This Infiniti ( 2008 QX56) is the best car we have ever owned. We purchased an extended warranty (100K additional miles) at 95k for $2400 from Carchex years ago in fear of a major catastrophe repair required before we were ready to replace "" The Box"" (one of many pet names).  I'm pretty sure we didn't use the value of the warranty before it expired at 200k It slept in the garage all night but lived outside during the day. It rides and drives like a dream and we have taken it across the country. Minimal expected wear on the interior. Other than rock chips, no damage except for a small pea size dot on the back tailgate. My 2 girls grew up in this car. When we travel, we move into the car. Knock on wood, we have never been stranded in this vehicle. It has serious get up and go for a ""bread truck"" as we sometimes lovingly refer to it. Yes, at a gas expense. We do go through the effort of only having it serviced at the local Ray Brandt Infiniti dealership (40 miles away)  where our service advisers have become like family. We have had no catastrophic failures with the engine, transmission, electrical or cooling/heating. Probably the most costly has been the struts. Then the brakes. Both I consider maintenance items. Oil changes are completed locally every 3-4K. Currently, I have 2 TPS sensors that are dead. Other than that everything on the car is operational.

The Dvd is nice and the back cabin heater/ac. The captain chairs in the 2nd row are very nice along with the push button seats. The drivers control area is well thought out.

Shocked at how nice of a car/muscle car/SUV/truck it is! This 400 ft lb of torque burns rubber and MOVES 0-60 in 7 seconds with the exhaust growl of a muscle car! The seat is as comfortable as my old Caddy Eldo seats but even better heated. Back seats heated and recline! BOSE stereo system with CD recorder built in! Have the full optional entertainment package ($3000 when new) that is amazing. So many options and gadgets that I still have not figured out how to use after owning it for 16 months.  2008 def. looks nicer than previous years with extra chrome everywhere and a much nicer interior as nice as a Mercedes S600 I once owned. Best looking SUV on the road, it has a ""buffed"" muscular look to it and an exhaust growl to match. It does have some ""blind spots"" that one must learn to watch, esp. at night with tinted windows. Just a few minor repair issues that come with buying a 9 year old SUV with 117K miles on it. Sits high, goes like a muscle car, carries 8 passengers or lots of stuff, love the power reclining rear seats. Keyless is nice. Nav. needs to be updated by dealer every few years which I have not done. Parts are expensive like all others and it is a luxury car with lots to go wrong when so heavily optioned. Gas as mentioned is bad but that's why it moves like a muscle car which I like. I did expect to get better than 12.9mpg on road trip to Phoenix from San Diego, so a little disappointed in that (3 total people and luggage only) Thought I'd get 16+. Oh well, I did not buy it for mgp, but instead for ALL ELSE. One GREAT vehicle and will keep long term, even think it looks better than the 2011 redesign (not as macho looking!)",5

Infiniti/Nissan knows that the SRS/OCS are not manufactured to function properly in some vehicles, that is why they have a recall on over 900,000 vehicles yet excluded the 2009 models including mine.  The sensor in the passenger seat is defective on some 2009 G37s and works opposite to how it was intended, it cuts off airbags when a passenger sits on the seat.  I now own a vehicle I do not feel safe in and would never put the lives of my friends and family in danger.  I purchased used less than a year ago after surviving a mva where my 1999 vehicle's airbags helped save my life.  How can I in good conscience sell it to anyone?  This should be a recall from Nissan/Infiniti as they are aware of the seriousness of severe injury or death as a result of manufacturers defect but refuse to fix on 2009.  Also has problem with melting dashboard.  Get a different year Infiniti or pass to a car manufacturer that values human life.  Just wish I had known....Addendum:  Modern Infiniti of Lake Norman talked to Infiniti USA who came through and replaced defective seat.  I did pay to get car up to date on service first but did not have to pay for seat.   Infiniti definitely cares about the safety of their customers!

So far really like the car except for a couple of complaints. The transmission jolts the car when shifting gears most of the time and the quick shift is useless.  Hesitates when changing gears and then it's like it can't decide which gear to settle into when downshifting.  Very annoying and disappointing.

I take the G37 to the back canyons every weekend, and this car never disappoints. This car comes to life to its famed character beyond 50MPH, where its 330 horsepower shines.

When you decide to get on it hard, the rear end breaks free a little sooner then you would expect, but in a very controllable and forgiving manner.

Werewolf in Sheeps Clothes!," Had been looking for a very specific 2010 Audi A8L but after 8 months of searching could not find. Had to make a buying decision and wanted a four door, minimum 325 HP and stopped by a dealer a mile from my house and noticed the G37. The first thing I noticed were the subtle muscular lines and posture of the car. When the sales rep started it and the exhaust note perked up my ears.  As I sat in the vehicle and did a quick lookup on the Vehicle specs noted that the car had 328 HP, just 22 less than the Audi, yet 1000 lbs lighter.  I got familiar with the controls then took it and was shocked at the power pulling out of the lot.  Bolted on to the interstate and immediately started realizing that the car was extremely fast, handled extremely well, and hamadryads me smile. Yes, no Quattro drive and not the size of vehicle I truly wanted but I had a cash budget and given the local market didn't turn up an Audi, I went back to the dealer and dumped the cash on his desk and bought the car. Fast forward 8 months and I have ""thugged"" virtually every car who has given me a nod. Mustang GTs, Challengers, Camaros, 535s to name a few. I am now a complete G37 enthusiast and the dual everhead cam V6 is simply badass (and though rated at 330 HP, some legit publications that have tested it state it is closer to 365 HP!!!'

Never wrecked, nothing whatsoever wrong with it but for a door seal I had to replace.  I love this car, more power than you'll ever need, to the point of breaking the rear tires loose at 75mph on damp pavement when I stepped on it hard to change lanes and the VVT kicked in, YIKES!  You can pass anything at any time, and still get 26-28mpg hwy and 22 around town.  Handling is precise and crisp without being twitchy, and it handles curves on rails, very nice seat bolsters help too.  It rides great, firm, but not uncomfortable at all to my taste.  It's helped by smooth TN roads, up in the pothole, frost freeze northern states I may have another opinion.  Seats and interior are very comfortable for the long haul, with all the usual luxury.  Interior is also very quiet, which I love, not much road noise at all.  Now for a couple minor niggles, the cruise control is not all that accurate going up and down hills, picks up speed going down, then takes 3-5mph drop below set speed to kick back in.  Also the transmission has a pretty big lag between off throttle to back on engagement.  It will scare you the first time you time you slow down and jump back on it to turn in front of someone and it doesn't go!  I've gotten used to it and know how avoid it, so it's no big deal to me now.  The only other small thing missing is a headphone jack interface to play Pandora off my phone.  Bluetooth is only available on the navigation model, and there is a usb connection in the console which works with my IPOD, but I've never been able to figure out how to play Pandora through it.  There's also a hard drive you can copy your CD's onto, so there's really no shortage of music options.

After doing further research and test drives, i was easily able to make a decision. Went with the g37x for its power, luxurious feeling interior and low maintenance cost.

These countless hours led me to the 2009 Infiniti G37, which I bought new in 2009 for $30k (list price of around $35k). I put 155,000 miles on it, with zero problems except for changing the brakes twice, the battery once, and power locks that sometimes didn't want to cooperate. Never got the locks fixed because it wasn't a big deal. I put new tires on twice, and I highly recommend the Michelin Primacy - great in the rain, and last for 60k miles. I spent a lot of time looking at various replacement options, but none had the combination of power, handling, interior space, quality, and reliability. So I traded it in last month on a 2013 G37. Just yesterday I had a $40,0000 BMW as a rental, and I was very happy to get back into my car. The used G37 is without question the best value out there. I feel bad for all the people paying high 20's or low 30's for a generic car with half the power and quadruple the problems when they could have a year-or-two-old G37 for less money.",5

At the time of purchase it had 146,000 miles. I was skeptical of the mileage but after a friend of mine had a good experience with a 2003 G35 that reached 182,000 miles and only sold it because he needed an SUV, I decided to purchase it. After all it was a great deal. The dealer I work at took the car in as a trade in and was asking $11,600 for it. Since I work there I got a deal for $10,000! This the best purchase I have ever made! The car is in great condition with nothing damaged or worn. The VQ37VHR is a very powerful motor. In fact it is the same engine from the Nissan 370z. Along with the AWD this sedan hooks up even in the rain with the traction control off. This is a very quick car not to mention a good looking one. I have had no problems with the car at all. The Bose sound system is great and has a nice balance in sound quality. The Bluetooth works flawlessly every time. I am six feet tall and the seating position is great. Trust me, I am a very picky person and I am not afraid to speak the truth. This car is exceptional. Anyone in the market for a luxury sedan needs to consider this car.

The 5-speed shifter throw is too long for my tastes.  For a sports car the 1-2 shift should be the shortest possible, and it is not.  Again, minor.

I've only put about 3600 miles on her, but every time I take it out I love the car more and more. The remark about the rear seat being cramped is wrong except for maybe head room.

My major concern was seating comfort as I'm 6'5"" and 250lbs.  And let me say this car has more seating room then the Lincoln LS I traded in.  With the wide range of seat adjustments I fit in this car with no issues either from leg room or headroom (with sunroof).  The only minor issue is the seat width is a little narrow for me but not a major inconvenience.  Back seat room is fine for occasional passengers.  My 6'3 brother fit in the back with no problem.

Excellent build quality and design. I've owned a BMW and a Lexus before. This is the best!  Not a huge fan of the analog clock in place of digital clock.

It is a real head turner on the road-- I've been stopped by strangers in parking lots and at stoplights who tell me how great looking my car is. Drive is much smoother than my G35 coupe-- quieter too. A real pleasure to drive. I agree with other posters-- don't buy this car and complain about gas mileage.

The bimmers seem quicker since the G is such a heavy car. However, the G seems more refined than the M3 which suffered from a loose and clunky differential. The G's differential is much tighter giving an overall smoother & solid feeling. However, the clutch uptake is abrupt (similar to bmw). The navigation of the G is more user friendly, even compared to the iDrive in the newer bmws. It is touch screen and voiced activated.

However, the build quality could be better on the car, where I've had a problem with the muffler in the first few thousand miles, although that was only on early models from what I've heard.

I have been getting between 15 and 17 mpg around town.  I was debating between the 35 and the 45, went with the 45 because it feels ""heavier"" when you drive it and the gas mileage is about the same (the V8 doesn't have to work as hard).

It has loads of technology and aims to please the youthful buyers it attracts. It doesn't have the road presence of my much larger Yukon, but the trade off is easier parking, improved fuel economy, and better handling. The exhaust note is music to my ears with the right amount of V8 bark. It has generous seating for four adults and reasonable cargo space. The navigation is one of the best available. The dual climate control is first rate and the backup camera is essential due to poor rear visibility. Just mash the go fast pedal before you change lanes to be sure there isn't someone hanging out in the blind spots. Don't worry as it'll outrun, stop quicker, and out handle all but the absolute top performing car from each OEM. All that performance comes at the price of comfort. Premium materials help, but a sport oriented suspension will transmit bumps. Very communicative steering is far superior to the latest numb electronic steering units on newer cars. Parts are pricey as befitting a luxury brand, but the dealership experience is worth it.The latest update on this bionic cheetah is that it never feels cheap. Construction and high quality materials hold up very well. You'll be hard pressed to find a more reliable vehicle. The required premium fuel is the cost of performance. This isn't of any real concern for the targeted affluent buyers. As mentioned earlier the maintenance is quite high with stock twenty inch wheels and performance tires, large capacity oil changes, and well hidden service items which lead to higher labor costs if you have the dealership perform the work and you will want them to do just that. Infiniti was thoughtful enough to place an inspection plate that allows you to check the condition of the difficult to change air filter which I strongly suggest you replace with a long lasting premium reusable one. With our high snow fall totals this year it was easy to see that Infiniti did there homework with the AWD. When driven responsibly it moved in the direction you asked it too without drama. Much better than the old mechanical unit in my newer Yukon with aggressive tires. Is there anything this vehicle can't do well? Bruce Wayne should drive one of these. The one down side of this vehicle isn't a fault, but is the result of it's well known performance which leads to every boy racer to rev his little engine at a stop light hoping that you will stoop to his level and demonstrate what's underfoot. It can be quite annoying. Just turn the volume of the wonderful radio up a tad bit and you'll quickly forget he's there. Ah peace at last.The vehicle now has 118,500 and continues to impress. Several upgrades have been performed during normal maintenance further increasing its performance. The only issue is that the power door lock actuators are reluctant to cycle on very hot days. This is a well documented issue with a simple fix. Knowledgable enthusiasts cast envious looks with uncanny regularity. It's a shame Infiniti doesn't currently produce a V8 version of the G platform. Oh well guess I'll just have to hang onto this one.With fourteen years of sun exposure I can say that the dash it starting to show small bubbles. This is a quality complaint that several have noticed; an expensive one as well. The HVAC mode actuator has failed which causes a very loud popping noise when the system wants to recirculate. This requires changing it to fresh air and diminishes the system output. The drivetrain is superb and still provides impressive performance. The look has trickled down to several small crossovers including the new Alfa Romeo Stelvio so it's still modern even if not keeping with the edgier designs from it's parent company Nissan.The rear reclining seats are enjoyed by passengers and helps as the seats are sport firm. If you can find a used one with low mileage then buy it after checking for abuse and the obvious cosmetics. It's a great alternative to a large SUV especially if you have a small family.",4

With a suspension that gracefully ignores bumps, the acceleration power is surprising at first.  Most of all, what makes the crossover great is all the small details.  The interior is thoughtfully laid out and surprisingly spacious.",4.75

The Jeeps pales in comparison to the FX. The FX has the best style and design of any SUV. The rear and front ends are masterpeices of design and the car is an engineering marvel. The ride is smooth, the power superb and the comfort supreme.  The one flaw is a lack of visibility in the rear window when parking..it takes awhile to determine the distance from a parked car...the rear-view camera would have been nice.  Reccomendations: Make the rear-view camera an option in itself, or make it standard on the FX; also fog lights should work with running lights.  Great car..I love it.  GCAssad",4.875

Ive test all the bad boys in its class (ML, X5, Toureg, Cayenne etc. ) The only biggest competitor that I see is the Cayenne where performance is the real factor. However the FX45 is faster than the Cayenne unless you get the turbo model But at that price, you might as will throw a turbo in the stock FX45. Overall, the FX45 was def. best bang for the buck, and performance wise.. its a class leader. If you are looking for something soft like an RX or MDX, this aint the car for you.

It’s unique design is always breathtaking-at nearly every angle, you see the designer’s passion for this car. The technology is easy to figure out, and serves its purpose well. Infiniti service is amazing, and thoughtful. The new Infiniti Q60s are using smaller, 2 liter turbocharged engines. They’re nice, but the 3.7 liter V-6 VVEL engine is incredibly fast and has an impressive exhaust note. The rear seats are not designed for anyone over the age of 10, but as long as the trip is not more than 2 hours, they will suffice. It’s a coupe, and the focus is on the cockpit.  Fuel economy is acceptable, but it is a trade off for the power. You really need to buy premium fuel- more than one mechanic has stated that it is still cheaper at the pump than at the service department.",5

The new Q60's (formerly G37) have changed the engines to a 3.0 turbo so I'll have to see how they perform in comparison to the 3.7.  Also and foremost, how much fun they are and how reliable they are before I shell out what they're asking.  I purchased this car used with 20k miles on it.  It looked new inside and out and had no accidents.  I don't have the navigation and don't need it.  It has all the other bells and whistles including embroidered leather seats which they no longer offer.  I'm seeing a lot more of these on the road now.  I also owned a 2008.",5

I'm into cars that have style, power and luxury and the Infinity G-37S has it all and then some.  Moreover, it has a price point well below other makes in the same category.  None of my Infinitys have required anything more than oil and filter change over the last five years, except for a battery replacement.  Fuel consumption is close to 20 miles per gallon in town(where I mostly drive), which I don't think is bad for a 350hp car.  It's a real treat to drive a car with paddle shifters and be able to switch from drive to sport mode.

I canceled the dealer's extended warranty after a few days, which would have been a waste of $2,800, as I suspected. Since, it is now 2017, and I have not needed any repairs, other than new tires, which was my choice for a softer grip on the street. I didn't drive it for a few weeks and had to jump start it once. That was the only inconvenience, besides the battery on the keychain dying on me, and I almost got stranded, since they didn't tell me how to start the car with a dead fob. You take the key out of the underside, open the door manually, and insert the dead fob into the dashboard above your left knee. That should allow it to start. Then order a replacement battery on Amazon and install it yourself. It's easy to do and saves a trip to the dealer and some money.  One con: the car sits too low for me and offers a poor view of the street, compared to an SUV. Getting in and out is a pain. I'm 6'2"", though. I talked to a car guy who said the Infiniti lasts a long time. Other models I have seen here, like the Range Rover Evoque, seem to always break down. So the Infinit gives some peace of mind there.

Sales of the 2005 models approached Rolls-Royce Phantom levels in the US (only an average of about 22 per state) and fewer still in 2006 (anyone have the US figure through June?) and the failure to even publish a 2006 sales brochure (Infiniti sent me a 2005), though they do e-mail you a four-page 2006 brochure in .pdf led me to this conclusion.

3469, on 11/16/15 18:57 PM (PST),Rick Sparks ,2002 INFINITI Q45 Sedan 4dr Sedan (4.5L 8cyl 5A),Mr. Q45 Still Rocks," Back in the 90's, my wife & I bought a used '90 Q45, the first year of Infiniti's new sedan competitor to Lexus, BMW, Mercedes and Cadillac. All these years later, we remember that car with great affection - understated yet classy design, beautiful interior w. lots of room (but not too big), and for the owner who loves to drive, great suspension and ride combined with a world-class 4.5 liter V8 that loved to run. And all with Japanese reliability.Lately, we've thought a lot about that early Q. When it came time to replace my 150k mi. Mercedes E320, we chose a 79k mi. '02 Q45. The '02 was the first year of the 3rd generation, but everything about the earlier Q45 still applies. Best of all, the final series Q has no real weaknesses as a used-car buy; no air suspension to leak, no Northstar engine to fail, no complex electronics and no current dealers who hate to see an older Q come through the service bay. Our local Infiniti dealer treats my 14-year-old Q as if it were a new Q70.In searching for our '02, I discovered: 1) there are relatively few 3rd gen Q45s out there - Infiniti just didn't sell many new, and 2) most 3rd gen Q45s have accumulated over 100k miles. That said, I found a relatively low mile (79k) example about 100 mi. away w. great body/paint/interior and accident-free history. Service records are always a plus, but (sadly) not that common; a pre-purchase inspection is always a good idea, as is a search for customer (& BBB) ratings of the dealer you're buying it from.For the new owner of a used Q, the climate and audio controls on the 2002-2006 series require a bit of reading in the owner's manual, but are actually very logical (if not intuitive) and work fine. The interior design, especially the dash & center console, is both gorgeous and trend-setting; the current Q70 interior design is very similar. Large, supportive seats come complete with lumbar support for the driver & are the most comfortable of any car I've owned in 45 years of driving. That includes a healthy number of BMWs, Jags and Caddys.The Q45 was designed as a grand tourer in the European tradition - fast, comfortable & stylish transportation that can devour continents. Infiniti succeeded at a price that undercut their competitors by thousands. Although some regard the 3rd gen Q45 as somewhat quirky (headlight design, HVAC interface, transmission in permanent sport mode), the car's comfort, performance and space make it a true driver's car you can live with. You won't win any economy runs with it (20 mpg in mixed driving), and given the slightly numb steering, the Q is not exactly a canyon-carver, but it will get you there in a hurry with comfort & panache to spare. Those Gatling-gun headlights are the bomb, but be sure to follow the owner's manual suggestion to avoid turning the headlights on for very short periods; that apparently will burn out the ballast much faster, which is not cheap to replace (removal of the front bumper is required.)Maintenance is straightforward - just keep the 5W40 oil changed (synthetic, of course), put on a quality set of tires (I'm running new Pirelli P7s), and basically maintain it w. fresh coolant every 3 years or so, good brake pads and new engine air & cabin air filters once a year. And don't skimp on using recommended premium fuel - that thoroughbred 4.5 liter V8 will be much happier. Keep it clean & enjoy the fact that you own one of the world's great super sedans: the Q45.UPDATE: Six months in, I'm still happily driving my '02 Q45, albeit after investing some money to bring it up to standard mechanically & cosmetically. I decided to spend $200 at my local Infiniti dealer to update the transmission software to make the throttle more responsive; they also replaced the electronic accelerator pedal w. a new design. After the upgrade, the throttle response is much better, although the transmission remains prone to stay in a lower gear too long when accelerating at anything other than a leisurely rate; it's as if it's in permanent ""sport"" mode. I also had the dealer change the transmission fluid/filter ($100) & do a proper 4-wheel alignment ($90). After the alignment, the car tracks/feels much better now going down the road.I also spent $500 to have the front bumper removed & professionally refinished/painted; the original paint was wearing 80k miles' worth of scrapes & scratches. Other expenses since purchase include new Pirelli P7s, new brake discs/pads front & rear and a new cabin air filter.  UPDATE #2: Our Q45 has accumulated 13,000 miles of daily driver use in a year with zero repair costs & no problems. Average 20.4 MPG in mixed driving; oil consumption averages 1 quart/5k mi., which seems normal from everything I've read about this engine. Fabulous car, great value, glad I bought it.FINAL UPDATE (April '17): Sold the Q a couple of months ago! Fabulous vehicle, still highly recommended, just too much car for a daily driver. Replaced it w. a 2010 VW Jetta. :)",5

It now has 165K on the odometer and in those 50 thousand miles all I've had to fix was one wheel bearing (other than routine tires/brakes/plugs).  That's fantastic.

Both Q's are wonderful cars and a joy to drive. My BIG problem with owning these cars is 1) extremely high rate of depreciation 2) VERY expensive maintenance and repairs - major service intervals approach $1000. My 99 Q has issues with warped brake rotors, driveline vibratons, steering shudder that return after being ""fixed"". Sensors go bad on the car and it costs $$$$ to replace. Example: O2 sensor (this car has 4), fixed one for $365. Knock sensor (one of 2) requires COMPLETE intake removal @ $1000. Turbine sensor leak cost $2300 to fix. It never ends.

It currently has over $225k (quarter of a million miles) and the only repairs I have had to do on the car is the power steering pump and a new radiator outside of regular maintenance like brakes, alternator, etc...The comfort is second to none, even with today's cars.

And it is comfortable! Expect 19 for city driving. A mix, you'll get 22 if you drive easily. Highway, right around 24 for me; way higher than the EPA estimate.

I had a freakish accident which caused a small fire under the hood (alternator) that happened within the first 6 months of the car, but it was fixed  and I have had no major problems at all.

Lastly for those of you with air bag light problems, there is a fix on the internet, haven't figured out how to do it yet, but it should get rid of the annoying blinking light.

I drove this car throughout my early 20s, oftentimes far too fast, and did nothing except change the oil and tires.

Don't get me wrong, German engineering is still up there but this car holds it's own. The question potential buyers of this vehicle may want to ask themselves is ""can you afford this""?. I don't mean the buying price, but the cost of maintenance. ",4.125

Had about 100K on it or so. Performance is decent but coming from a RWD V8 to a FWD V6 was a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong I love my I30, but its conditional love. This car has been an absolute nightmare. The VSS was replaced twice, MAF sensor is prone to replacement, ECM burned up due to sudden fault in the Idle Control. Suspension is very soft even for a sedan. Besides this long list of expensive i mean very expensive repairs, I enjoy driving this car. It has a very responsive throttle and gets attention where ever it goes. ",3

I come from 97 528i, and some minor features are missing, and interior quality is not as great. HID lights are all fogged out by now and barely illuminate the road. However, over 2 years I only had the following issues: replaced ECU and defective idle control valve ($500), power steering hose ($300).

Replaced wheel bearings, two new alternators, VSS sensor, starter, ignition, radiator... Fine when you punch it, but very heavy otherwise. '05 Altima V6 tromps this car with offline and during-driving quickness(but with only 23 more hp).

Excellent road car.  Fussy about tire pressures on Potenzas G009.  Too much results in hard ride.  Bose great, A/C fantastic, not much wind/road noise.  This is not a cheap car to maintain at the dealer, however I highly recommend using only the dealership for service. OEM replacement parts for this car are the only way to go.

At best I've been able to squeeze 29 or 30 mpg on long highway drives, of which I've been doing a lot of.

Cruises effortlessly on European highways with cruise control set at nearly 100mph.  Excellent midrange power at the expense of fuel economy.  Suspension is tuned for comfort; car gets unsettled during small-radius backroads turns.  After 60,000 miles only problem has been with O2 sensor, otherwise trouble- free.

This with worth the premium I paid.  That warranty was good until 100K miles and the service I received was excellent.  My complaints are that the vinyl seat edge is wearing out on the driver's side.  Everything else in the interior still looks great.

Owned BMW for past 10 yrs - two 3 series cars.  This car cannot hold the road on curves. With the great hp - cornering needs to improve.  I have driven 5 series BMW as well (same size as the M) and they hold the road. The blue tooth decides when to work or not work, phone is always connecting and disconnecting.  If you get a call when its acting up, it will lock your phone up.  Stereo system is terrible. All the speakers rattle, dealer said it is a common problem. They attempted to fix but to no use. I do not blast my radio at all.  The auto seat back and steering wheel raise upon exit will just stop working and in a few days start working again - no i did not turn off the feature. For straight open roads it does very well, except you cannot set the cruise control when going over 85 - I live in Texas the speed limits in West Texas are 85. The navigation system is not user friendly,to many screens to go through to set destination. The voice system is not much help. It""s just easier to use my phone.  The car looks nice, I have the Malbec black - it looks great in the sunlight.  The seats are big and comfy and the heat and cooling work quickly.  I just expected better handling and sound system. My son's Ford Fiesta sounds better than this.  Needless to say i wont by another Infiniti.

The performance is a mix of both BMW and Acura, while the cabin's interior cannot be compared to anything but Lexus all with all wheel drive with the bells and whistles to boot. The body will grow on you and the best part is the car is that it's uncommon and looks 100% better than the previous and more box-y M35.

It's beautiful, I've had NO mechanical problems and it's a blast to drive. CONSUMER REPORTS was right when they recommended it over the MB E350 and the BMW 5's for 4 straight years (2011-2015). Unlike other car magazines that publish reviews based on the advertising they receive from car manufacturers CONSUMER REPORTS bases their evaluation on 50 objective tests.  The M37  is so dependable that it's recommended as a used luxury car by CR. It's a perfect blend of  reliability, performance and luxury. Before  I bought the M37 I drove both the Mercedes E350 2 door Sport and BMW 5 series. I was not impressed. Both offered cachet names but not much else for the high price. The BMW was not the BMW of my father's generation. The handling was lackluster and the interior was high grade plastic and vinyl (seats). The MB E350 sport was small,had a VERY rough ride and the seats were VERY uncomfortable. Like the BMW the interior was a mixture of plastic and vinyl (leatherette?). IMHO these cars are unacceptable for the $60,00.00 list price. By contrast the M37 Sport was exactly the car that CONSUMER REPORT predicted it would be. The Infiniti was VERY, VERY AGILE and handled much better than the cachet names. The seats were not vinyl but were beautifully double stitched leather. Also the ride was surprisingly better than the more expensive Mercedes E350 sport. Infiniti got it right when they designed this car. I'm very pleased with the M37. I've gotten many complements on my car. It does evoke an unsolicited ""WOW"" response from many people and I do catch a number of TESLA owners gazing at my car. I've been down to the dealership earlier this year and saw the new version of the M37. It's apparently the same car with new body work. A very handsome design.Conclusion: don't place your trust solely in  car magazine/car website reviews. I have purchased many cars over the past 30 years based my decisions on CR's recommendations and have never been disappointed ...... my advise do a lot of reading and do some driving",5

Smoother ride and power response from the 2017. Infiniti added two more speakers for a total of 16 but I don't notice any difference. The sound was great already in the 2014 model.

I have had it for 10 months and driven in snow, rain and dry conditions.  Mountains and flat ground.  The thing has been great in all conditions, even in a mini blizzard!  You have to watch the throttle in bad weather, or use the economy or snow modes but otherwise it handles great.  I find myself going over the limit a bit more often when accelerating on an on-ramp, it just gets to speed so quickly if you aren't paying attention, even faster if you have it in sport or sport+ mode.  I typically drive around in standard mode.  I initially used the economy mode but realized it didn't seem to make a big difference in fuel economy.  Speaking of, I average 22-24 MPG with a good mix of city and highway.  I play with the speed a bit but I'm not racing every car I pull up next to at a stop light either.  I have had it back to the dealer three times.  First was for the Bluetooth system.  It would not connect properly to my old LG G4 even though they advertised it would.  They went through the Bluetooth system and couldn't find anything and finally told me to go away that there wasn't anything they could do for me.  Now with my new (Samsung S8) there haven't been any issues.  Second trip was for the first oil change.  Third trip was due to a notice I got in the mail about a computer re-programming (no big deal).  Otherwise I haven't had any issues.  I was a littler nervous about the run flat tires and no spare.  I got a nail in one of the tires and saw that it was $465/tire for the OEM tires.  Luckily the nail didn't puncture the air chamber and I didn't have to replace the tire.  There are cheaper run flats but I have been impressed with the tires, not sure I want to spend that for replacement tires when that time comes.  Overall for being a fairly large car, it handles well and has a stupid amount of acceleration, even at highway speeds.  I love the flat torque curve.  I was a little worried about having some buyers remorse but so far I have been super happy with the car!",5

As of today the month has come and gone and still no car and no idea when I would get it back. Inifiniti customer care has to be the worst in history. I have been lied to and my calls have gone unanswered. They tell me dates, then when the date passes I have to call and then im told another date with no explanation as to why the change. Ive searched the internet and found that the DCU is an on going issue for infiniti since 2014 so they know about it, but when I originally asked if this is something that happens alot, I was told no. This has been my worst purchase ever. The look , power and handling of the car is fantastic but the unreliability of the electronics and the terrible customer service makes this a bad buy.

My previous car was a G37 IPL, so I will mostly compare this to that and the other two cars I cross shopped this with, the BMW 440iGC/340i and Lexus GS350 F Sport. It's definitely faster than the IPL, but it doesn't feel as sporty. I can't figure out why, but I've narrowed it down to either the tires being different or because the IPL had a LSD. It just doesn't feel that great in the corners. The acceleration is really good, though. I mainly drive on the highway and it's really useful for when you have to speed up to change lanes. From what I've read, the 400HP ranking is actually underrated. But still, I actually preferred the cars I was comparing this too. I really wanted a Lexus GS, but when it came down to price, there was really no decision at all. They have some insane deals going on. The sticker on mine was $57K. The Lexus and BMW I was looking at were $59K. My monthly lease payment is $250-350 lower with the Infiniti. My payment is actually $50 lower than what it was for my IPL and this has a lot more power and technology. The gas mileage is pretty good too. I get 24mpg in Sport mode and 25 in Normal. One time I was running low on gas, so I took it easy on the pedal and I got up to 30mpg. So in conclusion, the car looks great, handles okay, has a lot of power, interior is comfortable with a good amount of space, has all the new technology, and even gets pretty good gas mileage if you don't mash the peddle. And they usually have really good deals going on, so it's great value for the money.",4

The Bluetooth was useless, it went through brakes pretty fast and gas mileage wasn't great, but other than that it was a great car.  So, when it was time to get a new car, I bought the first model year of the Q50 hybrid.  Over the life of the car the drive-by-wire steering failed, the audio system never worked properly, the Bluetooth was useless, the transition from electric to gas was very rough, the gas engine would suddenly rev up while sitting at a stop light shaking the car, the car would actually speed up if you didn't push down on the brake hard enough, the car would shudder when accelerating out of a turn with neither gas nor electric engine knowing what to do and the mud flaps kept falling off.  I participated in two Nissan factory studies on engine performance and the exhaust system, which really made me feel like I was driving the beta version of this car.  After being told repeatedly ""that's just the way the car was designed"", I learned to live with all its deficiencies.  I was planning on selling the car before 100,000 miles, but since it hadn't really held its value very well, I decided to just drive it into the ground.  I didn't have to wait very long.  At 101,806 miles, 1,806 miles beyond the warranty, the hybrid battery overheated and needed to be replaced.  (I was one of 5 towed into the dealership that day with the same problem.)  That ""part"" cost $12,000!  With labor to install it, the total price was going to be $14,000.  The appraisal I'd gotten from CarMax just 200 miles earlier was $11,000.  Obviously it made no sense to repair it.  The dealership, Infiniti of Montclair, had no interest in helping me and suggested I get an attorney to escalate the matter.  Despite having owned and faithfully serviced Infiniti cars for the previous 11 1/2 years, Infiniti consumer affairs refused to buy the car back for a fair trade-in value or to even help out on the cost of the new battery.  I wound up having to sell this $50,000 luxury automobile with 101,806 miles on it for salvage value.  DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY OTHER INFINITI PRODUCT.",1

This car is very quick, nimble and fun to drive. I especially like merging into fast moving traffic. The acceleration will push you firlmy into your seat.

The performance is great, engine is very strong, transmission is super smooth and the brakes work very well too. The seats can be uncomfortable on longer rides, my FX had much comfier  ones.  I have a spare tire and the trunk is a lot smaller which is a little inconvenient at times. The headlights work extremely well and are very bright. The navigation isn’t bad in my opinion but I don’t use it much. It also annoys me that you can’t use it while driving but I guess that’s common. The car takes about a minute or two to boot up but it doesn’t bother me. I’ve never tried to use the apps so I can’t comment on that. The car has given me zero issues as far as reliability and I don’t intend it to. I’ve never had an issue with my previous Infiniti’s. The back wheels tend to slip a little in wet weather but it does handle good in the snow. Overall I would recommend and I think it makes a great used car  ",4

I own a BMW X5, and a  BMW CIC, and have owned BMWs and Mercedes for many years.  This Q50S is as fun to drive as either of my  vehicles, as well as all of the vehicles I have ever owned.When my wife and I decided to buy another car we spent months researching BMW 535 xi, and Mercedes c300 sport 4matic and had taken a few out on test drives.Both are nice, but none were just right.  As we researched additional vehicles my wife came across an Infiniti Q50S, which we also noticed that there was only one sport model for sale within a 400 miles radius.   That got our interest.  On a Friday afternoon we went to see this somewhat hard to find car, and drove the car for a couple hours and returned to the dealer.  That night we continued researching, and by Saturday morning we went back to the dealer to purchase the car.   Have not regretted it once.  Beautiful, comfortable,  strong running car and drives better than any other comparable vehicle I have ever driven.",5
4009, on 08/04/17 06:29 AM (PDT),Louise ,2014 INFINITI Q50 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Disappointed - some major issues," Bought the car at Infiniti in Georgia with just over 10,000 miles. It's a 2014 and I bought it in mid 2015. I average about 60 miles per day. Here are the problems: 1 - about 8 months after I bought the car so in 2016, I noticed the window button having cracked. Doesn't affect the use, but I feel the crack every time I go to use it. Shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car. 2 - in late 2016, the driver side window started making a horrid squealing sound when it gets wet and it's opened/closed. Again...shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car. 3 - the back seat row has the middle foldable cup holder that comes out of the back and behind it is a piece of what seems like a sturdy piece of plastic fold-able piece separates the trunk and the seat when the cup holders are down. Well this broke and came out the second time the cup holder was used. Shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car in my humble opinion. 4 - at about 59,500 miles the check engine light came on and upon starting the car excessive white smoke comes out of the exhaust. Made appointment with dealership and after 6 hrs they can't find ANYTHING wrong other than it's about 4 quarts low on oil and it needs back breaks. They must have reset the check engine light. A week later, engine light comes back on and I take it back to dealer at 60,003 miles. This is where magic happens. An hour into sitting at the dealer, they discover the engine is so full of sludge that I just plain and simple need a new engine. It's worth to point out that bumper-to-bumper expires at 60,000 miles.  Amazing. Now we have to argue that we should not pay for the engine. It was brought in while under bumper-to-bumper and really, a new engine shouldn't happen at this price and age of a ""luxury"" car!! Of course I'm being accused of not changing oil frequently enough, however they will be receiving receipts to prove that I've done my part. 5 - 4 months ago I had the back brakes changed and now are being told I urgently need new brakes again. Should break pads wear down in 4 months? Never owned a car where the breaks wear in 4 months and my driving habits/patterns hasn't changed much in the past 15 years. 5 - the back up camera doesn't always work. Some days it just chooses to be black until next start up. For me, these are too many problems for a car in this price range. I have owned a Nissan Xterra and a QX80 and I have loved the durability and quality, but this car has made me skeptic of the brand and quality. I buy my cars and I keep them for years. The Xterra I had for 12 years with near 200,000 miles and never had any issues other than regular maintenance. The Q80 I had for 18 months before trading in for a smaller more gas efficient Q50. Disappointed in the brand and the declining quality, along with poor Inifiniti customer service from both dealer and corporate. Next car will be trying a Tesla and hoping for better quality and care on that one since Infiniti has disappointed.",3

I love driving this car.  The handling is beautiful.  The brakes STOP the car very quickly. You should consider Infiniti more of a luxury sports car than a comfort car.   The front seats are soft on my butt and legs, WAAAAY better than our Mercedes GLK 350 which literally cause me pain in about 5 minutes of driving it.  I find the electronics intuitive, without the need to read a manual, which is totally different from my wife's 2014 Mercedes.  I love, love, love to drive this car.   The suspension is for driving fast in canyons, not to be confused for a fluffy marshmallow that you get in other luxury road cars. It handles bumps decently, about as good as my wife's Mercedes GLK 350, maybe even a little better. The MPG is reflective of the fact that Infiniti is squeezing EVERY bit of horsepower that they can out of this engine. If you want MPG, you need to get the Nissan Altima version of this car with 60 less horsepower.  The slow booting of the BlueTooth is mildly annoying, but I get to listen to that great exhaust note in the meantime :-) .  It has a nice little rumble when you start it up. This car was manufactured in 2014, so it may have less problems than those that were ""2014"" actually manufactured in 2013 (I hope).  I live in UT and have to drive up a steep, snowy hill in the wintertime that my FWD Camry barely makes on some days. I didn't want an SUV, which are more expensive anyway, and the price point was $12,000 dollars less than an AWD V6 Lexus.  I bought this as a Certified and bought the extended warranty, because I didn't want to pay when expensive electronics fail and I knew that Infiniti isn't as reliable as my Toyota's.  Caveat:  I've owned this less than a week, I can only speak about driving the car and nothing about reliability. The AC compressor started to howl when the climate control was on and they replaced it for a new one.  Within 3 months, it started to make noise again and it's getting louder so I will get it replaced again. If money wasn't an issue, I would have bought a Lexus GS.  If money isn't an issue with you, I would recommend that you buy a Lexus because the reliability will be light years ahead of this.6 month update. I've put about 7k miles on it with a couple long road trips.  I still looooove driving this car and I giggle whenever I stomp on the throttle (which I do all the time). I wish that the suspension was a little softer, but it's supposed to be for cornering and it does that very well.",5

4014, on 08/26/16 07:38 AM (PDT),Kevin ,2014 INFINITI Q50 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Good car  - Researched a ton before buying!," I read the reviews on here and was nervous about buying the car. My wife and I wanted a 4 door sedan because we already had the Explorer Sport (large SUV). I bought the 2014 and wanted the '15 because of the so so rating s on the '14 Q50... but this car was too good of a deal to pass up because it only had 6K miles on it (Bought Used -  prior owner only leased). I have not had any issues with the car since I have owned it ( 1+ Year.)    The biggest complaint about this car on these reviews has been the electronics...GOOD NEWS! there is a software update for the electronics.. however it still has some really minor bugs.  Example: When you start up the car its takes my car approximately 43-46 seconds for the apps to load. With this includes the rear camera ""drive aid"" lines. So if you hop in your car you can still use the reverse camera but the ""drive aid"" lines wont show up until your car software has loaded which again takes almost 1 minute. So this is occasionally annoying but not enough for me to hate the car. Other than that, the layout of the electronic is really nice. I am a simple guy who wanted a sharp looking car that had some kick to it ( this car definitely has some speed to it). I also wanted a car that when you sit in it, you are impressed by the look of the dash and the display which the double screens is really sharp. The one real knock I would have on the car is the lack of storage. Also, if you are over 6 foot - this car may be too tight for you but still check it out. I'm 5'11 (200lbs) and feels good but at times a little cramped.  I'm not just talking about the trunk, I am talking about in the cabin too. the glove compartment is really small and the armrest storage is not deep at all. Also, the baby seat fits in the car but isn't as tight as I would personally like it... then again we take the Explorer for most long trips with the kids...Summary really fun car to drive and I wouldn't stress too hard on the electronics.",4

I am not going to get into the widely reviewed issues with the rushed out, garbage InTouch system or the take you life in your hands DAS steering wonder.  On the good side, the car is very attractive, well designed and performs well. That's where it ends.  The noise level on the inside is equal to that of riding on a train.  The factory supplied (long gone) run flat tires are noisy as hell, are blow out prowen (4 in 2 years). The passenger side seat rattles, the backup and front cameras are total mud and have long delays going on and going off.  All of these issues when taken into the dealer and logging complaints with Infiniti have been answered with the typical Infiniti response "" CAN NOT REPLICATE""Now 27 months into a 39 month lease my car has been the shop for 5 weeks.  The brake pedal will sink to the floor after a 20 mile or so drive. The car does stop, but it stops long and feels unstable. The dealer has replaced the master cylinder after 3 times of doing nothing except for giving me the old "" CAN NOT REPLICATE"" Now it is the shop again waiting for define intervention from Infiniti.On top of that there is well known issues with the airbag system on this car. 3 Recalls later and 2 malfunction lights I can't say with confidence that they work.In the end, if you are looking for a quality car in the $55,000+ range and you have any value for your sanity and the life of you and your loved ones, run away from this car, this manufacture and their dealer network.  I thought I would never write such a review on Infiniti.  They have betrayed me and thousands of faithful followers.",2
4016, on 07/07/16 07:49 AM (PDT),Michael ,2014 INFINITI Q50 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Very Disappointing," I was one of the first buyers of the Q50 at the end of 2013 and I bought it because I wanted a sedan and loved the styling. There are several problems with the Q50 but first, the things I like. I definitely have felt safe in the car despite having to have it towed (only once) because the steering started to click it couldn't seem to find it's feet. This only happened once and Infiniti fixed it and paid for the tow. It's a solid car. However, it rides rough, it's noisey, and the worst part is that display/navigation is very unresponsive. It's incredibly annoying to push on the screen and taking as long as 10 seconds to accept the response. I've had the car now for 3 1/2 years and Infiniti has yet to correct this. Whoever designed where the USB port was put must have been a contortionist because it's almost useless. The navigation is stupid and not at all intuitive. Additionally, for the life of me, I cannot understand why I can't make ""Eco-Drive"" the default??? You always have to start in ""Standard"" mode. I believe the Q70 drives better and will consider it when my lease is up but unless I were to get a screaming deal, I probably would move on to another brand.",2

Two thumbs up.2 cars ago I had a 2010 VW GTI. Loved it, 'til I drove it (almost literally) to the ground. It had to have a new engine at 80k mi, so instead, I was then in the market for a new vehicle. I've always liked smaller cars and their handling and steering, so this was somewhat of a big step to take to go with a ""mid-size sports luxury sedan.""I had the 2014 Q50 for a year and I really liked it; I upgraded to a 2015 Q50 with a few more options (they took my 2014 as a trade-in). I'd never driven an Infiniti before the 2014 Q50, but my friend has/had a Nissan Maxima, another friend had an Infiniti M37, and a friend has an Infiniti EX37. My friends' opinions about the reliability of Infiniti kind of persuaded me to try it, and I'm glad I did.It is ""less connected"" to the road, especially with the way I want to drive, but I still enjoy it, but this means a softer, smoother ride--a comfy drive. My friend even commented on the smooth suspension as a passenger (although, he had a BMW 3-series, so that's a pretty big difference). The big 327HP V6 engine is pretty powerful. With a 3 adult passengers and a trunk full of luggage, the Q50 still has no trouble accelerating quickly.The Bose surround sound is pretty nice; very similar to Nissan's. You have to play around with the sound settings to get it just the way you like it (took me about a week). Sometimes the bass can be too loud; depends on what kind of music you listen to.Navigation is decent. Back-up camera is good (and the display is big too).Note: There is a big difference between the non-premium version and the premium version of the Q50, the premium version has steer-by-wire, which gives it a much more disconnected feel. You get used to it after a while (of all the loaner cars I've ever gotten), but they are drastically different. My Q50 does not have steer-by-wire. If money were not an obstacle, I would've gotten the Q50S for the sport suspension/tuning.",5

I thought they were a class act but they are not.  After a long period of denial, they finally acknowledged they had a problem with the smell coming from the drainage system around the sunroofs of the Q50.  Once they replaced it, the smell lingered for a while but eventually went away.  Unfortunately, they wouldn't do anything about the electronics.  Still slow to load and buggy as can be.  So, where even cheap cars will have guide lines on their backup cameras as soon as you shift, with the Q50 you have to wait like two minutes.  The clock will sometimes show only a face with no hands because the computer has lost the time/date.  The radio stations you've programmed will sometimes just disappear.  The automatic climate control will just stop functioning and you have to reboot the computer.  Most of the available functionality and features won't work (internet, email, text, etc.)  None of it is end of world stuff...just annoying for the most expensive car I've ever purchased/leased.  To be fair, I enjoy driving it as far as driving goes.  The power is there when you want it, it's comfortable, no complaints there.  Still like the way it looks, too.  The headlights don't reach out enough on low beam which can be hazardous, though.  I've noticed a few times that the sensor for the passenger seat airbag wasn't working properly and, as it turns out, I just received a notice of a recall on that issue.  I don't regret getting it, I enjoy driving it, but every time I consider that I could have purchased a much cheaper car with more features and functionality, I feel like it was a mistake I won't make again.  I will not buy a car that doesn't work fully again or from a company that has the nerve to say ""that's just the way it was designed"" when something is clearly not right.

However, when in traffic, decelerating, or at slower speeds, if speeds are demanded, the car will drag horrendously. It simply will sit there and go through the motions before reacting to the demanded power (between the downshifting, and the turbo charging, it is extremely slow to respond). That is probably because it is mostly relying on turbo power when it is in motion or decelerating,  and it is when the turbo lag issue shows up.  MPG is far from the ""estimated"" values advertised. I personally drive about 65% city, 35% highway, and I get an average of 17.3 MPG. Everybody is amazed at the technology offered by this car, I'm like ""meh"". The redundant systems contradict each other, are really unnecessary, and are really buggy. For example, there is no way to set a specific app, or app function, as it will reset each time you start the vehicle. The Infiniti drive mode selection is not harmony with the other drive mode selection that is selected separately. You can set one at ""sports mode"" and the other on can remain on “standard”, and vice versa – no alignment.   Also, these car's depreciation rate is probably one of the worst for Japanese cars. The review view camera software freezes constantly (I've had the unit replaced twice), the systems resets quite often, sometimes while driving, and the electronic clock shown is probably the brand killer (especially for those who really appreciated good clock workmanship from Infiniti), yes electronic technology the car is loaded with, not a big deal.

Loved every aspect of the car. Infiniti introduced a 3.0L TT Engine last year and so I made the switch (I lease my cars - the best way to go!) I absolutely love the new engine! The throttle/acceleration response is to the point and almost instant! I drive this car daily back and forth to work and some fun weekend drives and am very happy with it! This time, I added the Driver's Assistance package to give me some safety features and I'm glad I did it. The only thing that I dont like (it has more to do with my personal preference - nothing wrong with the feature itself) is that the forward collision warning and emergency braking assist kicks in when I'm zipping in and out of traffic. I know I can turn this feature off but for the 10-20 seconds of ""fun"" driving, I wouldnt want to keep having to go to the settings to turn the feature of, even though it can be turned off just by turning the Traction OFF. This car is very smooth and it can get up to speed in no time so just in case... I never turn the traction control off. Over all... very happy with the change and upgrade.

However, handing is awful, worse than any other car I have owned or driven, including SUVs!Q50 is not new to power steering foes.  2015 has its issues with Direct Adaptive Steering.  2016 has gone to electric assisted power steering on the Sports model with the second generation DAS being an option.  Being well aware of the issue with the first generation DAS, I elected to get base electric power steering.The car, however, wanders whichever way the road takes it, which is specifically evident at highway speeds.  If you hold the steering wheel perfectly straight, the vehicle starts pulling on one direction, after correcting it, it pulls in the other.  We have seen number of reviews on infinitiq50.org forum about this issue, some owners indicating that Run Flat Tires (RFTs) are causing this behavior.I don’t know for certain and I’m not willing to replace tires on the brand new vehicle.  In few months I will trade it in and get something else, although at a loss.Other than this issue and few deficiencies with the infotainment system, such as lack of useful applications and slow response, this car has been good.

I, like others, was worried about the acceleration, with this being a turbo driven(?), smaller engine.  While I think perhaps this new one might have a little less grunt if you're already going 40 or 60, off the line, this thing is like a vomit-inducing rocket.  There's a turbo?--I sure can't tell.  Yes, the steering is a bit wonky at first but I think I might grow to like it--as of right now I'm ambivalent about it.  It's like it fights your initial move on the wheel and then slightly keeps it where you move it.  Weird.  I haven't really had a chance to test them out but the brakes don't feel quite as utterly and mind-blowingly amazing as they were on my g35x.  Those things were absolutely ridiculous though.  I don't think I ever put my foot all the way to the floor.  These ones feel a lot more civilized but I think if you do put your foot to the floor that's when they'd really clamp down?  We shall see.  The interior is mostly a work of art--I'm SO glad they changed the colors away from that amber/orange color (gross).  However the dual screens are kinda weird.  I hope there's a way to just turn off the GPS screen (haven't found it yet), 'cause I'd rather not have it on all the time.  I also think it's pretty bizarre that you can't change the default driving mode (I have actually verified this one).  I'd much rather have it start up in Eco and what's the point of having a personalized driving mode if you have to click three times to get to it each time you start up the car?  Also seems strange that they don't have a main mid display mode that shows current MPH (that could be one thing I just haven't found yet, but I've definitely toggled through all the screen options.)

The power of the V6 twin turbo is amazing given the HP rating, so much quicker than other 300 hp cars I have owned. Guessing its due to the turbos offering torque coming on strong at just 1500 rpms. Maybe it's under rated? Anyway, very happy with nearly everything. Given a magic wand I would ask that blind spot monitoring and other the safety items be standard fare. Also it should be real leather! Sticker was 45k but got it down to just 38.5k.",5

That car had some issues (most notably the computer), but when my lease was up I decided to give the Q50 another try.  I absolutely love my new Q50.  The computer issues have all been resolved and I don't notice any of the issues I had with my last one.  Even though the engine is a bit smaller, the turbo gives the car plenty of power.  It also handles like a dream.  The sports seats provide great support.  And I love all the technology.  After having two Q50s, I can't imagine owning a car without the surround view cameras.  But best of all, the dealers were bending over backwards to move the cars over Labor Day weekend.  The final cap cost on my new lease was over $10k below sticker (with the only upfront payment on my part being the customary drive offs).  I would highly recommend this car.",4

4069, on 01/26/17 22:13 PM (PST),Thomas Gaydos ,2016 INFINITI Q50 Red Sport 400 Red Sport 400 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 7A),The Ultimate Sleeper Sedan," The Q50 Red Sport 400 needed to convince me to buy it...and it did. Coming off of a 2013 Infiniti M37xS lease (Q70 S AWD in modern nomenclature), I was looking to downsize. I leased the M37, a very large car, opportunistically because Infiniti had a great lease deal on the loaded models, but the truth is that I liked my G37s much better. The convincing came after driving some tough competition in the form of a BMW 340i and Audi S4, both of which I liked for various reasons. The first car I test drive was actually a Q60 Red Sport coupe loaded up with the DAS steering and all sorts of active safety tech. The interior was red with optic white trim. it was gorgeous. The car fast, composed, and a lot of fun. The steering was good, but still a bit video-gamey for my tastes. I had to deactivate much of the electronic safety wizardry because it drove me nuts. The next car was what I fell in love with; a Q50 Red Sport sedan, black on black, with only the Premium Plus package and a couple other select options added on to the standard Red Sport goodies. The black with the dark gray 19"" rims is a badass look and the black interior with the textured shodo aluminum trim is much more sporty than the wood interior treatment. The best part - besides the bonkers engine - is that the standard steering with electric-assist is MUCH better than the DAS, but still offers a couple of different settings. What won me over was the the combination of how the car drives and that I liked the interior and in-car tech better in the Infiniti. The first impression that you get when driving a Red Sport is that the engine is an absolute monster. I've owned and driven some fast cars and I think 400hp is under-rating this engine. It could be that it feels even faster because the torque comes on so early (1500) with a broad peak (6200) and that the AWD variant I have delivers all of that power at any time, but wow...this thing HAULS! The drive modes (SNOW, ECO, Standard, Sport, Sport+, Personal) significantly alter the personality of the car. SNOW mode is for the deep stuff. It essentially locks the car into 50/50 split and softens torque application, ECO actively resists aggressive driving and is perfect when driving elderly relatives, Standard mode softens the suspension, steering, throttle, and shifts and is perfect for general cruising, Sport makes the suspension stiffer, steering quicker, and everything feel much more aggressive, Sport + mode is hooligan mode and dials back the traction control. Personal mode allows individual settings for Steering, Suspension, Shifts/Throttle (I like everything dialed up expect standard suspension for highway driving, for instance). In all modes not SNOW or ECO, the Red Sport wants to run. I've already logged 4.48s 0-60 run and 12.95 quarter at 109.1mph according to Vbox in my limited testing. The interior is technically impressive with it's 2 touch screens and 3rd color screen between the gauges. Some complain that the InTouch system is difficult to use, but after a short time it becomes second nature. The app connectivity is beyond pathetic (only Facebook Check-in and Events, and Google Online Search apps) and is waaaay behind the competition, and the lack of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto is shocking, the bluetooth and USB connectivity, the easy-to-use navigation system, and the solid design of the overall interface make it a positive experience. The Bose 14 speaker XM/HD Radio/FM/AM system is impressive and is superior to any of the other Bose systems I've experienced in other Infiniti vehicles. It was also the best audio system of the cars I test drove. Overall, the interior is very comfortable with soft leather and high quality switchgear everywhere you touch. This Q50 has the G37 character that I felt the 2014 model lacked. It's aggressive and always wants to attack the next straightaway, curve, or onramp. The engine sound is addictive and it'll pin you back in your seat. Check this one out if you want a true performance sleep that also happens to be a heck of a value.",5

I knew that they had the G-35 series which were popular in the 2 door version. I was not impressed by the 4 door models..too small for my taste. When the Q50 3.7 came out my wife leased one and I started driving it occasionally. She absolutely loves it and I fell in love with the Q50 series as well. When the Q50 turbo came out and I had an opportunity to road test one I actually got it that day! It's perfect 2017 Q50 RS 400 twin turbo all wheel drive! What an amazing car for the price. It's a rocket period! Put it in Sport + and you literally need to hold yourself together because by the time you realize what's going on mostly likely the speedometer is way past 100mph. I have no complaints about the car. It has power, looks sharp, comfortable seating, and it has so many option of driving that it's a ball to drive. Mine only has the navigation option and that's it.

I have black on black and it turns heads.  The reviews are correct:  there is no turbo lag.  The steering is a little different feel, but I'm coming out of 15 yrs of SUV driving.

I came across the q50 liking the old G models. ENded up with the Q because of the boring feel of the genesis. The q50 is marginally faster only because the transmission tuning is terrible at best. Pedal to the floor my 06 IS350 and the genesis sedan both downshift instantly to the right gear and puts the power down. The Q50 on the other hand has to build the revs up from cruising around 2k rpm's to about 6k to rev match, and it feels like an eternity. It never really knows what gear to go into when trying to do a smooth pass from 40 to 55 mph. I have reset the ecu so it could relearn based on my driving, it has improved but is still erratic. It either stays in a high gear then just bogs or downshifts too much and jumps out where you have to come off the gas quickly to compensate.The premium Bose system is awesome much better than the earlier version in my old Maxima. I listen to a variety of music and it handles everything pretty well. I added an additional sub just to get those deeper lows but the sound is not lacking from factory, its crystal clear. The apps are a gimmick its best to use your phone when your parked versus having the intouch system do a google search. USB and ipod work very well and have clean sound and amplification. Bluetooth audio works seamlessly and gives access to phone for browsing on the screen versus using the actual phone.Build quality is not on par with lexus or bmw parts feel a bit cheaper and less sturdy. Cabin noise is low even at highway speeds. tire noise is not bad for run flats but the ride quality greatly suffers. For a 55 series tire it rides like a 35 minus the performance benefits. I will be changing to standard tires once these wear out. plus the 17 inch wheels look too small for the car 18s or the 19 inch sports are a much better option.Trunk space is marginally bigger than my is350 but the backseat is far more spacious. If the new Lexus IS wasn't so ugly i would have looked into one but i feel like i will go back to lexus versus Infiniti. Possibly even move to BMW before i buy another Infiniti. The q50 is no where near a bad car but it has a lot of bugs that need to worked out. THE GAS MILEAGE IS ALSO NO WHERE NEAR STATED. I get average 22 with 80% highway (70-80mph) 20% city (45mph). Driving the same routes/ speeds my is350 averages 25 highway and 18 city. the q50 is around 23 highway using premium only.",4
4073, on 04/25/16 22:50 PM (PDT),FotG ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Hybrid Hybrid Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid 7A),"Unpredictable acceleration, uneven stops"," There is very little consistency from where you put the pedal and how the car accelerates. The standard transmission mode is the most consistent and the most driveable. The sport mode is so wildly unpredictable that it's pretty much unusable. Sometime the car takes off like a rocket, and some times there is a 2-3 second delay before anything happens.  The braking is uneven and when between 30 and 40 miles per hour there is a sudden decrease in acceleration force and the brake pedal has to be pressed much harder. The transmission is too aggressive at shifting up to higher gears making it hard to maintain a constant speed. I read the reviews of this car and saw it was a love it or hate it kind of car, but I was not expecting it to be so unpredictable. Strangely enough, nearly all of these problems go away if you shift manually, but it also disables EV mode. Software in the car seems rough around the edges and as if it was rushed to production. They are typically small problems but they get annoying after awhile. Ex: dash screen and top screen remember what you last set them to, bottom screen doesn't. Won't remember your selected drive mode. One thing I do like is the direct adaptive steering. But only in the heavy/quick mode. The standard mode gets twitchy when making quick left then right turns (such as an apartment parking lot).The bottom line, I would not buy this car again, acceleration and braking are too unpredictable, which are consistent with a surprisingly high amount of car reviews. I didn't notice any of these issues in the test drive. My advice is get a weekend demo if you are looking into this car.",2
4074, on 04/24/16 23:32 PM (PDT),Nick J ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Hybrid Hybrid Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.5L 6cyl gas/electric hybrid 7A),Probably the best car in its class," A lot of reviewers and car magazines like to brag on and on about the road feel and handling of a BMW 3 series. But most people in the real world aren't driving their car on a racetrack, a mountain road or trying to set a lap time. The Audi A4 doesn't even compare to this car in any way. This is more spacious, more powerful, and the quality of the material and fit and finish is on par. The S4 however, is a better car. The same story with the 3-series. When compared to a 328, the Q50 is definitely the better car. A 335 is a better performance machine, but the ride and comfort is sacrificed in the name of performance. If you're looking for a great balance of luxury and sport, but you don't want to fork over $50k or more (Audi S4, BMW 335i, etc.) This is the best car in its class.",4

I did change out the run flats for conventional tires which softened the ride a bit. AWD system works great here in Minnesota.  Electric motor provides a ton a torque for quick acceleration. My lease will be up soon but I’ll probably change to something with a bit more room.  Lack of storage is a downside. ——This car was panned pretty heavily when it came out in '14.   There were some first generation issues that for the most part have been fixed.  Great highway ride.  Not a fan of run-flat tires - probably my only gripe.  Steering system is awesome.  There were a lot of critics of the wireless steering in terms of feel.  You would have to test it yourself to see but personally I like it.  Long drives don't wear on you.    Cross winds don't impact your driving line.  Bumps/potholes don't jar the steering wheel.  And the power the hybrid delivers is impressive.  Not to mention pretty good mpg as well.  Add in a nice audio system and all-wheel drive and you have a great ride.,5

I will write my upfront and honest review about the vehicle after putting it to the test the past 3 days. Please keep in mind I come from a 2010 535i RWD Sport. First impressions the Q50s seems like a top competitor in the sport sedan market , it is anything but. The acceleration isn't anything impressive , the car severely lacks torque and it shows. The cornering in 'AWD' kicks in when needed and is absolutely horrendous. It causes severe understeer  and instability. The ride feels very cheap and unstable as well. The seats aren't great and overall the interior feels cheap. The Bose 14 speaker system could be better as well.  There are other little things like non power steering wheel with out the - Deluxe Pkg.. I am sorry but for a mid 40s sedan to have a manual adjusting steering wheel is sad. If you want a reliable commuter car -Q50s ( I say the term 'S' lightly haha) is for you.

Premium leather in my G Leatherette in the Q (not a bad thing).  Memory seats, lumbar support on driver side in the G not for the Q.

4104, on 09/22/15 21:28 PM (PDT),JB ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Sedan Sport 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Bought my q50s awd with Nav and Deluxe package.," I got my q50s awd early of September. First of all, car's performance is the best within this price range. In terms of accerelation, braking, and handling, they are good enough to be called ""Japanese BMW"".I also own 2015 Acura TLX with SH-AWD and compare it to Q50s, TLX has much better comfort ride quality. Q50S's noise is quite noticeable and legroom, head room and back seats are not big enough as TLX. There is a lot of controversy on Direct Adaptive Steering system and to be honest, most of drivers would not even notice and it also offers precise and quick handling. Please do not mind about this system. However, the fact that you have to get all the way to tech package (you have to get another two packages in order to get this)  in order to get simple safety features such as blind spot monitoring system is quite annoying and its back up camera seems to fuzzy specially during the night (my 2014 honda civic ex has much better quality). However, this car still has a lot of standard features that are usually optional in some of other competitors. Q50S suppose to be sport car and I think Infiniti has done a great job with that. If you want comfort, smooth and easy riding, this car isnt great for you. Q50s is really for driving enthusiast who drives a lot to be afraid of owning BMW. BTW, if you are going to get Q50, make sure to get ""S"". its worth the price ! 19inch wheel, 4piston caliper, special front bumpers and sport front seats that also have manual thigh support!",4
4105, on 09/01/15 14:27 PM (PDT),rogue36 ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),"Loved my G's, but the Q50 is a beaut!"," I've owned 5 Infiniti G-Series vehicles over the past 12 years, starting with the original G35 in 2003.  Needless to say, I love the car.  I've always preferred its styling, comfort, and value compared to other entry luxury sedans.  I was hesitant to get a Q50 after reading the bad press it received, but the new styling really appealed to me and the technology in my 2012 G37 was feeling old (particularly the audio/navigation system).  After several test drives of the Q50 and its competitors, I liked the Audi A4 the best, but only slightly more than the Q50 and the lease deal on the Q50 was so much better there was no way I could pass it up.  Looking back, I'm glad I didn't get an A4 -- its styling is so boring compared to the Q50.Overall I really like the Q50.  The powertrain is excellent - smooth acceleration and quiet at highway speeds.  The cabin is comfortable with nice feel to the materials, supportive seats, minimal wind and road noise, and good visibility.  The Bose ""studio on wheels"" is thankfully just as good as it was in the G37.  I didn't get the Technology Package (which I somewhat regret) so I can't comment on all the cool ADAS features.  I like the car, but I do have two reservations: the steer-by-wire system, and the infotainment system.I wanted Around View Monitor to help with parking in my cluttered garage, and I really like entry/exit assist where the seats and steering wheel move out of the way to make getting in & out of the car easier, but to get these two features I had to take the ""direct adaptive steering"" system.  I'm not a professional driver, but even I can easily feel the difference between DAS and the hydraulic steering gears used on the G-series in the past, and I prefer the old steering feel.  That said, it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  I use this car for my daily commute on boring mostly-straight highways.  After three months I can honestly say I've gotten used to the DAS feel and it doesn't bother me anymore.  In fact I appreciate the lightness of the steering while making low-speed maneuvers.  I did however have one incident where I was taking a tightly curved on-ramp at excessive speed just for the fun of it (which I did all the time in my G's) and in the middle of the maneuver I felt the car turn in slightly without me moving the steering wheel.  It scared the heck out of me.  I don't know if it was the DAS system making an adjustment, or  something else happening, but it was very disconcerting.  Bottom line: DAS makes me nervous and I would prefer not to have it.As for the infotainment system, it has a nice set of features but the execution is bad, not terrible, but bad.  I have a lot of complaints about the system, but I'll limit myself to just mentioning two of them: 1) When listening to HD Radio the song title and artist name do not appear on any screen anywhere.  Not on the radio screen, not on the navigation screen, and not on the instrument cluster screen.  It's ridiculous.  I eventually found that information buried two levels deep in the ""controls"" menu, where it makes no sense for it to be and is basically useless.  When you listen to music from your phone or iPod the song title, artist name, and even album art are prominently displayed -- why wouldn't they do the same for HD Radio?  Even more crazy, if you turn HD Radio off you do get the song title and artist name displayed - though in the old style scrolling text format.  It's really frustrating and I hope Infiniti offers a software update to fix it.  2) I like to put my iPod or phone into random mode and just manually cycle through my songs.  Weirdly, in the Q50 there is a span of time where you can't hit ""next"" to go to the next song -- the system says ""retrieving album art"" and won't respond no matter how many times you hit the button.  That window of time seems to be from 1 - 3 seconds after a song starts playing, which can really be annoying when I hear a song I rather not listen to and want to quickly skip to the next one.  I either have to hit ""next"" immediately or wait 3 seconds.  It's a minor thing, but still, didn't anyone do user testing on the system?Anyway, it is a great car and I am happy with my purchase.  I recommend it to anyone who appreciates a sporty rear-wheel drive (or rear-wheel biased AWD) sedan and wants something that looks more elegant and interesting than the boring German sedans.",5
4106, on 08/27/15 10:44 AM (PDT),ghtrum ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.7L 6cyl 7A),"A Driver's car, updated"," Updated review:  Made it to 6 months and my first oil change.  It seems everyday I see or feel something else of a positive note on this car.  Lately, I have noticed a very positive feel while moving through a specific curve, where anything over 35 would cause a car to push through the curve.  This car drifts in a very confident and positive fashion.  I am still quite glad I chose this car.  If you are a driver's driver, you should try this car.  In this price range, I consider this a better value than competitors like BMW.  Truth:  19 inch tires, upgraded brakes, Premium, RWD drive.  I purposedly chose the NON drive by wire, as I had a really BAD experience with another Infiniti that had drive by wire.  The NON drive by wire, has excellent road manners, great steering control and road feel, great shift points, and wonderful braking.  I find myself in tight turns still able to make micro shifts to the curve such that the line I have picked out is more efficiently used.  (It took 1200 miles and 3 months to get to the present performance and appreciation for my part)  Though there are two taller gears than the Coupe model, I find the accleration and shift points to be more than adequate.Though others have found the dual electronics screen distracting, I have found the opposite.  With most things you need to do, like change the audio device or radio station, there are 2 or 3 ways to get it done.  I find that I can keep my attention on my driving, while my fingers find a handy device to make the change. The car seats will appeal to most people, but I can only give them 4/5.   I only have two negatives:  I hate run flat tires (bumpy, noisy), and I do not like how totally quiet the cabinet is.  There is barely any exhaust note or engine tone I can hear inside the cabin.  The G37 coupe is more appealling in that regard.  I bought the car with several misgivings, but they have mostly gone away, replaced by a real appreciation for this car that melds with my driving needs.",5

4108, on 08/21/15 19:40 PM (PDT),PsyMed ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),Direct Adaptive Steering performs poorly," Edmunds full expert review has nothing good to say about the Direct Adaptive Steering option, and now I know why.  My new, fully loaded Q50 Premium hash Direct Adaptive Steering and run-flat tires.  After driving it over 1000 miles on mostly highways, I'm deeply troubled by the rather abysmal performance, road handling, and maybe even the real-world safety of this steer-by-wire system.  (As of this writing, I do not know the extent to which the rather miserable run-flat tires may be contributing to this poor performance,  but I suspect it may be quite significant. I will have more to say about these tires shortly.)  For those who may not be familiar with Infiniti's Direct Adaptive Steering (""steer-by-wire""), there isn't a conventional mechanically coupled linkage between the steering wheel and the front end.  Rather, the system relies on an electronic interface between the  steering wheel and the front end.  Thus, unlike conventional steering, there is no instantaneous telegraphing and biomechanical feedback of the sensations that a driver normally feels between one's hands on the steering wheel and the road, particularly lacking the natural progressive resistance that one would normally feel as the steering wheel is turned ever more to the left or to the right.  The lack of this natural  sensation between the drivers hands and the road would be totally unnerving and disorienting.  So, Infiniti has attempted to simulate this sensation by driver selectable settings found within the Infiniti Drive Mode Selector app, found by scrolling through the apps on the touch pad.  After tapping the DMS app, one first selects Steering, after which one has four steering modes between ""Effort"" and ""Response"" to choose from, including (1) Light/Casual, (2) Standard/Standard, (3) Standard/Quick, and (4) Heavy/Quick.    Basically, the settings determine the degree of resistance one feels when turning the steering wheel.  With DAS, the  vehicle has an unnerving habit of wandering, floating, and swerving or yawing from side-to-side, requiring nearly constant steering corrections.    Unlike conventional steering, when one is negotiating a curve on a highway with DAS,  you can't simply turn the wheel in and hold it there as you progress through the curve.   If you attempt to do so you will quickly find that a few seconds after you turn the wheel slightly, the vehicle will stop going in the direction of the turn and will begin to go straight, so you have to keep turning the wheel back in the direction of the curve.  This in turn results in the vehicle wandering from side to side. But wait, there's more.  With DAS, the vehicle tends to fall into and follow, for example, any uneven seams or other such things in the road surface. In addition, when one is passing, or being passed by trucks (and even other cars) the wind drafts will blow the car to the side and require  diligence with the steering  wheel because one must anticipate and compensate for this.   I cringe to think how it might perform when driving on the freeway with strong gusting winds and slippery road conditions.  On the bright side, my experience thus far has been that DAS  performs decidedly better when driving around town as well as on country roads.   Quite frankly, I am utterly baffled as to how this steer-by-wire system ever made it into production.  What in the world were they thinking?  It remains to be seen whether or not there will eventually be a Technical Service Bulletin about this glaring problem,  and if so, whether or not a firmware update will even be possible in order to fix the problem.  While driving on highways with the Driver Assist is on, the vehicle will wander/bounce back and forth within its lane if you let it, rather like a bobsled.   In fact, unless you're very diligent about keeping the vehicle on track, the degree of wandering from side to side has me worried that I might get pulled over by the police for driving is if I am intoxicated!  My experience thus far has been that the vehicle wanders the least in the Heavy/Quick setting. As previously mentioned, I remain very suspicious that the run-flat tires may be part of the problem, and  I would be very curious to see how it performs when I eventually replace them with a set of Michelin Primacy tires.   The Internet reveals that the majority of consumers don't like run-flats because they impart a rough ride; they cost a third more than conventional tires; and they wear very quickly.   I find it to be absolutely infuriating that the automotive industry is increasingly cramming these tires down our throats.  Indeed,  I have read reports that BMW for example may void the warranty if these tires are replaced with conventionals. Fortunately, with the 2015 Q50, these tires can be replaced with conventional ones without voiding the warranty.  In addition, the vehicle has a spare tire that can be replaced with a conventional one.",2
4109, on 07/10/15 07:52 AM (PDT),Greg ,2015 INFINITI Q50 Sedan 4dr Sedan AWD (3.7L 6cyl 7A),New to Infiniti," When we looked at new cars in 2013, we were interested in the G37, but found that the Q50 had just been introduced.  It had all of the options we wanted (AWD, strong power, look of luxury) so we opted for the new model instead of the outgoing G model.  Overall the car is great with the exception of electronic systems that are the center piece of the interior.  I have never seen a car's systems take so long to come online.  Once you start the car, at best, all of the radio functions will finally become available after about 30 seconds to a minute.  Also (and I find this to be hazard that Infiniti should fix), the back-up sensors and grid also take about 30 seconds to a minute to become available.  When you are in a crowded shopping area and your first action when leaving is to back out of the parking spot, all safety systems should be immediately available.  Our other car's (not an Infiniti) backup systems, radio and all other electronics are immediately available at the turn of the ignition.  Even when the electronics are available, the Q50 has several glitches.  When we first got the car, the radio would ""freeze"", meaning once you turned to a station, you could not switch stations or even turn the volume down without stopping the car, turning it off and restarting.  I think they finally fixed that issue with one of the several updates, but we still have glitches in the radio and controls from time to time.  I think the Q50's navigation system is significantly better than the one in our other car and is extremely user-friendly and easy to use while driving.Overall a good car with impressive power, comfort and other features, but as a new model, it has some needed improvements that likely will not be available for another model year or two.  Will consider another one when we look again, but will also explore the competitors again as we are not 100% sold.",4

I love the styling, handling, and performance.  The Bose audio system is outstanding.  The infotainment system is old (no Carplay or Android Auto) but works well.  I especially appreciate that it indexes my iPod & thumb drive so that I can say ""Play song <name>"" or ""Play artist <name>"" and it works.  The Kia Stinger could not do that and the Audi A4 wouldn't work with my iPod at all!  What keeps me coming back to Infiniti is quality.  This is the sixth G35/G37/Q50 I've leased and I've never had a single major issue with any of them.  So why only 4 stars?  The seats.  The seat bottom feels like it is designed for a tiny Japanese person -- which I'm not.  The sides of the seat bottom are stiff and cupped upward, to keep you from sliding around during all those high-G turns Infiniti expects you to make, but for me they press into my butt enough to cause soreness and fatigue - so much so that I had to buy a foam seat cushion to use on long trips or I end up with sciatic pain.  This is something I did not notice during my 20 minute test drive, but after a week of owning the car it became evident.  If I could take the car back and switch it for a non-sport model, I would - that's how painful it is.",4

I thought I was buying a Luxury vehicle as it as touted as one and the price matches or exceeds other comparable small Luxury sedans.The only upside is that the car does have a good amount of power and is quick but other than that really has nothing going for it.The interior is very cheap with plastic everywhere and everything squeeks and already seems to be falling apart. Technology in the car is reminiscent of a vehicle from 2000, the lcd screen looks horrible and barely has any features or control over it. The gas mileage is abysmal, I do about a 50/50 mix of highway/city and I have never exceeded 15.5MPG! My last car was a large four door sedan that weighed almost 1500lbs more and was from 2004 but it got around 19MPG.The Infiniti dealer network and support from Infiniti USA is just downright horrible. Purchasing the car was not made easy at all, and I cannot even get a response from Infiniti when trying to contact their support.If you are looking for a true Luxury vehicle and a Luxury experience steer clear of Infiniti as pretty much any of the other Luxury brands will give you a better product for a better price.",1
4126, on 12/17/15 16:08 PM (PST),Feng Guo ,2015 INFINITI Q40 Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.7L 6cyl 7A),2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD causes me tinnitus and heari," I bought this new 2015 Infiniti Q40 AWD from Beshoff Infiniti (San Jose) on Feb 28, 2015. After driving this noisy car for three months, or about 3000miles, I started having ringing in both ears (tinnitus). It became more and more obvious after I drove this Q40, and I have trouble to sleep since then. I also start losing my hearing in both ears, especially for the low voice from a meeting in a group or in a noisy environment, or someone with bass voice in the phone. I have contacted Beshoff Infiniti in June 2015 when I noticed the tinnitus caused by the noise.  They refused to take the car back with full refund and claimed that it’s normal car noise. I took my doctor’s suggestion to wear earplugs when driving this Q40 since then. After another 6 months of driving (total mileage is 10,000miles now), the tinnitus and my hearing didn’t get better, and it’s boring me a lot, both in my life and work. I contacted the dealer and the car maker again this month. They asked me to do a second road test and still claimed that it’s normal road noise. But this “normal” noise is killing me and I don’t think I can drive this car anymore. Because the dealer and Infiniti refused to help me with the problem, I did some noise tests and analysis myself, to figure out what’s going on. According to the result from Adobe Audition CC, a professional audio analysis software, the noise mainly from 100-400 Hz, that is the low frequency noise not sensitive to human being. This means, even if the driver didn’t hear the noise, the energy carried by this sounds will still go through the ear and damage the auditory nerve cells without immediate impact. The symptom is, you may not hear a loud noise (at 6000-8000Hz), but your ears are in the pain. The low frequency noise of this Q40 AWD carried much higher energy than another model made by Infiniti, the Q50, at this range. This indicates that the company has the technology and capability to reduce the noise, but they did not apply it to Q40 for some reason. I am in the progress of negotiation with Infiniti regional affair manager now. Infiniti remains to claim it’s the normal noise, and because it not the defect on any part of the vehicle, they cannot repair it or give a full refund as I requested, neither the compensation to the health damage on me. With no concern on the fact that this noise already caused severe and permanent health damage to the customer, Infiniti refuse to recall the cars and investigate the potential harm of the noise to the customers. It’s always difficult for individual to negotiate and reach desired outcome with the big company.  So far, total 8574 of Infiniti Q40 were sold in U.S. since Jan 2015 ( Infiniti sales stats: http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2011/01/infiniti-g-sales-figures.html, the sales dropped from 1000 to 38 by Nov. 2015 ).  All these customers may suffer from the same noise. Some of them may have family members riding with them, including children. As a Ph.D. in Biology, I am aware that the auditory nerve cells are the only type of cell that cannot regenerate in human body. Once you lose the hearing, you lose it permanently. The public should be alerted that there is potential risk to drive this car, for both the current Q40 owners and the potential buyers. If you are the current owners of this model of Infiniti Q40 and have the same problem with it, please contact Infiniti regional affair.

We bought fully loaded including TVs for the kids. Upgraded to this when we had twins from EX35. Did the whole Acura MDX, Infiniti JX35 comparison. We needed something with 3 rows in case grandparents came along and we needed plenty of space for the twins stuff. My wife didn’t feel comfortable driving something as large as a Tahoe/Yukon and Lexus only offered 3 rows on a truck based platform with a stupidly designed 3rd row that flipped up to the side and chewed up valuable cargo space. After test driving both Acura and Infiniti we realized the Infiniti is significantly larger, offered a nicer cabin (in our opinion) and rode more comfortably. 4 years and nearly 50k miles later, we are just as happy as when we first bought it. No major mechanical issues. Reliability has been top notch, although I understand that reliability has not been Infiniti’s strong suit as of late, we have been lucky on our JX. The interior has held up extremely well considering my twins have given it all they’ve got.  Now we’ve just added a 3rd kid and with 3 kids in car seats, we need to upgrade in size. Having to utilize the 3rd row for a car seat crushes car or capacity. I had to rent a suburban to take the family on a week long road trip. Pros: reliability, looks, interior design, navigation and electronics, cargo capacity (3rd row folded), rideCons: underpowered and fuel economy is atrocious. Averaging 15.2 mpg over 50k miles. CVT transmission is so -so and completely not necessary if mileage is that bad. I would highly recommend this to anyone with 2 young kids. ",4

Major mechanical items (engine, transmission, etc.) have been reliable.  As others have noted, the transmission is sluggish/underpowered, constant issue/recalls with passenger side airbag, and the gas mileage is horrible - we average about 17 MPG in the city and 19/20 highway.  Key concerns:  1. Replaced battery 4 times in 5 years with terminals connectors having been replaced twice, 2. Door mouldings routinely come apart making car noisy with lots of squeaks, 3. Driver and passenger visors repeatedly break ($200 each to replace at dealer) due to cheap parts, 4. Tiny driver kickplate led to hole in interior floor carpet and the dealer wanted $1,100 to repair, 5.  Brakes have short lifespan 25k to 30k and need replaced; dealer quotes $375 for front pads - outrageous.   6. Terrible dealer support/lack of warranty support - Infiniti of Scottsdale, AZ is the worst.  The service ""advisors"" almost appeared to be gleeful as they told us repeatedly that another issue with the vehicle was not covered under warranty during the supposed 4 year/60K warranty period.    All said, this is truly not a luxury vehicle - just buy the Pathfinder and save $10k-$15K.  Or, if you truly want a reliable ""luxury"" vehicle go with Lexus or maybe Acura.

The car has had 4 recalls already (took 3 tries to fix one of those - passenger's air bag module). It's a gas guzzler in city driving. The CV transmission is non-responsive and sluggish. The supposed All Wheel drive is fake. It's a two wheel drive on the 4WD model with an option to activate the 4WD in a snow mode drive only. And then the rear wheels operate  only at 50%. The radiator fan motor went out at 34K miles, but somehow the warranty doesn't cover it and the dealership is charging me $1,300 for the repair. When you buy a car for $50K, you'd expect for the car not to start falling you at 34K miles. Engine began overheating because of the broken fan motor. It's comfy inside and the 3rd row seat (which is for kids or dogs only) ocasionally comes handy, but that's the only good thing I can say about it. Nissan, which makes the Infinity, has a 5 year bumper to bumper warranty on a truck/van (the NV 200). Makes me wonder why they don’t have the same warranty for a “luxury” SUV",1

The transmission failed at 59K miles which was covered under warranty although the new transmission only came with a 12K mile warranty. The wipers would come on whenever the felt like it. The weather stripping for the rear doors would regularly fall off. What topped it all off was the service advisor recommending that we not keep the car past 100K miles! The advisor told my wife that he had looked into buying a JX35 for his wife but opted to buy a Honda due to reliability issues.

However after reading other reviews and driving it for 2 months I can agree with them on some issues. For example, the acceleration is very disappointing but it helps that I have controls to switch to sport if I want to go faster because on ECO it goes at a snails pace. The controls for radio, air and phone are to far spaced and as a female my hands do not fit in the little compartment to charge my phone. The aux cord in the console is in the most awkward spot and is difficult to access. The Bluetooth rarely works correctly which is very annoying. We also have the entertainment/tech package and the way he dvd system works is also awkward with too many steps just to watch a dvd. My car is still under warranty  and the leader in the back seat is splitting and spreading, I eager to see if Infinity  will do anything about it. Also l, the look of the vehicle is pretty much s station wagon so I wish it was more stylish.

I bought a 2013 JX35. Within the 1st 100 miles we noticed the transmission was having problems. Everyone at Infiniti told us that we need to break in the car for 500 miles and that the car has a CVT transmission. Finally we got tired of the transmission continually jerking around and grinding between 10-35 mph and we brought it in. After 9 days in the shop they finally said they need to replace the torque converter. Done. After we picked up the vehicle, the car was doing the same thing as before, yet worse. Back to the dealer, same day. Finally we are told that they need to replace the transmission. Totally unacceptable. Infiniti ",1.625

If you have not driven a vehicle with a CVT transmission Do Your Homework. It is awkward compared to a traditional transmission. The engine will rev at times unexpected ,it is much louder, and you get the feeling of downshifting. They give you a selector switch that you can turn to sport mode to make it feel like a traditional transmission (not).  I had actually called infinity a few times regarding the odd reving and the feel of this.  They told me no one had complained, i couldnt believe it.  I have driven so many cars and suv's in my time , this was the first I ever sold back at a loss..  The odd thing was the following year the only change they made was to reprogram the transmission to feel like a conventional transmission.  i cant believe they did that just for me......Understanding it is SUV/ crossover, it does not take to turns well comparable. Bottom line at this price It underperforms.  They need to either really improve those transmissions or go a diffrent direction. It does not belong in there.  Would take my CX9 Back tomorrow.",1

4186, on 03/31/12 22:34 PM (PDT),beagle11 ,2013 INFINITI JX SUV JX35 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl CVT),First Impressions," Just took delivery of our emerald graphite JX35 AWD (fully loaded) with java brown interior.My first impressions are as follows:Appearance:As attractive as the JX35 appears in the photos, the vehicle looks even better in person.The exterior styling is very sporty without looking gimmicky.The dark plastic aeroskirts and underbody accents compliment the lines well.While the salesman admitted he was skeptical of the java interior with the dark gray dash and emerald graphite color scheme when we pre-ordered, but was very impressed when it was delivered.The dark brown leather looks very luxurious and breaks up what would be a monochromatic look.Its definitely one of the smartest looking SUVs on the road today. Performance: The engine is adequate and the ride is more luxurious than it is sporty. For 90% of drivers in this class, it will perform admirably.Plows quite bit into the turns, but this isn&#146;t a M series. Interior:Top notch interior.Seats are firm, but comfortable.I am a large guy over 6 feet, and I can fit in all three rows. The 3rd row would be tough for long periods, but doable for less than an hour.The 3rd row access entry space is big enough for an adult to gain access within to much trouble. Technology:It may take a year or more to get your hands around all of the features.The basic functions are intuitive, but like a really powerful smart phone, the vehicles capabilities likely far exceed the users mastery of the systems functionality.The steering wheel controls are reversed from most vehicles, and the different interfaces will take a little while to familiarize myself with being a distraction.Non-Critical, but Quirky Issues:Due to the push-button keyless ignition, there doesnt appear to be a way to energize the vehicle control systems within starting the vehicle first.There doesnt appear to be a way to roll up and down windows, or play radio like you would with a vehicle in accessory mode with a traditional turn-key ignition.There is a very poorly placed SOS button for the Infiniti Connect emergency notification system.The button is located on the overhead control panel, approximately ½-inch below the button for the driver-side overhead lamp.When the headlines are engaged, the button is back-lighted, but is easily confused with the overhead light switch in the dark.Yes, I pushed it accidentally on the first evening I drove the car. The response came from Infiniti in approximately 30 seconds and the call center representative was thankfully very understanding.While the odds of changing a tire yourself is remote with roadside assistance, the rear Bose Direct-Wave speaker and plastic rear hatch liner would need o be removed prior to accessing the under-body high pressure spare tire and jack.Remote start will not work with second key located inside of within close proximity of the vehicle.Once the second key was removed from the car, it started right up.While the DVD playing in the back can be viewed on the front heads-up monitor, the car must be stopped and the emergency break engaged before it will come up.No CD changer, but rather a hard drive storage system where you can burn hundreds on CDs onto prior to leaving.Unclear if the burn function works with audio books.Overall:I think Acura is going to have to re-design the MDX this year to match the JX35 main buying demographic.The bar has been raised in that price class.While not perfect and bordering on being too technologically complex, the JX35 hits or exceeds expectations for factors that matter to the 40-something $100K+ income female.",4.625

When I first stepped into the car, the traction control off light was on.  The car also shifts really weird in Auto, 4H or 4L modes.  It either jerks you right off your seat when you step on it or shifts too quickly to where you can feel the automatic transmission shifting 5x in one second.  Brakes were also difficult to control as the downshifting also made the car jerk as it is slowing down.  Car reached 5200rpm at 72 mph, with a redline at about 6200rpm, which made me afraid to push the car any harder as I was afraid it might blow up at a higher speed.  This big SUV also loves to guzzle gas and we were down to a quarter of a tank after 2.5 hr drive.  The visibility to the outside was good and it was comfortable for passengers not in the back row, but the interior was kind of small considering the huge size of the car.  Barely able to fit 6 adults with luggage.  HVAC is finickly and seems to be ""hunting"" the correct setpoint temperature as you get frequent waves of hot air followed by cold air without touching the controls.",2

We really got lucky when all they had was a QX80 at Bozeman airport. There were multiple days that we spent 6 - 8 hours in the vehicle and more than once 4+ hours at a time. We were all quite comfortable at all times. I've never driven a vehicle that was comfortable so such lengths of time. It was also a joy to drive on Montana's pothole-free highways and backroads. Handled high-speeds (in excess of 100 mph) with rock-solid stability and only a bit of wind-noise as a sign. Yes, Virginia, such speeds are completely safe on a 4-mile straight on a perfectly smooth road, with no trees in sight (you can see any cars, animals, pedestrians, etc. miles away). Fuel economy seemed fine - it's a big SUV with a powerful V8! Also, I'm used to driving full-size trucks with V8s so I knew what to expect. Was disappointed, but not surprised when I confirmed the price is more than I'm willing to spend. Can't justify $70k+ in the northeast where our vehicles are bathed in corrosive salt-spray 5 months per year. Very happy to learn the 2017 Nissan Armada is basically the QX80 with slightly fewer features, Nissan badges, and $15k cheaper. The Armada will be first on my list when we need to replace a vehicle. P.S. I picked ""Limited"" trim level because Edmunds wouldn't allow me to skip it. I'm not sure which trim level I drove.",5

It has all the bells and whistles you want and none of the BS. Gas mileage is in a word, horrible, but if you are paying a grand a month for your car $60-80 a month in gas is probably not a worry. Safety and tech are top notch, accelerates nicely and is a pleasure to drive. Plus I am saving 200/month vs a MB that is similarly equipped. I looked around, Hard, this was far and away the best bang for the buck. Cadillac felt cheap inside(PLASTIC AS FAR AS THE EYE CAR SEE) the same car from MB is way overpriced, and doesn't exist for Audi, BMW, Porsche or Lexus. I even tried the Lexus 540 which felt tiny in comparison and everything else was soo much smaller or no where near as nice (Yukon, Tahoe, Expedition). This is also far more comfortable than any previous vehicle I have owned (MB E350 Wagon, RR HSE, Yukon Denali and Dodge Durango) and is probably only beaten in value of all cars I have owned by my Porsche (550 Spyder).",4

(We were so disappointed in the Lincoln-- it seemed 20 years out of date. That said, this vehicle, ON PAPER, is great. This vehicle, in REALITY, is grossly overpriced for the ownership experience. I cannot believe how bad the GPS is (and that the dealer charges us to update the software for a car this expensive). If you buy this car, purchase a Garmin or other GPS. The efforts required to operate the instruments require extensive training and review. In general, you should NEVER do anything more than change channels on the radio without pulling over. (If you want the most intuitive instrumentation, go with a Ford product (((no, I don't have one at the moment))) or any other choice.) We have tried two dealerships for service, and cannot recommend either. Yes, they are glamorous, but the execution of service is slow, and the knowledge of the service team is modest. For example, they don't even know the proper air pressure when asked. That's just sad. The car does draw many comments, and that's good for a chance to explain to curious onlookers that they see what we saw, but DO NOT BUY THIS VEHICLE. We own several cars, including domestics and exotics. This is the only car we own which I would never buy again.",3
4205, on 11/27/16 14:49 PM (PST),Tim ,2015 INFINITI QX80 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Climate Control Issues very uncomfortable," When the Outside Temperature is between 40 & 60 degrees & the Vehicle Climate Control is Auto the center & floor Vents run 15 to 20 degrees warmer than the other vents making it uncomfortable. In order to keep your feet from sweating the outside vents have to be closed & the interior temperature is controlled by the center & floor vents (this is the only way to lower the temperature without having cold air come out of the Side Vents). Having the side vents closed makes your arm closest to the door cold when the outside temperature is in the 40s, unless you are wearing a jacket.  I brought the vehicle back to the dealer I purchased it from they kept it for 4 days & told me that was normal.  I placed a temperature gauges in the vents & photographed the Outside Airtemp reading and interior controls documenting the issue, I took the vehicle to another Infinity Dealer with the Presentation that illustrated the temperature difference between vents.  The Service Adviser was great he contact the Infinity Rep & validated my concern.  After another 24 hours without my vehicle the Answer from Infinity = all the QX80s have the same issue it is normal.  It maybe normal for the QX80 however my Lexus or Toyota do not have a 20 degree split between vents, nor do I remember any other vehicle I have owned.  This is a great vehicle, however if you live a 4 season climate twice a year you need to compensate for the Climate Control Anomaly. I would think the fix would be straight forward, either a sensor or software issue.  The Climate Control issue will make me look at a different vehicle when the time comes for another SUV. The Gas issue described in another review is accurate - The Amber lite illuminates after using around 19 gallons, that doesn't bother me now that I know @ at 15mpg there is only 105 miles left in the tank if you drive easy.  I generally fill all my vehicles at 1/4 tank",3
4206, on 06/10/16 16:54 PM (PDT),Craig Elford ,2015 INFINITI QX80 SUV 4dr SUV 4WD (5.6L 8cyl 7A),Great Infiniti QX80 Ownership Experience," My 2015 QX80 is my second Infiniti full size SUV as I previously drove a 2006 QX56 which I still own as a third vehicle for our family.  I put over 205,000 miles on the 2006 model, and had absolutely no problems.  Great quality vehicle with outstanding ownership experience.  When it came time to look at new vehicles I again did rigorous evaluation before purchasing my 2015 QX80.  I looked at the Ford Expedition (I previously owned a 1997 model), the Lincoln Navigator (my wife drives a 2006 model), the Cadillac Escalade, the GMC Yukon Denali, the Chevy Tahoe LTZ, and the Toyota Sequoia Platinum.  I am 6'-8"" and immediately eliminated the Toyota Sequoia as I could not even sit in the driver seat due to the very short headroom as my head hit the ceiling even with the seat back reclined pretty significantly.  I loved the legroom and headroom for all the GM products as they had best in class legroom, but GM still has not engineered a decent 3rd row seat to fold flat into the floor.  While they advertise the new versions that way, in reality you lose at least 4"" in the height of the cargo area as they have artificially raised the cargo floor to accommodate the third row seating when folded down.  Legroom on their 3rd row seating was basically unusable.  That left the Lincoln Navigator and the Ford Expedition, but there was simply no comparison when evaluating the quality of the vehicles between the Infiniti QX80 and the Ford and Lincoln products.  I have been extremely pleased with the outstanding quality of my QX-80.  With 400 horsepower it has plenty of power to provide effective performance for such a large, heavy vehicle.  While it does not have sports car acceleration, if you are driving a full size SUV that is not a primary consideration.  I have found the 5.6 liter engine to have plenty of power and zip and even when cruising at 70 mph there is still plenty of acceleration when you need to pass.  The 315 horses available on my 2006 QX56 was adequate, and the new fuel injection on the QX80 provides a noticeable difference in power.  The greatest improvements in with the QX-80 is in the changes made with technology to improve the ride and to make the driving experience safer.  I have found the blind spot monitor to be a tremendous help, and the intelligent cruise control is an amazing technology to monitor what is happening with vehicles ahead of you to ensure safe distances are maintained.  If you have not used this technology, you will love it as you can set the interval you are looking to maintain and the sensors on the vehicle do an amazing job of monitoring not only the vehicle immediately in front of you, but also the vehicle on ahead to determine if there is a potential safety hazard and will automatically adjust the set speed accordingly.The driving and passenger ride experience is incredibly comfortable.  With the long wheel base, the quality of the seats, and the suspension system provides a luxury car ride for your passengers.  I get so many compliments from those riding with me as to how incredibly comfortable the ride is as well as how impressed they are with the luxury finish.  Infiniti has used very high quality materials and it is very evident in the look and feel of the vehicle.  Even with the size of a full size SUV, the QX80 handles incredibly well for both highway driving, city driving, and the surround view cameras and sensors make it every easy to handle vehicle even in tight spaces.  Turning radius is excellent for this size vehicle and I can actually U-turn in a much smaller radius than many passenger cars.  This vehicle is a dream to drive on the highway as the ride is so comfortable, yet when needed the handling is very responsive.  Another great advantage to a full size SUV is the amount of cargo you can haul in the cargo area behind the 2nd row, and if necessary with the second row captain seats folded down.  I have hauled an incredible amount of gear in my vehicle multiple times over the past 27 months and having the voluminous cargo area is great.  This is where it is so important at the elegant engineering of how the 3rd row seating folds into the floor.While I would agree with the other two reviews listed regarding the low end of the gas gauge accuracy, and at times the shifting of the transmission could be smoother, but that is only when you are really pushing the vehicle and need to accelerate quickly.  Overall, to me these are very small issues compared to the overall quality and experience of owning this vehicle.  The QX80 also has unique styling which you may either love or hate, but you won't look like every other full size SUV on the road.  I personally really like the styling as it is not just a square box like so many of the competitors.The net is, I love my 2015 Infiniti QX80, and would highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.  We have been so impressed with my QX80 we purchased a new 2017 QX60 for my wife to replace her old vehicle. She loves it!",5

The interior compartment is very nice and it actually got me to buy the car. While it is beautiful, after a few days it seemed like one of the most impractical cars I ever owned. Storage is awful, there is no place to store even sunglasses and the owners manual is too big to fit in the glove box (really?). Also hard to believe that there is no power hatch, only a manual option in a ""luxury"" car. Another problem, there is no way to have the doors unlock when you put the car in park. My 2008 Camry had this feature.  Also, the sight lines are awful as there is very low visibility out the rear and sides of this car. The glass panoramic roof is a must as it makes it feel less cramped but no where near as nice as a moonroof that actually opens. There is very little leg and headroom in the back for an average size adult. As far as the drive, it is very simply underpowered, and whines through the lower gears. This is not how I would expect a ""luxury"" car to drive. While sport mode does offer some nice performance, it really whines even more. Lastly, the road noise is horrendous, it sounds like something is open, the only relief is keeping the radio turned up. Handling was one of the few positives as long as you are on very smooth pavement as the ride is very stiff and you feel EVERY bump and expansion joint, even on the highway.  In closing, I disliked this vehicle so much that I returned it after 3 weeks and took the financial hit. Very disappointed.",2

When car is in standard mode it really accelerates. It's a weird feeling walking up to this car because of it's low profile however, when you are driving it you still feel like you are driving an SUV. At first I wanted the dark grey car but saw the majestic white with beige and black leather interior and fell in love. The only things that still bother me are the button puss park. It still freaks me out. Also the back up camera sometimes turns black when your backing up. (it happened to me only about 5 or 6 times since I owned the car). I spoke with the Infinity Dealer about problem and they said it is a known issue with this car and are in the process of resolving it. Love the large premium tires too with beautiful dirt free trim. What else can I say about the Bose stereo and Speakers. Phenomenal! Bluetooth works great too. Dimming mirrors at night to take away that annoying one car who always seem to have his or her bights on. Adjustable seats a re wonderful and cater to small people as well as large. Great lumbar support! Nice beautiful cockpit with everything under the sun . Too much to even name.One thing is missing though. Where is the sunglass storage?

End 11/16 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Not for everyone & it's not an SUV," First, I realize that this car (not SUV) is not for everyone. I was seeking to get out of my Mazda CX-9 because the fuel economy was not very good and it was just more vehicle then I needed.  The two big dogs were gone and the kids were older so  I decided it was time to simplify my life and do something for me.  I searched high and low for my next ride and was not interested in driving what everyone else was.  The QX30 is different.  It's compact and loaded with style.  The turbo charged 4 cyl has given me a new super powers...passing speed and the ability merge into traffic with zero effort.  The drivers seat is exceptionally comfortable and it is fun to drive.  Here are the CONs... there is no cargo space.  I can get one carry-on suitcase and a couple of grocery bags in there.  If you are taller than 5'9 and weigh more than you should :( this car will not be comfortable.   It really is a two seater and not suitable for a family.  My five year old and his car seat fit comfortably in the back but it won't work for him in a couple years.  The owner's manual has a hard time fitting into the glove box, my iPhone Plus does not fit anywhere including in the center console.  The infotainment system blows!  It's complicated and is confused when you plug in your phone or more than one person has Bluetooth on in the car.  The upside is that I am glad I took the plunge and I don't miss the extra cargo or seating.  I wish the infotainment system was better but it's not that big of a deal to me.  I like the compact styling because it is more effiecent and prevents me from buying anything that I cannot fit in the cargo space.   The lack of seating keeps people that I don't like out of my car.  Some people complain about the visabilty but if you have driven an SUV you are accustomed to poor visabilty.  I actually find it easier to see what's around me than in my old SUV.  Lastly, taking the plunge to a much smaller vehicle was made easier by the fact that it is leased.  It's fun for now but in a couple years I can try something else.  It's not a keeper by any stretch and reminds me of a modernized version of my 1969 Karmann Ghia which like the QX30 was fun only for a little while.",4

End 5/18 4dr SUV AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 7AM),Loving our QX30 Premium more than our G37x Coupe!," Love the unique look and sexy / sporty styling of the QX30 and that in 2 plus months of ownership we haven't seen another one on the road.  Having a Full Sized Toyota Sequoia and a Mid sized Nissan Murano as daily drivers, we have driven Infiniti Coupes (G35, G37x, Q60x) as our weekend fun car the past 10 plus years. After a considerable search for our 3rd stall garage fun car, we pulled the trigger on a new 2018 QX30 Premium Crossover loaded with every option. We LOVE it and my wife is now driving it daily and her Murano sits in the garage. :-) She's averaging 25 mpg on her daily commute of 50-50 freeway / town. We've seen 30 mpg on two 300 mile weekend road trips. We embrace the size / dimensions as it offers so much more than our Coupes. Getting in / out is much easier and our dog can hop in the back as well. If your expecting to tote the family around or take several co workers to lunch... you'd better buy a larger SUV.  Hands down the ride quality and the AMAZING 2.0 motor / 7 speed dual clutch trans, impressed us enough to buy it.  Super strong 258 ft lbs of torque at just 1250 RPM, and you'll enjoy zippy guilt free starts as just 1/3 throttle puts you a block down the road while other cars are just crossing the intersection. Near triple digit speeds on entrance ramps are possible. Ride quality was better than Lexus nx200t, nissan Rogue SL, Toyota Rav4 Limited, Honda CRV Touring we also test drove. Assisted Parking is amazing and not only parallel parks but also backs into tight parking spots as well. All you do is monitor the brake and the car steers itself! Sound system is superb, memory seats for both driver and passenger etc. are all top notch. As for handling, it delivers sports car like cornering and a much smoother overall ride. We thought we might miss our 330 hp Infiniti coupes but the QX30 is like a sports sedan on steroids with higher seating, 4 doors, lift gate cargo area, and overall unique and sporty appearance.  The adaptive LED headlights are awesome in that they turn with the steering wheel, and auto high beam took all of about 1 minute to appreciate. As with any new car, there is a learning curve with controls and buttons, and even being the Mercedes influence such as seat position knobs on the door panel, the QX30 has been very easy to learn to navigate all the functions / screens. A few small complaints like having to hold the memory seat button instead of just touch it and placing the steering wheel volume on the right side wouldn't stop us from buying it again. We got an amazing low price and scored the 7 yr 100K wrap warranty for about 1/2 the asking price from a Chicago Infiniti dealer. There are 3 dealers in Chicago, so the competition is a good thing for the consumer! Just 1500 miles on the odometer and we are loving our QX30!",4

Another thing I didn't look for when purchasing the car was to see if the back seat fold down, and they do NOT.  There is a small pull down behind the middle seat so you can still stick something through the hole if you need to (like a fishing rod) but the lack of having this capability has caused several inconveniences. I haven't had any costly repairs which is a huge plus, only routine maintenance and the car still runs great.

Also, take the car for an extended test drive - most luxury brands will allow you to ""lease"" one overnight.Acura, Infiniti and Volvo all allowed me to do that.Acura missed a huge market by making the TL larger and longer and Volvo dealerships don't care if you buy a car or not.",4.375

It balances handling, comfort and exceptional value. I looked at all the usual suspects. 3 series, C-Class, Acura, Lexus and found the G37 to represent the best of all these brands. 3.7liter is a rocket on wheels, precision handling when pushed and comfortable in city driving. Exceptional navigation system, very easy use with both voice command and touchscreen. Great driving position. I have about 4k miles and its been very reliable compared to my 2008 Audi A6. Service costs are very reasonable. Good long distance cruiser.Like BMW and Mercedes, G37s are built on independent rear wheel drive platform unlike Lexus ES and Acura TL.",4.375

The car has amazing acceleration and handling.  The interior is great.  The version I purchased has the navigation system. This is not something I really wanted, but it is nice.  The navigation system is very good, but it is hard to find your destination sometimes.  My garmin hand held is easier to use.  I love the Ipod option and the XM radio.

It is by far the best of the four - I can't believe I'm getting the same fuel economy as the 2000 I30 with 227 HP and better than the G35 with 260 HP.  Still new to the area, so the Nav system helps and is the best one seen to date. I love the fact that I have all my music on a USB stick and can use it with the system (no Ipod yet).

Have been asked about the car by strangers a couple of times.  However, that is where my love of the car ends.  The transmission is very rough, particularly in the lower gears.  The car jerks as it passes through the first three gears - both up and coming back down.   Also, the car bounces a lot when traveling on highway.  Feels like I'm not a very inexpensive car.  Lots of road noise too.  Headlights don't light high enough on the sides of the road.  I travel daily on roads heavy with deer crossing and need high beams to see enough.

Rear wheel drive with sport suspension paired with the 328 HP really makes this car fun to drive.  only other car in its class that can beat it is the 335 but you get all the fuel pump issues with the bimmer.  The looks are a matter of opinion but i still catch myself staring at my car; madly in love.  Paint quality needs work and having a black car only makes it worse, i hate the paint.  the interior is decent, relatively plain, but very functional and cool in a simplistic way.

Don't like the CVT transmission in low gears, esp. 1-3. Has a lot of punch after that when you need it. Handling is terrific and I do like the steering feel. Bose audio is good but not great.

Overall workmanship of the interior is not as good as BM or Mercedes definitely, but still very good. One of the adjustments we had to make was the frequent service intervals. In BMW or Mercedes, intervals are 15,000 miles. In infiniti, it is 3750 miles. This means 2-3 more visits to the dealer/service.

The packages are well designed and standard equipment is good. My biggest gripe is with the 7-speed transmission which is jerky between gears 1-4 (apparently a known issue).

The G37 is truly remarkable and very fun and engaging to drive. It is nimble and very fast. I like the lines better and the interior is much better and more intuitive.

All that adds up to a 48k G37, but it's still almost 11k less than a comparably equipped and less powerful 3 series or other European sedan. Don't get me wrong, it's a fantastic vehicle without these options, and people have to purchase within their respective budgets, but I often hear complaints that may have been remedied buy the selection of certain option packages.

New front is vastly different from 09 and much more aggressive. Lower fog lights really add to the front. Would like some color on the steering wheel, but the new dash is very refined in appearance.

Audi S5 and BMW M3 were high on my initial list, but I kept coming back to the Infiniti as a more practical solution as a daily driver.

So your not gonna get 30mpg. I recently brought a pre certified 2014 Q60 sport model with 12100 miles on it. I traded in my 2007 M35. So far I like this car a lot I think you get a lot of bang for your buck. I paid 30.000 bucks for mine financing approx 21000 after 10000 for my trade in. So yeah 30 grand for a car as close to new as you can get. Yeah it's a bang for your buck. I love the new 20017 Q60. But not ready to spend 56k. Yes the technology lil things like the infotainment system is a lil long in the tooth but still relevant.  As far as the gas not bad at all. I drive 53 miles a day back and forth to work. And a tank of gas last me the whole week. Handles beautifully especially around curves. And I dont know how anybody doesn't love that signature Infiniti roar that 3.7 liter v6 puts out. Again it's a sports coup people it's supposed to sound fun and be fun to drive.. Also yes the new models are turbo. But remember turbo is a he'll of a lot of money when the turbo malfunctions. One final thing I got a great warranty regular warranty expires 2018. Power train warranty as well as pre certified warranty expires 2020. So yeah I'm very very happy,4

I run winter tires to enhance Snow/Ice traction and will take it anywhere. Technology is good, but not great compared to today's standard, but new model years promise upgrades in that area.  I have this on a special lease program for 24 months and its coming near it end.  I wish I would have taken a longer lease, I really enjoy this vehicle.  Some earlier comments referenced poor MPG, but I get from 21-24MPG in a mixture of driving conditions. The requirement for Premium fuel is a draw-back.

4304, on 07/21/16 18:21 PM (PDT),Jorge ,2015 INFINITI Q60 Coupe Coupe Sport 2dr Coupe (3.7L 6cyl 6M),Excellent Car - Great Value," After 105K miles and 7 1/2 years of ownership, it was time to change my beloved BMW 135i (I6 twin turbo 300HP/300torque / 6 manual) and I looked around high and low for a suitable replacement with a manual transmission. This is a review from BMW's owner perspective. My 2015 Q60S came fully loaded, in fact there were no options to add, which was quite funny and pleasant for me. The leather quality is good and craftsmanship is up to my old BMW. The technology in the car is great and Bluetooth and connections works well, the quality of the sound is very good but I miss the DSP capabilities of my old ride (no digital equalizer, etc). On the driving side, the engine feels powerful but in the high rev spectrum, it does not have the quick response of a twin turbo engine but feel agile enough, I have not explored the high end of the tachometer yet, but I am confident I will have a smile, it is still a 2,000 miles’ engine after all. The space in the back is enough for my 2 daughters on short trips and I am very pleased with the value and amenities of the car. Bottom line is, this car has a very reliable/trusted V6 engine, with Variable Valve and Lift technology but without the add ons that will cause constant repairs in a Turbo engine, like fuel pumps, positive crack valve, sensors, lean conditions, etc. It is a very powerful car and the delivery of the power is non-intimidating, has inexpensive components (normal spark plugs, spare tire, oil stick, jack, etc.) that will make you have a smile every time you have to service it. Missing points: The manual transmission feels normal, not really a short throw, crazy agility delivered close to 5K rpm, no 60/40 rear seat.8,000 Update (Feb 2017)Took a 500 miles trip with my 2 daughters and was nice. The engine has loosen up nicely and now I am enjoying a more spirited driving experience. The manual shifter has also become more engaging.Things i like the most: Service experience at the dealer is great and so inexpensive (<50 USD for oil change). I know BMW service is included but let's talk after 48 months. The 3.7 variable valve with lift V6 engine is great and so engaging after 5K rpm, wonderful! The tires will not make it to 30K miles but I am sure it will be less expensive that run flats. Nothing has broken, no ratles and the leather seats look like new. Very happy with the Infiniti experience so far!Details for improvement and why the germans can charge more: the headlights and fog lights have diferent color temperature, cruise control can have up to 5 mph variation, tilt the navigation a few degrees towards the driver, your right elbow does not have a support while shifting, shifter has to be 1 inch smaller.",5

4306, on 02/17/16 00:27 AM (PST),Kailasa Ishaya ,2015 INFINITI Q60 Coupe Coupe Sport Limited 2dr Coupe (3.7L 6cyl 7A),It's ALMOST perfect....," I should probably start this off by saying I am a long-time Nissan fan.My previous car was a '95 300zx TT that had been meticulously maintained, but was just getting...well, old.  I did consider a new Z; but the last several gens of Z's are just plain fugly to me - plus the newer Z's are cramped inside and feel somewhat cheap. So, after testing the Q60S, the 370Z, the new Lexus RC350 F-sport, the Audi TT, the Hyundai Genesis coupe, and the new Camaro, I decided to go for the Q60S.  (I almost went with the Genesis, but the Hyundai dealership here was [non-permissible content removed])This Q60 Sport is a great car...except for a major flaw, and a few minor quirks. I won't spend time going over every little thing that you can read about in any good review of the car.  It's a blast to drive, VERY quiet, VERY comfortable, and has all the tech a spirited driver could ask for.  The driver's seat is one of the best I have ever planted my butt in, the controls are intuitive and well-laid out (though I would now recommend the shift paddles on the wheel), and I've never been able to get the car to lose its cool, even in a good rain!  The suspension is dialed in JUST right in my opinion - stiff enough for excellent handling, and supple enough to handle the 3rd World condition roads we have here in Hawai'i.  Visibility is good, and with the reverse sensors and camera, you're able to see it all.  Brakes are super and haul the car down fast.The engine is a dynamo - it puts my old stock TT to shame.  I don't get what a lot of reviewers say about the engine being noisy - hell, for a 330hp V6 that has a 7000rpm redline, it's smooth and gives all the right noises (Be SURE to get the optional ""sport exhaust"".  Even though Infiniti won't say it, I'm pretty sure it's the IPL exhaust, and lets the engine put out a few more ponies to boot.  Regardless, it sounds great, and I get a big grin every time I rev it!)The major flaw - the transmission.  The 7AT in this car is VERRRRY slow in regular drive mode.  The tranny in my new Ford paratransit van is better...and that is a horrible thing to say.  I've had the Q60s tranny software updated, and the tranny STILL just sucks.  Basically, it acts like it was programmed for best fuel economy and not performance! When warm, there is a hesitation from a stop - like the torque converter is bad; same thing happens around corners occasionally; and at other times it feels like the tranny is having trouble deciding what gear it wants to be in. This gets really frustrating with that 330hp on tap!  I drove a QX50 loaner once, and that car embarrasses my Q60s acceleration.  The problem almost goes away when the tranny is in DS (manual sport) mode, but the shifts are still a little slow and the takeoff balky.  The transmission in this car just kills the experience.[UPDATE: - It appears the problem with this transmission is in the engine and transmission controllers - they don't handle a car using ethanol fuel (which we mainly have here in Hawai'i) when the ambient temperature is around 90 degrees.  I've switched to non-ethanol fuel, and/or dumping a bottle of octane booster in the tank, and this pretty much resolves the driveability problem.]If you decide to get a Q60 coupe, and love to drive - get the MANUAL transmission.  I'm glad I only have a 2-year lease on this car.  That's how badly the tranny irritates me.My first little quirk is with the Climate Control.  I've had a number of cars with Climate Control, and it appears Infiniti decided to do things a little differently with their version.  For example, if you just want fresh air - you have to shut the system off, then turn on the fans, then lower the temp setting as far as you want, and then turn the A/C on, and then off.  Ridiculous!  If you don't do all those steps - even though the panel says NEITHER the temp control nor the A/C is on, they continue to work anyway!  Oh, and you can't have recirculating air unless the A/C is on.  There is also sunlight sensors on the dash that seem to override the temperature control.  In most cars I've always set the temp at 75, left it there and been happy.  With this car, I have to keep changing the temp settings to keep from freezing!Second quirk is with the doors.  The doors are damn heavy, and if there is any kind of strong breeze blowing, they are a bitch to open, and almost impossible to keep open!  I've had to come up with a new ""exit routine"" to keep from getting a leg caught in the door as we usually have healthy Trade Winds here in Hawai'i.Last quirk - to me, even the upgrade Bose sound system's speakers sound muddy - NOT what I'm used to, as my 300zx had a Bose system.  The ""driver's stage"" setting on the system is cool - it's like surround sound, but the speakers need to be wayyyyy crisper in my opinion.  Subwoofer is pretty good, and it's nice to be able to tie my phone audio directly into the car system with a couple of button pushes.",4
