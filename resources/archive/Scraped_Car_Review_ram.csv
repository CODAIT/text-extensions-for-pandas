We liked the van, its ride, styling, etc., but we really needed a larger cargo area.  This would be a good delivery van for florists, parts distributors, etc.",4
1, on 04/28/16 17:01 PM (PDT),NANCY H ,2015 Ram CV Tradesman Minivan 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),INCREDIBLE VALUE," I am an appliance repair(wo)man. Bought the van new 3 years ago. 80k later, I've changed the front brakes and tires once. Although I change the oil every 3k to 4k miles, the book says every 8k. The acceleration is like a race car, even fully loaded to the brim with parts and tools. It goes from -0- to zoom in a few fast seconds. With sliding doors on each side, and a rear hatch, all my parts and tools are easily accessible. There are no rear windows, but the back-up camera works very well. I trust dodge to build a reliable van, and have never....never....been let down. Since 1995, and 4 hard-ridden vehicles later, i've always sold them at about 250k, with no major repairs. I paid 16.5 k, brand new....put 500.00 in shelving, and on the road we went. Peace of mind is priceless. Can't wait to see what they add in 2016! Built in wifi and a tablet station would be very usefull....add a printer into the dash, and you'd have the best service vehicle in history. Thanks again for keeping the faith!",5
2, on 05/20/15 00:52 AM (PDT),sikpuppy ,2015 Ram CV Tradesman Minivan 4dr Minivan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Perfect van for service technicians," I just got the C/V as a company vehicle about a month ago. Coming from a Ford Transit, this vehicle is like riding on a cloud...a quick cloud! And I no longer feel like I'm going to get run over while trying to merge onto the freeway. The ""expert review"" that said the Transit is more comfortable  around town is completely inaccurate. Comparing the Transit or NV200 to a Ram C/V isn't even fair...to Ford, Nissan or Chrysler. Any employee or other person travelling from site to site all day is going to be way happier in the C/V...and a lot safer than in a Transit or NV200. The C/V is smooth, powerful, has power everything and ample space for tools/equipment. Even the stock sound system isn't bad for what it is. Ok, 75000 miles later :Cons: The side mirrors have terrible blind spots. They could be better. Invest in some small stick-on blind spot  mirrors. The spare tire could be located in a better spot. Other than that, still a great vehicle for service technicians. Very disappointed that Ram discontinued the model.",5

I get comments on it all the time. This truck had the upgraded UConnect  5.0 . . .  it is much nicer than anything else I have had.I am 6'3"""" and I really love the size - super comfortable seats. They are the gray cloth. Cabin is really comfy. I call this truck the 400 HP BarcaloungerEngine - So far so good . . .14 MPG around town I have seen to 23 MPG highway. I have seen haters call the hemi ""gutless"", but I cannot figure out what they are talking about. The engine is a runner, pulls solid off the bottom, but seems to come on to the cam at about 3500 - 4000 rpm. It is fun to drive. I have done some towing (mulch) . . . .  put her in Tow/Haul mode. It did not complain any. Tranny - Got the 8 speed. I was a little wigged about no dipstick. But this is apparently a high end tranny. I guess i will worry about it when I need to. I would like to do a fluid change at 50K. We'll see. For now, it is the smoothest tranny I have ever seen. Lightning shifts, almost imperceptible. Almost magic. You CAN catch engine and tranny napping at times. Engine in MDS ECO mode, tranny in OD then when you step on the gas it has to wake up.  I guess this is how it gets 22+ mpg highway.  Issues up to now - One day the shifter locked. It cleared up on it own. Also, the 3rd brake light on the cab was leaking some. I got weather stripping and fixed that myself.If this truck does not turn to a pumpkin, I'll probably hold onto it until I trade it in for a Buick Regal (probably when I am 85)",5
11, on 04/20/16 14:03 PM (PDT),Steve ,2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab Sport 4dr Quad Cab 4WD SB (5.7L 8cyl 8A),"Over 10,000 miles.  Ram Rebel 5.7"," I have owned this truck for just about 8 months now and felt I could give it a proper assessment.  Zero issues to report.  I have the 5.7 with the 3.92 gears and 8spd trans.  I have averaged just around 16mpg in mixed driving conditions.  While towing a 7,000 lb camper (which this truck does effortlessly) I average around 11 mpg.  Two of my favorite options are the ramboxes (storage compartments accessible from the outside of the bed that utilize the space above the wheel wells without compromising bed capacity (still able to load 4x8 sheets of plywood and drywall no problem)).  My second is the adjustable air suspension which can lower to allow ease of entry and raise to an off-road dedicated 10+"" clearance height.Interior - spacious and comfortable in both front and back seats.  There is so much leg room in the quad cab rear seats this truck easily carries linebackers in the back in absolute comfort.  The instrument cluster is programmable as to which display you want to see in the center and what data to appear on the corners of the digital display and is intelligently flanked by the large rpm gauge and speedometer.  This is truly the most comfortable vehicle I have ever ridden in.  Storage is ample and everywhere.  under back seats, storage wells in floor boards, behind back seats, door pockets, seat pockets, center console, dual glove compartments...The ram boxes are extremely useful and allow larger tools, hunting gear to be stored and locked in sync with the remote, or through a couple bags of ice and a case of your favorite beverage and  you are the tailgate king.Included as part of the Rambox package is a ram embossed heavy duty plastic bed divider which also serves as a tailgate extender as well as a Ram embossed tonneau cover which folds into thirds to allow tall items in the bed and easily folds back into place to cover the bed.Performance- The 395 HP Hemi is amazing.  It really is a fast truck when you get up on it, but rides with the comfort of a luxury sedan.  The exhaust note sounds deep and throaty when starting or accelerating and just loud enough to sound impressive without be obnoxious.  Even with the 33"" Off-Road toyo tires included as part of the rebel package you would never know it from the inside of the cabin.  Lots of people complain about the shift knob, but I actually like it.  It frees up a lot of space in the center console area where a center shifter may go.  It's beefy and easy to use and you will never mistake it for the radio volume knob.Also get the 8.4AN stereo option (9 speaker Alpine system with a subwoofer)  the nav is meh, good compared to other vehicles, but with iphone apps such as waze and google maps.  The stereo sounds fantastatic and never feels strained when cranked up to 11 on the volume know ( you know, 10 and One).I always love driving this truck.  I get many compliments and although it's not the cheapest transport option out there, The Ram's are very competitively priced and I was able to get mine at 8,000 below sticker.",5
12, on 04/01/16 16:29 PM (PDT),Josh07 ,2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab SLT 4dr Quad Cab SB (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Best truck ever," I recently bought a 2015 RAM 1500 SLT, and cannot be happier to own and drive this truck. Aggresive look, engine is strong, but drives so smooth, interior is made of quality materials and awesome MPG! Hope it will last for a long time, before I consider getting another replacement. Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",5
13, on 01/04/16 07:34 AM (PST),Lou Green ,2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab Express 4dr Quad Cab 4WD SB (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Eco diesel lot of problems," I bought my 2014 Dodge Ecodiesel for the fuel economy and roominess it offered.  I will say that my ram 1500 quadcab does ride well and gets great fuel economy in the summer.  I average 24 mpg and have seen as high as 30 on the highway.  Winter time those numbers drop 3-4 mpg here in NJ.  The problem with this truck is it has proven to be very Unreliable. Before its first year anniversary it spent 39 days at the dealer for repairs.  An electrical meltdown best describes the issues.  They used trial and error and replaced lots of parts, each time waiting several days for new parts to come in.  The dealer service is the pits.  I swapped dealers last week and more of the same.  AC, cruise control and a starting issue are still being addressed.  More parts ordered and more time at the dealer.   I will be shopping for a replacement very soon.  Buyer beware !Update:  traded the Ram in and no longer own this truck.  I found most dealers offered less trade in value for that Ecodiesel than the gas engine model even though the diesel is an upgraded option.  I'm at 42000 miles and tried to trade the RAM in on a Tundra, however the word is out on the ECO diesel and now resale is very poor and this is for a truck that commands a premium dollar for the diesel option.   Looks like I'm stuck with it till the 5 year/100000 mile warranty runs out.Update2: Finally found a dealer that gave me a trade in for a 2016 Ram gas engine model and so far so good.",1
14, on 11/26/15 18:35 PM (PST),Mark ,2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab Big Horn 4dr Quad Cab SB (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Just got the truck of my dreams, The crew cab proves to provide plenty of room for a family of 4.  I drive a lot of miles and wasn't sure I should get the hemi or the v6. The v6 proves to get great mpg at 20/25 on a full size truck and power is not a problem pushing 305 hp it does the job. Quite cab and lots of comfort. The only thing that upset me was the $800 charge they wanted to charge me for the navigation download so I use my garmen gps that I paid $100 for and get free updates for life. Come on ram give the navigation with the truck.  I do love my ram truck though.,5
15, on 11/16/15 08:25 AM (PST),Robert Butler ,2015 Ram 1500 Quad Cab Big Horn 4dr Quad Cab SB (3.6L 6cyl 8A),From Ford to Dodge (RAM)," I have been Chevrolets and Fords for over 25 years.  This is my first Dodge primarily due to my fathers advice that Dodge's have great power trains, but horrible everything else.  Times have changed, at least with respect to the ""everything else"".Keep in mind, I have only had this truck for a month and only have 3,500 miles on it, however, here are my first impressions.This truck (Ram 1500 SLT Crew Cab with Big Horn package, Hemi engine, 3.93 rear diff) runs like a scalded cat.  The ride is not like a Lincoln Towncar... it is a truck, I would hope not, but it is very smooth and quiet.  The advertised 15mpg city / 20mpg highway is a pipe dream, but I suspect the rear differential may have something to do with that.  On the positive side, I am getting about 16.5 mpg highway while driving 80mph through the Texas hill country.  City driving is about 14.5 mpg so not that much worse than advertised.The turn knob shifter took some getting used to, but I appreciate the space recovered from where the shifter would traditionally be.  My only complaint is that some of the A/C controls (changing from dash vents to floor vents, etc) must be done via the touch screen.Overall, I love this truck.",5

I have air suspension, Ram boxes, convenience package, sunroof, skid plates, navigation and 3.55 gears in the rear axle. I love this truck! I did a ton of research on all truck brands and it came down to this truck or the 2015 F150 with the 2.7L V6. In my opinion the configuration of this truck - the V6 Pentastar with 3.55 gears, and 4x4. Is the best drive train on the market. With 4,600 miles on the truck I am averaging 32 MPH and 19.6 miles to the gallon!!!",5

The issues as reported was water penetration into the wiring harness. This cause the glow plug harness to be replaced 3 separate times. The error codes ranged from the check engine light an glow plug symbol to messages flashing on the dash saying, battery voltage low, def system failure service needed, defrost system failure.   Every time get it back works great then the issues arises. Mechanic and dealer are now claiming that the water penetration is from dirty water and this void warranty.

I've got 217,500 on mine most of the miles have an Airstream, TT, boat, cargo trailer in tow sometimes with a Harley or other cargo to deliver in the bed.  Repairs have been a light switch & an alignment both at 196,000.  The engine is quiet & smooth as is the 8 speed transmission.  At 65 mph unloaded it averages 30 mpg.  Towing a typical 26' Airstream TT from Ohio to the west coast at 65 nets between 15.0 & 17.0 mpg depending upon headwind.  Its an efficient & comfortable long distance commuter or moderate weight tower.  The quiet smooth ride is more road compliant and handles better than any other truck but is too soft under a load without either the factory air suspension or supplementation from one of the aftermarket axle to frame air bag companies. (TLC, Timber Grove, Air Lift) Mine benefits from an aftermarket tune with an engine brake for safely descending grades with a trailer.  Still have original brakes.  Truck also has optional trailer brake controller. Tune also provided some power and mileage and minimalized re circulation of EGR soot.  Never had any emissions problems. The 1500 platform as well as the motor has its limitations if you plan to tow 9,000 pounds or 33+ foot TT you would be better served by a HD.  Short of that its a great truck and I would buy another one.",5
21, on 11/27/15 11:20 AM (PST),Randy Veatch ,2015 Ram 1500 Diesel HFE 4dr Quad Cab SB (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),No complaints on FCA," Went from 2010 F150 to 2013 Ram with Hemi, to this 2015 Ram 1500 with Eco Diesel.   Been happy with Ram, fuel economy on the Eco Diesel is good (21 city, 25 hwy) but the Hemi was more fun!   My experience with Dodge / Ram / Jeep has been good over the years, from 1995 to now between my wife and I having Ford, Mercury, Chevy, and several Dodge / Ram products and my wife now has a 2014 Grand Cherokee.   We have had just as many problems with other brands (fuel problems in 2010 F150, bearing went of rear diff in 2007 Tahoe) and have no complaints on CDJR products.  Love the quiet of the diesel in my 2015 Ram, and the 8 speed transmission in the 2013 and the 2015 are the best transmission I have ever driven.   They could have a little better quality of the plastic on the glove box, and I miss my glasses case in the roof of my Ford, but overall been very satisfied.",5
22, on 10/28/15 13:16 PM (PDT),Ryan ,2015 Ram 1500 Diesel HFE 4dr Quad Cab SB (3.0L 6cyl Turbodiesel 8A),Less happy with the truck since my last review," It's a Chrysler, so reliability is poor.  I trade premium pickups every two years and prior to this MoPar I had a Ford F-250 and two GMC 2500 HD's before that.  First the Ecodiesel and 8 speed transmission are awesome.  My actual fuel mileage is what Ram says it should be.  Other than expensive oil changes and fuel filter replacements required every 15,000 miles, I have no complaints as to the drive train.  The product as a whole irritates me often.  With the last 3 pickups over the past 7 years I've never had an issue with recalls or repairs with the GMC's or Fords (not counting that piece of crap 6.0 Powerstroke Ford built 4 vehicles ago) but the recalls and breakdowns of this Chrysler irritate me.  A sensor took 5 days to repair and resulted in the Ram being hauled from my home on a truck.   Ram refused to take it to the dealer where I bought it and stuck me with a local village idiot.  I drove 50 miles to avoid the local dealer and buy the truck because the local dealer is the village idiot, Ram can't haul a $54K pickup an extra 50 miles?  Now, the real reason for me going to the trouble to write a review about a truck that is actually pretty nice.  The navigation.... map updates are $150!!!  Are you kidding me?  I can buy a Garmin and stick it on the windshield with free lifetime updates for a little more than $150 and the Ram radio that is an extra $1000 for navigation costs me $150 to update?  Unbelievable.  Stick it to me Chrysler, see if I come back.  There are other really nice pickups out there.  I'll probably have one of those others next time.This is the update on the Ram.  I've downgraded several items from my first review.  The main thing I see that irritates me is decreasing fuel mileage.  I initially got 27 highway and was pleased.  I've not seen that in a while now, it has dropped overall about 3 or 4 mpg now with nearly 60,000 miles on the truck.  Navigation is irritating, I refuse to update the maps when I can have Siri just take me where I want to go so I consider the navigation option a total waste of money.  I replaced the OEM Goodyear Wrangler SAE  tires with what I hoped would be better tires, and am running Bridgestone Duramax all season tires.  They create more road noise, ride much harsher than the Goodyears and don't seem to have any better traction.  I should have stayed with the Goodyears.  The recalls have been a real hassle.  My dealer is slow and it is irritating to have to update the software, change out the entire exhaust and etc.  I knew this was a possibility as the ecoDiesel in my 2015 was a beta model, but the hassle has been a bit more than expected.",4

Spend a lot of time in ""limp mode"" on my way back to the dealer. Multiple engine problems related to diesel regeneration process and throttle control.

The Ram is the only truck that has a coil rear suspension.  Everyone else has a leaf-spring rear suspension.  The ride is terrific.  You do give up about a 1000 lbs in towing capacity and 100 lbs in rear cargo.  But ask your yourself, ""How often do I tow 10,000 lbs?""  For most people the answer is never.  But you will enjoy that ride every mile.  It is a tremendously better ride over Ford or Chevy or Nissan.  I have owned them all.  My last two trucks have been Dodge.  Another point is the Rambox.  It is a space saver for me and worth every penny.  I use my trucks on a farm and I have towed 10,000 lbs upon occasion.  Ram gets he work done and I ride in style and comfort.  My 2010 Dodge had 145,000 miles when I sold it and never a problem.  My 2015 has 80,000 on it now and no issues.  I do service my trucks right on schedule and it pays off.",5

Averaging 27-28 mpg in mostly  highway driving.  Very comfortable truck.  Performance has been excellent as well.  At 62,000 easy miles, the issues have begun.  EGR valve is clogged and ""can't be cleaned"".  EGR cooler is leaking into the exhaust system (common problem)  FCA won't even return a phone call. All parts are back ordered for 3-4 weeks because so many of these trucks have the same problem.  Dealership has been very good and is trying to help me but FCA won't stand behind the dealer or the customer.  No rental vehicle, no help getting the parts, and no guarantee that these parts that I'm paying for ($3,100) will even fix the problem. The only way these ecodiesels will make it beyond 75,000 miles is to go with an EGR tune.  These are the only ones that are functioning well.  The problem is it can void the warranty.  I really like the truck when it's functioning.  The most disappointing part of this experience is FCA when the issues begin.  I've never been a fan of extended warranties but, for this truck, You better have it.  Most repair jobs are done by throwing parts at it until they find the issue' expensive and backordered parts.  I would gladly trade out of the Ecodiesel for the V6 Penstar motor.",2

The fuel mileage beats the EPA estimate and it is very comfortable to drive. I have driven it a 1000 mi in a day and found it as comfortable as any car. My favorite features are the towing mirrors, the shift knob, USB ports, interior storage, driving feel and the way it looks. I have owned many Chrysler products and they have all been very trouble free. UPDATE: It now has 71,000 miles and still not one problem. It still has the original brake pads. I change my own oil and it is one of the easiest oil changes around. I buy the Rotella T6 from Walmart and the Mopar filter from amazon and the cost for an oil change is about 85.00 dollars.",5

The first was a 2011 4x4 crew cab that we loved but was part of the huge recall where the back ends need replaced, which really put a bad taste in our mouth since we had been driving this truck pulling campers and boats for many years with children on trips, knowing they should have recalled this years ago and knowing we weren't ""safe"" was a bad feeling.  Dealership said it would be 8-10 weeks without our truck to repair, really??  So we traded it in!  Bought a new 2015 4x4 big horn with the longer bed, love it!!  But each time we started it up a big cloud of white smoke blew out the tale pipes.  We contacted salesman, who said to put first 1000 miles on it and if it's still did it to bring it in.  At 5,000 miles husband does first oil change and only 2 quarts of oil comes out (it holds 7 quarts)!!!  We take it to dealership explain this, they hook it up and say ""it has to be water vapor, nothing's wrong with truck"". We continue to drive it, we are adding a quart of oil every 1000-1500 miles!  That's a lot of oil this truck is burning!!  We now have 10,000 miles and decide they are going to figure this out.  We take it in to dealer, nothing leaking oil outside engine so they mark the oil level and tell us to drive it 1,000 miles and bring it back in so they can ""document how much it's burning then send a request to Chrysler dodge fiat to see if they will allow them to replace or repair engine"".  So now we play their game... I think it's ridiculous! We pay $45,000 for a brand new truck that burns oil like a 20 year old truck?!?!  Just to be told they may or may not fix the problem... As much as we have loved our 2 ram trucks, if they don't fix this under warranty, it will be the last dodge Chrysler anything we own!!!!",2

Took it to the dealer 3 times for steering vibrations that could not be resolved.  Dealer was a pain in the behind but FCA was great to deal with.  They bought the truck back.  I didn't even ask for it. 2nd Ram is great!  Going on 26000 miles and it's solid.  Only have been back to the dealer for small things.  Like uconnect updates.  It rides like a car, plenty if power.  Consistently 21+ mpg on highway.  Very comfortable seats.My conclusion.  Very well designed truck.  Prolly the best of all truck brands.  I'm not brand loyal either.  I go with the best product.  However, the unions are what plagues these truck companies.  Unions should be busted up.  That's why reliability is hit and miss.  These guys might be pissed off at management one week and put together a string of sloppily made trucks.  I've been part of a union and they aren't good for the auto industry.Update:  this Ram has 37k miles on it and it is one solid truck!  I love it.  No squeaks or rattles, and very reliable.Update:  57k miles and still drives like a new truck.  I keep it waxed and clean plus all maintenance.  I've had small issues so far.

I've had no major issues; this is the 2nd Ram truck I've owned and been very happy with both of them.  I would recommend the Ecodiesel without hesitation.

It had everything I need in a truck: great ride, towing, and fuel efficiency.  All was great until I was driving home from an out-of-state trip.  About 200 miles from home, in the middle of nowhere, my engine died on the interstate while I was do about 65.  Fortunately, I pulled over safely and contacted roadside assistance.  It was a Saturday.  Their solution, as per their contract, was to tow me to the nearest dealer, in a small town.  The dealership was already closed for the day and would be closed on Sunday.  I had to be at work on Monday, so this wasn't an option for me.  Fiat Chrylser America couldn't help me; their ""roadside assistance"" was to leave me stranded in a small down for days.  I had to pay out-of-pocket myself for my Ram to be towed home so I could at least go to work.It turned out to that the resonator blew.  The local dealership held it for several days and returned it to me repaired.  Two weeks later, my ""low oil pressure light came on.""  I dropped it off at the dealership and after a day or two they called me back and told me there was metal in the oil pain.  The engine disintegrated and I was told it would be replaced under warranty.Today is day #30 without a truck.  I have opened  a case with Fiat Chrylser America and have talked to their customer-service representative once.  She was very nice, but unfortunately I haven't received an update in about 10 days.Overall, I regret purchasing this truck.  I've spoke with other Ecodiesel owners on Ram forums and it seems I'm not alone when it comes to dead engines and difficulties with Fiat Chrylser America.  I will happily update this review if there is a happy ending.UPDATE:  There wasn't.  The truck was a lemon.  Traded it in at a substantial financial loss to myself for another brand of truck which has run wonderfully.

I bought a new 2015 Ram 2500 diesel 1 year ago. I have had it in the shop almost 100 days total and 35 days 1 time alone until I had to pick it up to tow my trailer. The problems are from the window regulator, stereo, tire pressure monitoring system, transmission will not shift correct and finally just wouldn't start today and left me stranded. The brakes don't work and they found an internal leak but issue still isn't fixed. All issues are verified but none have been fixed. Some people at ram have been nice while others want to make it nothing but hard for me to get any thing done about it. Finally after my case manager told me ""there's nothing we can do about it and if You want a different outcome to seek arbitration""  I did open a case with NDCS and turned in my evidence for arbitration and they left out my main letter and told me it's too late to do anything about it now. They also held the meeting in Texas when I live in Arizona and wouldn't tell me where if I wanted to attend.  At that point it was a one sided argument besides my service records. Arbitration awarded me a new truck but after going to the dealership today and picked out a new truck. I would have to get a new loan, my down payment and monthly payments I made would be erased and my loan will be for more than the original. 0 compensation and told me I will have to swap all my after market parts like leveling kit, wheels/tires, amp power steps, remote start, bed tow prep package, and aftermarket tint. It has been the worst experience I have ever dealt with and not the experience I expected when buying my first brand new truck. Everyone from Ram points fingers to others and no one can help or point me in the right direction. I have been waiting for a call from Ram directly to se what we can do again but it's been over a month after they told me 1-3 days twice In a row and erased my case. After calling in and finding out it was erased I had to re open one and start over. Ram customer service SUCKS",2

My last truck was a 2012 RAM Hemi Crew Cab 4wd. That had a 6 speed auto transmission. The new one has an 8 speed. This is the best transmission ever invented. I have had about 70 vehicles in my lifetime and I cannot impress upon this feature enough. Not only do I average 20-22MPG in mixed driving (I don't floor the hemi very often), but this transmission seems to read my mind. It is always in the right gear. I love the looks, the seats, the comfort of independent suspension, the UCONNECT and many other things about this RAM...but the 8 speed automatic is outstanding! When you can get 20-22mpg in a 4WD crew cab with 400HP, you are doing something AMAZING. My sister bought the same vehicle with a few more bells and whistles and she has hit 24mpg on the highway.

So far it has met and even exceeded most of my expectations.  I traded in my beloved 2006 Toyota Tundra 4x4, however I didn't know what I was missing.  The Laramie, for being a good sized truck drives extremely easy...its crazy.  The interior is well designed and easy to use.  The Uconnect system is one of the easiest systems I have ever used.  Everything from the GPS, Bluetooth, air conditioned/heated seats and setting up internet in the truck is simple.  The Alpine system puts out incredible sound and the speakers in the ceiling is just cool in my opinion.The 5.7 Hemi, 8 speed transmission w/ 321 gears...is also one of my favorite features.  The truck has a lot of power!  I have averaged from day one--17 MPG.  I have seen as high as 22.7 on the highway and as low as 14 pulling my boat.  My Toyota never saw over 19 MPG and it's 800 lbs lighter and had 125 less HP.  So I am very happy with the Laramie's mileage.  Hopefully as it breaks in even more, I will see a little higher MPG.  But, fair warning...the motor puts out 495 hp.  If your heavy in the gas, your mileage will suffer.  I have experienced that when my wife drives haha.The only item I have had trouble with in the keyless key FOB.  On occasion, I have had my key FOB on me while I'm in the truck...but the truck didn't pick it up, which meant the truck wouldn't start.  My truck starts with a push button, not an actual key.  So I had to get out of the truck, lock and unlock it, then I got back in and it started.  Yes, that will irritate you.   That's my only complaint.I am experimenting with a KN filter right now, to see if it helps or hurts my mileage.  I will post later what my results are.  I have heard it both ways 1) that it helped  2) that it hurt your mileage.  So after a few road trips using both (stock filter or KN)...I will have some actual data to share.My truck is a Cowboy Cadallic.  Dodge really did it right this time.

Its Bright Red with step bars, chrome wheels, bed liner, tow hitch, and tinted windows. I have 22k miles on the odometer now. All in all the truck has been the best vehicle I have ever owned. However, its my first new vehicle. Most of my cars and trucks before this one were 10 or 20 years old. The 5.7 Hemi has plenty of power, probably to much. 3.92 rear gear axle ratio. The 8 speed auto seams to keep the power at the wheels at all times which comes in handy while I am towing. And, I tow a lot! Almost 95% of the time I am towing a 4k pound box cargo trailer. Fuel economy varies depending on what I am doing. If I am towing around town with a lot of stops then I can see 13mpg. That's stopping a lot too. If I am towing but on the interstate going 70mph then I am looking at 15mpg. Towing on back highways going 55mph and I am getting 20-22 mpg. Not towing in town with frequent stops 20mpg. Not towing on the interstate at 70mph 26mpg. Not towing on back roads at 55mph 30-32mpg. My right front tire wore out after 17k miles on the outside tread. Maybe from towing all the time.

There was not an exact match for purposes of the review on Edmunds. This truck has the softest and quietest ride. It is unbelievable. Chrysler really thought of everything when putting together this truck.  This isn’t even the Limited, but I have not had one of those “awww man, I wish it had the _____.” Mine doesn’t have rambox or the air suspension, but I can’t imagine the suspension can be anymore smooth yet agile than it already is. As for the rambox, I’m sure it’s a nice feature, but there is plenty of space to store things securely inside, even in those little boxes built into the floor. This truck is smart - it knows the temperature enough to decide whether to turn on the heated seats/steering wheel, or turn on the ventilated seats. It also knows whether to turn on the defroster and the heated mirrors. Apple car play is amazing. So much easier than using the older Uconnect systems. Even something so passive as the wheel to wheel steps are brilliantly engineered. They’re at the perfect height to get in and out of the truck (without muddying up your pants). The design of the truck (although dated, and slated for a remodel for the MY 2019), is still gorgeous. I have the Delmonico Red, and the paint is amazing, and the truck still has that “tough” look. Call me gaudy, but I love all the chrome. The only knock on the truck is that sometimes the steering wheel controls have a spasm and won’t work. It usually corrects itself after turning off the car and coming back to the car a few minutes later.   If that’s my only complaint, this truck is simply amazing. Like another reviewer said, gas mileage sucks, but I didn’t buy this truck to get 30+ mpg. You’re better off with the diesel or the v6 for that. ",5

By chance I found a prior rental (2017) on craigslist with 12K miles and bought it.  Same exact color (red).  I love this thing!  The gas mileage averages over 20 with mostly town driving (better than my Cadillac).  It was easy to get the USB drive interface working.  Lucked out and got one with the upgraded gauge cluster (highly recommend).  The ride is very smooth and quiet - comparable to my Cadillac.  Love the height.  Voice command not that great, but the phone and USB interfaces more than compensate.  The V6 is more than adequate.  The only con is that it's a little tough to park and fit in the garage, but you have to expect that with a full-size truck.  Glad I bought the Quad Cab instead of the Crew with the long bed (now that's a battleship!).  The 5' 7"" bed normally found on the Crew Cabs is just too short.  Better to trade back seat space for bed space.  A very attractive and practical all-around vehicle.  Thinking of buying a Laramie and selling my other cars.",5

Being a Mopar man most of my life of course I got the Ram 1500 Quad Cab Hemi, 3.92 Limited Slip with trailer tow pkg and Nav with the Alpine system. Came with the bed liner which is the only thing I may take out and replace with the spray in liner. Believe it or not people told me when I had my Challenger I would never get more than 18mpg. (5.7, A-8). Well got an average of 22 over the 26000 miles we had it. Now with this Ram they are saying I will never see more than 15 mpg. Well wrong again. I am still in the process of breaking it in but I am averaging 19.2mpg. Yes we do live in the country and it is more rural with rolling hills, but still getting that on break in we'll take it. The ride in this compared to my friends GMC Z71 2017 he just bought is so much nicer it is ridiculous. He has the 5.3, 355 rear and you can tell the difference between the coil springs in the Ram vs the leaf in his. Comfort wise I'd say the Ram has a little bit of an edge as his seats are more contoured but not as comfy. I chose not to get the crew cab Ram for 2 reasons. $$ wise the crew cab came in 4k more and for the difference I could not see it. Heated seats and steering wheel and shorter bed. Yes the crew also had more room in the back, but seriously how many times do most of us carry people in the back unless you still got kids. The crew cab also did not have the rear window defroster, no Nav ( but Nav capable) and fold down arm rest in the rear and my arms don't go back that far. Basically $$ for $$ the Quad Cab Ram 1500 vs the Crew Cab was our choice. Now my buddy who got the GMC SLT Z71 spent 14k for that puppy and no way can anyone justify 14k for a 4x4 GMC vs Dodge. Heck even the Ram1500 4x4 Crew Cab set up like the GMC was still 4-5k less. So bottom line is dependability, comfort, style, and overall satisfaction all those GM and Ford boys ( especially Ford, aluminum bed really) can keep on dreaming and when they finally settle on getting a real pick up truck they can buy a Ram. Can ya guess by now that I am one happy camper.",5

The first one had the 5.2 ltr. I have never had a problem with reliability on my first one and my 2017 is running great. I do want to note that I ran it on 87 octane for first 7000 miles and ran fine, but one time I started it up (not cold start) noticed for a split second a little engine knock. Only for a slight moment. So I switched to the recommended 89 and haven't had it happen again. So go with recommended and not the acceptable that Manuel states. Other than that I have had no issues whatsoever.  Very happy.  Interior is very pleasing and body style stands out compared to other brands. My son-n-law has a Toyota Tundra that drinks the gas (around 15 city/17 hwy) where I'm averaging 18.9 city/22 hwy. The interior on his is cheap and nothing noteworthy  about it.

My prior vehicle was a 2014 Ram 1500 Bighorn Crew Cab 4x4 with the 5.7 Hemi, 8 speed automatic and 3.92 limited slip rear. I loved my 2014 ram. I drove it for 90,000 miles with zero mechanical issues. I didn't even change the brakes or replace a single light bulb on it. Needless to say this experience made me a big fan of Ram Trucks. I wanted something a little more economical this time, so I switched to the V6 and a more basic trim. The V6 has plenty of power and can even tow 7,400 lbs with the 3.55 gear ratio. So far I am getting 2.5 more mpg with the V6 and I no longer have to use the mid-grade fuel recommended for the Hemi. I am getting over 600 miles out of a tank of gas (upgraded 32 gallon tank). Unless you're really into drag racing or regularly tow very heavy items the V6 should suit your needs just fine. The V6 and 8 speed automatic work seamlessly together. The trans never seems busy and the shifts are so smooth you may need to look at your RPMs to know when a shift has occurred. I opted for the cloth bench seats, which are very comfortable, even more comfortable than the cloth bucket seats in my 2014. I opted for the 5.0 stereo with the stock speakers which are actually pretty decent (better than GM's Bose upgrade). It does a great job of reading the 128 GB thumb drive i store my music on. My 2014 Ram had the Alpine sound system with navigation. The sound quality was excellent. I would highly recommend the Alpine upgrade if it's available in your trim level. The suspension is super smooth and absorbs the bumps on my heavily rutted dirt road with ease. I have found the same road to be pretty jarring in many other vehicles. The brakes are powerful and as mentioned above, have an exceptionally long life. I’ve been able to go through 18 inch deep snow in these trucks with confidence. Having the optional tow hooks is very handy for pulling people out of ditches in the winter or just yanking out stumps. I can't say enough good things about these trucks.",5

Plenty of power, great suspension, quiet cabin, comfortable seats.  Like the high ride for the ability to see far - plus less fatiguing for long trips.  My only beef is the stereo.  Like all FCA products, it automatically turns on each time you start.  The only fix is to turn the volume all the way down rather than pushing the power button.  Also, it only reads USB drives up to 4 GB (FAT32).  It would not play my 64 or 128 GB NTFS-formatted USB drives.  Fords are better here.  Fuel economy display and other Driver Information Center functions are not intuitive (had to read the manual).  Gas mileage was as advertised.  Liked the outside door handles for the quad cab doors (Ford and GM require you to open the front doors to access the buried rear door handles).  Great looking exterior!  Under hood is an amusing sight with the 3.6 - about two feet of empty space between the radiator and engine.  Still, I'd take this over the Ford's amped-up 2.7 with that annoying start/stop feature.  Better to suffer slightly lower MPG than to feel annoyed most of the time.  I never considered a Chrysler product before, but the trucks seem to have better owner reviews than the Fords and GMs.  I'll probably end up buying one of these.  A better truck for less money.  I'll just buy and install a proper stereo from Crutchfield.",4

In my opinion the Ram is the nicest looking full size pickup out there.  Once I put an ARE topper on this truck it will be the perfect all around vehicle.  More room than an SUV with plenty of room for six adults to ride comfortably plus all that cargo space in the back.  The only other pickup I considered was the Ford F150 but the Ram blew it away in terms of pricing, towing capacity and fuel economy.

There might be a point....  Before purchasing a 36ft travel trailer several years back,   I had a F150 Harley 4.6.  It was beautiful truck. Impeccable interior, down to  the accent lighting, air-conditioned seats with trademarked dye with Harley monograms.   The retractable running boards were a nice touch when they worked.  And when they didn't the result was laughable.  There was nothing quick, or powerful about that 4.6L.   And the Harley AWD edition only had a GWVR of ~5.5k so it had to go when I got the trailer.  We also had an AWD Volvo 400hp XC90 at the time which put the ford to shame in terms of power and handling but nowhere near that tow capacity.   I eventually upgraded to the F250 Powerstroke KingRanch which was rated for 14,000 and would tow my 10k trailer up any hill I could find.   But, even with stock suspension and proper weight distribution, the back end sagged noticeably and caused people to  flash their high beams angrily in retaliation for my low beams assuming high beam vectors...  Still, it towed cross-country w/o issue until I discovered that SuperDuty trucks exceed the hight restrictions of many Pacific North West urban parking garages (Including my own residence and place of work) .  So I sold the F250 and recently bought my first 1500 Hemi.   It fits in the garages and I'm happy.  It also has that same aggressive power and handling as the xc90 while towing my weight class and NOT blinding oncoming traffic.  This 1500 Hemi 4x4 with 5k miles was 1/2 the price of Powerstrokes with 40,000 miles or more.  I did have to travel 3 states away to get a decent  deal, and decided to  pass on the higher end trim package while keeping all the tow essentials.  So far I don't miss anything and will have much less to cry about when the Hemi begins to accumulate typical ""cramped garage"" cosmetic wear and tear that  has worst impact on for trucks with higher end packages.",5

I love my Ram, why I add 4 star,? My only ''cons'' is the fuel economy in the city, The Fuel economy falls dramactly in the city (12-13mpg) I think If at least It give you 15 or 16, will be perfect. Cabin is quite , material are good! The info system and screen are very nice and easy to use. The ride is smooth with unloaded bed, so Its a good point. The acceleration and shift are smooth, you can feel the power of the acceleration. I hasn't towed nothing, so I can't give an opinion about that, Nethier about the realibility, I own the truck for 3 months(2500 miles, But I bougth the car with 11000 miles), but I did two small road trips, with no problems, good fuel economy in the HWY using cruise control (22-23 mpg) at 60 mph.  I tested the Silverado before buy my RAM, I hd the idea that to choose the silverado because last more than RAM, but I didnt want to pay 4000 More for a Silverado LT as I wanted. i gonna prove the realibilty of my RAM, so Im new and I don't have previous ideas of RAM! I thougth that the ram will be hard to park but It's easier than I thougth . I prefer park back I think its easier, the sensors and the huge back up camera help you to park. the distance between each axes is no a problem to park.

And only other problem was the tailgate automatic locking device was faulty and kept unlocking the tailgate so as your driving it would slam down.

There is a sandy substance UNDERNEATH the paint in the door jambs of the front passenger and driver side rear door, right where you see it every time you open the door. There is what may be a small fuzz ball stuck UNDER THE PAINT on the bed side. The ""cup"", which is the little plastic area behind the door handle, doesn't fit in the top correctly on the passenger side, I fiddled and fixed the front passenger door, but the rear door has a sold 1/4"" gap all across the top. STAY AT A COMPLETE STOP while changing gears, if you don't, the lights flash on the dash and on the rotor gear selector (which is in a terrible place, considering all I do is turn my fan speed up and down instead of getting into Drive or Park) until you stop again. Kind of annoying. While on the transmission, if you're not at a dead stop, the transmission feels like its fluttering a little while it's engaging from Park to Drive, but if you're on the brakes until it's engaged, you'll not notice.     The truck really is great, but the quality control must've been off the day this one was built, and the rotory knob is weird. The stereo however, is nothing short of amazing. If the window is half up(or down for you pessimists), they rattle with bass, and I've got the bass on 3, and the volume on 20. The thing rocks. Gas mileage has been between 22 and 22.6 on the highway, and pretty solid average of 13.8 in town, a little town, lots of stop and go, like every 300ft. Our city blocks are small.     Really like the display in the dash, kind of like the stereo display, but I got the little one, the bigger one may be better, but I'm pretty satisfied, aside of the fact I bought the cheapest one and it's still 40k, for that price, I'd prefer more quality.",4

Looked at the silverados as a comparison but the price difference was insane. For a Silverado with less equipment than the big horn, chevy wanted almost 9k more. I'm sorry but even if chevy has better resale I doubt it's that high. If I wanted a comparable truck from chevy it was almost 15,000 more. I've heard of people saying ram isn't as reliable but I believe that's a myth seeing as how everyone I talk to about rams says they love it and have never had any problems. Because of the new ""knob shifter I opted for an extended warranty just in case"" . The truck rides great. It seemed more smooth then the chevy and just about as quiet inside the cab. The stock stereo has great sound and the engine noise is just the right amount not too loud but it makes its presence known. The cab is huge. Crew cab has more room then our old suv. My mpg gauge tells me I'm doing almost 20 mpg but the real word when I do the math it's closer to 18. Overall it's a great truck with great looks. Good engine. The hemi sounds awesome. One thing I've noticed is the small ft and finish stuff where ram falls short. Little things that don't hurt the truck but makes you think ""really...."" definitely recommend it though.",5

It's a RAM Bighorn, quad cab, 4x4, 5.7 hemi, cargo boxes, and loaded. I felt I had the best truck on the market better than Ford, Chevy, GMC, Toyota, and Nissan and had researched them all.  First issue was identified phones to work with truck Bluetooth radio didn't work well and most calls were dropped.  After much research learned best radio installed with an out of date android operating system with no way to update.  Also learned talking to RAM customer service a huge waste of time.  I paid the truck off this month and was planning to do scheduled maintenance at 120,000 and became an owner.  Same week check engine light came on put in trusted shop and had plugs (16 ), oil in front, rear, and transfer case changed, and belt.  Advised check engine light from shorted coil and had changed.  Planned to have radiator flushed and fluid changed.  A/C for two years has not cooled well and mechanics have been trying to find a leak, I live in hot South Louisiana, prior to flushing radiator had them find leak advised in evaporator coil requiring weeks and dash board to be pulled.  Also advised truck has a cracked exhaust manifold.  Driving home and discussing scheduling of new needed repairs with wife whose vehicle I borrowed for the days vehicle was in shop, check engine light back on.  Next week back in shop, no issue found advised if light comes back on bring to dealer, problem with computer.  Driving home check engine light back on and brought to another shop where at presently.  Advised cam shaft failure, no compression # 3 cylinder, may need new engine.  Later advised could fix, and having cam shaft, lifters, timing belt, changed.  Also having exhaust manifold, and evaporator core fixed and changed.  Hopefully I'll get the vehicle back sometime this month after approximately $6,000.00 of maintenance and repairs.  Note also two years into vehicle clothe seat bottom on drivers side failed $380.00 to replace, and three years into vehicle wheel tracking sensors failed.  Note mechanic has advised me he has three RAM's in his shop with same problems, and when in at dealer trying to get parts had two mechanics ahead of him trying to get same parts.  This truck was not cheap and I struggled to pay if off and now I will be struggling to just keep it rolling.  This truck has been very well maintained, all service done, and not driven hard.  RAM is aware of the short comings, issues with evaporator cores, cam shafts, lifters, tracking sensors, poor quality seat covers,  and exhaust manifold and for their benefits issues occur at 5 year, 100,000 miles at end of warranty.  Please note they report in their surveys of 95% of vehicles to 95,000 miles.  Costly to keep, costly to maintain, avoid RAM.  Follow Up note in resubmittal.  Since posting this review I'm getting nuisance warranty review calls from different numbers from all over the country. On average three per day.  I don't plan to buy another RAM product and gave them a chance first to deal with product short comings.  I strongly advise from my experience AVOID RAM.",1
120, on 04/27/17 17:23 PM (PDT),George Bryant ,2012 Ram 1500 Quad Cab ST 4dr Quad Cab 4WD SB (4.7L 8cyl 6A),My Ram Rocks!," I purchased my 2012 Dodge RAM 1500 in February of 2017 with 70000 miles on it. It is an ST trim level but it was optioned with the 5.7 Liter HEMI. This was not presented as an option for this review. I can only surmise that since my truck was an import from Canada at one point prior to my purchase, that perhaps the HEMI option on the ST is only available on units destined for Canada. Not sure. However, I love, love, love the HEMI! It has all the power of rabid wild tiger on steroids and cocaine, and it growls with an equivalent ferocity under hard acceleration. Even with the amazing amount of ample sound dampening material in this truck, you can still hear the roar of that V8, let me assure you. Yet despite it's raw power, under more muted driving, it is as civilized and tame as a small purring kitten. It has the civilized ride of a Cadillac too. Like I previously stated the sound dampening material must have been amply applied in this truck. On the freeway you can have a quiet conversation in a whisper, and you can hear it very clearly. Very little wind noise as well. The ride is smooth, with an amazing and uncanny ability to absorb potholes and other road bumps, in such a manner that it is barely a discernible bounce in the cabin. The materials in the cabin are plain, not a lot of glitzy finishes and the use of plastic is ample, but it doesn't bother me at all. Fuel economy is definitely a sore spot, I am averaging around 15 mile per gallon. I was hoping to get around 17 to 18 at least, but I do a lot of city driving, and the HEMI is too much fun to drive it in a more reasonable manner. If I was a little lighter on the accelerator, I am sure I could easily attain these averages. I really haven't had the chance to tow with it yet, but if my experience with the HEMI is any indication, I don't think any amount of moderate towing would be an issue. I have had a Ford in the past, and I have had a GMC as well. Neither hold a candle to the fun factor, practicality, or reliability I have experienced with this truck thus far. In fact my GMC was a money pit, I invested so much money in that truck that I do not think GM will find me as a return customer any time soon. My Ford was plain, and didn't wow or impress. Granted it was much older, but even with its age, I would have expected a little more refinement, albeit not to the extent my much newer Dodge Ram has. In short. I love this truck. I had an option of either the RAM or a Nissan Titan. Once I experienced the HEMI, the Dodge won hands down. Also, I am nostalgic. My grandfather had a really nice 1992 Dodge Ram with the Cummins Turbo Diesel. He bought it new. My father has also always been a Dodge fan. He had both a 1952 and a 1956 Dodge Truck. The latter was a custom built shop truck. I have fond memories of all of them. I love getting in my truck and even in 2012, they have that same Dodge emblem front and center on the dash. The font and format of that lettering has not changed in 60 years. I am proud to follow my father and my grandfather in purchasing a Dodge!",5

I traded a Ford for it and this was the first Dodge I ever owned. Around 95,000 miles the transmission went out and I had two broken exhaust manifold bolts. All this was covered under warranty. Then one month later, now out of warranty, some sensor in the intake manifold caused my transmission to shift poorly. This cost me $400 at my local mechanic. Then both front wheel bearing went out. Bought them at Autozone but the threads on the stud were wrong. So I had to get them at Napa, another $500. Then at 123,xxx miles I start getting an engine error code so back to my mechanic. The one of the lifters failed and destroyed the camshaft, another $3000 repair. At the same time my mechanic told me I had a warped exhaust manifold ad that I had broken the same two bolts. So I contacted Chrysler about it. They refused to do anything. Basically, as much as I like this truck, and I gave it a decent review, I would NEVER buy another product from Chrysler...period!!!

Starting with the list of items that i really like... 1.) I have the Dodge Ram Crew Cab Laramie 1500 with the black heated and cooled leather and the features available on this pickup are great. Heated and cooled seats work with no issues, living in Minnesota I will always have a heated steering wheel after this vehicle, and I will always have a upgraded sound system as the Alpine factory sound system sounds incredible. 2.) The power is fantastic for daily driving. I've driven this vehicle for about 20,000 miles now and I'm very impressed by smooth shifting along with easy passing power and towing power. The Hemi doesn't struggle to rip you back in your seat while doing it smoothly. 3.) The looks of this vehicle are great. I have the all white Laramie with 20"" chrome wheels. I get compliments consistently about the looks of the vehicle and it's almost 7 years old now! Here are a couple issues that bother me about the vehicle..... 1.) Within 2,500 miles of buying the vehicle, the hands free control module went out. What this meant for me is that I could no longer connect my phone via bluetooth for hands free calls or audio playback. I took it to the dealer to get a quote, and $100 later I was told the part cost $600 + labor to replace. Disappointing since I'm constantly on my phone. I'm sure i'll end up forking over the $1,000 dollar bill eventually to get this fixed. 2.) about 10,000 into driving the vehicle, my airbag light came on on my dash. After a little review, I read that this is a pretty serious issue since in the case of a collision, my airbags would not go off. After bringing it to the dealer, I found out the code was reset and the light is off. I'm a little uneasy whether or not the issue was actually fixed or not. 3.) Drive down a gravel road with this pickup... I can not believe the rock noise that is created during this experience. I have highway tires on my pickup and the rock noise is unacceptable. 4.) The winter MPG's is complete garbage. In my experience, I can not get better than 15 MPG combined during the winter while driving approximately 20/80 city/highway. 5.) The center console has a rattle which is easily fixed. It's still a little annoyance that could be avoided by Dodge. Overall, I  do like the pickup, power, and luxury interior of the 2012 Dodge Ram. With that being said, it won't be a bad day when I upgrade to a newer pickup...",3

I also purchased the Max Care Warranty  with unlimited mileage coverage and no time limitations from date of purchase.  I think MaxCare costs me around $3,200 for the $100 deductible option.  I drive 30-35,000 miles per year and put value in ride comfort, reliability and the assurance that my truck will start when I turn the key.  All of my services, including oil changes, are done at the dealership.  The truck drives as tight and quiet as the day I bought it with 12 miles on the odometer.  I'm surprised that the truck has not developed in squeaks or rattles.  The ride is very smooth, especially considering that I have over 140,000 miles on it.  To maintain the smooth ride I put Bridgestone Dueler Alenza Plus tires on it.   At 100,000 miles the truck developed a ticking sound.  Turned out to be manifold bolts.  Problem solved at dealer for $100 MaxCare deductible.  At 120,000 miles the roller bearings on the lifters failed and caused damage to cam shaft.  All had to be replaced.  Problem solved at dealer for $100 MaxCare deductible.  I would not be a happy Ram owner if I didn't have the MaxCare Warranty.  Would I buy another Ram?  Yes, but only with MaxCare unlimited mileage warranty.  If Ram replaced the Rotary Shifter in the current models I might consider upgrading.  I can't get past that shifter when thinking about another truck.  So, for now I will continue enjoying my 2012 Ram until such time as it leaves me stranded and/or is constantly requiring trips to the dealership.  Pro's:  Cold A/C, excellent ride on and off road, smooth steering and good sized steering wheel, Hemi V8 power and sound, Silver paint still looks good, comfortable seats for long trips, fun to get in an drive every time i go somewhere, gear shifter in center console where it belongs.  Cons:  Cost of Hemi tune up (16 spark plugs).",4

This is my company assigned truck that I travel all over the country in, designing and building RF networks. I sometimes ride in this truck for 14 hours straight and it is definitely the most comfortable truck I have ever driven. Power is good from the 5.7 and it has not had any leaks or failures. However, the transmission is starting to act ""funny"". It has a strange hesitation and jerking movement while idling up to a light or rolling through a parking lot. It has also had a few seriously hard shifts that felt like the trans was about to fall out the bottom of the truck. Still working fine otherwise and it doesn't do it all the time, but this transmission has been worked hard and has spent a lot of time pulling a trailer so it is starting to show signs of wear. My truck has the 6spd auto, the 8spd may be better/worse. Had to replace the struts about two years ago at the 90k mark, they were completely blown and the truck was bouncing around like a trampoline. Other than those issues the truck has given me no problems and I expect to keep driving it until 200k. My last work truck was a F150 and I will admit that it is built better than the Ram, it had fewer squeaks/creaks/rattles, but it didn't ride or look as good in my opinion.*Update* Passed 185k miles and finally turned the truck back in. The company is liquidating it but it still runs and drives. Engine still purred but the trans is done. My new assigned truck is a 2018 F-150.",5

I saw this blacked out optioned truck on the lot and fell in love with it.  It looks great and I get lots of compliments!  The bucket seats are far more comfortable than in the Tradesman.  Acceleration off the line isn’t as good due to the higher gearing in this specific Sport.  The new 8 speed tranny is so much better than the old 6 speed.  Very smooth shifting, very little of it trying to find the right gear.  The 6 speed in the Tradesman was always clunking around, always looking for the right gear to be in.  I didn’t like the way it shifted from the beginning and did have to take it in at 65K to have transmission work on it.  I was really nervous about the warranty running out and having to pay for a new tranny.  But I got the lifetime power train warranty on the new truck which was the primary reason for going back to the Ram.  Gas mileage has been in the 17-18 MPG range.  Although I live in a hilly area I still can't imagine getting 21 MPG.The Uconnect system can be a little distracting.  The high beams are awesome.  The truck came with a big subwoofer that sits under the passenger side rear seat and takes up 2/3rds of the rear under seat storage.With 700 miles on it I am loving it!Update: I now have 10,500 miles on the truck and still like it although the tranny isn't as smooth as in the beginning.  When coasting and getting back on the gas it has a little trouble finding the gear it wants to be in.  I am missing the extra space I had in my old extended cab compared to this Quad cab.  I still have not been able to get more than 19 mpg (only once) and generally still in the 17-18 range.  The air conditioned seats are ""ok"".  Not great.  Not worth the extra money.",4

EXF 3.0L VM Motori V-6 diesel, DMD 3.55 Rear end, DSA Anti spin rear end, WFJ 17"" wheels, AHC Trailer tow, XHC Trailer brake control, and a few other options... MSRP 46,860 / Invoice 42,670 / Net, Net, (less Holdback $1,370) $41,300... purchased for $41,900 less $2000 rebates, $39,900...( I personally feel the manufacturers have gone nuts on their pricing... their excuse is that they are competitive, bad argument on their part.)Ok,  in my 63 years of life, about 20 of those years, I sold rolling stock to Federal, State, county, and municipal political entities and large and small commercial accounts. These vehicles included Chrysler, Ford, cars and trucks, and Sterling class 4 through 8 trucks... So as writer of this review, I am no nut case... I have driven them all... As for the dealer, they came in on the weak side... little or no product knowledge, customer satisfaction rating will get hit with an average rating, maybe... but, after saving a ton of money, I acquired my new ride on the 3rd of November 2015...had the dealer not had screwed up, I might have had the truck a week or two earlier...  As of this writing Sunday 22 November 2015, the truck now has 1587 miles... My first 100 miles, at 65 mph,  she clocked in at 33.1 MPG. way better than advertised... The following weekend of 6 Nov. 2015, I logged a good 580 miles at 80 mph, a lot of low rolling hills, some flat plains,  good weather, a bit of wind, low humidity, normal temps, and she got a whopping 28.9 MPG...  the majority of this ride consisted of more road miles with probably 50 miles of urban driving,  this is way better than advertised... as for performance, if you lay that foot on the accelerator, you will be bounced into the back seat... for an itty bitty V-6, she's got some guts and power... As for the power source, the VM Motori diesel, she's not like any diesel that is out on the road... Most power sources that you find in domestically built trucks, ie, cummins, cat., detroit, powerstroke, and GM's Isuzu motor all have or have had an excessive valve knock... this was always standard issue with diesel motors... The Motori, it's so quiet, you can hear yourself think... this little power box is actually quieter than some gas engines... If you are into quiet engine operations, this is a good choice... In the cabin, you can actually hold a normal conversation with other occupants.Fuel expense, even though the price of diesel is a bit higher than gas, with this truck and power source you can expect at least a 30% improvement in miles per gallon compared to gas... My first 1500 miles, I have spent less money on diesel fuel than my old gas truck... substantially less... As for handling and ride, this truck is nothing compared to what Chrysler or Ford built back in the 80's or 90's... An option was available for an air ride suspension, I couldn't justify the added expense, or future maintenance costs 80,000 miles down the rode... but, she is smooth, little or no road noise, no road harmonics... Power steering, it's electric, no more steering juice to feed to it, no more steering gear leaks... and as for precise handling, it's up there... handles like some low profile road cars.. without the stiff rides... As high as the truck stands, you would think that in the curves the G forces would be against you, they are not...  you would think that you might have some pitch and awe to contend with when attacking curves, she stays straight and goes where you point her... little or no over or under steer...as for wind noise, Nada... none...  The Sterling Acttera, a class 6 truck had a 65 degree cut in her cornering, it could out corner any F-350 to 550 on the road... the Ram 1500, she's there, I do not need a football field to turn her around...  but, historically, Dodge trucks were always known to out maneuver Chevy's or Fords... If you are still reading this review, and you're and ole guy like myself, something of note, the back up camera, make sure you get it... the Uconnect radio system has this huge interior screen, when you turn the knob selector to reverse, that camera lights up everything behind you... I ordered the front and rear sensors, it's well worth the expense... Parallel parking is a breeze, and backing up to a trailer, is so much easier now.  I am not having to get in and out a half dozen times  to see where the trailer tongue and hitch is...  One other thing that you will need to get used to, transmission selector, it's a knob, electrically controlled, no more column shift. It seems and feels weird at first, but you'll get used to it...",5

I was comparing similar trucks (4dr crew, standard bed, big engine) with the features I wanted (big touch screen, remote start, cold weather package with heated seats and wheel). I drove a Silverado (worst one by far, terrible ride quality and cheap interior), a Tundra (nice but a terrible lease program) and an F150 (same as the Tundra; loved it, but when we got to numbers, it would've made more sense to purchase the vehicle because it was $200 cheaper per month!). I'd heard mixed things about Rams, simply because Chryslers don't have the greatest rep. Well, I think the Big Horn alone could change one's mind. It's the absolute best bang for your buck. Plenty of great features (a nice big screen, remote start, parking sensors, huge backup camera) for easily the best lease I have ever seen. I'm paying barely $400 with nothing down except my trade. For what this truck has and what it can do, that's astounding. I'm doing a 3 year lease, and I will without a doubt be returning to Ram for another one when this lease ends! The only thing that is questionable is the 8 speed transmission. The transmission itself is flawless, extremely smooth shifts and I think it helps with the ride quality. But the rotary dial throws me off a bit. Luckily, it was easy to get used to after a few months. Don't let something tiny like that get in the way of an amazing truck for the BEST price (yes, the BEST) on the market. Ram has earned the business of me and my friends for years. Amazing quality!

I am very concerned that like Volkswagen, the Fiat-Chrysler engineers may have installed cheat devises or software settings that illegally inflate the performance specs of my truck.  The outcome of the EPA/CARB investigation is not known at the time of this writing.  If through some miracle the truck is able to get a pass on this and keep the current performance, I will remain a very happy owner.  This truck is great in most every way.  I pull three different trailers regularly:  My 25' travel trailer, a 2 ton hydraulic dump trailer, and a furniture moving trailer.  The 6 cylinder diesel gets the job done with ease and the 8 speed tranny works flawlessly.  We just returned from a 3000 mile traveling camping trip pulling our 6000 pound travel trailer and averaged 16 mpg (calculated by doing the math at the pump, not by reading the electronic dash display).  My wife and I have done two long-distance trips of over 400 miles each way NOT towing and the average was 28 mpg.  Two irksome flaws:  1)  Shame on Fiat-Chrysler for going cheap by placing the electronic down/up shift buttons on the right spoke of the steering wheel.  Fingertip paddles on the back of the wheel would be so much better, especially when downshifting going down grades while towing.  2)  Why are advanced safety features such as blind spot monitoring, automatic braking and lane departure monitoring not available (they are not available on any trim level at any price!)??  When a person decides to spend nearly $60,000 on a high trim level truck, such features should be available.",4

Original sticker price was 48,475 and we ended up getting it as a Chrysler Certified vehicle for 33,000 because it was traded in for a Jeep Wrangler by the original buyer.  The original buyer felt it was too big for what he wanted after driving it for a few months.  This truck has the Bighorn Package with the safety tech and 20"" wheels, heated seats/steering wheel option and cold weather package. It also has trailer towing and a dealer installed tonneau cover and heavy duty Westin running boards.  We looked at Ford, Toyota and Chevrolet/GMC along with Ram during the winter, but were either underwhelmed, or price shocked by all of them.  During comparisons, it was obvious the Ram was superior to all the others in perceived build quality, and interior refinement for similarly equipped vehicles.  The seating comfort was noticeably better in the Ram, as was the ride, handling and quietness. You can travel on uneven roads at highway speeds yet carry on a normal conversation with people in the back seat, or hear the radio without repeating yourself, or turning up the volume to get over the road or wind noise. In fact, the truck rivals some luxury cars in quietness.  The 5.7 engine also seems to pull better and feels stronger than the others. The 8 speed transmission is silky smooth and shifts seamlessly, at times you can't even tell it is doing so.  The hemi engine is smooth and quiet, but has a noticeable ""Growl"" when you step on it.  The Ram has them all beat hands down.  I am not going to say the Ford, GM, Toyota are not good trucks, because they are. I'm saying that of all the good trucks out there, the Ram struck me as the hands down better vehicle and at a better price.",5

Everything was great up to the point when the weather started to get cold --live in OH.  All four windows started to malfunction during the cold weather. The widows keep getting frozen and when you tried to roll them down -even after warming up the vehicle they would go down after pushing the button up and down.  Finally the window did lower after pushing the button, but it just completely dropped straight down into the door frame. Took the vehicle to the dealer to fix the problem on all four windows.  The dealer indicated that in cold weather the clips holding the window snap if there's to much resistance.  So, I'm now on my third trip to the dealer to fix the windows every time the temperature gets below 32 F.  Ram needs to figure out this problem; otherwise DO Not buy this vehicle if you live in cold weather.",3

Fast forward to December, transmission begins to shift funny from 1st to 2nd gear. Took it into my dealer, they said was more than likely a software glitch, and flashing it would fix problem, called next day was told it didnt work and they were going to try to relearn it (whatever that means) Next day was told that didnt fix it either, and it needed a new transmission ( 3412 miles ) Asked for rental for second time was told to contact customer care, was told they don't provide rentals for warranty repair, back to dealer next day, after a nice argument with service dept I was again denied a rental, so took my complaint to showroom floor, and was finally put in a rental car. Now after having my truck for nearly 2 weeks, no work has even begun on my truck.

I work from home and do not put on a lot of miles.  I am tall 6,8 240LBS and needed something I could step into.  I began shopping for trucks that had great lease deals to get the 2016's off the lot.  Naturally I went to my local Chevrolet Dealer and test drove the 2016 Silverado.  The ride was extremely choppy and I felt every bump.  The acceleration was strong but not great.  Overall, I was more impressed with the 2007-2014 line up they offered which had a much better ride.  I went back to the drawing board.  Then I saw an add in the paper for a Big Horn 4X4 Crew Cab Hemi V8 for a low monthly lease payment so I went in for a test drive.  The ride was outstanding, acceleration was great and the sound through the dual exhaust was just enough growl for me.  My two kids (3 and 5 Boys) both fit comfortably in the back with room to spare.

Just took it on a 2200 mile drive through mountains, snow, rain, wind storms, and thanksgiving traffic coming back from our round trip from Orange County to Vail Colorado and back through Vegas. Had 6 hours of bumper to bumper traffic from vegas home but still pulled off a 27mpg adverage in a 4x4 crew with 4 people a cab high shell and 5-600 lbs of gear. Elevations over 8000 ft and 11-15 deg nights Didn't slow us down. I was concerned with the Uria tank/ lines freezing, but got lucky, and didn't have thaw it out with the Colman stove... lol. Also purchased this truck for under 36k. It pays to look online for 30+ days on autotrader New/ lowest price/ any distance. Shipping was 1200, but hey I saved over 15k. Only issue with the accessories was the cruse control. As most have found out the on/ off Cruse button works randomly. Spank the back of the steering wheel and it will eventually come back. Love this truck ran it at speed limit + 4mph most all the trip w/ 18 starts and stops and 4 small side trips in Vail. Only needed the 4x4 once and most of the time ran in the light snow in 4x2 as the leader in our convoy. This truck is very stable and rides like on a cloud. Ford is rough, loud and can't compete on mileage. Chevy doesn't do it for me. Still has the same issues that they haven't resolved for nearly 20 years. I.E. Burt out running lights, tailgate latch. This is cosmetic, but really solve your build quality issues.At 3000 miles,I did a minor upgrade to the truck. Trimmed a little fat off of the burn cycle and am now getting 30+ MPG AND RUNNING CLEANER. drove from the center of orange county to Mesa AZ.  Side trip and back and averaged 30.8 for the tank after running around at home for 2 more days. The fuel computer still reads accurate and truck seems to have slightly more power and torque.I know now how to get max mileage. I can get 33-35 highway at 62mph.

I decided to stick with the RAM for the ride quality, quietness, features for the money, and Hemi V8 performance.  I have about 3,000 miles on it and I'm getting 2+ more MPG on the same commuter route, (as long as drive normal).  However, i don't hesitate to pass because the acceleration is much better than my old 2009.  I haven't taken on a real highway trip wet but 2014 loaner with the same power train setup delivered 23.2 MPG on an 1,000+ miles round trip, (at 70-75mph, with AC, in Texas).

S class chains are recommended for the rear but even S class cables came down within 1/4 inch of the brake line when I tried a set of Z cables. Wake up Ram. I did get standard chains in a narrower width that don't wrap so far down the sidewalls but a simple change of the angle the brake lines leave the rear calipers would seem to solve the problem. Did the bailout put government engineers in charge at Ram. I just can't understand why real truck engineers would not design a truck to take standard style chains.Update; I still think the chain clearance issue is ridiculous. I am happy with the ride and comfort. 4WD and the anti spin diff seem to work fine. Plowed through about 18 inches of snow in the Yosemite campground not thinking about the front air dam but it survived just fine (snow was soft). Best MPG so far 21.6 by dividing gallons into miles. The computer shows about 2 mpg better than what I actually get. Most highway trips with mixed terrain I'm getting right at 20 MPG, mixed highway city gives about 17 MPG. I think on a maxi mileage test, flat road 55-60 mph it might go 23-24 mpg. The 21.6 mpg tank full was running 65-70 on hwy 395 from Death Valley (-200 feet) to Gardnerville ( 4000 ft) with Nevada gas, not the excuse for fuel we get in California.",3

I was hoping for slightly better gas mileage, but can't complain too much about it.  I got the 3.21 gears as I won't be towing much and wanted the better gas mileage that it offers.  It has decent acceleration, but if you want better acceleration go with the 3.9 gears.  It suits my needs.  As with any vehicle, the dealership navigation system is not as good as google maps, which is frustrating.  The voice recognition system sucks.  There should be an option for a passenger to input an address while driving.  As far as driving goes, it handles well.  The seats are comfortable.

While there is plenty to compliment about my truck with respect to ride quality and power , it is extremely disappointing as I have discovered poor finish in terms of exterior paint (numerous fish eyes), minor visual damage to interior trim, and poorly/losely fitted exhaust components.  I just completed my official RAM buyer customer satisfaction survey noting these concerns.  A week has passed and no response from RAM.  It's clear that spending $58,000 dollars for a luxury truck doesn't matter.  All of this said about my new 2016 RAM, none of it was a great surprise as my 2012 had some serious fit and finish issues that I had to have corrected with my dealer.  My RAM is nice and I stuck with RAM this time around as my truck was assembled in Michigan (engine built in Mexico), unlike the GM full size trucks now built in Mexico and Ford I didn't consider at all (just not a fan of the Ford product).  But again, I wish RAM would listen to its buyers on these concerns.  I spent serious money on this product and it should be delivered in a fully quality inspected state.  Based on my experience having bought two RAMs, quality assurance with respect to fit and finish is not part of the manufacturing process.  Another aspect of my new truck I find highly frustrating is with the UConnect and Pandora.  One reason I traded and seriously upgraded my truck is to have a vehicle with Pandora navigation controls on the dash.  I have invested time in going through the proper steps to setup the UConnect in the truck and on my iPhone only to informed through a call to UConnect Assist that there are unresolved issues with the UConnect system and Pandora.  As such, the Pandora app will not load on my UConnect system and to listen to Pandora I basically have to do it the old school way through my phone controls -- a dangerous disappointment!  Again RAM, I spent a serious amount of money on this product only to be disappointed.  Do something about this or refund me the cost of this useless system in my truck!  (Update as of 10/27/16 -- Since my initial submission of this review I have learned that the Pandora app will not work on the UConnect system as a technology company that supports the relationship between UConnect and Pandora backed out of their contract.  FCA dealers were made aware of this in May 2016, however I was not informed as a consumer eagerly looking forward to having this feature.  This is unfair and deceptive and I should have been informed of this prior to my agreement to purchase my truck!  In all likelihood it would have stopped the deal.  Shame on you RAM!)Other issues:1)  I join with other reviewers that have complained about the knob shifter -- I hate it!   However, it seems with electronic shifting most automakers are moving to knobs and push buttons.  I really miss my console shifter on my 2012 truck; and2)  RAM should also have an easy down tailgate and crash avoidance systems to put the Limited on par with the competition.I hope I come to terms with these issues and disappointments in light of the price tag - or I face some serious buyer's remorse.  Only time will tell how well I really like this truck overall.",2

Quiet and smooth.," We bought the 1500 Big Horn Crew Cab with the Eco Diesel ( I couldn't select the 3.0 diesel engine in the drop down menu).  Got a good deal, a little over $10k off MSRP.  Just took at 3500 mile drive and it was a pleasure.  At 75 mph we were getting 26.5 mpg, so about a 700 mile range on a tank full.  When we were doing 55 mph we were over 40 mpg.  I figure I used about 2 gallons of DEF.  The ride is so smooth and quiet.  When I ride in my 2012 Subaru Outback It feels so clunky compared to the Ram.  This is the most expensive vehicle I have ever bought, but I am enjoying it.  We added nerf bars, spray in bed liner and trifecta cover.  After having it a month we are over 4500 miles and no big issues.  We have the towing package so the side mirrors are huge. We did take a hit from someone in a parking lot, but it folded in, so only a small scuff mark.  In parking lots we now fold in the mirrors, manually, the Laramie has power mirrors.  Our only complaint is wind noise.  We think it is coming from the mirrors.  Above 50 mph it is noticeable and a little of a distraction.  I may take it into the dealer to get it documented.  Overall, highly recommended.UPDATE 3/12/18  The wind noise still is a little bothersome, but not terrible. It may be coming from the windows, but it is hard to identify.  Curious what will be going on with the ""Diesel-Gate"" Chrysler finds itself in. Seems like the same thing that VW was caught doing.  I am sure there is a settlement of some sort coming to EcoDiesel owners. I have received nothing from Chrysler, which is disappointing.  My Winter mileage has dropped down to about 24 mpg on the highway.  I am sure this is due to a combination of the cold and the fuel cut with kerosene.  Overall I still very much like the vehicle.",5

Going from the Bighorn to the Laramie is a step up in ride quality, reduced road and cabin noise. My wife commented on the smooth and quiet ride on a recent 4 hour trip. The 8 speed transmission is smooth and quiet, no jerking or lagging, it's always right there.  There is also a noticeable difference in fuel effeciency, both trucks were v8's but going from a 6 speed transmission to an 8 speed is a huge improvement in fuel economy.  The interior of the Laramie is impressive along with all the technological enhancements, this truck can respond to your every command and can keep you connected by hands free phone, text, navigation, music and on an on!

Also, missing is a front camera, capless fuel door, xenon headlights, and a soft opening/closing power tailgate that a woman can easily use. It does need more sound insulation, because the wind noise does get into the cabin. The fit and finish needs to be improved, especially with rubber seals and other exterior trim. The truck is a gas guzzler, that's no surprise, but they need to do what Ford did and go aluminium.",4

It's the nicest riding vehicle I've ever been in. It soaks up the bumps and dirt roads with ease. The 3.0 diesel is amazing. The trip home from the dealership (155 miles, mostly HWY) I managed 27.4 mpg, over the EPA estimate. Part of this due to the fantastic 8 speed transmission. It's always in the right gear and never ""hunts"". Acceleration is OK, but I didn't buy a ~6k lb  vehicle with a small diesel to drag race. I test drove a hemi and it was straight up fast, also unnecessary. The leather interior is awesome and the ventilated seats work very well. Rear storage is excellent and fold flat floors work well. I've only had 1 issue with the Uconnect system, but a reset fixed that. Pandora, Bluetooth streaming and USB ""browsing"" all work excellent. The Alpine sound system is good for me, I'm not a huge audiophile though.  Stock tires are mediocre, but most vehicles have this issue so no negative marks.15000 mile Review - Still loving the truck. Fuel mileage has dropped a bit with the colder weather and winter fuel. I've been getting 24-25mpg with routine driving but can push it closer to 26 mpg if I really try. I have been using the block heater and winter front cover too. The latter really helps the engine warm up at highway speeds when it's below 0 and windy. No reliability issues or CELs. 4wd and LSD has worked fine in the snow although, again, the tires are just mediocre. The heated seats take a bit longer than expected to get warm, not a huge deal.   I did take a ~1000 mile trip to Maine and back right after my initial review. With 3 guys, a bed packed full of gear and a 20' aluminum boat (also with gear) we got 18mpg. A very hilly trip too and I was pulling 75mph a good portion of the way.",5

I am getting about 16.5 in everyday driving but it is important to note I have the towing gears not the stock gears so that has a lot to do with it. If I had to do it all over again I would get the normal gears. It still will move if you press the gas and the intake growls that big truck will blast off and I really like the acceleration. The ride and ammeneties are great no issues. I would not hesitate to buy another Ram. One year of ownership and still going strong had two minor issues one was a check engine light that led to a fuel pressure sensor needed to be replaced. It did not have any impact on the way the truck drove just the annoying light on the dash so they fixed it and that was all covered under the warranty. The second issue I will have fixed when I take it in for service. One of the front parking sensors slid out of the bracket that holds it it. The bracket is broke so I have it taped in place it still works fine just need a new holder. No big deal to me. Otherwise still love my Ram I have towed my RV (7000 lb towable) several times without issue. It is my everyday driver and it will really move when I need it to. Gas mileage is now hovering around 17.5 so maybe that sensor had something to do with it? The biggest thing that impacts the mileage is me, love the growl and when I put my foot in it gas mileage suffers but it will move and sounds great. Love my Ram no regrets.Now a year and a half later no new issues and gas mileage is about the same. I still love my Ram and by now have towed the rv to the foothills in Georgia without issue. This baby pulls like a mule no hesitation. I would gladly buy another one so it’s obvious I am a satisfied customer.Over two years now as a daily driver and still happy with my purchase no major issues would definitely buy another Ram. Gas mileage hanging around 17+ the biggest help is putting the average mpg indicator next to the speedometer that curbs my tendency to put my foot in it.",5
221, on 07/27/16 13:00 PM (PDT),TB ,2016 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Big Horn Fleet 4dr Crew Cab 6.3 ft SB (5.7L 8cyl 8A),6 Mo Update," After owning this truck for 6 mo. I have learned even more, but my comparison is based on my 2006 Nissan Titan and previous F-150.  The comfort of this truck is excellent the cab is quiet but I think RAM could do even better.  Acceleration is also excellent in fact on dirt roads it is so good it is hard to keep traction. Fuel economy is good about 14-16 combined at 80 mph, just wish the big 3 would do better, and the warranty is ok but I think they could also do better like the new Nissan or better yet offer a warranty like Hyundai 100k and 10 years, their sales would sky rocket.  Now for the not so good.  Working with the dealership is so difficult, never had a problem working with a dealership like I do with RAM,  my front parking sensor went out and the dealer charged me to have it fixed, they said it was a natural cause not mechanical. The lights flicker at night, the dealer said they did a firmware updated but it still does it, and now the cruise control will not activate sometimes.  The fog lamps bounce at night this is because of the poor way they are mounted.  I drive on a lot if dirt roads and the dust in the cabin is ridiculous.  I later found out there is no cabin filter, how cheap.  I found a kit on-line, installed it and it helped but still a lot of dust, this truck is advertised to be the do all truck but if you live in an agriculture area which is hard not to, it will be a big issue.  In fact I may not purchase another RAM because if this issue, very hard driving down the road with a lot of dust in the cabin and kids having problems breathing.  My Nissan and F-150 never had this issue.   Looking for another truck and will have to consider all brands since this one does wow me yet.   --I am also a 2006 Nissan Titan owner and I will have to say that back in 2006 there were more luxury options than on trucks today.  here are the things I had to but for the Ram that the Titan came stock with: MUD FLAPS, SPRAYED BED LINER, ADJUSTABLE TIE-DOWNS IN THE BED, BUILT IN TOOL BOX, SLOW OPENING TAIL GATE, NERF BARS, HEAVY DUTY FLOOR MATS.  These are things trucks should come with from the factory.  On the interior the Titan also blows the Ram away with toys from 10 years ago that should still be on todays trucks.  The ride on the Ram is very nice but they put car tires on them to give a quiet and smooth ride and by the way the tires only last about 13K miles.  I do not use the bluetooth because there is no option to use my headset or speaker phone in the truck, don't understand why car manufactures are not smart enough to create this feature,  who wants speaker phone on their private calls when there are other people in the vehicle.    The Ram has great power and tows good, overall I am happy so far with it but very disappointed in the way they make it look good.  If a person never owned a truck and purchased one today they wouldn't know what they are missing, but i do.",3

I like sitting up high and i'm impressed by the outward visibility in my truck even versus my '08 Altima (which also was very good). The fuel economy is less than advertised but still ok for a full-sized truck. I will probably upgrade the intake and exhaust system after a year or so, just to see what difference it makes. The interior is impressive and the infotainment system (UConnect) is really cool, very intuitive to use. The only things I didn't get that I wanted were keyless ignition (I had that on my 8-yr old Altima) and blind spot monitors.

Tundra's come with a 4.30 rear axle, meant for towing, so it has lower fuel mileage. Looking at all other trucks, Ram, Ford, GMC, they come with a 3.21+/- or 3.55+/- rear axle, better mileage, but do offer an optional 3.9+/- ratio for towing heavy.I like the Ram, nice ride, but am hard pressed to find the 5.7L or EcoDiesel with the 3.92 ratio. So, I'm still leaning toward another Tundra, it has a nice ride, that's why we bought it in '07. All these other trucks have great specs, but it's not an apple to apple comparison. Tundra's are built to tow, and probably get the same mileage as any other truck with a similar rear axle.If you're buying a truck to tow, make sure you do the math, the dealer is going to sell you what they have, not what you need.",4

The V-6 is quiet and has a nice growl to it when the pedal is pressed to the floor. For the savings ($1200 less than the Hemi plus $1000 additional rebate) I am happy I went with the Pentastar. With the 3.55 rear end I can still tow 7000 pounds and I am getting 20-21 MPG in mostly highway driving.

The 3.55 gears with the towing package really utilize the engine power and that wonderful 8 speed transmission is smooth as butter. Fuel mileage is above what the window sticker claimed in city and highway driving. All aspects of this truck have been outstanding. The 8 inch touchscreen controls is a must have as well.

(and they are looking to get rid of the v8 engine by the way). although chevy will try and match the pricing (did my research with that too), they still dont give you the dual exhaust.  i test drove the ford f150 and the chevy silverado and the ram 1500 beats them both. fords interior is nice. chevys interior is nice. but again, the ram 1500 interior is more luxurious. besides the fact that you also get a free 1 year subscription with sirius satellite radio with dodge. chevy and ford were only 6 months. and about that horsepower.......395 hp with the ram. chevy and ford dont give you that much. the passenger seating in the back is also very comfortable with the ram, and more comfortable than the chevy. you get alot more for your money with the ram 1500. this is my second ram 1500 lease and i am very satisfied with this truck. so satisfied that i just might be it outright at the end of the lease. for the life of me, i really dont know why anyone would want any other truck.",5

Improvements in the entry area could be made for the taller person, I am 6'2"".  The height of the door could be 2 inches higher to accommodate this.  On the same token the seats could be an inch or so deeper for the same reason.  This truck drives and rides amazing.  The engine is quiet and responsive as is the steering.  I have not had the vehicle long enough for any repairs and it has not been back to the dealer in the first 6 weeks for any issues. 3/3/2017: My previous evaluation is still the same.  I have noticed a couple of issues that could be changed.  The sensors that identify your distance to a close object SHOULD have different sounds for the back or the front.  The same alert does not help if you are not sure, such as when you are backing into a parking spot (parallel park).  I would also like to see the dash instrumentation that has the stored messages could have a dual purpose.  That being that the warning lights that come on, only a couple of times, could display what the warning is about.  That would tell you if you need to park the vehicle because of a serious problem.  Fumbling through the  manual is a painstaking process.  In addition, a separate section in the manual regarding ALL of the warning lights and their meaning would be a terrific aid.  A larger fuel tank would be a great option.  When you tow the mileage drops about 10 miles to the gallon and you are stopping every 90 minutes to fuel up.  The current mileage is 31,000 miles and we are averaging 25.4 mpg.  As you can see, we like driving it and I would not trade it for anything on the road now.",5

This is my 3rd Ram truck in the past 10 years and easily my favorite of the bunch. I live in Texas and I like driving a truck. In the past I have had difficulty justifying the purchase price and the poor fuel economy because I really don't NEED a truck that often. It is useful to have a truck sometime but I don't need one on a regular basis. I do occasionally pull a trailer that is around 5000lbs but I only use it 4-5 times a year. My 2013 Ram 1500 with a Hemi pulled the trailer easily but mileage took a nosedive into the single digits. With the Italian built 3.0 liter diesel my new Ram gets 17+ mpg doing the same job. Overall without the trailer I am getting 25-26 mpg in mixed driving. This is just amazing for a 6000 pound 4 wheel drive truck. It seems that with the EcoDiesel you can have your cake and eat it too. In my case that means I can use a big heavy truck as my daily driver and still get fuel economy that is solidly in the 20s. In highway driving it is possible to aver 30-31mpg as long as you stay below 70mph.  You can probably tell that I am a fan of the V6 diesel option in the Ram. So what is the downside? Initial cost is one issue. The diesel is a premium over the gas V6 or even the Hemi V8. Maintenance cost is also higher. Oil changes happen at 8000 miles for the diesel versus 10,000 for the gas motors. If you want to DIY the oil changes you'll find that the filter runs about $50 and the sump holds 11.5 quarts of synthetic oil. You'll also need to replenish the 8 gallon DEF tank every 9-10,000 miles. The fuel filter also needs to be changed every 20,000 miles or so. So if you're considering the Ram EcoDiesel purely to save money then you might want to do the math first. It will take quite a few gallons of low sulphur diesel to offset the additional costs associated with the diesel. If you can make the equation work out in favor of the diesel I think you will enjoy the ride.  The range is usually well over 500 miles from the 26 gallon tank. It's not as punchy off the line as the hemi (I haven't driven the gas V6) but doesn't feel slow either. There is some definite turbo induced lag from a dead stop but once underway there is no trace of lag and you feel like you're riding a wave of torque. In normal driving the truck feels plenty quick. In full throttle runs it runs out of breath sooner than the hemi. If you don't do a lot of full throttle sprints the diesel will feel as quick or quicker than the V8. Part of the credit for the seamless torque from the EcoDiesel goes to the 8 speed auto transmission. Shifts are smooth and quiet. I have yet to catch it hunting for the right gear. The rotary dash mounted shifter takes some getting used to. After 3 weeks and 1300 miles I don't notice it much anymore. Compared to my 2013 Ram this frees up a lot of space on the console. The Ram 1500 has coil springs at all 4 corners and the ride benefits from this. The truck handles well given it's size. I am amazed by how large half-ton trucks have gotten these days. I think the interior of this truck is something special. I looked far and wide to find a truck with the black/cattle tan interior. It has various wood trim panels that are actually made of real wood. I know that wood trim in a truck sounds silly but I think it looks great. My truck does have heated front and rear seats along with a heated steering wheel. I have really appreciated that the last few days with the temps near freezing here in Central Texas. The front seats are ventilated but I haven't really used those as I bought the truck in December. The crew cab has a really roomy back seat though my son has complained that the seat backs are too upright for him.  The rear seat folds up and there are foldout panels underneath to give a flat load floor. There is some storage under the seats but on my truck much of that space is taken up by the subwoofer that comes with the Alpine sound system. Sound quality  is better than the base system but seems a bit harsh to me. The UConnect system with 8.4 inch screen works great. I would love to see Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integration but the Garmin based nav works well as does the bluetooth. It works nicely with my iPod touch and my son's iPhone. Messaging works well with my Galaxy Note 5. I love the Sirius TravelLink with weather (reports and radar) and traffic. Driving through Dallas the day after Christmas it warned me of tornadoes and at one point gave me a message that there was a tornado reported in my location. My son looked up and we were directly under a large funnel cloud. The ParkSense system and rear camera are a must IMO. You can probably tell that I love this truck. It was not cheap with an msrp of $56,184 and only time will tell how the EcoDiesel holds up. Go drive one and see for yourself.",5

I added a spray in bed liner, a tonneau roll cover, fender flares, and custom fit floor mats, all from third party vendors. I also had the oem electric trailer brake installed by the dealer, but haven't towed anything yet.The only critical feedback I have is relatively minor -- the AC required work prior to accepting the truck; a couple scratches on the passenger side door also had to be repaired.  These items could suggest that the dealer needs to step up their pre sale inspection process.The shift knob on the dash gives more space on the counsel which is great.  However, I find the steering wheel upshift/downshift shift control cumbersome.  For example, to down shift you push a button on the front of the steering wheel -- given the other steering wheel controls I find myself hunting for that button.  (Other vehicles put the steering wheel shift controller behind the wheel as paddles which I find much more intuitive.)I want to install a grill guard / winch system but the Sport model bumper interferes with the after market grill guards I've been looking at.  So if that's important to you, consider getting one of the other trim lines that has tow hooks on it.Overall, I'm very pleased and would buy the truck again.",4

Battery fine, Fuel pump fine, everything checked out but it would not start at times.  So I looked to see if anyone else was having issues.  It turns out it is the fuel pump relay.  A rather expensive repair.  Because I don't give up that easily I researched further and found that IF your ram has the tire pressure monitoring system and you by chance get a flat and are unable to get the flat fixed right away or end up having a tire that does not support the use of the tire pressure monitoring system you will eventually run into electrical problems for other parts of your vehicle.",5

Transmission went out at 4,000 miles. 1st trip to the dealer they said the transmission filter fell out internally. The next week I couldn't get it in drive. The next trip to the dealer they had to rebuild it. The sun roof started leaking after owning it for 2 years. Had it at the dealer multiple times and they couldn't fix it. The last time I called for an appointment they said they couldn't look at it because their rain machine was broken. I live in Tacoma Washington. Go figure it was raining that day. They aid they couldn't work on it in the rain. They have a lemon law in Washington state. Make sure to document and save paperwork for all repairs and file the docs through a lawyer. At 78,000 miles the right side exhaust manifold went out. There is a retrofit with grade eight bolts. They replaced the manifold under warranty but would not use the harder bolts-even if I paid for them. Now the other side is out. I guess it will be new exhaust manifolds every 60,000 to 80,000 miles. When it's on my nickel I will buy the better bolts and have them installed. I don't like drilling and having to extract broken studs.

I have always loved the F-150 and was planning on buying one. Dodge won me over not only with their newer design on the Ram but also with their promises of renewed quality (backed by a pretty good warranty).

Radio/Nav (Best one they offer) has been replaced 2x and still malfunctions. Window control module has been replaced, drive side mirror has been replaced, had to return it for the shop to reinstall the rubber trim correctly. Wipers come on with rain sensor without any moisture on the windscreen or in the atmosphere (4%) cannot find problem.  Alarm is set not to chirp, however when I lock it from the door lock and close the door it chirps 3x and unlocks. (nothing wrong they tell me) Truck interior venting makes a sound like a monster is yawning inside when they activate (thats the way it is they told me...HUH)  Both rear wheel well flairs had to be reinstalled by a autobody shop, coming off.  Door column trim (vinyl) had to be replaced 2x on drivers side. Its in now for fuel sensor not working and engine light on. Front left bearing or 4x4 hub seems to be grinding. Glove box latch sticks.....and the worst is after having all the repairs done I have to bring it back to repair the warranty work due to the sloppy mechanic/techns damaging items (while doing repairs) or getting grease on my leather interior and head liner.  I got my truck back for the second radio replacement and went with the service writer to reinstall bluetooth items and the freaking radio wasnt even installed all the way.  Mechanics need to loose money when they perform substandard work on clients vechiles.    This truck has been in the shop approx 5 weeks since I had it....and I thought my Ford 6.0 Diesel was a nightmare! UPDATE 1/13/17...radio still does not funtion very well, bluetooth connection on and off depending on the attitude of the truck.  Had a very lengthy conversation with DODGE rep at Dodge and explained all my issues. The rep responded approximately a week later with an e-mail suggesting I bring my truck to the dealer for the repair of stated issues......HUH didn't you hear a word I said. THEY CANT SEEM TO FIX THIS TRUCK. DO NOT purchase a Dodge. I understand from talking to outside mechanics that the only Dodge made part is the Hemi engine (which is patented) and most every other component is FIAT. No wonder!  Id stay far away form Ram trucks.UPDATE 7/13/17...all issues previously stated are still a problem. Dodge sent a email review to me and asked how my last service went. Well have to say out of Dodge warranty and on the after market one so now I pay a deductable on their problems. Did not answer as they (Dodge liked) so they contacted the Dodge dealer I bring my truck to and Im sure bent the service managers ear...they called me in a panic.....I told them the truck has been in numerious time for the same problems and you can't seem to fix them...WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY! Now sitting on my desk is another recall notice....daHHHHHHHHH. Vechicles have been around for over 100 years....get it right! I don't need the thing to tie my shoe laces, get me from A to B safely. Dont buy a DODGE!UPDATE 1/14/18....Still having the same issues, except now the electronics are slowing down...push door lock 5-8 times for it to lock. This morning after staring the truck the heated steering wheel and seat heaters didnt come on. Oh after about 2 miles they did. Radio is just switching stations after turning off truck and restarting. Radio at times just skips a beat meaning it goes out and comes back on after a second or two. Outside temp sensor, Im not sure it knows how to sense temp changes. It takes 5 miles to finally sense the outside temp. Vents still make the monster growling sound while the truck is not running and it is sitting awhile. Dodge mechanics cannot seem to duplicate.  Seems my mechanic where I bring it for a oil change knows all about the issue of venting noise. DO YOUR RESEARCH...Do not buy a Dodge....one more thing, this is not to be believed. My truck came with 20 inch chrome (plastic ) wheels and the spare Dodge put on the vechile is a 17 inch wheel. Now if your tire size is different on the spare, not so bad you dont drive too fast to the station, but a different size rim....WHAT are these people thinking. Im looking to get rid of this nightmare real soon.",3

I understand you could get those by paying for a higher trim level, but I feel all trucks should come standard with those (they are on the F150).  Aftermarket was fine though.  My biggest issue is with the fuel economy, which I expected to be not great as its a v8, but it's actually around 14mpg easy driving in the city, 16mpg on the highway. also, stock tires are horrible - if it rains (or aaagh - snows!) you're all over the road.",3

My truck is silver with dealer added leather, ""Kat Skin"" seat covers, which are great and look great as well. I get a lot of compliments and everyone thinks their factory leather. After 69,900 miles, I still love this truck. It is big, comfortable, quiet and it handles and rides great with zero rattles. It rides better than any Ford, GMC or Ridgeline I've owned. I had no intention of buying this thing, but I drove it and liked it. Honestly, I was scared to death of a Dodge/Ram/Fiat truck, and I sort of still am, but it has really been great. It may croak tomorrow, but it really runs great and has given me zero issues. At first there seemed to be slack in the rear axle or 8 speed tranny, but after a couple of software updates it went away. Sounds crazy, but it's true! Additionally, it has excellent power for a V6, (305 HP) and my overall MPG as of today is 21.6 MPG. In winter the average moves up to 22.5 MPG, I think it breaths better with colder air.  For a V6, this thing has a sweet rumble as well. On a road trip this past week of 400 plus miles and setting the cruise on 71 MPH, the overall MPG went to 23.6. I usually drive faster, but I was ahead of schedule for each bus meeting and drove slower. Around town on both expressways and streets the MPG will drop to about 19.5 MPG, but moves back up on the road. Even at 80 MPH it will average 20.5 to 21MPG.  If I'm not mistaken, it can tow 7,100 pounds and it tows very well. Really, how much power do most of us really need anyway? Sure, some need more or want more, but this Pentastar V6 is amazing. Today, I'd say I'm likely to trade for a 2019 just like this by spring. The 2019s look great and the reviews seem good as well.",5

I loved the truck for four years until this week.  Before I tell you why I don't think you should buy it, I'll tell you why I did buy it.  The styling was awesome, the power of the 5.7L Hemi was great, the fit & finish were good.  For 160K miles, the only problems I had were a wheel bearing (normal for it to wear out after about 120K miles) and a water pump, which broke after about 140K miles.  Everything else was normal maintenance.  All work was performed at the dealership.  As I approached 100K miles, I asked about servicing the transmission.  I wanted to replace the transmission fluid and clean the filters.  I was told, ""the 8-speed transmission is a sealed unit.  You cannot service the transmission.""  I was shocked, but reassured that it would be ok.  Well, it turned out to be a big, $5600 problem for me.  At 161K miles, I was told that I needed a brand new transmission.  The torque converter was malfunctioning, but you can't replace it separately.  You have to replace the entire transmission.  As you can see, I drive a lot.  For work, I'm just driving from one end of the state to the other, cruise control on.  I've towed my boat a grand total of about 50miles of the 161K.  No other towing or anything that would put undue strain on the transmission.  My last truck was a 2007 Toyota Tundra 4x4.  Lasted for 300K miles and I sold it for $11K (yes, you read that right).

It seems to be just a small vapor leak according to the code that the computer throws.  Maybe just a gas cap problem.  Other  than tires every 35000 miles, changing the oil every 5000 miles and a air filter every 12000 miles no other maintenance has been needed.  Just had to put all new brakes pads on at 72000 miles. I do mostly highway and suburban driving so I am averaging 18 mpg. Sometimes as high as 20 if I am on the interstate. From what i have read the Hemi is made in mexico and the transmission is made by BMW which is used on the larger suv and 5 and 7 series sedans. The seats are more comfortable than most pickup's I have owned except the the 2008 Toyota Tundra i had.  No other truck can match that back seat for comfort and room!Updated review Jan 2018.  The only issue has been a check engine light that a small evaporation code was showing.   Replaced gas cap and seem to solve the problem.  I had another episode with the check engine light which was caused by not resetting the engine oil life change warning.   This also caused the remote start not to work.  It would start the engine but then shut it down after a minute.  Again, I have a concern about all the electronics that interact with everything so I will probably trade it when I get close to 100,000 miles when the warrantee expires. I still feel it is the best equipped for the price. A comparable Silverado has a much higher list price and a F150 with the same options is fairly close to the Ram.. A Toyota Tundra probably has the best reputation for reliability but doesn't offer comparable options. I had a 2008 Tundra with 180,000 miles on it and the only major repair ($1000) was the air conditioner compressor and evaporator. The only other money put into it was for maintenance--- tires, 3 sets of brakes, a fan belt, filters, and oil changes.",5

It has the new diesel arrangement with the diesel exhaust fluid.  I have a '97 RAM 2500 Cummins engine that has 140,000 miles on it and runs like a top.  Never let me down.  That can not be said of the new truck.  First problem was the exhaust filter regeneration.  My kids were driving it back and forth to our house from the farm and they got a message saying ""exhaust filter regeneration required drive at highway speeds"".  They did not know that meant drop your plans for the next 30 minutes and take a drive.  Finally it went into ""Limp Mode"", which should be illegal as it limits speed to 35MPH.  My wife and I nearly got killed trying to drive it to a dealer 45 miles away for a forced regeneration.  We stopped and had it towed.  Latest problem is DEF tank gauge quit working at about 47,000 miles which also gives you a CEL.  I can still drive it but have to overflow the DEF tank to keep it filled.  Problem appears to be widespread and occurs around 45K miles.  Whole tank assembly has to be replaced at about $3,000 ($2,100 for part alone).  Bigger problem is there are no parts and no ETA for parts.  Even if I get a part I won't trust it.  New Diesel/DEF is not ready for prime time in my opinion.  I would not recommend this truck for city driving especially in heavy traffic.  If you are stuck in a massive traffic jam and it suddenly decides to regenerate it's exhaust filter you have a real problem.  No one seems to know if a new tank will solve the current problem or just kick the can down the road another 45K miles.   I understand from checking around that all of the new diesel pickups do the ""Limp"" mode thing.    There are several things that can cause that and another condition that does a countdown to truck won't start.  If you want to buy a new diesel I suggest that you read the owners manual carefully before you buy it and ponder driving to your dealer at 35MPH.  I am going to buy a gas burner.",2

I own a home and end up transporting things weekly and this Ram works great. One thing I was always baffled by were the tie downs on my Silverado - they weren't cut out of the bed liner. This Ram came with 4 tie downs (2 in the nose of the bed and 2 in the tail) which makes for moving almost any household item or piece of equipment a breeze. This truck has all the get up and go I ever needed while all the while is great on gas. Currently, I'm right at 20 mpg which is awesome compared to my 2009 Silverado which was hovering around 15/16 mpg. The 3.6L V6 is everything most truck owners need and then some, but still they feel the need to spend the extra money on the 5.7L V8. Don't get me wrong, they sound great and really get going - they can also haul and tow well - but for someone with a family, who wants a 4WD truck to help with odd jobs and for transporting bigger items, this truck is a great option. Crew Cab a must IMO. The Ram has a MASSIVE cabin which is great for when all my friends are riding with me or when my wife and the dogs all pile in.",5

It served me well enough that I went back to Ram when I purchased my 2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab 4x4 with a 5.7 Hemi and a 5'7"" bed.  The '03 had he Off Road package, the '14 has the Outdoorsman package.  I mention this because unless you have a true need to go off road, you really do not want an Outdoorsman.  It is the most stiffly sprung 1500 in the Ram line.  It also comes standard with 10 ply tires versus the normal 4 ply tires.  Together these two things make you painfully aware of every pothole in the road!  past that the truck is FANTASTIC!My truck has the 8 speed transmission with 3.91 read end (standard on the Outdoorsman) and with the 390 horse Hemi it will flat out move when you need it to move.  The surprising thing is that I am averaging 17.5 mpg and on a recent road trip from Topeka, KS to Madison, WI the truck averaged 18.5 for 1198 miles.  WOW ... in a 4x4 ... my best friends F-250 Super Duty 4x4 diesel doesn't do any better and I didn't pop $4500 for a diesel option like he did!  I am now at 27,000 miles and still love my Ram.  I change the oil, put gas in it, and goes and goes and goes, and looks good doing it.  Would I recommend a Ram to a friend or family member, after eleven years and several hundred thousand miles ... Absolutely I would!Update March 2016:  next month I will have owned my Ram for two years and I am now at 35,000 miles.  After going through my second winter my overall mileage has dropped from 17.5 to 16.8 ... early morning warm-ups I guess.  Last fall I added a topper and a full BedRug turning the back of the pickup into he biggest trunk I've ever seen!  Do I still love the truck?  That would be a yes and no.  I still love the truck, but it was way overkill for me.  The Outdoorsman is the most off road ready pickup in the 1500 line.  As such it is more stiffly sprung and comes standard with 10 ply tires.  If you hunt, fish, need to go off road to get to that special spot, this is your truck.  If like me you spend 95% of your time on streets and highways you would be better served with a Big Horn or Sport model.",4

I pulled over and popped the hood and found a rad hose not attached to engine.

The truck looks great, and interior is nice. That’s about all I have good to say about it. Now for the bad parts. I preformed all the required maintenance at the intervals the truck required and can’t keep it on the road. At around 50k miles the engine started tapping. I took it in and found out the cam shaft was ruined and lifters were ground off. After 2 months of the dealer having it I get it back (with the gas light on) and the following week the transmission locks into 4th gear. I take it back and after 5 weeks get it back everything seems fine. 3 months later the engine tapping cane back along with transmission issues. This happened a total of 5 times for the engine. THE SAME EXACT PARTS CONTINUING TO FAIL! During this time I contacted Chrysler to see if we can find out what is causing this to happen on both the transmission and the lifters grinding down, I was told that “engineers would look at it and figure it out.” After I get the truck back I had no response from Chrysler. I called and emailed and received no response. So basically I’m stuck with a truck that constantly needs rebuilding of the drivetrain. With Zero help from anyone. In the last 2 years I’ve owned he truck, the dealer has had it a  total of 10 months. Half the time I didn’t receive a loaner like the warranty said I should. This is by far the worst experience I’ve had with a vehicle that is supposed to be “ram tough” this is the last dodge I will ever own and warn everyone I can to stay away from this company and their products. 5 engine rebuilds and 5 transmission rebuilds in less than 100k miles is absolutely ridiculous. Buy a ford or Chevy",1

Personal use only.  Trailering the boat.  Hunting.  Hauling stuff from the lumber yard.  Whatever.  Having owned just about every brand except for Nissan I can attest to one undeniable fact of life at this point in time.  My Ram 1500 4x4 Laramie Longhorn Crew Cab is the best Truck I have ever owned on so many levels.  I test drove every truck available in August of 2013 and my first impression always decided for me.  If the Driver's seat was unacceptable my lower back would start hurting almost immediately.  This is the ONLY Ram Truck that had proper lumbar support and comfort along with cooled and heated front seats that allowed me to drive longer than 5 minutes.  State of the Art Tech Package and I like the Ram Side Storage Bins a lot.  The 5.5' Bed is to short on several levels but they did not have any with the 6.5' Bed so...Mine had the Spray In Bed-liner.  However, with rain the bed does not drain so find an incline, point the nose uphill and drain the bed.  The Fuel Economy is exactly as labeled.  13 City and 17 Hwy.  However, If you can tolerate 60mph the 5.7 Hemi with Console Shift 6 speed AT will yield 20mpg all day long in NW Florida.  520Watt Alpine Stereo rocks the Cockpit with Pandora Radio from my iPhone via Bluetooth.  The U Connect Nav System is not perfect but fairly accurate given where I live and travel.  The female living in the Black Box (Ethel) is about the most cooperative woman I have ever asked to call someone.  Seriously friendly Bluetooth System with the Ram.  Had 4 Factory Recalls in 3 years of Lease and then bought out the Truck at the end of the lease with only 21,000 miles on the clock for $29,500.  KBB Excellent Condition Retail in August of 2016 was $40K.  Mine was $55,000 new and $44,000 after Rebates and Discounts.  Exact OEM Replacement in 2017 runs about $60K.  However, IF you drive more than I do I would seriously consider the 3.0 Italian Turbo Diesel.  A friend of mine has one in his 2014 Longhorn and claims  30mpg everywhere with the mandatory 8 speed AT.  No other maintenance issues per se since new.  Annual Oil Changes and Rotate the Tires every 10,000 miles.  My OEM H7/94R Battery will get replaced at about the 4 year mark.  Wiper Blades every year.  Remove the Antenna and tuck in the mirrors for monthly car washes.  I crawled under the truck the other day to just have a look and no rust per se anywhere.  But seriously, a $4,000 Depreciation over 3 years and 21K Miles in an American Made Half Ton 4x4?  Never would have guessed that in a million years.  These Trucks have won multiple awards for reliability and longest lasting but that matters little to me if my lower back isn't comfortable for any distance I need to travel.  I sincerely hope this will be the last truck I ever own in my lifetime.  And, IF I never, ever, ever have to deal with Chrysler Capital again I will die with a smile on my face.  JP",5

358, on 02/09/16 16:36 PM (PST),napiert@hotmail.com ,2013 Ram 1500 Crew Cab Laramie 4dr Crew Cab 5.6 ft SB (5.7L 8cyl 8A),Worth the wait!," I did a very extensive review of Ford, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Ram, Chevy, and Cadillac when I was going to choose my retirement truck.  All of these trucks are great and you can't go wrong honestly with any of these amazing vehicles. For me, I'm a father of two (Boy 12, Daughter 10) and a husband. I worked for the military for 20 years and have always wanted a loaded truck for retirement with money not being an object...I still want a good deal though. I didn't need a 4X4 because I never needed it on my Ridgeline so I opted for the two wheel drive and comfort over off road duties.    So the Good: This 2013 Laramie is a looker! It just looks amazing with it's aggressive stance and chrome grill and trim. The quality is excellent both inside and out.  The leather seats are soft and VENTED and HEATED!!!! the stitching on the dash and seats just set it off. The interior is not a clone interior like the Mustang and the F-150 share just about identical interiors. POWER EVERYTHING! High tech LCD, customizable cluster with analog display as well that are integrated to the central display console in the dash.  The blue tooth works like a champ and it very easy and intuitive to use. Navigation is good, but it'll never replace your phone.  Plenty of charging docks and USB's for all your power needs and if you need it, you can make your truck a WI-FI hub. The sound system is amazing with clarity, volume, and bass! The ride is like floating and it is very easy to maneuver this beast, especially with the built in back up camera with guiding backup assist that is responsive to your steering inputs! Very cool. PLENTY of power! We towed a camper behind us with zero problems, it was like it wasn't even there. Exhaust sounds deep and strong and the acceleration gets you up to highway speeds and out of trouble FAST!!! The kids are comfortable in the back with plenty of leg room, and when the kids aren't there and you're grabbing groceries, the seats flip up with mini LEDs that light your rear cab located under the seats. Lots of hidden compartments in the front and the back to squirrel away bungie cords, first aid kits, tie down straps, jumper cables etc...  I get compliments from people all the time on this truck, she's a looker, has a great personality, strong, smart, and gets along with the family, all for a decent price! Seriously, the price/value is what won the Ram my 40 large for a used 2013 with 12,000 on it. With all the accessories and options, as well as the leather, 5.7 liter, AND a HUGE cab, the competition STILL wanted almost 50 Gs for a 2013 used model. Easily gets 18/20 MPG on the highway. Did I not mention that it looks amazing?!  The Bad: The original tires that came from the dealer are garbage and wore VERY fast. I've already had to have the central LCD screen/computer completely replaced (I bought the extended warranty plan) and had to have a hose replaced to put out the check engine light. The cover for my tail hitch bolt cracked and came off making it look ugly (Petty, I know but the cover failed and cracked then fell off). The Fan for the A/C started to make a very LOUD noise while in use and that was replaced (under warranty). In the city it gets 14 MPG (It's a truck, I know, but these are real world stats here). It has a back up camera, but it really needs front sensors too...the hood is so high that I often misjudge how far away I am and have to check and re-park closer.  Overall: As you can see, the good vastly outweighs the negative.  Ram nailed it and I see RAM trucks everywhere now. For me, the amount of Truck and FEATURES were the most important to me, given the price. Ram's value in the end won it my hard earned cash, I LOVE, that truck!",5

Mileage isn't quite as good since my kids have been driving it as I am sure they are opening up the Hemi.  But, towing my 6000 pound trailer has been awesome. My Ford E350 with the V10 would actually drop down to about 52 mph on a long hill and nearly overheat.  With the Ram I can accelerate up that same hill and hit 70!  Plus I get between 7.5 and 8 mpg vs. the 6.5 to 7 mpg I used to get with the Ford.  Truck still runs like a watch and hasn't needed anything but standard maintenance.  Plus it is worth way more than I owe on it.  Yippee.  I still highly recommend it.11/28/2016 - Still loving the truck.  Did have to replace the tires at 35,000 miles, but wouldn't change a thing.  The van has still been problem free!  Still highly recommended.05/28/2018 - 5 years and 54,000 miles with the truck and still loving it.  It has not been problem free, but it has not been a problem either.  Had to get both exhaust manifolds fixed as the bolts broke on both due to an expansion / contraction rate issue between the steel manifold and the aluminum engine block.  Both were covered under the 60,000 mile powertrain warranty.   Also, replaced the brakes around 50,000. Mileage isn't as great as it used to be either (I.e. 16-17) but overall, still love the truck and can't imagine parting with it.",5

Bolts were falling out of the car, water came in through the doors, the electrical system, and the guys at the ram service centers all take a deep breath every time another ProMaster pulls on to the lot for repairs. There has never been a vehicle that has been put together and designed so poorly with absolutely no consideration to the American consumers or people that might have been faithful and loyal to the Ram brand.

Dealer put it wrong so bed went up sideways. We had an antifreeze leak.  dealer said it was a Sherrod pump. Hard to get pump since they changed models. FINALLY got the correct pump installed by dealer. More on that later.  Now the brakes started to squeal. Dealer said ""most do that"" Not a good answer. SO I took the brakes apart my self. There is NO anti squeak lube between the brake pads and the caliper. Fixed that myself front only. NO squeal. NOW the latest, the car will not start sometimes. The key goes into start position but the starter motor will not engage, at times the key cannot be removed. Dealer said they have to order a new key assembly . The old one is about to fall out.  Now back to antifreeze pump, started to smell antifreeze again. When pump was changed hoses were crimped and hose clamps were loose on pump and leaked. I fixed that put in a new hose with insulation.  Still have trouble starting  the car....... DON'T BUY  DON'T BUY... I'm putting  L-E-M-O-N on the windows with the dealerships name .

Cargo weight was roughly equivalent to 8 people. It has made a difference in pulling but the engine handled it pretty well with RPM ranging from 2.5 and up to 3.8 on higher angle slopes. Overall trip read a surprisingly 18.8 MPG with an average speed of 66 MPH. It feels heavy and stable on the road like a mini truck. Overall pretty satisfied with the handling and cargo area. Cons: steering wheel has a slight uncomfortable angle and could have been made with more adjustable options. Some of the controls could have been closer to the driver. Interior and exterior plastic cover looks cheap and I am worried it would fall apart as soon as the warranty is past due. The body of the vehicle also makes an impression of paper thin. Driving the vehicle on a manual mode do actually make a significant difference in RPM and has a potential to save money on gas.As for accessories I decided to purchase a motorcycle garage rubber mat and cut it to size for bedding. It works great, cheap, and protects the floor from scratches. Planning to cover the walls also at some point to avoid scratching the interior paint.",4

I fell in love with it for what I do.  I own a fleet of expedite vehicles and they pile the miles on in a hurry. You can see that I scored it fairly high in most areas but had to give it a 1.  Mainly because it should score a -8 on value and maint. costs.  front brakes on a 2015 with 55k miles.  Dealer told me it is $1000.00 bucks for rotors, ""special order"" retainer clips and brake pads.  $1000 for front brake job?   I have a 2016 with 100k on it and 2015 with 55k.  The 2016 will need a complete top end rebuild, it is a gas engine and sounds like a diesel.  I use full synthetic every 7500 miles.  Headlight replacement very prematurely, several times.  Automatic engine brake engages automatically on very slight decline causing an already under reliable engine to rev up to the point of failure.  If you have a plumbing business or you are an electrician and need a van for 15k miles a year, and have a back up vehicle for shop times, this would be a great van.  If you truly need a commercial grade vehicle and depend on it for your livelihood, this is definitely not it.  Body parts are nearly impossible to find as it is assembled in Turkey or somewhere over there.  Don't take my word for it, call a body shop and ask about repairing a Promaster van.  I also have 2 Chevy cutaway vans and they both have over 130k miles and run like a top!  (2) Ford Transit Vans.  They are not setting any records but still light years ahead of where the Promaster is.  Lastly, what does Ram do to help new customers with their quality problems you might ask?  They lower the warranty from 2015 100k miles powertrain warranty to 2016 60k miles powertrain warranty.

I purchased a 2014 ProMaster, and added another last year. Just purchased our third one, a 2017. Very happy so far. Yes the driving position is unusual compared to  a car, but having grown up on VW Buses, I like it. The power door locks are a bit goofy, but otherwise the van is sensible and well thought out. Compared to the Sprinter that we also own, this van feels light, but more responsive. It makes our Ford E series feel like the dinosaur it is. I like the low load floor the FWD offers , and it has been OK in the snow-no better or worse than our front engine/rear drive vans. The dealer has been great to us for both sales and service, although I do drive about 15 miles for it. Our much closer local dealer was very rude both when I went to look at the ProMaster for purchase and when we brought the Sprinter in for service (they were a Sprinter dealer at one time). It is not a Mercedes S class in terms of refinement, but it is a work van and as a work van this has proven to be a functional, reliable tool.

Around town I get 16 at best (17 indicated on computer is optimistic). Highway the best I get is 15. I have the Pentastar 6-banger in my Pro-master. Other than the poor fuel economy my only other complaint is the suspension. Simply put it can't handle any bumps. On a rough road you'll want to pull over and check your fillings. When fully loaded it is a little better. Combine the suspension with a windy day and you'll want to stay off the interstate unless you want to be driving a box-kite down the road. The brakes work very well but there is so much front end dive due to suspension that you need to be careful. The front brakes also squeal like hell due to brake pad dust getting on the rotors. Other owners complain as well. All else is good. Excellent technology package, tall seat, spacious windshield. nice backup camera and the cargo area is huge. I sprayed in rhinoliner and insulated the walls/roof. A bulkhead is also a good idea. I'll likely keep the van even with the fuel economy and handling. It's an excellent delivery vehicle, but as an interstate vehicle you won't end up passing many gas stations. Summary Plusses - View of the road and high seating position, low deck height means easy to load things. Side door is awesome. Back doors swing open and completely out of the way. I mounted roof racks as well for ladders, etc. The truck is set up for racks that mount to tabs meaning no need to drill into roof.  Minuses - Fuel Economy/range, suspension, brake squeal, and it's the ugliest vehicle from the rear.",3

The low floor height is helpful loading my dirt bike, or anything else. For the extra $10-15 grand for a Sprinter, it just doesn't make sense to me.

It has multiple recalls, engine makes noise, the brakes make noise, and the reversing camera is bad. The main issue is that the dealers do not put any energy to fix it, It has been into several different dealers and they just let it sit there (we will get to it when we can,, we are busy) Well I have work to do also.  If you need your truck on the road, don't get the pro-master.  We have four of them, and switched back to Chevy.    Many months latter, still the worst vehicle I ever drove.3/2017 a definite do not buy.  Still no Promaster mechanic has been able to fix the recalls on the back doors. (not sure why) It only gets about 12.4 miles to the gallon once it is loaded up with inventory.  The truck seems to burn out lights about every 2000 miles. I am constantly replacing some sort of an exterior light.  These are common issues on all four of our vans of the Promaster line.  Oh yea,, my reversing camera is still broke.  They can not figure it out.  Once it is filled with inventory, this truck will get stuck in an eighth inch of snow.  No one stands behind this product and its a poorly constructed bucket of junk.   9/2017 I noticed another review saying that they got good gas mileage. The only way that the four we have would get o.k. mileage is if they are empty, Why would you need a van if you were going to drive it empty?  Still not happy, still a lot of issues that did not get fixed.",1

We are an experienced and established logistic company with a fleet of 160 cargo vans contracted with several companies. In the past, we have used several cargo brands such as Ford, Chevy, and Nissan. Recently, our leasing agent has switched us to the 2018 Dodge ProMaster Ram. Immediately from the first month of service, we have encountered countless problems that we have never experience before when using other make and models. The two main issues are mechanical and vehicle structure within less than 700 miles. The mechanical issues we have dealt with are the following, Serpentine belt, controls several important part of the vehicle such as AC, alternator, and power steering. The serpentine belt comes off which is not normal, and we are unable to prevent this issues.Transmission, the vehicle does not shift properly or not at all and the gears disconnect leading to rolling of the van which has lead to an accident in our fleet which has totaled another vehicle. The shifter in the vans are loose and/or becoming loose. Within the first 3000 miles, the front tires bald without reason which is abnormal as well. The structure issue is the door handle hinges. The door handle hinges mounted to the frame are weak and snap out regularly making it unable to open and the hinges actually break off the van. In January and February 2018, we made a formal complaint to Dodge through out leasing company. We had two visits from two different Dodge personnel and discussed the issues state above. During the visits, the Dodge personnel admitted to being aware of the hinge issues. Dodge personnel offered to only assist us to the mechanical issues, transmission and serpentine belt. However, they have not fixed the vehicles thoroughly, and are continuously being serviced. Within Dodge service, we are not reimbursement or given an incentive for the down time these vehicles are being serviced. The front tires and structural issues are still being overlooked. This announcement is to bring attention to all consumers to not invest in 2018 Dodge ProMaster Ram. Your money and safety are at risk. .....",1

Run away, Run away, Run away."," I am a fleet owner and purchased several of these because they are very functional with a great overall design and platform.  They safely handle a lot of weight and have superior freight space.  They are actually kind of fun to drive because you are setting way up high like an old flat nosed tractor.  They are front wheel drive and do pretty good in the snow and ice and gas mileage is far superior to the others.  So it sounds great right?, so why the poor review?  What a piece of JUNK!  Headlight bulbs are about every 6 weeks, headlight capsules melting right onto the bulbs at the tune of a $1000 per occurrence.  The factory built in Jake brake is so overly sensitive that even empty on the slightest of down grades it is downshifting abruptly and the rpms shoot up to 4500.  There is coolant loss that apparently is impossible to detect?  Lifter knock will form around 85,000 miles faithfully.  I have had so many problem with these I know the Ram customer care rep by name and memorized her extension.  I put 200k bumper to bumper warranties on them at the tune of $5,000 each, which is great but between actually trying to get them in for service within 3 to 4 days, waiting for parts for days and crazy expensive repairs it is a constant nightmare and almost not even worth it.  Then once they are repaired they try to get out of warranty by saying it is maintenance or normal wear and tear.  In general Ram dealers are the pits for service work, usually only having 1 or maybe 2 techs who are even ""certified"" to work on the Promaster.    The worst is Ram knows these problems exist and take no responsibility or have figured out any fixes for it.  I have a dealer service bulletin I ""acquired"" outlining the problem but they refuse to recall it.  The 2018 engineering marvel to remedy the problem..... they eliminated the daytime running lights and put the old headlight manual on and off switch.  Ram customer care will help pay for the premature repairs a couple times but after one or two you are on your own.  I am not brand loyal, and had no preconceived brand bias one way or the other.  It is on very seldom occasion that I leave reviews on any products, but the Promaster is deeply flawed when it comes to durability.  I have a few Ford Transits, the cargo space in narrower, they are rear wheel drive and about 2-3 miles per gallon less but very reliable.  The 2016 Transit that has 305,000 miles on it has had less cost in repairs then the 2017 Promaster with 45,000 miles.   Chevy Cutaways are bulky with poor gas mpg but cheap, quick and easy to fix.  The Chevy Cutaways typically need transmissions at about 150k miles, but they are readily available and takes about 5 hours at the dealership (GM crate one installed for about $3200 - $3700) I will not be buying another Promaster and I hope this review helps any business owner out there make a better choice for your business needs.",2

Each dealer has one guy that works on these, maybe two if it is a big dealer.  Radiator hose is a 3 day wait.  This is a business killer if you have to depend on the vehicle to make money.  They eat headlights like crazy, Ram knows there is a problem but does nothing.  2018 big fix was to no longer have daytime running lights and put manual light switch back in.

After reading past reviews, maybe commercial use is too tough for them.  Also, if your an employee and don't own it, you drive it like a knocklehead.  I use mine for RV and Motorcycle recreational.   1. The tire sensor problem is not known by most people, but when you rotate the fronts to the rear you must decrease the new fronts pressure and increase the rears pressure or the Sensor light will stay on.  The rears need more pressure because of sensor receivers for the rear and front location are different because of cargo requirements.  2. The side sliding door handle needs a redesign.  If you pull handle in an angle to open instead of pulling straight out before trying sliding it back you will brake plastic lock.  Drivers door hinges and headlight failures are related to vibration from the front end.  The struts are cheapest Fiat could fine.  Don't slam the doors like the old Chevy's and Ford vans.  That will break the window operators especially if you door storage if full.  Radio issues and backup camera.  Just have dealership change the radio out, Its not repairable.  Brakes are pain, yes! But Ram owners have know Ram pickups have always had brake wear issues.  You want brakes go get a Ford Van. No issues with DEF system yet. So far so good.  I would buy another one is I needed.

I needed a van/truck for my event lighting business. I needed something I could park on the street in front of my house. I am 5' 11"" so I wanted something I could stand-up in.  There didn't seem to be a whole lot of choices in the class of vehicle I needed. It was between the Nissan NV, Ford Transit 2500 or the Ram 2500. I didn't like the look of the Nissan NV. Looks too much like an ambulance. I went to a local Ford Dealer and the first Transit 2500  I looked at had a recall notice on it so it couldn't be sold. The dealer didn't have a basic Transit 2500 on the lot but the sales guy called me the next day and said he found one not too far away. In the meantime, I started reading reviews and looking closer at the Transit and there were just too many things like having the parking break in the middle between the two seats and countless breakdown issues that I just did not want any part of. I decided to head down to our local Dodge dealer and look at the Promaster 2500 HIgh Roof. They had one on the lot. I took it for a test drive and really liked it. I got in easy, backup camera and sensors were great. Got it with power mirrors that fold in. Apparently, the dealers order only a few configurations of the van so if you want to build one yourself, they said it would take about 4 months to get. I took advantage of the rebates and got it out the door for around $34,000. It had about $1500 worth of upgrades. I didn't need navigation, floor mats and a bunch of extra stuff. The LED lights would have been nice but I am going to get that aftermarket anyway. The only ridiculous thing I found so far is that the passenger seat doesn't have an armrest. Reall happy with the purchase. I have only had it 4 days now so the good thing is that nothing has fallen off the van yet that I know of!

This is a big vehicle and the diesel has been getting between 25-28 mpg for personal use, lightly loaded (very little city driving.) The first gear is very high but I quickly adjusted.

426, on 08/12/17 07:27 AM (PDT),PROMASTER OWNER ,"2016 Ram Promaster Cargo Van Van 1500 Low Roof 3dr Van w/136"" Wheelbase (3.6L 6cyl 6A)",FROM A GUY THAT OWNS TWO 2016 RAM PROMASTERS 1500," I own two pro masters of the same year and the same model, and I want to provide an honest review separated by sections so that you can make the best decision possible when purchasing this vehicle. DO I RECOMMEND THIS VEHICLE: No, I don't. I would suggest you purchase a more reliable van by Ford. The vehicles have been great regarding the space they provide, and I like the seating, but the reason I suggest you stay away from this vehicle is that there is just way too many issues with them. I read some reviews by some disgruntled people and I typically think they're just upset, but it doesn't happen to everyone. Well, I own two, and the problems between both of them have been tremendous, and all before the vehicle reached 30,000 miles. Van 1: Before 20,000 miles first the bolts in the door were loose and began falling out. PROBLEM #1: I noticed something with the door, and it was bent because of the bolts missing and securing the door. PROBLEM #2: While driving the vehicle just died. Towed it to the dealership and entire oil system needed to be replaced because it was malfunctioning. Warranty covered it. PROBLEM #3: The driver side window stopped working and had to get that fixed. PROBLEM #4: The sensor for low tire pressure is always on indicating low pressure when it's fine, had to get that replaced. PROBLEM #5: Back door wouldn't open, the cables had to be readjusted on the door. PROBLEM #6: The air conditioner now produces a low-level hum that is always present. I haven't had this fixed yet but will update when I have it addressed. PROBLEM #7: The headlight bulbs burn out fast. I've had to replace them about five times already; this isn't normal. CONCLUSION: All these issues had taken place before 30,000 and were all covered by warranty. I will say that calling Promaster has been great as they took care of all the issues for me and they do a great job at that. Even if you take it to the dealership, always notify Promaster so they can follow up with everything. VAN 2 PROBLEMS: I purchased this with 20,000 miles, and all of these issues happened before 40,000.  PROBLEM #1: Headlight keeps going on on the left, I replace it twice a month at this point. PROBLEM #2: When turning on the van the air conditioner doesn't work, and I have to restart the vehicle once or twice for it to reset and turn on. PROBLEM #3: The sliding door is stuck shut and won't open. I have to take it in because the handle won't work or anything else. PROBLEM #4: The vehicle is starting to loose power when driving and I'm taking it to warranty again next week for this issue. PROBLEM #5: The tire pressure sensor keeps tripping when the tires are filled just fine. No one should purchase a new vehicle or one with 20,000 miles and have this many issues; it's ridiculous​.",1

Mileage depends highly on speed and wind direction with this beast.  Can be anywhere from 15 to 22 in strong winds at highway speeds.  Never under 15, even going directly into 20 mph headwind in plains. FWD is GREAT for winter driving, and allows vehicle to have lower deck.  Vehicle bounces around empty.

The rear door latch was broken when we bought the van. It was repaired five times by the dealer. We started driving the van more in 2017 and hit some major problems: van started going into limp mode at around 15k miles. The check engine light went on, van wouldn't go over 40 mph, and engine would rev to 1500 RPMs. The dealer said they might have to charge us to diagnose problem. My husband did a quick internet search, saw this is a common problem with Promaster vans. Shut down car and restart once, this takes it out of limp mode. Restart it a second time and the check engine light went off. We hoped this was a one time thing, but it kept happening. The Service Department at the dealer is worthless. They pretend that we are the only Promaster owners having problems, treat us like we are unreasonable for being upset that our van is so unreliable. For each repair they keep the van for a minimum of 2-3 weeks. We have to call frequently to get status updates. For limp mode, the dealer replaced the throttle position sensor, but this did not work. When we took it back a second time, they replaced the main computer/PCM. When we picked up the van after this repair, some of the lights (seat belt, battery) stayed on on the dashboard. The dealer thinks this is the instrument cluster. They want to charge us for this. At around 16k miles we heard a loud sound in the engine. The dealer said they might have to charge us to diagnose and repair this, but it was a broken fly wheel, covered under the 5 year powertrain warranty. The service advisor told us not to take this on long trips, but to ""stay local"". So we have a $30k van with 16k miles on it that we can't use. When we picked it up after the fly wheel repair, it started making a different engine noise. We dropped the van off again at the dealer to replace the instrument cluster and diagnose this new noise. After 2 weeks they hadn't even attempted to diagnose the noise, just called us and told us the van was ready to pick up. We refused to take possession of it until they determined what the noise was. The service advisor yelled at us, said, ""You'll never be happy"", and ""What am I supposed to do, it's not pulling any codes"". We finally got the service manager to agree to diagnose the new noise - it is a broken idler pulley (which they'll charge us for). Or is it? The dealer really doesn't seem to know what to do with these vans, just keeps replacing parts hoping that something will work. So now we are out of our 3 year warranty, and we're too late for our state lemon law. I have contacted a lemon law firm that thinks we may have a case. There is the federal lemon law, breach of warranty, and basic consumer safety laws that may cover us. If we had just driven the van more when we first got it, we would have had a very clean cut case with the lemon law and not had to go through an attorney. We have also called Fiat Chrysler, but all they do is recommend arbitration. It's non-binding to the consumer, but if you agree to terms from arbitration, you have to sign away your right to a future class action suit against FCA, and no way would I do that. These Promasters are a nightmare and there may very well be some sort of class action litigation in the future.",1

Ram doesn't seem to care about this. Servicing the engine is horrible. location of the fluid fills are horrible. Same for oil filter location. The trans leaks, but there is no dip stick to check level! Front clanking bump sounds developed after about 10k miles. Trans periodically slips and changes gears for no reason.

It gets 19 to 20 mpg on trips, which is exceptional for an RV - twice what our last small class B RV got.  It is comfortable to ride in and provides great views out the large windshield.  It is highly maneuverable (drives like a car) and parks in normal car spaces.  It does well in the snow (we are in MT, so lots of snow) and it does back roads well.  The only significant mechanical problem has been squeaky brakes, which the dealer finally fixed at no cost.  There have been some minor recalls that the dealer took care of with no problems.

I don't use it commercially, it was just a better replacement for my full size pickup. It's basically used as a REAL sport utility vehicle for my dirt bikes, kayak, snowboarding, camping and hauling things once in a while. I'm 5'8"" and find the seating position very comfy, longest drive I've done in one day was 550 miles. I love the cavernous interior, it was the widest and tallest of all the low roof contemporary euro style vans, with the lowest step up height.  It's performed well in snow due to the front wheel drive (which was a selling point for me, I only wish there was a 4WD version).  So far the only problem  I had was front parking lights contacts corroding, but it was fixed during a recall, it had a bunch of other various recalls that were fixed at the same time (so I hope). The other HUGE gripe I have was when filling up with gas I have to hold the trigger the whole time because the gas trigger lock unlocks probably due to the gas filler hose angle (?), but it only happens in California with the vapor recovery boot.  Ive averged 20mpg, which was alot better than my pickup.  Time will tell if I get any of the problems mentioned in the other review, but my experience have been positive so far.  I do all of my maintenance on all of my vehicles because I'm a mechanic by trade  and don't trust dealerships. I think if you read into specific vehicle forums, you'll get a better perspective of how owners think of their vehicles, because many people that give reviews on automotive sites are just the mad ones with that have had problems.",4

Annoying chrome handle on center console glares sunlight in eyes while driving.  What's practical?  Not much to me for either driver or passenger use.  Turning steering wheel sometimes turns stations, volume or dash settings from one thing to another by rubbing up against hands, fingers or legs.  Self dimming rear view mirror too impractical especially with rear tinted windows. - Throws off perspective for me.  Climate control blower sounds like jet engine - but blows poorly.  Cruise control ""on"" function blanks out digital speed indicator when first turned on is nerve wracking when setting speed.  ECO mode is about worthless.  Rarely works.  Had checked.  Response?  ""It's okay, you must have lead foot."" - Um, it's posted 55 mph off my driveway.  Only time ECO comes on is downhill or coming to a halt.  Worthless for highway cruising.  4x4 with factory supplied HT's, (Highway Tires) makes little to no sense for most off road applications. Or, even driving in sand or snow in 4 low.   Changed mfg HT tires at 3000 miles to AT's.  Better.  Help/support/loyalty?  Dealers within 100 miles around here are mostly useless for anything.  Tire pressure is around 60 psi front 80 psi rear TPMS setting is too high for normal unloaded driving and is supposedly adjustable by dealer - by ones who know what they are doing.   None here do.  Changed oil when asked to adjust tire pressure.  Check everything else but headlight alignment when stating poor nighttime visibility.  At another dealer?  Had truck for most of day and didn't do anything when high beams wouldn't come on. The closest dealer?  Blew up an engine by putting wrong oil filter on someone else's vehicle among other things.  Trust them?  Not today or tomorrow.  As of right now the vehicle is worth around $39,000 - from $52,000!  Depreciated that much already and can't even use it for normal intended purposes as general purpose P/U?  Am keeping ""it"" for now to remind myself not to buy another over priced off scale impractical  luxury car masquerading as a truck until the time is right to buy a real and more practical vehicle - to use as a general purpose pickup truck.  Also, according to all I've read, you cannot now put a snow plow on half ton trucks, just 2500's and up.  Even then, the 1500's or half tons are as gargantuan as the 2500's.  Sometimes a person can't win for losing?   Guess I'm out of luck finding a real truck until the newest soccer mom truck fad dies off?  Until then, it's sitting until something more practical comes along or it lays an egg.  Just like Ram did?  Ticked off?  Fill in the blanks?  Finally and very thankfully got rid of it to someone else who could hopefully use it - or didn't know better?",2

Overall rating is excellent. this is my 5th Ram having purchased my first, a 1500 in 2006. I have owned (3) 1500's, (1) 3500 and now the 2500. I balanced the cost of the diesel against the cost of the hemi, and found the latter to be the better deal. I pull my 38' 10k RV behind my truck with few issues and on occasion even put my HD Ultra in the bed while towing the RV. Wish I had bought the 8' bed vice the short bed....next time. Truck pulls fine on the open road, but will struggle a bit on steep inclines. The trailer brake system works great. Transmission is fine, but at times, will shift hard when rapid down shifting. I intend to have the dealer check it out at the 30k service. I love the email vehicle status updates I get via email from Ram on a monthly basis. Modern technology....Cabin is spacious and I find it better than the competitors offering the same trim level. Price is better also! Ram needs to dump Firestone. The factory tires don't wear well. If your looking for a heavy duty truck that also gets great gas mileage, you might want to look elsewhere. Just keep in mind, the 6.4 Hemi has all the balls you may need, but fuel economy suffers. 15-17 mpg on the highway at 72-75 mph, 7-10 mph pulling  the RV at 60-65mph. Cabin is well put together and comfortable. I have cloth, but the first thing I did was Scotch Guard it and continue to do so every 6 months or so....no stain issues. Seriously, this truck gets the job done at a price below the competition while offering the same quality of materials and workmanship. My wife loves driving it....that in itself says a lot about the Ram. (She drives a '17 Ford F150...).",4

My 5th Ram since 2006 including my 2008 dually. I just can't find a better truck for the money. I've seen other comments and really don't know what direction the authors come from. I've driven my truck through water that came up over the chrome step assists.....never had an issue. Back up camera works fine. Takes getting used to when all you have been doing is using mirrors in the past....but I have never had to make more than 3 attempts to hook up to my RV. Plenty of cabin room, has all the gadgets and doodads, (although I do miss the CD player), and it does any job asked of it. It's had a few recalls, but I think every damn car/truck in my neighborhood has too. It's towing capacity is a bit fuzzy. Ram's website says 15k other sites say 16k. Have had an Susie with tire vibration at 70-75mph but the dealer is working to resolve. I have found that bad dealer service puts a bad taste in customers mouths and they post comments about their vehicles reflecting not so much the vehicle as the dealer. I have had a great dealer, Arrigo, so I guess I'm lucky.**** After driving from FL to Yellowstone...then to MA I learned that although the 6.4 Hemi is a strong engine, it doesn't like pulling 10k in RV Wright up hills. Lots of downshifting and high RPM' s. If I had to do it again, I would go back to the 3500 diesel dually I owned. The built in Jake brake is great. Works well but still puts a strain on the engine on steep declines. Despite this, I'm still a Ram fan.",4

Over all the great is a great truck. BUT the air box was designed top pull air in too low on the truck. Engine damage will occur if you use this truck for anything other than a pavement princess. I drove my truck through approx 1ft of water on my hunting club. Due to the low air box, it sucked in just enough water to hydro lock the engine.

By far the best purchase I have ever made.  RAM hit the nail on the head with this truck.  I wasn't sure about owning a diesel with DEF fluid, but with the fuel mileage I get I have no problem with it.  It only consumes DEF fluid when I pull and it doesn't go through that much.  When empty I don't use any.  Big advantage to Ram is there is a gauge so you see your level of DEF fluid vs dummy lights on Ford and Chevy. And to fill the DEF tank is right next to the fuel.  Chevy you have to pop the hood to fill the DEF tank.  The diesel is amazing, huge amounts of torque when pulling and the fuel mileage is crazy.  Empty I get about 23mpg Hwy and 18 in town.  Pulling a 10K trailer 75 mph I get 13 and it doesn't slow down for any hill or mountain.  Just set the cruise and go.  Reliability is standard Cummins reputation.  Diesel still require the maintenance, if you ignore it you will pay for it.  I went with Ram Cummins because of the issues with Duramax eat injectors and Powerstrokes have had issues in the past and Ford Dealerships are garbage.",5

It never ceases to amaze me how the price goes up year after year, even with the obvious cost cutting done by FCA! 2 years down the road more stuff breaks. I pulled the rear slider closed and the handle came off. Time will tell as the truck loses value! 2 years down the road yet another FCA recall and no fix!

The Gas mileage is horrible average 8-10 MPG. The tires are worn out. I have owned several Ram trucks and will never buy one again. I am selling/trading mine as soon as the dealer replaces the motor. After the repair due to the low resale value I have been unable to sell the truck. My truck now has around 29000 miles. I am less satisfied than I was. I do NOT recommend this vehicle. I now have a small older truck i drive, and only use this one when i have to. I DO NOT RECOMENT THIS. Update at 31000 miles the transmission had to be replaced. Warranty covered everything.i now get slightly better fuel mileage. The truck has been painfully to own. I use the truck as little as possible. It has been a huge dissapointment.

I'll try to update later after all is said and done.Here's another update: Got the transmission fixed at one of the top rated dealerships fairly close to the house and I've had no issues with it since; however, it doesn't go quite like it originally did; a little slower to change gears and get up to speed. We've taken it on a couple of long distance trips and it's been fine and I really don't have any more complaints about it. I use the truck to tow logs for my little sawmill and it does a good job. I also tow the occasional boat and trailer for other things and love the tow-ability and ease of controls. The original Firestone tires were advertised as 'off road' but they certainly are not and barely grip on an uphill incline when the truck is towing or has a load. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the truck now that the tranny problem seems to have been rectified and pleased with the warranty work although I did have to pay a little extra to have the truck towed to the dealership of my choice to do the repair work since the two closer dealerships have horrible service departments. Definitely worth paying a little extra to get the work done right the first time, though.Another update: the part for the transmission (solenoid) was replaced with the same faulty one. I am waiting to take it back to have it replaced with the newer version. Also, another warranty issue has arisen - the truck may jump out of PARK. There's no remedy yet for this issue. Just drove it to the coast and it got 18.5 MPG on the interstate, the same as everyday driving for some time now. I think that is great for a 6.4 L gas engine. Other than the transmission issue and an unidentifiable wheel noise, it's been great.",3

At 550 miles the transmission failed.  I was pulling a trailer weighing around 2500 pounds and a terrible slam sound came from the transmission as it was accelerating.  The vehicle and trailer shuttered and awful noises could be heard under the hood and in the floorboard.  So I took it to the dealership and they got negative codes.  They replaced the shifting solenoid (didn't work) and now its being torn apart like a science experiment at the nut house.  RAM customer service is as helpful as Hillary Clintons IT guy.  I was told that it is kinda what it is.  What? So do yourself a favor and leave these things alone.  Tell your friends and family to stay clear.  I am making a payment for a truck to sit at a dealership and who knows when this will get resolved.,1

I put a quart of 0-40w synthetic oil. Again at 3,000 miles - 1/2 quate low and at 4,000 mile had to add another quart. Dealers tell you the recommended oil change interval is 6000 miles between oil changes however, they do not tell you about oil consumption (based on Ram's ""Acceptable Oil Consumption"" maintenance notification - one quarter every 2,000 miles at over $10.00 per quart is within their accepable level). That only applies if you have less that 50,000 miles, after that, it's one quated for every 750miles. Love the truck - hate the oil consumption. Buyer beware - ask about any Dodge or Ram models there maintenance flier regarding ""ACCEPTABLE Oil Consumption"" - its the same.",3

WELL DONE RAM!," I was looking to replace my 2k Super Duty V10 4x4 supercab with a crew cab to give the dog more room, and fewer repair projects for me.  After getting frustrated with the local Ford dealers, started looking at Ram.  Spoke with several neighbors and co-workers who had made the switch from Ford to Ram & were extremely happy with the reliability & value of the Ram.  I had an extremely pleasant buying experience.  I did not want (to pay for) a loaded model.  I was able to find pretty much exactly what I wanted.  I bought a '16 2500 Heavy Duty crew cab short bed 4x4 with the 6.4L gasser & 4.10 gears in the Tradesman trim level (not a Power Wagon).  It's optioned almost to the SLT level with the chrome appearance package, preferred equipment package, UConnect 5.0, 4.10 gears, anti-spin differencial, shift-on-the-fly 4x4, park sense/park view, power trailer tow mirrors, and LED bed lights.    The ride is nice, albeit a bit stiff... but that's mainly a function of running 80 psi in the tires.  I'm amazed at how quiet the cabin is.  Being a base model, there are plenty of hard plastics in the cabin... but so far (fingers crossed), no squeaks or rattles... & it seems well put-together.  I wish it had a telescoping steering wheel, and the brake pedal sits a bit high for my foot.  I'll get used to it tho.  The seats seem quite comfortable... even the back seats.  The cylinder deactivation is imperceptible, tho at low speed/rpm, it will chug a little, on occasion.  The shift points (of the transmission) seem a bit off, even with the 4.10s, but all work smoothly.  It just seems like it's easy to catch the transmission off-guard pretty regularly...  a common occurrence in newer cars/trucks with 6-10 cogs in the trans...  it's tuned for mileage.   I'm getting around 11-13 mpg in town & 17-18 mpg on the highway.   No complaints there.  I'm still in the break-in phase, so no towing yet.  Overall, I'm a happy camper!",4

I custom ordered this truck and man did everything I got on this truck deliver. A month after getting my truck I went to Big Bear after a major snow fall and my truck handled well in 4x4H in the snow. My truck started well in 0 degree weather and every thing worked after driving in 0 degree weather. Next, two months later I went driving in the desert and once again my truck handled well on very rocky and bumpy roads like a champ. I have driven on the beach, in canyons, through water and my truck gets the job done. I just towed my 9,800lbs travel trailer and my truck towed well and braked well. I feel there are two downfalls with this truck; one is the limited turn radius of the truck. The turn radius isn't bad but the truck is hard to park in parking spots. Also the rear air vents provide very limited air in my crew cab. With those small issues stated, the interior of the truck is great. The storage in the rear passenger area is outstanding. I plan to have this truck for a while. Good job RAM!!!!!!!",5
500, on 03/25/16 18:43 PM (PDT),Jason ,2016 Ram 2500 Crew Cab Big Horn 4dr Crew Cab 4WD SB (5.7L 8cyl 6A),Upgraded from a Tundra," 6.7 Diesel Black Appearance Group.  Basically I will compare my last truck (2010 Tundra 5.7 Rock Warrior 4x4) to this one.  My family camps a lot.  I have a 9000# camper.  My Tundra pulled it very well.  For a 1/2 ton truck it's amazing.  Great brakes, amazing power, and great comfort.  With all that said it is NOT a heavy duty truck!!  I originally purchased a 1/2 ton truck because it was a daily driver and figured a 3/4 or 1 ton truck might be too much as a daily driver.  I could not have been more wrong.  After 5 camping seasons towing with my Tundra and filling up every 120 miles (I got 7.5 mpg) I had enough.  I have always wanted a diesel due to obvious reasons; towing/hauling, efficiency, stability, and the pure idea of having a diesel truck.  My father has a 2012 F-350 6.7, so I borrowed it for a long trip.  About 10 minutes into the trip I knew the Tundra was gone.  I drove them all.  In my opinion the Ram 2500 was by far the best decision for me as a daily driver.  The 3/4 ton has ridiculous towing (17,000+) and the available payload is way more then I would use.  It's the only 3/4 ton that has coil rear 5-link system.  Which promotes a fantastic ride for a HD truck.  The ride is solid, sturdy, and enjoyable.  It handles very well for nearly an 8000# truck.  For those of you who are...um.. vertically challenged, may have a difficult time getting into it.  It will be a more of a jump.  I'm 6'4"" and I slide right in, however, my wife 5'4"", has to climb in - but she loves the truck!  Once you get inside you will be amazed on how refined it is.  Everything inside the cabin looks high quality and well made.  The conveniences included rival most luxury SUVs.  Performance wise it will scoot.  The nasty torque will put you in your seat, but it is the slowest out of the big 3 from a dead stop.  Once you are moving (say 20-30) and you hammer it - they all are fairly close.  It shifts quite a bit sooner than the Chevy and Ford.  The Ram will shift just before 3,000rpm, whereas the others will shift closer to 3500-4000 on a wide-open throttle acceleration.  But I didn't purchase this for drag racing, I bought it for straight up towing.  With all the torque available at 1600rpm it does it extremely well and with very little effort.    Fuel economy for this 8000# beast is beyond amazing.  My Tundra averaged 14.5-15 per tank to and from work.  I have over 2000 miles on my Ram; basically 4 tanks.  So far each tank has been; 19.2, 18.6, 18.5, and currently I'm sitting at 18.8 with about another 100 miles until I fill up again.  I take the same way to and from work everyday.  Yes, I have a boring daily routine.  I live in central Ohio - the elevation is around 900ft (for those of you that need to know if the mpg is at sea level or in the clouds).  PS - I have, and will keep, all the emission.  I'm sure I will change my mind in a few months, but for now I'm happy with the sound/performance/mpgs.Granted this entire review is based on a couple thousand miles.  Rest assure I will update after I have an entire year of camping under my belt.",5

Had a few problems with the ford and after owning a 2005 dodge 2500 decided to give Ram a chance. I will admit I do miss the tailgate step, this is my only complaint. This truck has almost as much technology as the wife's luxury SUV. This is my daily driver and no problems with mirrors if you set them up correctly. With the 6.7 Cummins 370HP/800 TQ and 3.42 rear axle ratio I get 21 mpg at 70 mph and my average with all driving is 17.8 mpg. I can pull my #14,000 trailer without a strain. So if you have to tow and need a comfortable daily driver go test drive a new ram. Since I 1st did this review the only thing I have added is a bestsop trek step. Works great for stepping up and down in a high truck!",5

I kept the truck until I traded it off in 2011 for another ram 2500 and it never had anything go wrong with it. The only time it was in the shop was for regular maintenance, It was always reliable. My 2011 was also a great truck.  Same story as the 2004, always reliable and never had an issue except for the suspension was a little rough. I traded it in on a chevy in 2014 (HORRIBLE MISTAKE!). Within a year the transmission went out and then the oil pump!!! Unbelievable! Maybe it was a lemon, I don't know but I will never buy another chevy again. (Also in 2010 I bought a new Camaro and it was in the shop for an oil leak within 10,000 miles). I then just recently traded off my chevy on a 2016 Ram 2500 Laramie and love it! The truck is extremely nice inside and out and drives fantastic compared to the older Dodge Rams that I've had.  Or any other truck that I've owned for that matter (Ford, Chevy). I would suggest to anyone looking into buying a new truck to test drive the new Ram! I never write reviews but after reading the negative one on here I had to post my feelings about the Ram.

I will not buy another. I like driving my 1999 2500, owned it for 16 years and take it to drive unless I don't have a choice.  Would trade 2016, in if I wouldn't lose so much money. I get 21 mpg in my 1999; get 16 mpg in 2016.There's no interior lights for the front seat area. Have to pull over or passenger has to remove seat belt to read the map. Have to use the light in the back seat area. It doesn't have gas caps. It has Dumbo mirrors. They stick out way to far for normal use. It's very hard to see traffic in the mirrors. Real hard to change from fast lane to slow lane. Can't see cars in right lane. Mirror height to short. If you turn (90 degrees) the mirrors, you can see wide, but can't see cars. Have to use interior mirror for lane change. Has bug eyes mirrors on drivers side and passenger side. It's a pos. Tried to change out mirrors. Dealer had no knowledge on any kind of part swap. I'm 6'2"" and can't reach in to the bed of the truck without a ladder or lower tailgate. Still need ladder to get in bed. You have to buy steps to get in and out of the truck unless you have a 16"" vertical jump. Wife in high heels had to take off shoes to get in. Even with step, I hit my head on the overhead door opening. Not as tall as my 1999. Motor has a rev limiter. about 3200 rpm. Right when the motor is at full turbo, it cuts out. The exhaust brake button need to be relocated. You have to look at the bottom of the dash to engage. Eyes off the road like texting. Going to get a switch, for exhaust brake, to put on the gear shift lever. What does work--- I like the drink holder in the door. It's wired for easy towing. I like the six speed transmission. Wish I could put transmission in my 1999. Have to check. Over all I will retrofit an older truck before buying a new one. I've driven over 6 million miles in my life and this truck is dangerous to drive in traffic. Even on Freeways.  Overall.       Don’t buy this truck!",1

This was one of the first years with the spring suspension in the rear and it has held up to all towing and payload requirements without blinking. The ride quality is still a 3/4 ton but far superior to the other rams with springs in the rear. If you don't need the extra payload of the leafs then personally i would stick with the springs for daily ride quality. The only time i have seen the distance between my bed and tire gap shrink is with one of my 1950's era steel equipment trailers which is none too light in the hitch weight department.  overall tows well - nice and smooth - though if you live in a word of elevation changes my guess is you would be disapointed with high speed towing as the engine really needs to work at high speeds to get up hills and maintain a set speed.  It still does the job but it is working hard.  flat and mild elevation towing with no hassle. towing mirrors add great visibility - i can park this easier than my daily driver.  Factory tires are marginal. headlights dim. easily dents and scratches. mechanically rock solid. 4x4 low is awesome for heavy duty truck work.  stock front bumper accepts the powerwagon winch kit without modification. bought mine new in 2014 with solid factory incentives and i can still trade it in for more than i owe on it. even though i knew better i got suckered into adding extra warranties at the last minute - money wasted - the truck has had no issues despite being put through a great deal of abuse.  Makes my dad angry that my little gas engine can out tow his mid 00's diesel.,5

525, on 08/08/18 11:36 AM (PDT),Habitual Dodge Cummins owner ,2013 Ram 2500 Crew Cab SLT 4dr Crew Cab 4WD LB (5.7L 8cyl 6A),2013 Ram Cummins SLT 4 dr. long bed," Think long and hard before you buy this truck. I traded in my '02 model, similarly equipped, knowing that the older model would require some shop time, before long. It turned out that the new truck spent much more time in the shop than the old one ever did. High points are the refinements. The new 6.7L Cummins in the later Ram models are whisper-quiet at highway speeds. The new truck is much more stable. Gone is the death wobble that threatened the older models at higher speeds. Mileage is on par with the older, 12v Cummins in the Dodge Rams. Highway mileage regularly calculates above 20 mpg, with a best ever of 23.9,  driven at or below the speed limit on a round trip between Soldotna and Seward, AK. With a heavy trailer, right at the 17k lb. capacity of the truck, mileage dropped below 10 mpg on the same highway (a hilly, twisty highway). Here are the downsides: this truck has been in the shop for repair for three months, in the two and a half years that I've owned it, starting with a check engine light on the first drive home from the dealership. It was back and forth to their shop seven times, all for different problems, in the first nine months that I owned it, for a total of two months in that time period. I also replaced the water pump, myself, during that time. It has been replaced a second time, since then. The main exhaust emission components were all replaced twice. The rear differential failed, and was rebuilt. The heater fan quit working, and one dealer took two weeks to fix it, replacing the fuse box, at a cost to me of $1k. As soon as the warranty was out on the emissions system, I pulled it all off, and installed the biggest muffler I could buy. I like to be able to hear myself think. That cost $1,300 for materials and the programmer, not including my time to weld the exhaust and remove the problematic devices. Now, at 67,500 miles, the variable geometry turbo actuator has failed. The dealer first quoted me $2,800 for the device, which is in stock, and said they could drop it to as low as $1,950. Since the powertrain warranty ran out two months ago, this is my cost. I opted to mail the actuator to a repair place, at a cost of $500, and two weeks out of service. Again, not counting my labor. Speaking of the VGT, the exhaust brake is a nice feature that doesn't work like it should, with the automatic. It works best with a heavy trailer, but only if you are using the brakes. At highway speeds, the exhaust brake will slow you down to 55, then the torque converter unlocks, and the truck coasts at an idle. You get better compression braking naturally with the exhaust brake off, because the torque converter stays locked. You can make the exhaust brake work better by downshifting manually, but touching the throttle will leave you coasting when the torque converter unlocks, and the control for manually shifting barely works. The A/C quit working not long after they fixed the heater fan, and I haven't gotten it fixed, yet. One of the two USB ports does not work. The sheet metal on the body is thin, and both doors were already dinged when I bought it, at 20k miles, apparently by people pushing the doors, near the handle, to close them. The left third of the rearview mirror turns into the backup camera, which basically makes the mirror useless for backing up the truck, especially if it's dark. The truck is prone to understeer, and traction control is an unwelcome inconvenience that can't be turned completely off unless in four wheel drive, at a dead stop. It also leaves you with a considerable throttle lag, as the computer decides whether or not it can give the throttle input you desire. The value of the truck has declined steadily, since I bought it, and it is still barely worth what I owe on it. Summing it up, the truck fails in several of the categories which are the main reasons to buy a diesel pickup, including reliability, durability, and resale value. Good power, mileage, refinement, and work ability. The roomy interior is nice to sit in, even when the truck doesn't run.",2

The constant dinging of warning messages from the bug-ridden computers that end up meaning little while scaring the bejabbers out of the driver is one of the biggest headaches of owning this vehicle. The now infamous 'Uconnect' system is so corrupt and full of bugs that it should aptly be re-named 'Disconnect'. The fact that FCA's response was 'go buy a new truck because we fixed the problems but you're not getting the software fixes' was particularly enraging. The batteries failed withing 26 months, the running board covers are cheap plastic and have been disintegrating since day one and are as slick as black ice when wet. The entire truck is nothing but thin plastic and even thinner metal that is easily dented by pushing on a malfunctioning door. I have a list of other things wrong with this piece of garbage as long as my arm and the truck is currently under several recalls, not the least of which is the catalytic converter.

528, on 03/24/16 13:49 PM (PDT),Ryan Tafoya ,2013 Ram 2500 Crew Cab Tradesman 4dr Crew Cab LB (5.7L 8cyl 6A),Good for a while," I have been driving a 2013 2500 Ram with the Cummins engine. The truck now has 78,000 miles and other than high maintenance costs (oil change and fuel filters replacement $400) and only ok mileage (combined 18) it had been a good truck. I was recently involved in an accident that damaged the front passenger door and front fender  but still drivable. It's been in and out of the dealership four times for engine repairs. The engine quit and initial sensor was for the throttle valve. First they replaced the throttle valve and did an EGR service, after the DEF light kept coming on, they finally decided that the DEF pump and airbox had gone out. With these repairs, we are now sitting at $2500. Somehow, I suspect it will not end here. The problem is the emissions technology has not been perfected and the factory does not want to admit it. The pre DEF engines ran relatively trouble free for well over 100,000 miles. Unless you plan on hauling a lot of weight, stick with the gas engines for now.Update; at about 80,000 miles the fan ate the shroud and the water pump went out at the same time.  This also destroyed the radiator, repair bill $3000. The water pump went out the first time at 40,000 (under warranty). A week later the fan ate the shroud again, the dealership covered the repairs this time but the truck was down for almost a month between both repairs. Now at 85,000 miles and things are going ok. Now at 115,000 and no new problems to speak of. Engine runs good and interior has no rattles. Update; at 125,000 the right rear seal, soaking the brakes in oil. So, new seal and new rear brakes. Engine running strong, transmission has been trouble free and interior quiet. Mileage averages about 17.5 now.",3

In a word versatility that was fun to drive. I found the Promaster city wagon after the local Ford dealer wasn't even carrying the passenger Ford Transit and the salesman looked at me like I had something growing out of my head. This was the only Promaster City Wagon on the lot so I guess the versatile Eurovan has yet to catch on. I hate the lack of versatility/space in minivans and crossovers b/c of seating and finish. I recently bought this for clearing out an estate and for long trips. It's been a smooth ride so far. There is plenty of head room and room to bed down for the night or long haul. Back seats can be removed to make more room or tumble forward. Ideal for one or two people on a long haul. Lots of cargo space for moving gear and head space and shelf rack above windshield. Cruise control is a must but not standard. The cargo base is a tin can with 2 seats. The city wagon finishes the back with some plastic and fabric/sound dampening. You pretty much pay for anything extra. Decent fit and finish. Be forewarned: here in VT and with insurers it is deemed a truck/commercial vehicle b/c it has a truck base? so costs @$100 more to insure for a year. I am hoping after the break in period to get better mpg. Right now @23 hwy? 4 speaker Stereo is a little tinny but it is nice to take calls and play tunes via bluetooth, a new trick for this old dog, and I like the backup camera.

Which was an ok set of features, camera, stereo, blutooth, cruise. I was unable to procure the rear defrost and wiper package. Rain driving means using the side mirrors which fold in btw, for parking. So far, so good. Lots of compliments and head turns around town. Good sight lines, though somewhat exposed, like you are driving around in an fish bowl.  Roof rack is extra. Seat is comfortable for a big guy like me.

I was unsure of my feelings about it but now I can honestly say I do not like this van. one of my complaints early on was the acceleration. It's a peppy vehicle but the gas petal is way to sensitive and acceleration from a stand still is inconsistent. I've had the vehicle long enough to have gotten used to driving it but sometimes I step on the gas and the van accelerates normally. Other times it moves too quickly and there are times when it seems like it doesn't respond at all. Not a good feeling in busy traffic. Then there is the brake issue I mentioned in my first review. The issue still exists and RAM has no plans to do anything about it. I guess it's not an expensive enough vehicle for them to care about. Every morning when I leave for work my brakes screech like crazy due to the cheap metal they used on the drums and they rust overnight. Either that or the pads have a high metal content and the metal in them rusts. The screeching does go away after driving the vehicle and making a number of stops to ""grind"" the rust away. On a rainy day I can get thru the screeching period, drive for a while until I reach my destination, get back in the van a few hours later and the brakes screech all over again. This is unacceptable! Since my last review I have realized that this van handles bumps horribly. I have a 12 year old pickup that rides better than this thing. Now I am having electrical/transmission issues and am actually waiting for the local RAM service tech to call me back to arrange to have the van towed for them to evaluate/repair the issue. Maybe it's just my vehicle as I do see positive reviews but I am not happy with it.",3

He offered me this van at what I thought was a great deal. I want to like this van but I really don't know what to think so far. It took me a while to get used to the gas petal. Either I was taking off too fast sending everything in front flying backwards or I would start and then hesitate. Anytime you switch from driving a particular vehicle for a while there is an adjustment period as you get used to the new vehicle. I am getting used to it but not sure if there is a transmission issue. I just can't seem to have a smooth start. I've never had that problem with other vehicles for this long. Also, every morning, especially if it is damp outside, my brakes seem to work too well. I will be maneuvering in our driveway working my way toward the street and every time I just slightly step on the brakes I damn near go thru the windshield. They just stop way to hard. The brakes sound awful too as if they needed to be changed a long time ago and the drum is being grinded by worn pads. My brother's mechanic looked at the brakes and said there is plenty of meat still on the pads. They didn't replace the pads because the only ones they could find were really expensive. Hopefully some aftermarket company starts making some cheaper, better pads soon.I want to like this van. It is peppy and has good cargo area. I suppose I just need to take it to the dealership and have them take a look.",4

First off, I'm a repair guy, own a Avalanche truck, can pack all my tools and pull a trailer no problem,  MPG is my problem.  So, first time I rented one was December of 2015, right after they came out. I also have a catering company and my truck was in the shop. It handled my equipment well and I was pleased. Second time, I had to pack my daughter for college and drive about 500 miles,  I got about 27mpg, and that was mostly freeway.  This last time, I noticed things that I hadn't before; lack of 2 arm rest. Seems like that should be common place, especially for a cargo van. The ability to rest your arms on the door arm rest area, it's just a bit too far away, your forearm is on it but your elbow is off, and if you shift towards the door, your ""rear"" is riding on the high part of the seat. The gear shifter positioning doesn't allow for your phone to be stored close by. Yes there's a flat area on the dashboard but a middle consule area would be great.  The two cup holders between the front seats, the one in the rear is really a pain for either driver or passenger,  not convenient.  You definitely have to get a suction cup phone holder if using your phone for GPS,  no place to see it otherwise. Overhead storage bin is great, I'm able to put my ""classic construction clipboard "", wallet, bag of chips, etc up there no problem. Side doors open easily,  rear doors are great. If you're packing / moving, which I did for my daughter,  I suggest similar size boxes, that way everything fits nice and tight. Setting the tripometer is kinda a pain until you get use to it, it's on the wiper or blinker handle at the end, so you have to push it in and cycle to your option. The lumbar/ recline knob is really a pain in the.. .Seriously,  you have to wrap your left hand down and around while rotating the knob. It is a bit loud when not loaded.  I've only rented the cargo version,  no second row seats. 12vdc plug in cargo area nice feature. Oh, the 2 plugs in the front are not ""live"" unless key is on, so you can't charge phones/ tablets/ ,etc unless van is on,  kinda bummer. Standard rims and tires are weak. I've been on the search for a van like this for the past year, but unless the Tradesman SLT have more comfort features,  I'm not completely sold. I  do like the towing feature,  which the Chevy and Nissan are not compatible but the Transit is. I'm on the road all day with a co worker, so these minor details are actually major for me.",4
547, on 09/14/16 20:19 PM (PDT),Wendy F ,2016 Ram Promaster City Minivan Wagon SLT 4dr Minivan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),What can't my Promaster City Wagon do?," I love my Promaster City Wagon. In bright yellow, I might add. It looks like a little bread truck/caution sign driving down the road but I am so happy inside. I have to say that I am trading in two cars for this one PMC wagon: a 1998 Toyota Tacoma with camper shell, and a 1995 Chevy Lumina minivan. I like a car with great utility and a car that I can sleep in on road trips. My old truck and van were each really good in their own way. But my new PMC Wagon tops them both--as a hybrid truck/van monster. Obviously my review is being written by someone that drove a Tacoma and an old van--not a Lexus so my needs for comfort and luxury may be somewhat less than yours, but here is what I think.  This car is so fun to drive and so comfortable that I have no idea that I am in a cargo van -- except for the fact that it holds boat loads of stuff. It accelerates quickly -- too quickly if you want to watch your gas mileage, it handles and turns very well. It stays on the road. I can pass ANYONE on the highway, and often do. No trouble getting up to speed to merge onto the highway either. The seats are comfortable in the SLT with the extra lumbar support. It is true, you do have to crank the recliner knob and it is a bit slow, my old Lumina van was the same way. The front seats go so far back that you can sleep in them just fine. I am 6'2"" and find so much leg room up front that I don't have to put the seat all the way back (never happens in other cars). If you don't want to sleep in the front seat then tumble half the back seat forward and sleep diagonal on the floor (if you're under 6' tall you don't have to sleep diagonal).  It can come with satellite radio and has a great entertainment/computer console with buttons integrated into the steering wheel, built-in hands-free phone calls with bluetooth. Someone complained about not having a CD player. Well any smart phone or mp3 device will hook right up to the radio console with USB or bluetooth.  Tons of head room, you can put your arms straight up and wave them around. Way cool overhead storage and clever bottle holders in the door pockets. Good, solid construction. Sliding doors are light and very slidey with very clever handles. I love the simplicity and design of the door handles and latches and the combination door handle/lock button in the front seats. Cavernous front seating area with wide angle view. I want to drive this thing to Alaska to see the wide open scenery. I think it is quiet. I know it is quiet compared to my Tacoma (which is a noisy little truck) and even compared to the Lumina. Even during a wind storm, I did not feel that the van was too tall or got too much wind noise or battering around. Note that it is wider than your average minivan. A wider track like a jeep might be helping to avoid that too-tall feeling. It corners like a car, not like a van. I have almost 5,000 miles on it so far and no mechanical problems yet (knock on wood). I am getting about 24 mpg in town and more like 26 on the highway. Best mileage in 9th gear (85mph and 30 mpg).  I have not tried it in the snow yet. As a front wheel drive I expect it will do OK, but we'll see. It has a quick disconnect battery! Seriously, you just pull up a big pin. I have been waiting for that for years. My first car was a Studebaker (no I am not that old...the car was older than me) and I loved my Studebaker because of the simple, functional design. I feel like I have finally bought another Studebaker. You can't beat the combination of price and utility (and I suspect, but we don't know yet because it is a new model...reliability). Driver fatigue is very low in this car due to comfort. The speedometer is oddly off to the left of the dashboard (not centered) and I don't think the trip computer allows you to show a digital speed which would be handy. What you see in front of you is the date and some other trip info. I think this is funny because the date doesn't change--all day long. But maybe if you're using this as a work van and have to sit in that front seat and do paperwork, you'll appreciate knowing where to find the date? I had wanted to buy a car with automatic climate control, but this car did not have that option. I must say I really don't spend much time fiddling with the temperature controls in this truck anyway. There is an unfortunate blind spot where the panels are in the back/sides that prevents you from seeing, in parking lots, if someone is approaching the back of your car from the side. But a backup camera, and audible object detection system help with that. So my complaints are way fewer than the things that I love about the car. I get compliments often about its looks and potential versatility. My old parents find it easy to get in and out of both the front and back seats, it has a low step-in height than most trucks and a higher seat height than most cars. I consider it a FWD SUV, for on-road adventure; a mini, dry camper; a daily driver; and a cargo hauler.",5
548, on 07/11/16 12:57 PM (PDT),Lostrminds ,2016 Ram Promaster City Minivan Wagon SLT 4dr Minivan (2.4L 4cyl 9A),Promaster City Wagon SLT," Sitting at home late one night researching minivans on YouTube.  Thank goodness I ran across the Ram Promaster City Wagon. The wife wanted stown'go style mini. That was enough to make me throw up but this van was interesting.  We had looked at and drove C, D, H, K & T vans, did I miss any? Sure they had the stuff but they carried the average $33k+ price tag. Two weeks later a new Ram City Wagon SLT in our drive. A great bang for the buck.   Now owning our Ram Promaster City Wagon SLT for almost 3 weeks now with 2400 miles on the clock. I can say we love it.  Ride, handling, gas mileage and interior space is fabulous.    Our wagon had a long list of options from heated seats, backup camera w/ rear audible sensors, fog lamps, aluminum wheels, electric windows and doors (child proof lock outs in rear for windows & doors too), adjustable steering wheel, electric adjustable heated mirrors, rear wiper/washer with defroster and the Uconnect radio which is far superior than our Mylink on our GM. The front overhead storage shelf is Awesome, too. For the cup/bottle holder baby crowd: front doors 2, rear doors 1 and center console 2 that's a total of 8.  Head room, shoulder, leg room up front and back is great. The front doors offer easy access to the front seats which are equipped with turn knobs to adjust seat recliner with lumbar support. Boohoo no lever. Passenger has recliner knob. The rear sliding doors open to expose rear seats that tumble forward in 60/40 fashion. 60 on drivers side 40 on passenger side but are non-removable. Putting our toddler in his car seat with ease, no issues with banging your head, bending over straining your back and easy access to adjust that car seat. Also each rear seating position (3) has the LATCH System to install a child's car seat.    Cabin safety I see front air bags, front bucket seats tagged with airbag equipped and side curtain airbags front and rear, too.  I read something about knee protection: not sure if that means airbag or just the design of the lower dash. Other safety items that seem standard on every vehicle I assume need to be stated: antilock brakes, skid control, hill assist.   A personal not on safety I've read the professional reviewers complain of ""NO"" 3rd row seat: thank goodness! I've witnessed a few highway rear ended accidents in my day and everyone I've witnessed are automobiles that get smashed into the back to the rear window.  It is in my personal option a tragedy waiting to happen to place your children or loved ones in a far rear seat/3rd row in any minivan or small SUVs. That could result in your child being (the Bumper) compacted in any type of rear end Collision/accident. As the driver I have a cripple zone in front of me with airbags and a steering to attempt to maneuver but you have limited of no control what so ever when hit from behind. With that in mind why would you place a child in the rear crumple zone!  Explain that to me? Why! A quick internet search will qualify my option. Purchase a full sized van, Suv or a bus.    The rear cargo doors are also 60/40 opening to 90 or 180 degrees they offer easy low height access to the rear cargo area which is  carpeted with 4 anchoring points and shallow built-in side shelving on both sides.  Rear cargo area is roughly 49"" between wheels by 52"" with seats up and 67"" with seats folded. Stack that firewood, carry mulch, toss in the dog or pickup your groceries with no worries of damaging your interior cargo area, no fancy trim just space.  Our gas mileage is averaging 26.8.  Nice pickup, great cruising on the highway. Set cruise at allowable speed and the motor and 9 speed automatic handles it nicely. If you want to control your shifts tap the gear selector to manual and take control of that 9 speed gear box.   Handling on the winding  roads at posted limit to me is sure footed and pleasant. In our area we have many unpaved, washboard, loose gravel roads it performs satisfactorily stays were pointed. I've driven auto cross in my Alfa, motorcycles, snowmobiles and boats. Is it my Alfa Spider no but it's not a barge either. Fun would be the word with manners.   Interior noise seems to be a topic of concern. It's a van! Well we both think our Ram interior is as quiet as our 2014 Chevy extended super quiet cab. Nice sounding 6 speaker stereo, free satellite radio for a year, flawless Bluetooth hookup and iTunes no problem. Two 12volt plugs between the seats and one in the rear driver side also near the shifter a usb and audio input for your phone.  I personally like the look of the wagon. I've fielded many questions from I suppose similar minded folks at almost every stop: gas station, grocery and even the highway rest area. I'm willing to shown'tell but the wife not so much.   Our dealer was superb out of Warren PA.  Hats off to Cory and Troy.  Best ever experience I've ever had!  Out the door with the exterior and interior protection treatments and a Michelin tire swap w/nitrogen came in rig",5

I spend a great deal of time on forest roads, this is not hardcore off road terrain. Bumpy, Muddy, and a bit of fun yes, but not “Off road” really. I pull trailers, the heaviest around 13,000 Lbs and lots of freeway driving.I have always owned trucks, my first vehicle was a mid-80’s Toyota pick-up, then a mid-90’s Toyota Tacoma, then a 2004 Toyota Tundra. In early 2013 I wanted a bigger truck and I also missed driving a manual transmission truck. The only automatic vehicle I have ever owned was the 2004 Tundra.  I went all out and purchased a new 2012 RAM 2500 diesel Crew Cab. The 2012 was in the shop every month like clockwork. You could not drive this truck for more than half a day off pavement without the check engine light coming on, which was ironic since the mode of the truck was an “Outdoorsman”.  After two years I had had enough and worked it out with the dealership to trade the truck in on a 2014 RAM 3500 diesel with a manual transmission. I was thinking that all RAMs could not be this bad or the company would be out of business. Well I was wrong.2014 RAM 3500 Big Horn 6.7L Cummins Turbo Diesel Crew Cap with a manual Transmission Review:The truck has power I’ll give it that, but only when it is not in the shop for something. The main issue was the exhaust system. In my option it is a very poor design that has various bandaid fixes, but should be redesigned and made functional. In the two years I owned this truck every part of the exhaust system was replaced at least once and many were replaced multiple times. One comment I get all the time was why not just install a “delete kit” and solve the problem. I’m sure this would have made the truck usable and improved the overall performance, but I feel you should not have to break Federal Law for a functional truck. The truck put me in limp home mode 2 times while more than 100 miles from home. If you are not familiar with this mode, the truck computer will give you a warning that in 150 miles your top speed will be 5mph. This is one of the most frustrating things, since it is not a failure of a key system that allows the engine to function, but rather an exhaust system failure Aside from the exhaust issues, there was a host of other issues:1.	The 3rd taillight leaked water in the cab twice. I finally gave-up on the dealer fixing this and fixed it myself with a little bit of caulking. It should be noted that this also occurred on my 2012 RAM. It is a very common problem with RAMs. Easy fix with caulking, but for the price you pay for this truck the cab should not leak.2.	The windshield wiper motor failed, casing the windshield wipers to no longer work.3.	The emergency brake light would not go out in cold weather, luckily the emergency brake would disengage. 4.	Transmission started leaking a little around 30,000 miles5.	The cruise-control button started not working intermittently around 50,000 miles6.	The latch on the middle console stopped working and was locked in the closed position7.	Around 58,000 miles a bushing in the front end started to fail and would make a clunking sound every time you turned the wheel while driving or not.8.	The exterior body detail between the front and rear doors started to crack and peel.While the 2014 RAM was in the shop a little less than the 2012 RAM, both trucks were complete failures. If you are looking at purchasing a new truck please, don’t buy a RAM. Hopefully you will never know firsthand the pains and financial loss of owning one.",1
