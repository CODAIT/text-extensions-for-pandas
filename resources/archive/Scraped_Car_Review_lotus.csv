0, on 03/11/08 20:25 PM (PDT),SanDiegan ,2008 Lotus Exige Coupe S 240 2dr Coupe (1.8L 4cyl S/C 6M),Street Legal Race Car," This is my second Lotus. My first was an 05 Elise with 190bhp, a soft top, and standard (""Touring"") suspension. My new S240 could not be a more different car. This Exige is serious business. The acceleration is spectacular; when you get on the throttle the supercharger sounds like a jet engine and you quickly become one with the driver's seat. I really enjoyed the handling and cornering of the Elise, but the Exige S240 with the Track Pack is not to be believed. The capability of this car to corner hard with minimal body roll is unlike anything you have experienced before (including 360 Modena's and Gallardo's that I have driven).",3.75

I'll put this simply, this is the street version track car. Not much has changed overall, unless you count the interior is redone, has the launch capability, better, bigger brakes, 4 piston calipers and (gasp) a cupholder! Now, I didn't think that Lotus could improve the Exige, even with the superchager in 07. I waited since my first one was the first release without the SC. I was going to buy the track version, but heard that I should wait. I'm glad I did... so worth it! This Exige is is the BEST! Words can't describe the feeling",4.75
2, on 03/08/07 11:42 AM (PST),jeff pearce ,2006 Lotus Exige Coupe 2dr Coupe (1.8L 4cyl 6M),new lotus owner," I researched this car for a while before I bought it. The car is fantastic to drive. The interior space is comfortable but yes it is somewhat spartan. However, it is a sport car and not a luxury car. The acceleration is crazy fast. The feel of the car while driving is like being part of the car itself. I have the upgraded stereo and the touring package so I can listen to great music and smell the wonderful scent of leather. Imagine a smooth ribbon of highway, the sun on your shoulder and your hands wrapped around a machine that is capable of unleashing a fury of raw energy and you are in command. This car is worth every penny and the few negatives, like high maintenances charges are worth it.",4.5
3, on 05/21/06 16:11 PM (PDT),Al B Bach ,2006 Lotus Exige Coupe 2dr Coupe (1.8L 4cyl 6M),"Exige, Mighty Mini Supercar"," Exige will take you're breath away. Not a practical utilitarian car by any means. This car car is designed for one purpose: to be driven on back twisty roads where the adrenaline flows through your veins. This is a ""me"" car that spells out individuality with F1 roots. This car is for serious drivers in a small niche track drivers, car enthusiasts and those that want pure performance without killing the pocket book. From its 150lb chassis to the hand layer fiber body it is definitely worth the wait for an order to be processed for the US market. I waited since 2004 for mine since the first US announcement for ramp up in Nov 2005, delivery was Feb 2006. Only 300 made and I'm glad I got mine.",4.625
4, on 03/22/06 19:00 PM (PST),XEEEJ ,2006 Lotus Exige Coupe 2dr Coupe (1.8L 4cyl 6M),An Amazing Car - But Not For Everyone," The Exige is an amazing machine.  Steering feel, braking & cornering are all phenomenal.  The car is also beautiful to look at while being functional.  I love mine, but prospective buyers need to know what they're getting.  The car is not for everyone and you have to be willing to deal with its total impracticalities.  It's basically a 4 wheel motorcycle.  The car is best used on twisty back roads or on track.  Commuting or highway cruising is a waste, in my opinion.  You have to accept the attention that the car draws.  It's a surprisingly comfortable car once inside.  Ingress and egress are tricky but get easier with a little practice.  Nothing comes close to an Exige for the money. ",4.375

7, on 07/30/08 13:01 PM (PDT),"""Mr Lotus"" ",2007 Lotus Exige Coupe S 2dr Coupe (1.8L 4cyl S/C 6M),EXIGE S - PURE RACER," My 2d season with the '07 (1st year) Exige S. This is a pure race car on or off the track and is built around acceleration, handling and braking - it is arguably the best handling car on the road.  This is why a strong driver who knows the car's capabilities can win over other high end cars both American and European.  It must be understood that to arrive at the final equation of this car's performance there entailed certain cons built-in.  But you must maximize the car's capabilities to overcome its modest top-end when competing with other racers.  And get a Valentine 1 or be prepared to get multiple tickets or -- be prepared to ditch the 5.0 as the ol' chap found out last night - not rec. ",4.25
8, on 07/02/07 11:36 AM (PDT),Exige_S ,2007 Lotus Exige Coupe S 2dr Coupe (1.8L 4cyl S/C 6M),Take It To The Track!," This is it. THE car I've wanted for so many years. I've had everything from a '68 Shelby GT350 to a '66 Sunbeam Tiger, even a pair of '02 Miata SEs, but this car shines above them all.  The control you have is beyond anything else on the street. It's not the fastest or quickest car, but it feels like it is. It even looks fast sitting still.  Everyone wants to race, talk about, touch or drive it and lots of people take pictures of it.  Even kids love it.  It's one of those cars that kids of all ages get to ""drive"" in video games, and when they see it on the street it's almost as if you're looking at a Matchbox car.  It has race-car looks but you can drive it on the street... AND the track!",4.875
9, on 06/18/07 15:38 PM (PDT),AZExigeS ,2007 Lotus Exige Coupe S 2dr Coupe (1.8L 4cyl S/C 6M),The most fun on four wheels, The 2007 Lotus Exige S is very quick and handles like its on rails. The only other car I want is a Pagani Zonda. My comments: do NOT buy this car if you want luxury. There is hardly anything inside except bare aluminum. Buy a Cayman S instead. DO buy this car if you are a real enthusiast and intend to take it to the race track on the weekends. This is a race car built by a company with Formula One heritage.,4.625

This car would be difficult on public roads given the small size, hard suspension, and low center of gravity.  The small engine works very well in a car this light.  However, it can be very loud and a radio is not going to help.  I am 5'6"" and find it very difficult getting out of the car.  For serious racers, this is a great all-around package.  No creature comforts.",4
12, on 01/28/11 07:51 AM (PST),mkovalsky ,2010 Lotus Evora Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.5L 6cyl 6M),Best Lotus Yet," A Lotus you can actually live with everyday-the interior is all leather and fits together properly, no squeaks or rattles.Instrument cluster is perfect and the touch screen stereo/navigation works well.Lotus even made it easy to get in and out of, relatively speaking.Handling is second to none, it is like driving a larger Elise.Interior is quiet under normal driving and you can actually hear a phone call using the built in bluetooth.Exhaust note is quiet at low rpms but becomes a fantastic wail at full throttle.Handling in the wet is scary at best but it has incredible grip when dry.Absolute head turner, expect to get a tremendous amount of attention everywhere you go.",4.75
13, on 02/19/06 21:51 PM (PST),jbrookstone ,2004 Lotus Esprit Coupe V8 2dr Coupe (3.5L 8cyl Turbo 5M),Musclecar in Exotic Clothing," Only 33 2003.5-2004 Final Edition Lotus Esprits were made and shipped to the United States.  Equipped with a turbocharged 32-valve flat-plane crankshaft V8, they start, idle and sound very much like a '60's era musclecar with a hot cam.  Exhaust note is very good from a low grumble at idle to a roar under acceleration.  There is almost no turbo lag, tons of torque above 2000 rpm allowing the Esprit to easily burn rubber in its first 3 gears.  Steering is very, very fast and precise - plus the turning radius is exceptionally tight. Cockpit space is adequate for those under 6 feet and trunk space is surprisingly generous. Handling is outstanding, as in all Lotuses.  Front spoiler seeks bumps.",4.125

Don't mean b/c u ""want"" to drive it fast, I mean b/c IT wants to drive fast. The gas pedal is either on or off, as is clutch. Brakes similar, risk a face plant if not careful to go gentle on pedal.  Not easy to drive, but has its rewards. Downsides: (there are several), forget about getting it if you are shy, everyone WILL react to it, sometimes positively, sometimes not. This leads to things that weigh on your mind. As in, can I just park this car anywhere?(ans: no). Do I need to plan my trips? (ans: yes). The car nose is unbeleivably low. Remember this is not a Porsche911, it is a supercar.",4.5

Handling has been described as the greatest ever.  I don't disagree.  Performance is unbelievable, especially with a few reasonably priced mods.  This car will glue you to your seat and handle curves at speeds previously reserved for video games.  The styling is not as outrageous as otherrs, but this is a car that looks much better in person than in print.  Beautiful, exotic, good fuel mileage, unbelievable performance and handling for a fair price.  The only flaw is that the interior, while very well made, is that of a typical British car - small and tight.",4.75

I am so use to people making double takes when they see it on the road that it feels strange on the rare occasion when it does not occur. The performance is way beyond what I can explore and the exhaust note with the center exit U.S. exhaust is phenomenal and sounds only like exotic european cars can. The interior is very intimate and memorable and feels very nice once settled in.  I think the exterior is one of the most beautiful, exotic shapes to date and still looks modern after all these years.  I have owned Porsches and Ferraris and this is the most satisfying car yet.

The interior is gourgeous in tan and the wheels are the most beautiful I have ever seen.  The twin turbo acceleration is the best I've ever driven and the exhaust is pleasantly loud.  Major service is maybe $1200 and was $5000 on the Testarossa. Other accessories and parts much more reasonable also.  I am using as everyday driver and I fully expect it to be reliable.",4.75

I have had nothing but pleasure without any headaches.  Keep care of the Exclusive Lotus and it will keep good care of you.

It's limited production numbes ensure exclusivity and first rate personal support from the manafacturer. It has fantastic looks, and is now very reliable which is significant in this car class, second only to the NSX I would say. The car has superb handling which requires some getting used to as it's uncluttered by electronic traction control gizmos. It can easily out perform the NSX, 911. Against the Ferrari 360 it's a close affair.  It is surprising comfortable on long journeys although getting in and out can be cumbersome.

The car is larger and more roomy than other Lotus models. I have the manual transmission I wanted back to drive a true sports car. I have owned Porsche's and the new Porsche's have lost the fell of the road and the fun of driving the same as the new McLaren. The McLaren is beautiful and fun but the new models take away again that sports car feel. I have 3000 miles on the car and use it as a daily driver I have only had the car for 2 months , no problems. The Toyota supercharged engine has plenty of power and the shiftier is very easy to use . The clutch has  a very soft feel I prefer a clutch to be a little stiffer but you have to look at the general public. There are very few autos today who give you driving pleasure and the true feel of the road that is why I went back to Lotus, driving excitement and simplicity in a great sports car.  Update review I now have 15673 miles on the car and it has been trouble free . My wife likes riding in this car rather than the Porsche she feels more comfortable riding in the Evora 400. This spring we took a trip to Idaho 2600 miles round trip and no problems, everyone we met on the road asked about the Lotus due to its limited production. Last week a 911 wanted to race us and the Porsche was no match for the Lotus. The Porsche has 370 hp and 285 lbs of torque at the crank where the lotus has 407 hp with 350 torque at the wheels from a dyno machine. If you are looking for a true sports car with precision and balance then go with the Lotus. If you just want to be seen in a Porsche and pay more money for less handling and higher service costs then buy the Porsche.  This car is great on country roads where driving sport cars are fun if you just drive around town then the Lotus is not for you.",5

Lotus has taken years of specialized racing builds turning their experience into a well built, well tuned, well heeled and well, a good-looking automobile that can turn heads and flat dust the next Guy.

You will begin getting gas at night just to avoid all the questions and strangers chatting you up for 20 minutes. I have learned more about the car from others than I knew before I purchased it.  It is alarmingly quick to 100 mph and I have not had one problem with it.  Not one, ever, an extraordinary feat for a hand-built vehicle.  The interior is simple and clean, with only the essentials.  The high RPM power is addictive.  I would equate driving this vehicle with how a great white shark must feel swimming along out there, knowing there is nothing out there that can touch him.

I have seen more Ferraries and Lamborghinis than lotuses. That truly makes this an exotic car. It sounds like a formula one car under an over pass!

If you buy this car expecting anything more than a driving machine, you are looking at it for the wrong reason. The combination of aluminum and fiberglass that make up the Elise provide a very high power to weight ratio, even with the very small 1.8L Toyota engine.  After pushing the car past 6200 rpm you feel a boost in power as the car switches to the second cam. As you redline in second at 8500 rpm, the shift into third pushes your head back into the seat. At this point you realize that you're on the freeway inching toward 100 and need to slow down. What a killjoy.

It is like a street-legal road rocket. A race car. A go-kart. It's so fun to drive. I have driven faster cars, but none more gratifying than this. And it's no slouch either! Once you're inside, it's pretty cozy and roomy. Easy to get comfy in. I have never been in a car that garnered so much attention. Every day I get compliments, questions, comments, and non-stop looks. I don't imagine that Ferrari owners get nearly this much attention. Take this car to some twisty back roads and the magic will come to life.

Getting in and out for me, 6 foot 2 inches, 205 pounds was a little tricky at first, but now feels normal, taking about 2 weeks to adjust.  Driving the Elise is tons of fun and manuevering it is easier than any other car I've ever driven. It is very forgiving, especially for a RWD sports car. Over rough roads or on long trips (with the stage II exhaust fitted) the Elise is definitely not at home. You will feel every bump and the drone of the engine will likely wear on you.  Nonetheless, the Lotus is an amazing car, even as a daily driver. There is nothing on the market that comes close in performance and looks for anything near the money.",4.5

In 2006 I was looking, quite honestly, for the best bang for my buck.  I'm single and don't drive much and never used the back seats in my old cars, so a 2 seater was ideal for me.  Upon seeing the Elise I was sold. In Chili Red with the Sport and Luxury upgrades, I purchased a 2006 brand new and it is quite literally the most amazing car I've ever owned. Between beauty, performance, and even reliability (with the Toyota engine), this car blew and still blows away anything from twice the price on down. It's truly an awe inspiring vehicle",4.875

All of these cars were amazing and unique, but the Lotus Elise is truly the ride I have been looking for.  Yes it is not a Porsche uni-body design and it does lack German engineering, but the feed back and handling is so much like a race car it is truly awesome! The light weight chassis design along with the independent suspension makes this vehicle very unique.

I have never driven a car that is more responsive to the touch than this one.  It is as though this car is an extension of your mind and body. It is a blast to drive at high speeds through twisting, turning roads, passing muscle cars with 500 hsp plus motors that simply cannot hold the road. My last toy was an Acura NSX and after test driving Corvettes, Porsche 911's and BMW's I thought I would never find a car that would touch the NSX.

I bought a black Elise with a hard top and the neighbors thought I was driving the Batmobile.  If you want a car that has a fun factor of 10+, it's a no brainer; however, it is a bit of a challenge to get in and out of, and if you're a large person, or over 60, I'd say, don't even try to get in and out of it.  Braking and acceleration are great.  Love the exhaust sound as your driving.  Beware, it's an attention getter!

Just ordered the Turbo kit from Force Fed to bring the hp to 275 from 190.  Does it need it?  Not really...it's just more fun to be had.  Car handles stock better than most prepared gt3 cars.

Hard top is easy to remove and very light since the car only weighs about 1900 pounds which is less than a Mazda Miata. Soft top can be removed in a matter of seconds and rolled up to fit in the trunk. There's enough room in the trunk for enough stuff for a weekend trip if you go alone.

As I learn to exploit it's performance more, it shows me it has more to give.  So far I have not found the bottom of this tall glass of fast and agile!

The car has been a joy to drive and its handling and braking rival that of any sports car at any price.  I can't count the number of times people have approached me with questions about the car and how much they liked it.

This car weighs 25% less than a Mazda Miata, and maneuvers precisely.  The steering car is very communicative, through its steering, ride, and pedals.  Because of its light weight and low center of gravity it sticks to the road like glue.  The engine isn't too powerful, but it is reliable with Toyota's 1.8L VVTi engine.

In a straight line there are faster cars but nothing handles and connects you to the road like the Elise. It's a true drivers car. This was not intended or designed to be an everyday grocery hauler.
