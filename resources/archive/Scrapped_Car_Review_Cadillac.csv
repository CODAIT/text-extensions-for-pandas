0, on 11/07/17 07:56 AM (PST),James Landi ,2007 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),An incomparable  luxury roadster," It's hard for me not to take second, third and fourth looks at my Infra-red 2007 XLR when it's parked. It looks like no other car-- unique from every angle-- a true work of automotive art that was hand built by G.M in their Corvette plant.  This is a sports car that will provide you with the finest,  most quiet, and most comfortable ride on virtually every road surface.  Driven sensibly, it will give you 25 miles to a gallon of gas.  For its time, the electronics were top of the line, but alas, it does not have blue tooth or an audio input into the sound system.  My wife and I selected to purchase ""On _Star and activate the XM.  Aside from having a failsafe navigation system in the car with the cd map, the On Star provides you with audio directions through the Boise sound system  Additionally, each month you receive a mechanical report on the state of your car's many systems--- so you are confident about the car's operation.  The used car values for XLR are relatively steep,  but if you find one with low mileage that has had the benefit of a mature driver you'll be very please with the purchase.  It's the most fun you'll ever have in a car!",5
1, on 04/26/08 11:33 AM (PDT),John Cutsey ,2007 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Awsome Machine," As stated in my review above it has been the most exciting car that I have ever drove. I have had BMW's, Mercedes sl500 amg package, Jaquar XJR supercharged and nothing compares to not only the exciting drive, but all the looks you get from every age group 8 and 10 year olds through 75 to 85 year olds.",5

I have had absolutely no problems at all. The quality is outstanding. The power and responsiveness are awesome. A very drive-able vehicle whether in city/freeway traffic or on long weekend excursions. A great machine to drive! ,5

5, on 10/17/06 14:06 PM (PDT),AL ,2007 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Love It," I just wanted something different than my BMW convertible that I have driven since 1977.  I love this car.  It is a thrilling experience to drive.  No, it does not handle like my BMW but it is a nice change.  I will get snow tires and hope that it will take me safely in the winter months ahead. I call it ""My Batmobile"" it reminds me of Batman's car.  It is a beautiful change for me and my husband.  If you are looking for an automobile with fuel economy--this is not the one for you.  All and all I just love it.",4.75

7, on 10/09/06 11:34 AM (PDT),Bob K ,2007 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Much Better Than Expected," Finally, a car that is as good or better than a Mercedes. The XLR-V is a gentleman's sports car.  It flies and handles great. At the club we get positive nods at the door, people are really impressed after a ride.",5

9, on 12/06/17 12:24 PM (PST),MJL ,2009 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Claasic Cadillac Sports Car," The car is pretty advanced for being 9 years old.  Nav and entertainment are just fine.  No USB.  It's the Corvette in a tuxedo!  It has 30,000 miles with no issues thus far.",5
10, on 05/11/09 21:53 PM (PDT),Scott Leyva ,2009 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),I love my XLR-V," We traded our 1995 red XJS convertible after 14 years.  We knew nothing about the XLR, but were smitten once we drove it.  It gets just as many if not more looks and compliments!",4.625
11, on 10/18/08 17:30 PM (PDT),Richard Spratt ,2008 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Fun beyond belief!!," So far this car has been a dream to own. It is incredibly responsive and handles like a jag roadster but better. I have had it on two road trips and is an absolute joy to drive as well as  ride ride as a passenger. While it has a six speed ""automatic transmission"", my only regret is that I do wish it was a manual transmission.  My wife will take it out and put it through its paces and she would not want it to be a manual transmission.One other minor thing is that it does not have a factory installed connection to plug my I-Pod into the sound system. I would recommend this car to anyone!",4.875
12, on 04/21/08 15:08 PM (PDT),ANBEY ,2008 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),XLR-V," I tend to drive a car hard.  This beauty can take it. The curves and laps disappear while admiring glances stand back and peer. I can't take this car out without some one having something glowing to say about it.  It is a real looker.  From LA to San Francisco the ride was smooth and easy. I arrived fresh as a daisy and ready to party at the wedding I was attending.  Waking up to a flat tire  bummed me out, until I realized it could drive 300 miles on the run-flats it came with. So I went to breakfast as planned . Later with the assistance of On-star  I casually sought out  a tire repair store. Goodyear did the trick, and I was on my way.  The joys and goodies are too many to name.",4.875
13, on 03/14/08 10:48 AM (PDT),sp ,2008 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),"So far, so awesome"," I've driven a lot of different high end and sports cars, so when it came time to step it up to the 6-figure market, I had a lot to choose from. I chose the xlr-v for the styling, the acceleration, the hard top, the fact that all the options are included at base price (unlike the M6 or the SL550) and that it had a much more attractive and distinctive exterior body style than most cars in its class. I have driven this car almost every day (despite having 4 other cars at home to choose from), and I have yet to be disappointed.  This car is fast, comfy, technologically sophisticated, and it's a head-turner.",4.625
14, on 06/04/18 11:55 AM (PDT),bruce4ahome ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),The most spectular car I have owned," I have had 4 Corvette's before this car. When I was looking for something new and fun, Of course I looked at the C6 Vette's but I liked the interior and exterior color combos they both offered. I prefer this color of the infared and Shale color combo over any the Corvette had to offer. Plus this car rides great. With it's weight distribution of 50/50, I have not broken the rear end loose once driving the Ca. Sierra roads. Just a wonderful car. Very much a hear turner everywhere I go.",5

16, on 07/31/17 11:24 AM (PDT),Paddy ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Brutis, I've had a few performance parts put on my car and it really makes me smile when I put my foot into it. Dynoede at 465 HP to the ground.,5
17, on 12/23/06 11:29 AM (PST),Old Sarge ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Great Sleeper," I traded a 2005 Honda S2000 for this car -  WOW! This is a car that I never believed that an US car company would build, let alone Cadillac.  Its handling is up there with the top line BMW and Mercedes. Its gas mileage is 20-22 mpg.  This is a very nice ride.",5
18, on 12/16/06 02:41 AM (PST),david ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Davy's Baby SLR - VVroooom," This is the fastest car I have ever had. It drives extremely smoothly and has great power with a bit of a whine like I have heard on newer airplanes. It drives great, however, I am not a high tech guy and this car is high tech. It take a lot of effort to ot to learn to appreciate everything. It comes with a pre-packaged cell phone and OnStar, which is very cool. This car is sharp.  I love the power and am surprised that I haven't been pulled over yet.  The high tech features make it attractive to others that haven't seen the digital info projected like 3D over the steering wheel at the front of the car. The radio blares and for a sports car.  It has a very smooth ride.",4.75
19, on 11/28/06 13:47 PM (PST),Samuel ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Truly Grace," Owning and driving this vehicle has been a dream come true.  It has performance, handling, comfort and style. I constantly receive compliments on it. Cadillac has done a fine job with this vehicle. My Son can say, ""This is my father's Cadillac.'  Smile, and have a blessed day.",5
20, on 11/25/06 18:31 PM (PST),STEPHEN HOLM ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Almost Perfect," I have owned several head turning cars and motor cycles, but this beats them all.  From old ladies to young men and kids, people have chased me through parking lots and tried to flag me down on the street, just to get a look and learn more about it.  They are usually shocked to find out that it is a Cadillac.  Yes, this happens to the point it that it is a problem.  Aside from that, it is great fun to drive.  The acceleration and handling are so very nice, yet the car is so refined. It is simply a refined ""wildcar"". It has an amazingly fantastic aftermarket sound (meaning the engine).  The great sound system is stock.",4.875

22, on 05/18/06 09:10 AM (PDT),John Winant ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),GM's Secret Head Turner," I bought the XLR-V because I wanted something new and different. The car had a beautiful look. I've had it for almost two years and I love it. People walk up to me and tell me that my car is outstanding. I've had no problems with this car, only one minor recall for programing. I would recomend the XLR very highly.",4.875
23, on 04/30/06 07:35 AM (PDT),Go Man ,2006 Cadillac XLR-V Convertible 2dr Convertible (4.4L 8cyl S/C 6A),Love the XLR-V, The performance and ride are excellent.  You won't be disappointed.  This car deliviers on its promise.,4.625
24, on 06/01/18 16:38 PM (PDT),Alfredo ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),electrical nightmare, 9500 in electrical problems before I sold it. CUE system is horrible( replaced twice) and so are all the sensors that don't work. Its too bad I really enjoyed driving the car.,2
25, on 05/03/18 16:13 PM (PDT),David H. in the Valley of the Sun. ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Five years old and not a darned thing wrong yet!," Bought it used with 18,000 miles (lease return) three years ago. It now has 55,000+ miles on it.  So far this car has been absolutely perfect. The interior is still flawless. I had a softer taller and fatter high-end set of Michelin tires installed on the stock 17"" rims and it glides so much smoother now than the original tires on it.  It doesn't get the highest fuel economy but then again it's not a Prius... this baby flies.  My guess is that the mileage is affected from me getting into the 272 HP turbo charged power plant.  Everyone who has driven this car says it drives like a sports car (not a Cadillac Sedan).  What more can you ask for... Cadillac Styling with ample performance and decent fuel mileage.  I'll probably keep it for a long time.  By the way, the CUE entertainment system will drive you batty at first. But eventually you'll get it figured out. I suggest you use the controls in the steering wheel as much as possible. Otherwise you'll find that you can get distracted fiddling with them.  My only complaint is the CUE system and the cramped back seat.",5
26, on 04/30/18 13:25 PM (PDT),Adam S ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),You don't know what you are missing.," Before owning the ATS, I had two BMWs (both bought new,) a 2002 325i and a 2005 Z4.  When I traded in my 325i in 2013, didn't want another BMW, but I did want a rear wheel drive car that would give me a ride similar to the BMW.  Well, truth be told,  when compared to my 325 and the newer BMW 3-series cars, I found the ATS' steering, road holding capabilities, road comfort, dashboard panel and interior to be superior.  This car took turns without leaning, and considering its great suspension, it rarely felt ""jittery"" on regular roads.  It's 2L turbo was quick enough for me.  However, I must say that although the BMW's turbo engine and transmission were smoother, the ATS was still a more enjoyable car to toss around.  The car's touch screen infotainment system got a lot of bad raps, but I didn't have any problems with it.  Nonetheless, it does appear that over the years, the negative reviews of the infotainment system seems to have had precedent over the car's excellent road performance and has undeservedly decreased the car's resale value.  Good new for those who are looking at the ATS (but bad for me when I will sell the car in another 2-3 years).  My overall recommendation to anyone interested in this car is not to waste any time and just buy it.  You'll have a great car at a very great price.",5
27, on 04/29/18 19:48 PM (PDT),Joseph DiFrancesco  ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),My favorite car I have ever owned!," First of all, I really do think this is my favorite car that I have ever owned. It has a few quirks, but overall it is an incredible car! It is so fun to drive and so luxurious, can’t find anything comparable for a comparable price. ",4
28, on 10/12/17 16:13 PM (PDT),Greg Meyer ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Not as great as you might think," I have only 38k miles. My camshaft sensor went out in July of 2017, it took the shop two days to replace it and they never called me to say that they needed to keep my car another day. The techs at Putnam Cadillac don't like to talk to customers so they don't call them to inform them of pending repairs. A month after it was in the shop my Cue touch screen started dying and in two weeks was dead. I told them the Cue screen was dead when I dropped the car off yesterday. Today they finally called me after I called them for info. They said the Cue screen was dead, I said I knew that and had told them that yesterday. What's happening with it? The rep, Leo Yi, said he has the parts but he can't do anything until he speaks to his warranty administrator and she does not get in until tomorrow. Does that mean that every warranty job at Putnam Cadillac in Burlingame has to wait for this administrator to confirm the work can be done? Every job in the place must be backed up!                   The ATS is a fast car. The transmission is very slow to shift even in sport mode. The 3rd to 4th gear shift takes forever and often slips. This is common with most ATS's. It is Very small inside. If you are taller than 5'10"", don't buy one. You will have a hard time getting into it. The very tiny trunk is only big enough for a gym bag or two. The CUE touchscreen system is terrible. Due to that particular issue, I cannot recommend this car. The touchscreen works sometimes and fails sometimes. You cannot turn on the A/C without the touchscreen. If you look at the Cadillac forums, you will see the frozen or dead Cue Touchscreen is a very very common problem.  Why they are not recalling the cars is beyond me. Consumer Reports needs to look into it.  It is nice looking car inside and out. Good paint. It handles well. But the poor touchscreen, poor dealer service, and getting in and out of the car without banging my head are reasons I would never own another.",3
29, on 03/08/17 12:21 PM (PST),Kris ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Issues with ATS  Local GM service excellent," I have owned my 2013 Cadillac ATS less than two months, yet have had a couple of issues with the car.  With that being said,  I have never received better service than my local GM service department has shown me.   The history of the car was a one owner (3 year lease) 32,000 miles.  The day I purchased the car and drove it home I smelled burning oil.   Noticed the next day there was oil on my garage floor.  I took to a GM service center, and they found the positive crankcase vent tube broken, replaced broken parts and installed two valves, yet after this was done there was oil dripping onto my garage floor.   Took to another GM service department closer to my home and they found oil leaking from the lower oil pan.  They resealed the oil pan and fixed the oil issue.  Two weeks later the car started shuttering when I accelerated between 25 to 40 miles per hour.  Took to my local GM service center, diagnosed issue as a torque converter chatter.   The service center replaced the torque converter.  The technician found a coolant leak while this work was being done and replaced the hose leaking.   All the work was covered under the existing bumper to bumper warranty.  My local GM dealership was awesome.  Their entire service department is a class act.  They went above and beyond to fix the issues with my car.**Update 6 months later....  No other issues with the car.  The work (repair and replacements) the local GM dealership completed on my car fixed all issues.  It's a fun car to drive, I have lots of compliments on this car.",4
30, on 01/23/17 06:43 AM (PST),shannon bentley ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),"Awesome, Sporty Ride!!"," This is a true diamond in the rough sport sedan.  Driving a $51k car that I bought for the price of a new Honda Civic.  I drove Lexus IS-250's and  BMW 3 series and this was way more enjoyable to drive.  Interior space is tight for backseat passengers but the driver and front passenger have loads of room (I'm 6'5"" 250 lbs).  The CUE system is easily figured out and the My Cadillac app works great for starting car from my desk and downloading routes for upcoming trips.  Overall I am very impressed with my new baby.",4
31, on 12/28/16 20:14 PM (PST),Carol Pinion ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Eye catching styling," The ATS is a pleasure to drive. It handles well and is responsive. The interior is comfortable.  The exterior design is very eye catching and I've received compliments on the car. It has a good audio system with Boise sound. I'm very pleased with this car and would purchase another in the future.*Still love my car 5 years after purchase. As I walk to my car in a parking lot, I still get the pride of ownership feeling. Still get compliments from people as I drive it out in the public. The styling has not diminished with time. Would buy another ATS as its a beautiful car and very dependable.",5
32, on 11/09/16 15:57 PM (PST),Deborah K G ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),I love it!," My car is exactly as advertised. Its got great styling, its super comfortable, and I feel safe while driving.",4
33, on 10/06/16 08:30 AM (PDT),Little old lady ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Dream Car or Nightmare?," I purchased this car in 2014 and thought my dreams had come true.  Beautiful car. Very classy. Sporty.  What a nightmare it has become.  CUE system SUCKS!  The CUE is frozen on the homepage and will cost $2K to repair.  Not covered under warranty.  Several recalls including rear defogger, transmission issues, etc. Of course there is no recall on the CUE.  Interior falling apart. Plastic parts just pop off. I'm collecting them for next owner. Driver seatbelt gets stuck.  The audio is horrible while using the phone via Bluetooth.  I'd rather hold my phone and drive.  Navigation is only available through OnStar and limited at that. Climate controls have a mind of their own.  While only using the AC, the heater will intermittently come on; even in 100 degree temperatures outside.  Needs frequent front-end alignments and I'm a careful driver (don't run over potholes).  I will NEVER buy another Cadillac.  Please save yourself LOTS of money and aggravation and ""steer clear"" of this one.",1

35, on 03/30/16 07:54 AM (PDT),Steve M. ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 6A),This thing is a blast to drive," The ATS is really a fun to drive car. With the 321 hp  V6 it has plenty of power and with the trans in manual mode you can really wind it up through the gears. Handling is great, it really holds the road. I don't know why it is that GM puts summer only tires on vehicles  it sells in the north east. I had to replace them not long after I got it with all season, an extra expense. The one thing that I don't like about the car is the touch screen controls. You can't work the radio or climate controls by feel, you have to take your eyes off the road to make sure you hit the touch screen just right and sometimes that isn't easy. Over all I like the car and am enjoying it but I would say that it is not anything for a little old lady or anyone wanting a real cushy ride.",4
36, on 03/12/16 13:56 PM (PST),Jaime H ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Great entry luxury sedan," I am definitely on board with the Cadillac brand after this purchase. I have had the car for almost four months and loving every second of it. This car handles surprising well, even in rain I dont have to change the way I drive. Interior is great for the price tag. I can't say anything about the cue system, as mine does not have it, but I just connect my iPod to the USB port and leave it. So getting the touchscreen didn't appeal to me. The 2.0t engine is great. Having almost no turbo lag is great for hooning around backstreets. Transmission sometimes gets confused on when to shift when pushing the car hard, but manual shift gets rid of that. If your in the market for a4s or BMW 3 series but are slightly to expensive,this car used is a great choice and beats out the europeans cars if you ask me.",5

38, on 11/05/15 09:18 AM (PST),Elaine Mico ,2013 Cadillac ATS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),The American Standard of Luxury not here.," I leased a 2013 Cadillac ATS 4 door Sedan turbo, The car has been nothing but problems from the start.We are talking about the American standard for luxury vehicles, obviously this car is not.I am not going to completely trash the car because it does have some good points such as the handling, acceleration,interior looks as well as an appealing exterior, definitely a great looking vehicle.But the CUE system is inoperable while driving for fear of getting too distracted or frustrated and getting into an accident. The radio is useless it's always acquiring the HD signal so it sounds terrible, every once in a while it loses all the pre-set stations.I had front end problems since the begining of my lease, the car is in the shop every few months for different problems, already had about 7 recalls, There is absolutely no pleasure in driving this car.As I write this it is in the shop for noise vibrations on engine and rear. They called me and told me that there were loose screws on engine/door as far as the back vibration is concerned they said that all 4 rims are bent due to the potholes on roads. Now this definitely doesn't sound right, I can understand one rim possibly getting bent/damaged but not all four of them this leads me to believe that there is an apparent design/structural fault or that the materials used are too weak to support the weight of the vehicle. I have owned/leased well over 15 different vehicles during my life and never had a problem where I was told that the rims were bent/damaged.This ATS has been nothing but headaches since we got it and I must say that the dealership has been no help.When I last contacted the owner of the dealership he told me that I should call Cadillac/GMC directly and complain to them so let me get this straight you buy the car and after that they are done with you so now when you have a complaint or problem you have to contact the manufacturer yourself. What is the point in buying from a dealership when they are not there to help you, we may as well be allowed to buy directly from the manufacturer since ultimately they are the ones that you have to deal with.Lastly I must say that my experience with this vehicle has been nothing but frustrating and overall unpleasant, what is the point of having a car that you have absolutely no joy or pleasure in driving. I would be willing to possibly understand having so many problems if the car was used but for a brand new car it does not appear to be reasonable and at this point the car only has 27,000 miles practically still pretty new.It’s 2018 and my review of the ats still stands.I have since leased a 2016 srx no problems, now leasing 2018 xt5 no problem.",1

I paid 25K and I love the car. I always put in 92+ octane and have never gotten less than 25 mpg (miles driven/gallons pumped at empty- not cue's take on the same). The handling of this car is as car&driver and all other magazines have stated - Second to none in it's class. You feel connected to the road in a car that isn't a bloated overweight numb steering overpriced import. The trans does need work however, but in sport mode I have only minor complaints. I also have had zero problems since I bought it, and I now have 20K miles. Bottom line - If you're looking for a GREAT chassis, with sweet steering feel and acceleration take a test drive. I cross tested Audi A4, 3 series all the usual and the caddy fit my needs and likes much better than the others.",4

Around 10k miles performance was awful 0-60 in about 15 seconds and I kept taking it back and finally they decided to replace the turbo at 15k miles. Still has the same problem but also shift rough and has a hesitation issue no one at the dealer can replicate. I currently own 5 GM vehicles but it maybe time to thin out my stable or at least dump GM. The dealership has been downright rude and awful and 800 Cadillac service is joke.

The equivalent German or Japanese cars cost significantly more. We're talking 20-30% more!At first I wanted to use my new gem sparingly but the more I drive it the more I find myself making excuses to go for a spin.Don't buy this car without the full CUE. Pony up and you won't regret it. Don't believe anyone who says CUE is unusable. I have had zero trouble.Update: 4 years and 40,000+ miles later and I still love the car. If I had to do it again I would go for the V6. I miss the torque. The car has still been stone cold reliable and Cadillac service is stellar. There have been minor weird issues like a dead remote/key battery, all quickly fixed for free by Cadillac. My only remaining curiosity will be the long term reliability. With 4 years 50,000 miles maintenance included and 10 year 100,000 mile power train warranty it might be a long time before you see that update!And yes, I'm dying to upgrade to the ATS-V or CTS-V.",5

To be honest, the good deal drove me to the dealer to try the car. I leased it for about $140/mo cheaper than BMW, Mercedes, Audi.I have driven BMW, Mercedes, Audi as well. This ATS really can compete with its sisters. 2.0T engine is amazing, powerful although little noisy when Turbo kicks in. I tried my friend's Audi A5 but ATS was faster in acceleration. Handling is stellar ! Braking is great, better than BMW and Audi due to Brembo brand. Check 60-0 mph braking on YouTube. I think it was 99 feets vs 101 feet for BMW, Mercedes, Audi.Interiorly, I agree with others, it is small. Rear seat barely for 2 adults, and Trunk is much smaller than my previous Honda Civic. For me isn't an issue and I am slim, use the car for commuting only, rarely people get intro rear seat. Small trunk doesn't bother me, I have a SUV.Great finish, wood trims, leather all over. But the touch part of the console is awkward. Physical buttons are more appropriate while driving.Gear: for some reason manual downshifting is restrained. You need to pull hard to overcome the unexpected resistance. Upshifting is smooth. I don't understand why Cadillac does that.  Headlight is good, but the high beam light is poor. Don't thing it will lighten the road like BMW and Mercedes.Overall, the performance is outstanding.

I also own a Porsche 911 and this is the only sedan I've ever driven that actually compares ok.  I also think the exterior look is fantastic - clean, timeless but also interesting.However, I dislike just about everything else about this car.  CUE is horrendous.  It is unintuitive and talks too much when in voice prompt mode.  My wife's Audi blows away the Cadillac's interface.  While the 2.0ilter engine has reasonable power, you have to overcome both turbo lag and a slow transmission (mine has the 6 speed auto) in order to get good performance.  Even then, it sounds pretty bad - a bit like an overworked and muffled lawnmower.  If you ignore the sound and run the car in manual mode then it's fine, but who wants to do that.These two things are irksome enough that I decided to sell the car.  Resale is absolutely horrible.  This is partially due to the fact that the car was overpriced in the first place.  I knew that going in but I wanted to buy American.  Poor resale doubles the pain.If you want to buy the car anyway, get the V6, make sure it has the new 8 speed auto, and make sure you get a hefty discount on this overpriced car.Overall, I would not recommend this car.",3

If you think a Crown Victoria is a good car, the ATS is not the car for you.  On the other hand if you think a BMW 3 series is a good car, test drive an ATS, you will be surprised.  The ATS is a complete departure from the ""livingroom recliner on wheels"" approach of days gone by for Cadillac.  Its a drivers car cut from the cloth of European sports sedans.  (Think Audi A4, BMW 3 series) That means crisp handling, quick accelleration, relatively small size and a firm ride.  If you think these things are desirable, it's hard to beat an ATS, but if you want a numb isolated ride and don't care about handling, then please, buy something else.  For perspective,  I traded my wonderful BMW 5 series for the ATS and in most ways, the ATS is as good or better.I've not driven the base 2.5 engine.  My ATS has the 3.6 V6 and for comparisson I have spent a few days driving the 2.0T and both perform similarly in terms of brute power... the 3.6 sounds more pleasant to me but both engines deliver lots of power.  If driven in traffic, the cars don't feel real fast because the throttle is easy to modulate in stop and go traffic... but if you stomp on it, you will see 60MPH in between 5 and 6 seconds.  If you enjoy driving fast on twisty roads, it doesn't get a lot better than the ATS for four seats.  Definitely not Crown Victoria like.For more perspective, I'm in my 50's, 5'8 and fit fine in the front and back seats comfortably.  The up optioned seats are terrific even if 6 footers aren't going to be happy in the back seat, but they aren't going to be happy in the back of an A4 or 3 series either.  I have read some reviews on line about the ATS and draw the conclusion that some ATS buyers had no idea what they were buying.  They would be happier with an early 90's Crown Victoria.  That's fine, but you have to come to terms with what the car is and what it's intended to do.  The alternatives to my ATS are the Mercedes C250, Audi A4, and BMW 328.  If you think an alternative to the ATS is a Toyota Avalon, you should consider something else.  As for me, I love my ATS.",5

Most likely the worst feature for me. Look at the passenger room, sit in the back seat. It was very uncomfortable with four adults. The max load, passenger and cargo is only just over 800 lbs. The cab is small and noisy. Open the moonroof in either configuration and it's very noisy.  There is nothing that sets this Cadillac apart from any other vehicle. The Luxury model is sub par to the foreign cars standard models and almost twice the price. The 2.0 claims to get good mileage, I am only getting just under 20 mpg. There is nothing 'Cadillac' about my ATS.  I've had mine for two months and have less than 800 miles. I'd rather drive my 2006 Ford Ranger than the ATS, and I do. If you are in the market for a small sedan, look else where.",1
76, on 12/08/15 22:13 PM (PST),Harold ,2015 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Fun to drive," We leased the ATS because of its great looks but was pleasantly surprised by the excellent ride and handling. I would say the ATS actually drives better than a 3 series BMW. We do not regret leasing this fun to drive car. Only complaint is the rear seat is not designed for large adults and difficult to enter and exit but once you get in it is comfortable enough for moderate trips. Highly recommend. Update 06/20/16: We now have 14,000 miles and the ATS is still better than expected!",4

The only thing she did not like was the touch display on the cue display which does not have knobs. The ride is very comfortable and not noisy as said in the other review. Yes it is the Cadillac version of a sports car but having owned a 2012 Camaro R/S  this is like driving a BMW Series 3.

84, on 10/04/17 09:46 AM (PDT),Jay ,2014 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A),Where to begin....," So i got this car after driving a 97 camry for 10+ years. I loved it so much but after awhile it was time to let her go. i always loved the grill and back of caddys and i had hit a point in my career where i could afford it so i went after it. Initially I LOVED IT. It was fast, stylish and beautiful in inside. Once i figured out you could manually shift, i completely lost it. The love affair didnt last long though. So first, and i dont know why this is the case, but the check engine light is attached to the coolant level. The first time it came on, i almost cried. I had heard that cadillac maintenace is CRAZY so i had prepared for the worst. After getting the code pulled i relaxed. this happened about 6-10 more times so either the ATS inhales coolant, or i had a leak. Second, its small as hell on the inside. Im 6 feet even and it was impossible for anybody to fit in the backseat behind me. Not the biggest problem, it just gives me a reason to not carpool. Now to the biggest issue....THE CUE SYSTEM IS TRASH. It ALWAYS lost connectivity with the bluetooth, then the touch screen just flat out stopped working. Upon doing research, its a common problem. I did love the secret compartment however. For this to be a ""luxury"" car, i felt they couldve did a better job with that. Last but not least, its depreciation rate is ridicoulous. Its worth about 1/3 of what i paid for it. Never again. to wrap this up, its a fun drive, real smooth, responsive, fast, quick and gas milage is great. Thats where my praise for it stops. dont buy, lease",3
85, on 10/29/16 22:12 PM (PDT),Jon ,2014 Cadillac ATS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Initially it was great but it's still American," Do not buy this car new, it is worth nothing after 2 years. 2 years old, 39k miles and it's worth 14k? 50% depreciation in two years with a warranty! This car was great when it was new, but after 39k miles the build quality begins to show. I've had multiple repairs on the interior. Suspension is creaking, whistling noise from the wheels. Lots of road noise. Unusable Bluetooth phone over 30 mph. Thought this car was a great value compared to BMW and Mercedes, it isn't. You are not winning. This is a chevy cruise with a Cadillac badge and more powerful engine. The transmission is garbage, and I could never average more than 22.7 mpg. Terrible from a 4 cylinder. I traded it in for an Infiniti Q50, got the same payment and tons of technology. Not to mention 300hp V6 that gets better mpg. I could not be happier to get rid of this car. It's beautiful but a piece of junk. I gave America a chance again and was again disappointed. The technology you get and then build quality from the Japanese luxury cars is crazy when you compare prices. Don't be tricked into thinking this car is a good deal.",3

Called Cadillac up and put in a claim and they have stated that because the dealer says it's fine they can't do anything...so basically I'm stuck with a 50k POS.

In the 14k miles and year and a half of ownership of this vehicle there have numerous quality issues with the car (see list below).  Seems GM spent most of the development money on Chassis Tuning on the ATS and let everything else slip.  Others seem to have more luck than I have, but should you really have to get lucky to get one of the ""good"" ones when purchasing a new vehicle?

91, on 01/23/16 09:32 AM (PST),Asiafish ,2014 Cadillac ATS Sedan Performance 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Leftover 2014 a ragingg bargain," This is my first Cadillac after over a decade driving Mercedes-Benz C class.  I drive on average 40,000 miles per year and typically buy a new car every other year (leasing is too expensive for that many miles).  Compared to my last Mercedes (2012 C250 Sport) the ATS is more powerful, better handling and has better seats, at least in front.  With the amount of miles I drive, a comfortable drivers seat is the first thing I look at, and the ATS seat is the best I've had yet with the possible exception of the 2005 C230 Sport sedan, which wasn't as adjustable, but was perhaps a slight bit better shaped, especially at the headrest.  <P>The seat is extremely firm and very well bolstered.  It also has an extendable thi support that really makes the difference (I extend mine outward one detent (it has three).  The side bolsters and lumbar are inflatable and a lot smoother and better shaped than those in more recent C Class seats, though the 2005 again was just as good or better, though non adjustable for the side bolsters.<P>Ride matches the seats, very firm, but compliant.  I prefer a stiff ride so long as it isn't punishing, and Cadillac has about the best balance in this car of anything I've ever owned.  Recent Mercedes C Class is a bit smoother, but the ATS has sharper handling and steering.<P>Brakes are outstanding, with Brembo by Cadillac branded brakes up front and smaller disc brakes in the rear.  I took a very twisty mountain road Thursday night and drove quite aggressively, but the brakes never faded, never squealed and always scrubbed off speed with serious authority.  These brakes are far better than anything on any car I've ever owned, and equal to those on my friend's Porsche Cayman.  <P>The interior styling is just beautiful.  It has many traditional Cadillac styling cues with the slender vertical tail lights especially appealing, but everything is tidy, compact and modern.  This is a Cadillac, but a youthful, enthusiast Cadillac.  I love the way this car looks inside and out.<P>The CUE system is perhaps my only complaint.  This system is totally touch-screen based which is very nice, pretty and functional, so long as the car is parked or you are in the passenger seat.  It is awkward to use while driving, but fortunately most functions can be accessed by the steering wheel controls and the phone's mute button also works to mute the stereo.  I liked the Comand System in the Mercedes better, but once you spend a bit of time and learn the steering wheel controls and voice activated access the system is less annoying, though still not ideal.  I would much prefer old fashioned knobs and buttons, but it isn't a deal breaker.<P>The instruments are okay, nothing incredible.  There is a three-section LCD at the bottom that is extremely useful, with each of the three sections configurable for anything from trip computer to navigation, fuel economy or diagnostics.  The only real complaint I have is that the tachometer is pushed to the far left, and in aggressive driving can be obscured by the steering wheel or drivers hands.  This would be a bigger problem in a manual transmission car, but on my automatic it isn't too bad.<P>The back seat is small, quite a bit tighter than my last C Class.  I'm 5'9"" and like to sit a bit further back than normal for my height when driving.  I can still fit in the backseat behind my driving position, but foot and knee room is minimal.  I could ride back there for an hour or three, but a longer trip wouldn't be comfortable.  The backseat itself is terrific though, with great lower back and thigh support and the same firm padding as the front seats.<P>The interior is also very well trimmed in very nice leather, thick carpeting and real metal (aluminum in my car), wood or carbon fiber.  Panel gaps are even and everything feels very well put together.  The window sticker advertises a hand cut and sewn interior, and I believe it, with quality at least equal to my last 2012 Mercedes and better than the 2009 or 2005 that I owned previously, or my wife's Lexus for that matter.<P>Fuel economy is a bit disappointing so far.  I've put just over 1,000 miles on the car in the week I've owned it and my last long drive (270 miles) returned 27 MPG.  It was mostly highway driving at 80 to 85 MPH, but the C250 would return 30MPG on that same drive.  Maybe it I'll improve as the car breaks in.  City driving so far gives me just under 20MPG, where the C250 woud give 23.  This car has only a 6 speed automatic compared to Mercedes' 7 speed, plus the car has a good 70 more horsepower, so I can't complain.<P>It's early days yet with the ATS, but so far, I'm impressed.<P>***UPDATE 18 months and 46,000 miles***My mileage is far lower than usual for this much time, which is on account of the car spending a lot of time with the dealer.  Currently in Lemon Law case.",3

107, on 06/14/17 20:24 PM (PDT),Clark ,2016 Cadillac ATS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),An overlooked gem of a car," 2016 Cadillac ATS 2.0 turbo luxury AWD trim is a great handling car. As many others have mentioned already, the vehicle is slick, drives extremely well, handles confidently, and overall a great driving car. When the sport mode is selected, the wheel and suspension gets noticeably tightened and gear changes at higher RPMs to allow for a quicker acceleration, which all makes it a very nice sporty experience. One feature I do not like is that the luxury trim does not have the HID lights (higher trims do have it). Halogen lights does the job, but it is nowhere near the brightness of HID. Backseat is cramped, but for small to normal sized people, it isn't uncomfortable. If ATS makes HID standard and add a couple more inches to the backseat legroom, in my mind, it would clearly beat BMW 3 series. Until then, it is so close, yet so far from the 3 series benchmark. At the same time, when I'm in the car by myself driving in sport mode on the highway, these couple of minor inconveniences are an afterthought. At 272 hp and 295 lb-sqft, the 2.0 turbo is the real steal among the trim offerings in my opinion. If you are looking for an entry level luxury sport sedan, I highly recommend you test drive the ATS 2.0 turbo and test out the acceleration and handling. You won't be disappointed.Update: After 19k miles, the car is still great. No issues. Runs and handles excellent. Still loving the nimbleness, acceleration and instant power.",5

New the car had a loose connector in the driverside door. Within twenty four hours the cruise control quite working and the dealer can't get the correct part. After a couple months it started working. The Continental Procontact SSR run flat tires are noisy and hard riding.  Cadillac & Continental  refused to replace them. Rear tire alignment was off and dealer didn't mention when rotating tires. Had to replace tires at 24,00 miles due to broken belt, replaced with Bridgestone Driveguard Tires. What an improvement with driving comfort. The way tires and rims are designed, it's easy to scratch rims on curbs. If you use Apple Carplay with the iPhone navigation or OnStar navigation the radio wont play. Dealer isn't very helpful with assisting. No one to turn to. Don't recommend Apple carplay. Heater don't seem to provide heat consistently when needed.. Controls are dangerous to use and drive. CUE system is as dangerous as texting. Had trouble with drivers side window lowering enough to open door. Took Cadillac dealer four tries to fix, but when cold still won""t lower enough. works ok during warm temperature. Told dealer what I felt why, but he won't listen. For some odd reason transmission slips in low gear it's self when it shouldn't. Plastic cover on back of drivers seat fell off twice, Had to pop it back on, Cue screen went static, but had backup diagram showing driving forward.  Back up camera isn't clear on moist evenings. not sure if exhaust cause problem. Cadillac problem. Had same issue on Cadillac XT% loaner, but not as bad. Camera gets dirty easy, especially when raining.  Car value depreciated over $27,000, in less than two years. due to dissatisfaction I was going to trade in, but own more on car than it's worth. Even do I put a $10,000. down payment on. Had this car back to the dealer more than any car I've owned in 40 years.

The price was greatly discounted on the ATS base model so I decided to purchase it rather than a Chevy Malibu. If the Chevy Malibu was rear wheel drive, I would have purchased one of those.

The car is best on a long trip when comfort and smooth highway handling count the most.  My biggest problems have been with faulty sensors -- just about all of them to include:  oil pressure, engine temp, airbag, steering, tire pressure etc.  The actual components were NOT at fault.  In every case it was the sensor.   The other problem I had (which seems to be common among owners) is the power window motor failing.     The electronic switches and displays are chintzy.   Anyway, the motor is great.  Uses about 1 quart per 1,600 miles.  All that said, it is a fun car to drive on a trip.  It depreciated quickly -- so I would shy away from buying a new one in the future.Update on 7/6/2016:  Still have the Caddie and enjoy driving it, especially on road trips.  Unfortunately, the latest ""service engine"" light came on and provided some ugly results:  ""replace torque converter clutch (TCC) solenoid.""  This is an expensive repair where the a transmission shop has to remove the transmission to replace parts.  Uggh.  In searching this repair among other Caddie owners, I am not alone.   Many, many owners have reported the same thing.  The car has just under 100K miles, has been well maintained etc.  GM knows about the recurring problems and made little/no changes to address specific and expensive problems in subsequent model years (see my original comments above).  No love here for this company -- sorry.  I will avoid buying a caddie in the future.",4

I've had it custom made with power folding mirrors, a power rear sunshade, adaptive cruise control, xenon headlamps with intellibeam, and adaptive remote start. This luxury liner cost me near $72,000, but it was worth every cent.  It drives great and filters out the bumps on the New York City streets.

Even though I have only had it for 2 months, I have taken it on several trips out of town.  The city mileage could use some help.  The only complaint I have is with the poor design of the seatbelts.  I am a short person (5'5"") and I find that the seatbelt hits me across the neck.  It is not adjustable, as it comes out of the top side of the seats.  They work fine for my husband, but he is 6'4"".  In other cars we have owned, you had a slide feature to raise or lower the seatbelt.  I have raised my seat, but that is not enough to help.

The back of my seat periodically folds back to a horizontal position without my desiring it to do so.  This is my 5th Caddy and, by far, it is the worst I ever owned.  The driver's seat belt root is too far in the midline so that when you want to strap yourself in you find that your back is laying on the belt and you have to twist yourself to get it.

The whine becomes imperceptible after a while. After more than 12,000 miles, I have not experienced any problems. The ride is supremely quiet, and the seats are comfortable, although a bit on the firm side (I prefer the seats in my previous Lincoln Mark 8).

It don't get no better!  George Jones, Pasty Cline, Conway Twitty, and Ray Price sound even better when I am cruising in that old car.  The car is mobile art.  An object of beauty and grace.

The paint is flaking off of the radio and climate controls.  It's the first thing I see when I get in the car and I cannot believe it.  As much as I love Cadillac, GM went belly up for a reason.  FWD doesn't make sense for this car.  Too much weight up front and the turning radius is bigger than a cul-de-sac.  The car actually feels downsized to me.  Not nearly as much room as my 1993 Fleetwood Brougham and certainly nothing like my 1995 Buick Roadmaster Estate Wagon.  I hate to see these cars disappear.

241, on 07/24/15 05:31 AM (PDT),Dave Edwards ,2004 Cadillac DeVille Sedan 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),RICH MAN'S CAR FOR WORKING CLASS MONEY!," The reality of these fine cars, is that the market has not been kind to them. But that is a good thing for a guy like me, who is on a budget, and wants a nice, classy car.  My 2004 Deville Base cost $35,000.00 + new in '04, but in March, 2015- with 107k on the odometer,  it cost me $4,000.00 out the door of the dealer, with all taxes and fees, and smog paid. I have since fixed all the things that were known issues at purchase. I put on new General Altimax RT tires, new cross drilled and vented rotors and ceramic pads all around, and a new heater blower motor. Buying all the parts on Ebay- NEW for about half the price of a local auto parts store... and my costs are at about $5,200.00  YES, I then had a driver's door window regulator failure!  EBAY- NEW AC Delco Motor, 61.50, and regulator- 30.99 Labor- 75 bucks.  The REAL reason these regulators fail, is because GM used nylon/ plastic guide wheels. If they were made of aluminum, there would have been far less problems. If you encounter regulator failures BUY ON EBAY. I've heard that dealers can charge as much as 500 bucks to replace one. After seeing my mechanic do the job, I know I could do it myself. $168 is quite reasonable, I'd say. A note- the dealer I bought from, was DRIVING this car from Reno, to Tahoe daily.... because he dug it that much.Now, it's my turn.This car, is by far, the most classically 'handsome' Cadillac of the last 30 years, in my opinion. It handles like a sloth. I don't like that so much, as I drove high performance cars all my life. That said-  the great angry song of the Northstar V-8 when you 'get on it' is a joy to hear! Mileage so far has been as 'bad' as 18.0 city, and as good as 23+ highway. Haven't taken it on a long highway trip yet. It is about the same as my Nissan Pathfinder. HEY!  I bought a Cadillac, not a friggin' hippie Prius! I'm a very big man- 6'-2"" and large framed. This is the most comfortable, roomy car I've ever owned. I'm also a bass player. My whole rig, two small speaker cabinets, two bass guitars and stands, a seat, and an amp head fit in the trunk, no problem.I drove this car from Reno to Elko, a four hour trip, both ways, if you do over 80 mph. I did. got 23 mpg., and felt like  I was gliding over the road.  I now have 117k on it.  The driver's side window regulator just failed again! These are just poorly designed units. and apparently, the aftermarket ones are, too.. unless it's something else. I ordered a new regulator. 30 bucks. The motor sounds like it's still working. Left rear door window and locks are inoperative. All the motors and module work fine. It is a short in the harness somewhere. Makes no sense, as the rear doors hardly ever get used. It doesn't affect me, I never need to unlock (I can still do it manually) or roll down that window.  I still love the car. A really nice ride.Almost two years owning this nice car, and the drivers window regulator failed again. This is a known issue with these on this model.  use that door anyway. The other issue is I had to replace the oil pressure switch. I mentioned above-  took this car to Elko, Nevada, from Reno, about a year ago, four hours there... and then back home to Reno a week later. Much of that trip is a 75 mph. speed limit. The car actually achieved 23 mpg. And that, is at 80+ mph! The comfort level has remained as it was when I got it, big, roomy, quiet, and very pleasant to drive. These cars are still very reasonable to purchase and own/ maintain. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another 2004+ model if the need arose.  The city mileage varies, according to trip length, and my driving style. Observed is lower than my time of purchase... It is mainly used in the city right now- showing 16.9. Still a nice ride.",5

So not alot of people wanted this car because it doesnt get the best gas mileage. All I have owned is cadillacs, I love them. They don't hold there value well but you can pick them up at a good price if you really look around. I paid $7,000 total for mine with taxes. at the time its high book value was  $11,500. The car does have a little over 100,000 miles but you can't tell by looking at it. For a big car that weighs alot this car will get up and fly, the ride is of course very comfortable.

This is one of the prettiest cars out there - much nicer than the LS430 (and half the price used).  Only the Benz S can compare. Extremely quiet and comfortable, with a silky-smooth ride.  Powerful engine delivers smooth acceleration; transmission shifts without jerks (no hunting like the Lexus or Avalon).  Bose stereo is just the best.  Mileage on the highway is 29.5, while city depends on whether it's warmed up: 16 cold for short trips, 18 warm.  Daytime headlights were annoying - had to remove fuse to disable.  Nav has helped a lot in strange towns. Occasional whine from a DC-DC in dash. Use the heated/cooled seats a lot. Pearl paint is tops!",4.875

This is a great car in all areas. The northstar is a terrific engine. For a large car it handles well. I love all the gadgets it has. Heated and cooled seats.

In the short time I've owned it, I've found it to be comfortable, fun to drive and surprisingly economical.  I average 29 mpg highway (around 18 city).  The NorthStar V8 & trans are smooth and quite.  While I'm not sure I would have paid $40k + for this car four years ago, the poor re-sale value puts it in a class by itself for a used car!

Excessive consumption can also be related to piston rings being stuck due to ""babying"" the engine.  One relatively easy solution is to find a clear stretch of road, place the car in second gear and accelerate quickly up to ~ 70 mph, then coast down to 40 mph (no braking!).  Do this 3 -4 times.  It will help keep the piston rings floating free and seated against the cylinder walls, reducing oil consumption.  Dealers and knowledgeable mechanics can also perform a chemical cleaning.",3.75

At 100,000 the selonoid transmission started to go bad. And the oh so dreaded sensor modules always tend to fail on all cadillacs at some point which costs between $500-$800. Other than all of that.

564, on 10/06/15 12:40 PM (PDT),SnoopDeville ,1999 Cadillac DeVille Sedan 4dr Sedan,Could have really been great," Good: 1. It was pretty fast for such a big car (Used to laugh at civic SI's) 2. Got pretty good MPG at 23MPG all around and over 30MPG on the highway if you kept your foot out of it3. The bench seats are awesome 4. Enough room to fit all your friends in the back seat.. (And it they pissed you off, they could all fit in the trunk on the way back) 5. It gives you a very protected safe feeling 6. Hitting huge pot-holes feels like running over gravel Now.. Why it got such a bad number of stars.. 1. I bought the car used; it had 68K miles on it. 2. The car started to have over heating issues.. I replaced the radiator with a triple core aluminum dragster radiator off of a chevy dragster. The Thermostat didn't circulate the coolant until it was too late, which at 236 degree's for the system to start to circulate is what caused the issues with the head gaskets on these cars. Pulling the Thermostat and buying one made for a different engine (shortstar) and using that one with a bypass on the two 26K CFM fans cured the overheating issues. (NOTE: you can't do the head-gaskets on the 98-02 Northstar, since the head is structural and the engine will warp when you pull the heads.. Entire engine must be replaced) 3. When it rained the tail lights didn't work 4. The alarm would randomly go off. 5. Replaced the power window motors with other Cadillac ones, Twice, before using Toyota Camry one's modified to work in the caddy frames. 6. Dealership wanted to charge me 150.00 for Windshield washer blades.. (Are they high?) 7. Exhaust rotted off the bottom of the car (Stainless isn't a choice on a 40+K dollar car?) (No matter though some Super40 flowmasters and two 3-1/2in chrome tips sounded great) 8. quality of the interior materials are made from cheaper plastics than rubber maid garbage cans. 9. car had electrical issues, and eventually randomly caught fire. (Ironically after the fire department put it out, all it took was some new ignition wires and it started right back up. ) Verdict: These cars can be fantastic cars for people who have some automotive repair skills, they are also fantastic cars for people who live in area's where there isn't heavy traffic. If you live in the middle of mid-town Manhattan, look for a Fleetwood, which while these look alike the fleetwood LT1 is a much better engine. If you however are stuck on one of these for whatever reason.. Keep an open eye for coolant leaks, oil leaks, transmission slips, and mostly overheating. Have the person start and run the car, wait for the coolant fans to kick in before you buy one. Most of these cars are marketed at needing a ""head gasket"" however, you can't replace the head gasket on the 98-00 Northstar, the head is a structural part, and pulling it will warp the block, which will result in leaking head gaskets as well as other issues. If you find one without the over heating issue, replace the thermostat with a lower temp thermostat immediately, and replace the coolant fan switch with a manual, or adjustable one, choosing to kick on the fans at a much cooler temp (201 vs 236). Doing this will enable you to have a car that will get you around at a very low price.",1

Purchased a low miles (35K) 2007 3.6L sedan based partially on my local mechanic stating that the 3.6L engine was 'bullet proof.'  I purchased from a Cadillac dealer (Val Ward in Ft Meyers FL) in 2012.  It was an attractive car that rode extremely well with decent acceleration and very good handling and braking.  Checked all the blocks by checking reviews, car fax, prepurchase check with independent mechanic.  Within months I started having problems.  First the ABS started going off (intermittently), making braking horrendous and dangerous.  Then noticed the engine started eating oil.  There was no (blue) smoke from the exhaust, but my mechanic suspected the emissions system (CAT, etc) was absorbing the oil leaking out prior to the bypass.  [Note - I should have cut my losses and sold this thing at that point, but the wife loved the car & the Mech thought it wouldn't get any worse.]  Later the check engine light came on.  Code said it was a Cam sensor - which was replaced (not cheap).  The light later came back.  Here's where it gets bad -- in year 5 of ownership at 100,000 miles the engine essentially went.  (All kinds of noises that was most likely timing chains / guides and perhaps other bad items from the crank case.  Keep in mind this car was driven easy by a female and I believe the first owner was elderly.)  Replacement REMAN engine is over $5K installed and rebuilding the existing engine with duel Cams is about the same.  Trade in value without major problems is currently extremely low around $3,000 thanks to Cadillac flooding the market with these vehicles.  My Mech (who sold his SRX with the same engine) said that Cadillac knew about these engine problems and has done nothing about it other than quietly fixing the problem in a later model year.  He also believed fairly early that Val Ward knew there was a problem with this vehicle before selling it.  Careful sleeping with this pretty babe.",1

Two major options are the 17"" wheel sport package, which by the way is the only wheel package that you can get with the navigation system and the 3.6 luxury package.

We test drove a BMW 3 when we purchased, the 3 is fine but we use this car for family road trips and the back seat and cargo space on the 3 were a joke.

677, on 01/02/17 07:00 AM (PST),Brian mayer ,2013 Cadillac CTS Sedan Performance 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),This car is the definition of fun.," This car competes well with the German counterparts, especially in the dollar amount it cost.  You get a lot for the money.  The tech in it is great, the car is quiet, the seats are comfortable, and it travels well with the wife and I, and our two kids.  The fit and finish are top notch.  All of these were a plus because what I was really looking for was a car that handled well and could be a lot of fun.  I have the performance edition and it comes with the 3.6 engine and the FE2 suspension.  The engine provides plenty of power, but straight line speed is not what makes this car a stand out.  After all, a lot of cars have decent 0 to 60mph times.  It's the superb steering, suspension and brakes.  Last summer I really got a chance to push it to the limits by keeping up with an Audi TT on the curvy back roads of Wisconsin.  I finally slowed down when it started raining ( I did have my wife and one of my kids in the car with me).  As for reliability, in the time I've had it, it has only needed to be repaired once.  That was for a leaky seal around the sunroof.  If you want a fun sedan, if you want a family sedan, try this car.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.From here on is an update to my original review.  The car continues to be reliable.  The all wheel drive has been spectacular in these Iowa winters.  It is still a blast to drive.  I just wish the roads where I live were as fun as the roads in Wisconsin.  I've had to replace the tires and it was a little spendy.  But when I bought a sports sedan, I knew things wouldn't be cheap like on my wife's little Hyundai.  I stick with my original assessment:  If you want a fun family sports sedan, the CTS won't disappoint.From here is another update as of Jan 2018.  The car is still fun.  Last fall I was again driving in Wisconsin.  I picked a very curvy road for the route.  It was awesome taking those 25 and 30 mph curves at 55 and 60 mph.  The same goes for cloverleaf off ramps.  Those recommended safe speeds are routinely surpassed.  Of course, such fun has a price.  I have had to replace both rear wheel bearings.  As I stated earlier, I knew that having a sport sedan would result in extra expenses.  I haven't mentioned the Iowa winters yet.  I have AWD on my CTS.  It has not let me down yet.  The suspension that helps keep the car planted in extreme driving also helps it hang on for these winters.  Again, an awesome car.",5

There are so many options that it is better just to drive one than attempt to list them all here. Very nice quality on fit and finish, quiet interior cabin and safety features to numerous to mention. This sedan came with high end Michelin tires and the ride is remarkable. Cornering capabilities are upper end and even the 3.0 liter engine will provide you with exhilaration that is unexpected. You feel like your doing thirty when you doing 80. I find myself constantly making myself back off the accelerator on the interstate. The car feels nimble driving while you have the security of feeling beefy and strong. I did not buy my sedan for status, I bought it for the performance and architecture. If you really want a car you feel good about this is it. You get so much more for your money with CTS than with its competitors, so of which are over rated because of their high cost. I do not want to bash other brands as I want to high light my experience with this car. Completely elated and satisfied would be an understatement.

686, on 04/04/18 00:50 AM (PDT),Steve M ,2015 Cadillac CTS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Jury is still out but I love driving it," This car has had some gremlins in the first month of ownership. MAP sensor tripped at 15k. Crankshaft Position Sensor relearn came on and can only be relearned with a GM tech II  or similar scanner. Then the power steering light comes on and power steering switches to manual. Once you restart the car, it comes back on, but has gone back off again. Of all things, this is concerning and dangerous if it occurs during a turn. Hopefully my mechanic will figure it out and I can get some miles on this beauty. I will update this review. I know...I know... many say they will, but don't. I will however. As far as how it drives: this car moves well for a 2.0 and has all the power I am looking for. gas mileage is decent for a heavier AWD car. It corners great and hugs the road with little body lean. Of course, the suspension is stiffer, so you're not going to get the traditional floating Cadillac ride and will feel more bumps, but it's not bad. The cornering makes up for it. You can even adjust it some. The CUE system is not hard to figure out and so far works well. 2014-15 versions though can't upgrade to Apple Play or Android Auto via the dealership. There are people who claim to do it with a $750 upgrade on Ebay, but I'll just use my phone in a holder. I wish they had the adaptive cruise avail on the Luxury version, but the Lane Assist is nice. So....while it hs many of the bells and whistle, power and styling I want, the main thing is will it be reliable. Reviews don't indicate it will have engine or tranny issues but I'll see what happens with the electrical gremlins before saying this is a great car.",4

The 2.0L Turbo four and six speed is great. I am very happy I missed out on the 8-speed in the '16 up as well as the standard auto stop/start as I have had loaners I didn't love. Sad I had to go aftermarket for a backup camera in the base trim though that is now standard for '16 and newer. My biggest issue is the resale value. It is much like an Audi as the bottom fell out of the value right away and I haven't caught up with my payments yet.

Sitting inside the car is like relaxing on a very nice couch. And couch is a good term for the Cadillac CTS because that's pretty much what it is--a piece of furniture, because its hardly ever moving. Why? Because its constantly breaking down. The motor in this thing seems to have a shelf life of about 150,000 miles. I've owned this car 5 years and have spent THOUSANDS on various, regular repairs. And the ECM repair issue (GOOGLE it) is an epidemic. Literally, every one of these models has a defective ECM. The longer you own the car, the harder it is to replace the ECM, and thus costs to repair are SOARING. last time I checked, an ECM replacement at the dealer cost around $1000. Cadillac is a joke, and this car is a punchline. DO NOT BUY THIS HEAP!! And forget about getting support from Cadillac because those people are incompetent and could care less. Buy a Lexus instead! Get your money's worth and drive something that is reliable!",2

This was a problem because the cooler is located inside the radiator and the antifreeze mixed with the transmission fluid and the transmission had to be cleaned out. Then the right front shock assembly broke. A simple, common part with only $50 labor. Except GM has stopped making parts for this car already. The mechanic couldn't believe it. I finally found the part from a junkyard on the other side of the country. Then another part broke and again, the part could not be found, so my mechanic made something that would work. It is now sitting on my driveway, the transmission finally gave out on it. I haven't listed all of the problems I've had with the car (heater doesn't work after 6 months, leaks every fluid like a sieve, warning lights randomly come on and then turn off, sometimes the window controls don't operate the right window, and on and on). This was a fun car to drive when everything works, but that only adds up to a few days in the last year.

The camshaft and crankshaft position sensors on the engine also both went bad, which made the car stall randomly after running for a while. It was also leaking fluid onto the exhaust manifold which caused a bad burning smell when the heat was on, which was an expensive fix.

The biggest fault the vehicle has would have to be the extensive use of electronics and other devices that are not needed, however if these units fail, the car doesnt run. Anytime anyone touchs a Cadillac for repair, plan on a minimum of $1000. Better yet, pass on the Caddie and buy a normal car. The Cadillac name is not made from quality anymore. ",2.125

My airbag light came on, thermostat shot, both brake lines blew on 2 separate occasions costing me over $100 in tows, had a quote of $875 for all 4 brakes and rotors...the list goes on.

This on a car with less than 100,000 miles on the odometer.  I completely understand why GMC is on the verge of bankruptcy.  And my forgiveness to those who will lose their jobs when they finally close the doors, but if you build junk and offer bad service you don't deserve to be in business.

Cadillac patented all parts for this car right down to the battery. There is a microchip in the battery that ensures  you buy an AC delco.  I had to have some repairs done on the head gasket seals and the power steering had a leak, and the repairs cost over $2,300 just for those two.  If you are thinking about buying a CTS and expect to ""trick"" the car by buying other parts, just look for a different car because I had the battery replaced with a non-AC Delco battery and the car didn't detect the microchip and told OnStar I stole the vehicle and they disabled the car until I replaced it with good old AC Delco.

773, on 03/10/16 13:25 PM (PST),Greg ,2009 Cadillac CTS Sedan 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 6M),Great Car for the Price," I purchased my 2009 CTS in 2013 with 69,000 miles on it at the time.  I drive the car daily (40 miles or so), cross country twice (2000+ miles each time), and frequently on road trips of 200 miles or more.  It handles well on the highway and the ride is smooth.  Cabin is spacious and quiet for an older vehicle, and comfortably seats me and three others.  I have not had any problems with the car mechanically though I frequently ride it hard and put it away wet.  Since it hit 75,000 miles I've been changing the oil every 7,000 miles and using nothing but Valvoline High Mileage Full Synthetic.  The engine is powerful and it will outrun most sedans on the road, both 0-60 and in top speed... believe me, I've done it.  The only electrical issue the car had was in the headlight wiring harness, which had a plug rust out due to a leak in the passenger side headlight.  I attempted replacing the headlights first, believing the issue was in the passenger side light itself, but when both stock and aftermarket replacements (don't ever buy them, they are terrible and not nearly as bright as stock) continued to have issues, I tracked the problem to the harness.  $114.00 was the total cost and it took me about an hour and a half to install (I know very little about this kind of stuff).  Not bad if you ask me.  The car now has 114,556 on it and still runs, shifts, and takes the corners like it did when I first got it.   I live off a pretty windy road, and at night when traffic is non-existent, I enjoy taking the ""20 MPH MAX"" corners at 60+.  This car sticks around the bends and makes me confident enough to sling it back and forth with ease.  Only other change I made was the addition of 4 new tires (cost $800) at 100,000 miles (still had factory rubber up until then) and wiper blades every 2 years or so.  As of right now factory breaks still pass state inspection, as does everything else.  I am very satisfied with how this car drives.  I only wish it had a few more features on it, but it's a base model so I digress.  Total cost in 2013 for the car was $19,995, and I've put probably less than $1500 into it in my time owning it.  I'm happy with that.  One last thing.  Was at a dead stop and got rear ended by a Camry traveling in excess of 40 MPH.

The technology inside the CTS is incredible, with only a few annoying exceptions (see below). I am very happy with this car and look forward to driving it every day.

Couldn't resist the feel and performance, and fun of the 6 speed manual. Had great luck with the cheap old Buick so I figured I'd be safe purchasing another GM product. Purchased the car with 92,000 miles and it looked and drove like new. Had all dealer service records so I thought I'd be safe. Whoops! Pros - The car handles amazing, and is extremely comfortable and fun to drive.Cons - At 105K a grommet on the gear shift went out. Could still get 1st - 6th gears fine, but couldn't put it in reverse. $300 part, but Cadillac was out of them, and nothing aftermarket was available. Had to drive for 2 months with no reverse while waiting for the part. Sortly after purchase I noticed I was having fairly high oil consumption. Never had a car do this so I contacted Cadillac. Told them I was burning 2.5 quarts per 5000 miles. I was told by a mechanic at a Cadillac dealer that ""that's really low consumption for the 3.6 motor"". Now with 170K miles on it, it's using 1.5 - 2 quarts every 1000 miles. At 126K the motor broke a valve. Needed a full valve / upper motor job. $3500! At around 125K the traction control / ABS started acting up. Traction control engages when not needed, and occasionally the ABS engages when stopping, which can be a little scary. Transmission started leaking at about 125K. Too expensive to fix, so just keep adding oil to the MT when I change the oil. At 150K the brake lights quit working. Turns out it's a problem with the wiring loom. Repair was ridiculous so I just re wired it myself direct from the relay to the brake lights. Right catalytic converter now needs to be replaced. Can't get an inexpensive aftermarket cat in California. Going to be dumping this ""beauty"" as a non-op when it's time to get it smogged. Still can't believe that my cheap old Buick ran so well and never had a problem, and the sweet Caddy has literally been a piece of junk.",1

Next it was check engine lights. Then they replaced the gas tank. Next the rear end problem came back. Then came more check engine light problems. And then less intrusive problems started happening like the finish chipping off the most used control knobs, problems with the driver's power seat, problems with the nav system.

Highway driving is a pleasure and city driving great. With the 3.8L engine it has very good pickup, lots of power under the hood. IT has good acceleration on hills.

This car is loaded except for navigation. The interior trim is really American cheesy. Why can these automakers spend a little more to make a little more? You can't play with the Germans and Japanese unless you at least MEET their specs. The dealer did a faux CTS-V package with mesh grille, spoiler, and 18 wheels (from STS) with new Michelins.

The CTS though is a vast improvement that not only looks better, but drives better, and comes with much more standard equipment and even better options. This has been one of the best cars that Cadillac has made so far. I would guess that the CTS is probably one of Cadillac's most successful vehicles since the STS, which also took the same form as the CTS when they were remaking the Sevilles.

I like the car generally, for the reasons I purchased it - stand out design, performance. However, I think it's a pretty average GM car in most ways. It lacks the ""luxury"" amenities you would find in other cars of this price range. For example, you get the same generic key fob as a Chevy Astro with no standard alarm or window roll down feature.  And no locking fuel door? Are you kidding me? And while the performance is good, it's nothing to write home about. Assembly is not that good either.

You will need to get a gasket set and replace the throttle body coupler as well. Cheap but labor intensive. You have to remove the plenum for the gaskets first taking off the Fuel rail etc etc. When you do this you will see were your starter is located. After 100,000 miles or 150, stretching it you will have to replace the double plat plugs. Front is ok to to do , the back by the firewall could be a pain in the butt. While your at it change the coils if you could afford it. You may start to develop oil leaks . Many of the O rings around the sensors dry up and start to leak slightly. The oil filter adapter leaks on these cars, usually needing a new gasket or possible new adapter and gasket. While u have that off, u might as well change the crankshaft sensors located in a tough spot right above the oil filter adapter using new o rings to stop those little oil leaks that are starting at this mileage. Also changing the crankshaft position sensors will assure you that they wont fail and leave you stranded without notice. Piece of mind. The cars are just heavey maintenance. im a mechanic that changes the oil regualrly using good sythetic oil and filter. I use my caddy, but it could be a pain in the u know what. the parts are made realy light of aluminum and these days they are not even madein the states. Many now are made in asian countries and many mechanics will tell you they are having problems with the quality and reliability of the electronic sensors etc. Even a/c delco is stamped made in China etc. Timkin Hub bearings are now made in Korea.

That had to be replaced.  I did not find the dealership to be attentive to my service requests and had to make several trips for the same complaint to be repaired.

Other than local driving, I take long trips with one or no passengers. My CTS's sport suspension, Stabilitrack, traction control, 17"" Wheels, etc. make it handle great on Interstates and secondary roads. The seats allow comfort for 8 - 10 hours behind the wheel.  I drive from Prescott, Arizona to both Southern and Northern California often. I have enjoyed separate drives to: the Canadian Rockies, Branson MO, Durango and Salida CO, Washington, D.C., Roswell NM, and Tombstone, AZ.

Interior lights dim off and on, and the cruise control has been disengaging--it only has 18,000 miles on the car. To this date, it has had three recalls.

I never thought I would own another GM car let alone a Cadillac. However after test driving the CTS plus the great deal, I took a chance. I was thinking about a top end Camry or Ford 500. My CTS was in the same price range but in another class when it comes to performance. The mileage was the biggest surprise. I get between 28 mpg to 31 mpg on the road.  Where we live we have a lot of twisty two lanes road that we have to use, a real pain except when I use the CTS. So far I really love this car. ",4.875

Spending months investigating automotive publications and internet reviews, comparing detailed specification data, and driving many of the cars that met my stringent requirements, only two cars remained out of all the competitors.

The CUE system has been upgraded in 2017 and is fast as a phone or tablet so all of their disparaging comments about it are no longer valid for this year model and subsequent. Some reviewers complain that when they touch the silver trim on the center console nothing happens. It isn't designed to. You have to touch the lighted controls. They should just figure it out and get over it. Some reviewers complain about no volume knob. I typically use the steering wheel controls so that isn't an issue for me. They don't have knobs on their phones and they seem to cope. Very comfortable seats (I don't have the Recaros), very high quality interior, great performance, very high tech in the Premium Luxury model. Great looking car inside and out. I can't think of a single option they could add to this car (well maybe massaging front seats). I bought a 2017 certified pre-owned with 6300 miles on it (Manufacturers Vehicle) and got a 6 year 100,000 mile warranty instead of the standard 4 year 50,000 mile warranty plus the balance of free oil changes for the first 3 years or 36,000 miles from original in service date for $20,000 under new MSRP. I would never buy new (never have). If you buy this car I don't think you will regret it. I guess my only negative comment on it would be they should sell it with all season tires instead of summer tires. I drove this car plus an ATS V and a CTS V and for the money I think this is the best value for the all around package. You only spend a small amount of time having fun with the acceleration compared to hours cruising down the highway. I would rather lean toward the additional comfort (and better looks IMO) of the CTS over the ATS and paying an additional $20-30K for an extra 200 horsepower in the CTS V wasn't worth it to me. I'm satisfied with 420 horsepower.",5

YES I AM!!!," My husband recently bought an '08 Cadillac which surprised me because of the problems we encountered with the '02 we had.  The Cadillac is a very nice looking car, but to drive one is disappointing to me. First of all the sun roof leaks, the car sqeaks horribly. When riding along the engine or the transmission causes the car to jerk. Of course we bought this car used and as they say you get what you pay for, but as working people we cannot afford to throw our money into a car that is already needing repairs done. I got into the car after it rained and the drivers side floor was wet from the sunroof leaking.  How do we manage both, payment and a repair bill. I must admit that I'd always wanted to own a CADILLAC, what a classy looking car  but from the experience we've had, I was honestly upset when my husband brought home another one. O' my lord Cadillac, what's wrong here? Again I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this car!!!!",2
994, on 07/16/16 09:20 AM (PDT),Jordan ,2008 Cadillac CTS Sedan 4dr Sedan w/Direct Injection (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Bang for your buck Queen," I purchased my 2008 Cadillac CTS4 with the 3.6 direct inject V6 engine and most of the bells and whistles. The only options I did not get were navigation and parking pack. I have to start with the power train in this vehicle. The 305hp direct inject V6 is an absolute peach. Smooth, refined, and power all over the band. It's also very quiet, until you push it past 3500rpm, then she starts to growl. It's a great noise for a Luxury V6. The tranny, a 6-speed automatic, is one of the best I've ever used. It's buttery smooth and knows where (what gear) it needs to be. I've never had issues with either. Always follow the factory maintenance guide and requirements for maintenence. The all-wheel drive is great. I live in Buffalo, NY, and if there is one thing people know about Buffalo, is that we get a lot of snow. It puts the power down well. This car is also incredibly comfortable. I owned a small econo-car previously, and my back would cry at trips longer than 45mins... This car, no complaints at all. Very comfortable seats with 10-way adjustability. I'm very big on nice interiors, and the interior of this car sold me on it. It's beautifully laid out, nice use of perforated leather, soft-touch plastics, and wood trim throughout. I got the panoramic moon roof as well, which is beautiful during the night, or soaking up the sun rays on cooler days. There are, however, creaks and rattles all over the cabin. It's a shame, but the car is also cheaper to own than foreign competitors, so it's expected to see corners cut in places. The only other complaint I have about the interior is outward visibility. The pillars are very thick. It hasn't been a huge problem, but noticeable. Exterior is subjective. I was never really a fan of the look, only because my little eyes can see cost-cutting corners shaved. But, it is a sharp looking, handsome design. Modern amenities such as HID headlamps and LED light bars throughout make her a beauty in the night. I also opted for the 18"" polished aluminum wheels and spoiler, which make the car look a little more upscale and aggressive, respectively, in my opinion. Driving the car had been very nice. Smooth over rough roads, good road manners, although the weight does tend to want to drag it around corners sometimes, great steering feel, and plenty of V6 power. 0-60 has been run at 6.3 seconds for me at the track, on 93 premium. Practicality is good, not great(this is a luxury sedan after all). Fuel economy roughly 19-20 mpg combined city/highway. Cost of ownership has been low for luxury levels. Maybe I'm ""lucky"" or maybe I properly maintain my vehicle. Either way, outside of normal maintenance (oil, tires, brakes, etc.) and a few minor electrical faults (all have been very cheap (>$20) fixes or under warranty) this car hasn't caused me a single headache. If you are looking at buying one, DO YOUR HOMEWORK!! look at owner history, service history, car fax reports, etc!! Can't stress this enough. The car is a fantastic car, especially at the price you'll find them. But, it needs to have been properly maintained and taken care of.",5

1000, on 01/24/16 01:39 AM (PST),Virginia Swisher ,2008 Cadillac CTS Sedan 4dr Sedan w/Direct Injection (3.6L 6cyl 6A),another year," 2016, wound up as a decent year for this car.  (2014)10 months ago I bought a Cadillac CTS and what a nightmare.  I needed to replace the 2003 Buick Century with 190,000 miles on it. I've have had several GTM cars in the past and wanted to keep with GM, and this was going to be my birthday splurge. I decided to look for a used car with lower mileage, rather than a new car because I was on a limited budget.  I had looked at Chevy Impalas, Buicks  and found that they were exceeding my budget- so just as a whim- I looked on the internet at Cadillac and was seeing that there were a few that were in the same range as the Impalas. (I did CarFaxes on every car I looked at & before I took it for a test drive - this car came with a positive report- one owner, garage kept, well maintained, & 50,000 miles on it & it looked brand new- nothing to indicate that there would be any problems. ) So in comparing a Cadillac CTS to and  the Impalas- I thought I was getting a higher quality car- not so.  I picked it up at the end of February-        (they gave me a 3 month warranty).  In April, the check engine light came on- it needed a new coil (not cover by the warranty)  $500: in June, the catalytic convertor went (cover by the warranty, otherwise it would have been at least $700).  In July I took it in for an oil change and a check up and was informed it would need new brakes on the rear by the end of November (this would cost at least $400- wound up costing $500).  In September it just passed inspection (mostly because of the brake issue).  The middle of October, I was heading to work and there was the horrible clanking noise coming from the wheels- (no warring), managed to get to the dealership (which has been in business for over 80 years) and left it there. Next day they informed me that the drive shaft had broken (don't know how or why) and it would cost $1500 (they took off $250 from the bill). I informed them I was extremely unhappy and nervous about driving the car and I needed to talk to customer service.  She listed to me politely, said she wanted me to be secure with the car and they would take it in and do a complete check up on the car to make sure everything was working right.  They did that, then one week later I as was coming home from work, I heard this big thump. I got out of the car to check it and saw nothing- got back in the car and it went nowhere- the transmission went on the car.  I called the dealership and they couldn't believe this happened.  They gave me a loaner for the 6 days they had my car. The bill came to $2500, but I paid $750 (they got GM to cover most of it under a warranty).  At This point, I can't trust the car and began to talk to my salesperson, customer service and head of use car sales about  getting me out of this car (between the sales price and repairs, I have spent over $20,000 + the dealership has put in $3000 in repairs). My salesperson showed me another CTS, a year younger than mine w/ less mileage. So he discussed it with the head of use car sales, and he informed me that  they could only give me $10,000 for the car.  I can't afford to throw $10,000 down the drain and then spend an additional $7500 to get into that new car, so I left asking that they keep eye out for something comparable that I could afford.  I became resolved that I would have to keep  this car, so I put the new brakes on  at the beginning of December and hoped for the best.  On the Monday after Christmas, on the way home from work, the car began to vibrate violently as I began to accelerate.   Again I called the dealership and manage to get it there, and then left it.  They called me  the next day and informed me the car was fixed at no charge  (it turned out to be 2 coils & 2 spark plugs needed to be replaced- that would have cost over $700). I have checked into Lemon Laws- my car does not qualify, talked to a  friend who is a lawyer, called Cadillac Corporate to file a complaint- but no help.  I cannot in good conscious sell this car to anyone else without divulging the history of this car & once hearing about it who would buy it from me.  (I do have to say that the dealership has been reasonable about discounting the repairs and I appreciate this, but I have never had so many problems with one car in my life time- and I have purchased older cars in the past. This car has been in the shop 8 times in 10 months- this is not right!!!!! Update- 2017 this year was a mix bag- I noticed my daylight running light was not working- so I checked to have it replaced- $300 to replace a $15 bulb- ridiculous , fortunately I did not have to have the light fixed to pass inspection.  In September I took the car in for and oil change and the shop noticed that a gasket was leaking. Asked how much it would cost to repair it- $15 gasket= $700+ in repairs.  the shop said it didn't have to be repaired immediately and I could put it off until the next oil change.  Fortunately the leak had stopped.",3

Granted, I only have 55,000 miles but so far the car has only been to the dealer twice, under warranty.  Once for a part in the rear suspension and once for the XM radio receiver.  Other than that, the tires were replaced at 50,000 miles and I have changed the oil every 6-7000 miles,  based on the computer, or once per year. Also, being a C6 Z06 Corvette owner, I know what performance is about.  This CTS is a joy to drive and can really get up and go. The only gripe I have with it is an engine vibration ( I believe caused from engine strain from staying in gear too long) at 45 MPH. It could probably be adjusted out, but I can not see spending the money to have it fixed. The only other issue is that the trade in value is so low that I cannot make myself trade it because the car is so enjoyable to drive. Otherwise, I would probably have a new CTS.",4

I do like the looks of the CTS, so I bought a 2008 CTS 4 as a replacement. It had 28,000 mi. I have had many issues with it as well. First, it uses oil, and the oil MUST be checked every 1500 miles or you will be in trouble.

The car has some spots where the wood accents aren't quite large enough to fill the space they are in so there a couple of gaps here and there. Also, the car has a pretty bad paint job for a luxury car. It was like they only put one coat of clear on it.

My wife being the primary driver averages 33 miles a day and is very easy on the vehicle. At 41K the car threw a rod resulting in blown engine.At the advice of GM the car was taken to my local Cadillac for repairs. Although the vehicle only has 41K and the power train warranty is for 100K Covert told me there is nothing they can do as my power train warranty expired 2 days prior to the break down. For $10,000 they will put a new engine in for me.GM continues to tell me the warranty is good up to 100K, but states I failed to properly maintain my vehicle.I purchased the car with 31,217 miles on it and have documentation from dealership showing the oil was changed at 31,107 miles.The attached excerpt from my 2008 Cadillac CTS Manual states you vehicle computer will let you know when to change the engine oil and filter. This is based on engine revolutions and temperature, and not on mileage.It goes on to say that one may not need to change their oil, but once a year. When Cadillac turned over their review to GM the local Service Manager wrote that our vehicle was 6977 miles overdue for an oil change.The dealership went on to tell me that we should have the oil changed every 5k to 6k. Although the manual specifically states mileage is not a determining factor. Also using the 5K to 6K logic and the fact my oil was changed at 31K we would have been due for an oil change at 37K which based on their equation would only be 3K over not the 6977 reported to GM which resulted in denying my claim. Again GM states mileage in not a factor in oil changes. We owned the car just over 8 months and have only put 9,500 miles on the car. The dealership is stating the car ran completely out of oil and it was our fault. How does oil disappear when we have no leaks? This is not possible and Ive spoken to numerous certified mechanics who stated cars do not run out of oil in 9,000 miles unless you have a leak or the car has an oil usage issue which is the fault of the maker. Note this vehicle has 37 recall or service notices some related to power train and cooling systems.

I have found 70 mph yields an engine speed of 2,250 rpm, which is good for less engine wear and highway gas mileage.  The interior is well laid out with the exception of the glove box which is big enough to hold gloves and not much else.",4.375

I took it to Pennsylvania last week and it handles the road beautifully.  I am completely satisfied.  Other perople come to me and ask me about its performance.  Others that own a CTS come and tell me how much they enjoying owning this car.  This is a beautiful car.  I am just thrilled that I have it.  My friends like riding in it too.,5

We test drove a Toyota Avalon, Infiniti, and Ford 500. I went to this Cadillac because of the exterior styling and a little improvement in fuel economy over my Tahoe Z71. We love the performance; I've also owned a Corvette and the ride and handling of the CTS are comparable and in some respects better given that the Vet blows you away with power. But I always wanted a powerful, comfortable family car that had some style and looks like I found it. The interior is roomy enough for the men in my family, all of them over 6 feet and 200+ lbs.

The car is so good looking and gets many stares because of its polarizing looks.  It is suprisingly roomy and comfortable.  As for the performance the V6 has plenty of power, however I now wish that I got it with a 6 speed manual because with the automatic (even with manumatic) it does not feel sporty enough.  The leather is top notch and is softer than new BMWs and Mercedes I have been in.  Cadillac has almost hit a homerun with this car, it only needs richer plastics in the cabin (mainly on the console).

Wanted to update my impressions after 31 months of ownership. We all know that it takes time for things to go wrong or an annoyance to develop. So let let me start with the slight irritations first. First off I did experience the mist odor in the HVAC after 19 months.  Not bad, but annoyed me. Dealer resolved it at the next oil change. Secondly, and I still have to ask the dealer about this, is the fact that when I changed cell phones from a Windows phone to an iPhone I cannot receive text messages anymore? Used have the car read them to me and be able to respond verbally. Have to figure this out. That is it! Otherwise nothing. I get a smile on my face everytime I get behind the wheel. had the opportunity to drive my buddys new Merc AMG recently. Very nice car. But not as responsive or quick as the V Sport. Also drove the CTS V s few days ago. Outrageous car!! Wow! But if you need a daily driver which can go out when it snows (within reason of course) the V Sport is actually better. That it. But one! Not sure why they are not selling? Crazy for the money. The CTS v Sport is, hands down, the best handling sport sedan period. Not BMW, Jag, Lexus.. nothing.  The quality, feel and  finish is excellent.  Drive it!",5
1135, on 09/14/16 23:39 PM (PDT),Ray Anderson ,2014 Cadillac CTS Vsport Premium Vsport Premium 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 8A),One Amazing Sedan," After purchasing a 2016 BMW X3 35i and completely being disappointed in it, this car is complete 180 degrees.   I purchased a used 2014 CTS Vsport premium that just came off a lease.  With under 25K in miles and half the warranty and free maintenance left this car it was a deal from a new one.   I have to say they are a bit pricey new, but there are usually some good incentives out.  With that, I have to say this is an amazing car.   The interior is what a luxury car should be.  Nice materials and everything feels solid and well build.  Seats are comfortable and driving position is just right.  I just don't understand why all the auto critics hate the CUE system.  I think it works just fine.  No system is perfect, but other than the volume control being slow sometimes, everything else works fine.   Handling and acceleration are outstanding.  The car is quick and corners like it is on rails.  Usually good handling comes at the expense of ride quality.   Magnetic ride control has master these two feats.   GM has really knocked it out of park with this car.  It is sleeper.   It gives you all the comfort of a luxury car with the performance of sports car.   This is the perfect balance between the two.  Given the fact I have a bit a lead foot, it is returning 19 MPG on average.  This is not bad.",5
1136, on 02/18/16 13:49 PM (PST),lajollaboy ,2014 Cadillac CTS Vsport Premium Vsport Premium 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Let's get this straight...," Being an avid enthusiast and owner of my '14 Vsport Prem I have read and viewed about every review article and video on the internet.  With some of the reviews, I truly wonder if they are driving the same car I am!  So, for the format of this review, I'm going to pick out those things I commonly read with which I disagree - both good and bad.1.  ""Fit and finish not as good as German competitors -""  This is the one I really don't get at all.  People complain of cheap plastic and the like... I honestly don't know where they are getting this from.  My car is rock solid - from squeeks and rattles to the feel of the controls.  The only thing I've had problems with is that the glove compartment which actually has two latches (!) sometimes only catches one of the latches.  But that's it.  I find my interior design elegant and tasteful and much more progressive than the Germans.2.  ""CUE is terrible.""  Cue is designed to be a highly customizable owner experience which for somebody (like a car journalist) who drives the car for a day (or even a week (or even shares the car with other journalists as part of a long term tester)) may find it frustrating.  But once you do have it set up and understand how to get to things, it's really a very well designed system.   You can get to most of the things you need from the steering wheel and view your changes in the instrument pod (as opposed to the middle screen) which I would much prefer to having to reach for a joystick and look to the middle screen every time.  With that said, despite being able to do most things from the steering wheel, finger prints are still a problem as noted by many, especially if you have a frequent passenger who doesn't like your music (Zoe!!!) and it would be nice to know what the temp controls are set at without having to tap and return on the screen.  3.  ""The touch sensitive buttons are unrepsonsive.""  ... like the slider volume control.  This is just patently not true. The metallic guides for proper finger placement are very useful.  I use these buttons many times a day and have never been frustrated by them.  I am sorry that Cadillac has bent to journalists' pressure to get rid of them.  4.  ""Doesn't have features that a similar model from the German three would have.""  This is laughable.  For every feature the Cadillac doesn't have at a price level, it provides 10 others that the competition doesn't have.5.  ""The interior is tacky.""  Nope.  It's awesome.  Its just not 80's vintage matte black with random dials, buttons and switches all over the place [sarcasm] like typical German cars.      Most of the interior is leather and natural wood.  I mean for God's sake, THE HORN ON MY STEERING WHEEL is made of LEATHER!  I love it!  I wish the display were higher res, though.Now the bad...1.  ""Incredible power train!""  While the car is crazy fast, the engine can feel a little choppy showing its V6-ness through the rev band if you wind it out.  The throttle is WAY too sensitive and the transmission takes a lot of getting used to and even then some of the shifts are a bit abrupt.  You'll get used to it but until then you and your passengers will have some sore necks!  :)2.  ""Incredible ride and handling!""  Oh yes it does!  ... at least after you change the tires from the PZeros that it comes with.  Those things are made of cement!  3  ""Turns a lot of heads.""  Sadly, most people want to see a German luxury car badge.  I think my car looks very cool but I'm surrounded by BMWs and you know those guys aren't too forthcoming with compliments on American cars.All and all, I love my car!  It's fast, comfortable and the styling is so cool (inside and out), it's unbelievable!",5

The CUE system isn't intuitive, and I'd prefer just knobs and a straightforward information management system.It took me about three days to feel like I had the hang of CUE. My car has the upgraded Kona wood interior, which is absolutely beautiful; I don't know that I'd pay for it, however, if not for the $6000 in incentives GM offered ($3000 rebate + $3000 ""conquest"" cash) and dealer's willingness to negotiate.

At low speeds its fast to respond (0-50).  At higher speeds it doesnt feel fast but you will be driving 80mph and not relize it.  Handles excellent although in sharp turns it tends to feel like it slows down to complete a turn.  I have the premium so every luxury is available which i like.  My tall 12 yr old daughter doesnt think tge back is roomy.  Im not sure because ive never been in tge back set.  The front seats are extremely comfortable.  It is a hrad turner on the outside.  I didnt realize that it would get so much attention.  People love this car.  When they see the inside they are in complete aww of tge car.  My true only complaint is the cue system 2.0hmi it lags and is sliw and turns off when you least expect it to do so.  I will get the upgrade of the nav cue system i hear it way better.

The engine performs extremely poorly at those low speeds around 15 mph when it's shifting to the next gear. The car always jumps in shifting gear at the low speed. In acceleration, the gears shift fine with no issues. However, as it gets to about 45 mph, it struggles again where you need to really press on the accelerator again. It also has a rough idle, the touch screen isn't responsive at certain spots, the sensors activate when the car is at a complete stop and no car is moving, the sensors in the car will beep for a minute then stop, and backing up if you're near something and are aware and you lift your leg off the brake, the car with do a shuddering self brake scaring the scrap out of you. Overall, not worth the money.",2

This is the first car where I am glad to have an automatic - an 8 speed silky smooth automatic.  Paired with a peppy V-6 engine that uses regular gas this car is a blast to drive.   Love all he gadgets in the premium trim level. Love the brown interior.  Love the metallic black exterior.  Love the 19 inch wheels.  The handling is awesome.  The CUE system deserves the critiques, but it is workable and after time it becomes second nature.  I have leased 3 cars in a row.  I bought a 2 year old car with plans to run it 10 years.  So far I am very happy with that decision.",5
1147, on 09/26/16 15:07 PM (PDT),Scott in Wesern PA ,2014 Cadillac CTS Sedan Performance 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Germans Let Caddy Catch Up  **UPDATE Mar 2018**," Let's be clear: My Audi A8L, 2009 model was a stellar car. It did everything right and looked damn good doing it. At nearly 110,000 miles, I was faced with two - three garage visits per year @ $1500 a pop... or trade in my Black Beauty. In Feb 2017 Mercedes ran a promotion offering 2016 low-mileage E Class turn-ins for a decent price and a 5 year unlimited mileage warranty so I said what the heck. The E Class is a nice car, but it does not have the superior chassis of the CTS. It is also bland on the inside. The CTS interior looks elegant from any seat in the car. Having just zoomed past 30k, there are ZERO rattles or squeaks...a good sign of build quality. I also tested the BMW 5 series and an Audi A6 just to be sure.... Sorry BMW but I have no idea what you guys are trying to accomplish. Audi's are always awesome, but the dash is a bit on the spartan side. As an added bonus, I just swapped out the Pirelli run-flats with a set of Michelin Pilot Sport AS3+ and the Caddy now has the Magic Carpet ride similar to what the A8 delivered.  It still handles like a dream but feels less twitchy. Go Caddy Go!October 2017 Update: I joined the Cadillac forum where there is a ton of great information. The CTS developed a squeak at very low speeds over minor bumps...the dealer was inspecting the strut and shock components when I looked on the Cadillac forum and it turns out to be the upper and lower control arms. Covered under warranty! They replaced the steering knuckle too, so hopefully I'm good to go for a nice long time. The car continues to impress. One important note about Tour v Sport modes: many cars change their demeanor dramatically when you go from Tour to Sport...the CTS,  NOT SO. I inquired to my mechanic if it really does much and he said Oh, Yes. Putting it in Sport mode makes it go from a lion casually walking through the grass to a lioness hunter crouched and ready to pounce. The moment you change your inputs to be more aggressive, the system immediately reacts accordingly. So I leave it in Sport all the time. You never know when your going to have to blow by Bubba's diesel exhaust-spewing truck or put Granny's Prius in her place.The interior remains rattle and squeak-free. The car fits like a glove. On a recent 300 mile jaunt on mostly hilly Western PA highway roads and keeping within 10mph of the speed limit I returned a highly respectable 26+ MPG. I felt the brakes pulsing a bit on the highway, so I mentioned it to the dealer during the steering knuckle trip and they resurfaced the rotors at no charge! Ahhhhh smooth as silk again.***Mar 2018***  Little niggly things are creeping their way into nirvana as the odometer zooms past 45,000 miles. The sunroof has a weird squeaky-creak. Nav map orientation, which I always use with heading up, likes to re-orient itself to north up. Yesterday the tranny couldn't decide between 2nd or 3rd and shuddered between the gears for a good 5-6 seconds...even the wife said ""what was THAT?""  More worrysome is my dealership got rid of the guy who ran the service department and replaced him with a complete nincompoop. My car threw a pair of codes related to the front suspension, so I called, made an appointment, and told the nincompoop the codes and said WRITE THEM DOWN since I'll be clearing the codes with my OBD-II scanner. Upon arrival at the appointment, it was as if I had never existed prior to that moment in time. I nicely reviewed what we had previously agreed to, and he (in a huff) went to the car with his scanner and came back and said there are no codes to which I replied ""Because I erased them after I told you what they were I am not driving around for a week with the check engine light on"" to which he replied, more huffily, ""Then we'll have to put it on the computer"" No s**t Sherlock. I asked for my keys back and have been looking at used Audi A8's. There are some tremendous deals out there!",4

Lastly, the sound of the exhaust leaves something to be desired...Overall this car is absolutely fantastic.  Handles, drives and feels like a very well put together sporty mid-size luxury and clearly is at level of MB E350 level or BMW 5 series...tested both and CTS beat both out in nearly every level.  This Cadillac ""move"" is only going to get better and I'm excited as I hope I never am interested in a german car again.  If I could buy the new CTS-V it would be mine but the price is Porche 911 Turbo level...yikes.Caddy, well done and worth the buy for anyone considering a mid-size luxury sedan.  Great car and many people are impressed by the car's beauty and style.",4
1151, on 03/31/16 15:08 PM (PDT),JohnnyBos ,2014 Cadillac CTS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan AWD (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 6A),Absolutely love this car," I bought my all-wheel drive CTS last year (2015) - it was a 2014 model year that was still on the lot, so very happy with the deal.  For the past 15 years I drove only German cars, BMW and Volkswagen.  The pros and cons for the CTS:Pros:--It manages the amazing trick of feeling substantial while also being light and agile.  Comparing the aluminum body of this car (including doors and trunk) to a BMW 5-series steel body, you realize how much fat and bloat you're carrying around with the BMW.  It shows up especially in the handling of the CTS... it's an absolute racehorse, and a lean and agile one.  Yet the doors close with a very satisfying ""thud,"" same as you find on the German cars.--Love the exterior design and (almost all) of the interior... it's amazing.  Very sensual and aggressive, sleek.--On the highway, the open road, it handles better than a 5 series BMW.  Great sound dampening, great control.  Just a heck of a car to drive.--Some people complain about the CUE entertainment system, but I actually find it pretty simple to use.  It's a million times easier to use than the old ""I-Drive"" systems on the BMW.--The materials used in the car, the leathers and wood trim, etc., are all top notch.  I was recently inside a BMW M5 - which cost over $100k - and the BMW didn't have anything nicer in terms of interior materials.--On the inside of the driver's door is a round sticker which you won't find on any BMW, Audi, Lexus, or Mercedes sedan - that sticker says ""Made in Michigan, USA"".  And as someone who cares about our country and our workers, that's the ultimate status symbol.  When Detroit makes a killer car, you can feel great about buying it for a lot of reasons, including where it's made.Cons:--The CTS heat seater heats up a little bit slowly and doesn't get the seat very hot, even at max temperature.  The seat heaters on my German cars would burn your tail if you left them on too high / too long.  As someone living in the Midwest I'd prefer a hotter and quicker seat heater.  (The heated steering wheel does heat up quick and hot, however).--I'm not in love with the design of the steering wheel - could be a little simpler and more elegant looking.  But other than that, and a very small Onstar button panel on the ceiling, the rest of the interior is BEAUTIFUL.  It's sleek and tight and very well put together.--I would physical buttons which allow you to adjust direction where the air flows in the ventilation system (to feet, to windshield, etc.).  The CTS has buttons which only appear on the screen if you increase/decrease the volume of air flow.  Or you can go through multiple screens to adjust it.  Same with AC... there's no physical button to press for AC... there are other ways to get AC to come out, which show up on the screen, but I prefer to have a direct physical button for it.--At very, very low speeds... like when the car is just rolling forward of its own power at 3 or 4 mph, without pressing the gas, it feels a little torquey and uneven.  Living in the city, you often end up kind of rolling forward a bit in traffic or a parking lot.  My VW and BMW were more smooth at that super low speed.That's about it... other than that, it's a totally amazing car.  I recommend it highly to all my friends, colleagues, and other people.  It's a fantastic car and is VERY underrated.",5

1183, on 09/15/17 10:16 AM (PDT),Rita Richardson ,2012 Cadillac CTS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan (3.0L 6cyl 6M),Buyer Regrets..  Cadillac should only be leased..," We bought our son a cadillac there 10 years ago..  We took really good care of it with regular oil changes etc   It only had 73,000.    When we got it already had 13,000 so he really only drove it 60,000 and in June the engine quit.  We took it to Banks and they said it would be like $7000 or more to fix it and it wasn't even valued at $7000.   I really felt bad as there was absolutely nothing wrong with this car as far a rust or dents or scratches and the interior was in really great condition.   I can't believe that Cadillac doesn't make a car that can't  go more than 73,000.   I have had an oldsmobile that went to 218,000, a blazer that went to 140,000 and I still have a Hyundai that has 115,000.   These are all just regular cars, I really thought if we got a Cadillac..It was built to last. but I guess I was wrong.Last April 2016..  We bought a 2016 truck and 2012 Cadillac in the same week.  Paid cash.  We paid  $21,000 for the Cadillac and I just took it to a dealer who now says that it is only worth $13,000.  wow an $8000 loss on a car we have had a year and a half. It had 47,000 when we got it and it now has 57,000.   It is in the garage most of the time now as I am afraid to use it to have happen to it what happened to the 2007.We had a Cadillac previous to these to that the head gasket went on as well.I guess I should have done more research on these cars and looked at reviews..  I really regret buying this car...  These cars only meant to be leased I guess so you only have them for 2 years and get rid of them.I will be posting my reviews of these cars on all sites that I can.  It is definately Buyer Beware.  I won't EVER buy another Cadillac..nor will I tell anyone else to do so.Thank you for reading thisRita Richardson",3

1185, on 09/15/15 10:08 AM (PDT),Dylan ,2012 Cadillac CTS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),Stay away! Keep family Away," I bought an 2012 CTS Lux. It was used with 11,000 miles on it by an one owner who upgraded every six months. In May 2014 I had to take it in due to my airbags randomly being deployed while it was parked in my garage. Under warranty Cadillac replaced both driver and passenger airbag and also said the wiring was messed up and they corrected it. November of 2014 the airbag light came on and I took it down to Cadillac (45 minute drive from where I lived. Same dealer that I bought it from) get there and was told they would get right on looking at it because it was a slow day. 4 hours later I get told they couldn't find out what was wrong with the car and just reset the light. April 21, of 2015 my car now has 32,000 miles on it and I'm on vacation visiting family 900 miles away from home. i drove to a friends house to pick her up to go get my oil changed before I headed back home. My car is off and parked. My keys are in my pocket my wallet and cell phone along with a newer MacBook Pro is in my car locked. My cars electronics for the navigation and airbags and everything else catches fire and destories my trunk and everything in the back seat before the fire is able to be put out. My insurance totals the CTS but they get out of paying GAP of 5,000 dollars. Granted I paid a lot more on my car payments then my 500 dollar a month payment. I contact Cadillac and my insurance both because now I'm stuck with a 500 dollar car payment on a car that is now torched. Cadillac want nothing to do with it since no one died and insurance said they don't care and not there job too. We've always bought GM products and now I think we will be sticking with paying higher repair bills with European cars then with American anymore. So if you are serious about buying this car ask yourself is your life or families live worth the risk?",1

The incentives are what got me, the design, the handling, the power...However, ALL of that isn't worth the car for one reason and one reason only. The absolutely complete MESS of navigation and especially the phone system. 1) when you get a call, the number appears on the DASH but the CONNECT button is on the NAV SCREEN and it pops up MAYBE 25% of the time. The audio voice will instruct you to hit a button, but when you do... nothing happens and you will lose calls ALL THE TIME.

Style and Design are the best in class, which I must say is the biggest lure to buy a CTS. Performance is great, has good power and handles better in corners. I am surely disappointed with the drive comfort level, seats itself aren't bad, something about the drivers position and may be the suspension. It gave me a neck ache after a couple hours drive.

1195, on 07/18/17 13:47 PM (PDT),Karl ,2016 Cadillac CTS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),The Cadillac of CTSs," I couldn't be happier with my 2016 CTS.  The car looks fantastic, and aggressive, from every angle -- classic Cadillac.  And the CTS 3.6 AWD has the performance to back up its looks, with tremendous acceleration (0-60 in 5.3 seconds), razor-sharp handling, and confident braking.  The interior is beautifully designed and crafted, including aromatic leather seats, a pleasing and logical dash design, and natural grain wood trim.  I find the driver's seat as comfortable as any I've ever sat in, and was able to achieve the perfect driving position after a few days of fiddling.  I'm also enamored of the 13-speaker Bose Centerpoint sound system, which produces striking musical fidelity; the excellent navigation system; and the extra-large panoramic sunroof.  Between the CTS's cosseting interior and raging performance, I thoroughly enjoy my commute to and from work, particularly on the back roads that I take to avoid traffic.  I also look forward to chauffeuring my son around to his various activities, and would note that there is ample room in the back for child car seats, not to mention tall adults.  As for maintenance (i.e., changing the oil and other fluids and rotating the tires), it's free for four years, and my local Cadillac dealer treats me like a rock star.  I've had zero problems with this car, and highly recommend it.",5
1196, on 06/23/17 14:31 PM (PDT),Greg ,2016 Cadillac CTS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Car is really nice but suspension?," I have 29,000 miles on this car and the engine performance, braking & handling remain excellent except for a couple serious issues.The suspension is still shockingly harsh, especially the front and even in Touring mode. When going over bumps like highway milled to paved surfaces the transition patches/ramps can't be absorbed smoothly. The Pirelli all season P Zero Nero run flats P245/40 R18 93V tires were so harsh they finally became damaged at around 12,000 miles so I switched to Continental run flats and it's noticeably better but still not what I'd like. I don't think the car is meant for run flat tires?The other issue is road/wind noise. Still not quiet enough.Now that I've had it longer I have a few things that are less than desirable.The Bluetooth and Apple Carplay get messed up too often. It usually happens when using Carplay, where it's working and then it stops and I have no connectivity (pairing) to my phone. I have to stop and turn off & restart the car. I'm not sure but maybe it's because I don't wait for the car to go through its sequencing at start? I notice when I don't wait the tilt feature on the side mirrors doesn't work.Rear seat leg room is way too cramped. My 6 & 9 year old granddaughters are touching the front seat backs and it's not acceptable for adults. Trunk space and accessibility is very poor but would have been better if the rear bumper access point was lowered to the trunk floor level and the back seat opening (seats down) was wider. That height difference seriously limits the length of items you can put in and is further limiting by the narrow back seat opening. Now that Cadillac has announced new sedans are coming because the ATS & CTS have poor sales the resale value of these cars which isn't good now will dive further. NG!So unless I see something much better I'll stick with my CTS. I still like the looks and I get many complements on the car.",4

I wanted something that was fun to drive. I got one with a 2.0T engine as it is plenty powerful for my needs. Mine is a base sedan (RWD only!) with upgraded leather seats, panoramic sun roof and park white color as the options. The car has it's quirks, but nothing that you cannot live with. CUE is as good as a touch screen infotainment system gets. Don't believe the negative reviews out there. Use it and find out out yourself. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who wants a fun to drive family sedan that can fit 5 passengers with ease.",4
1199, on 07/26/16 11:50 AM (PDT),Next2pool ,2016 Cadillac CTS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Everything is better than the previous CTS," If you owned a Gen II CTS, this one will be better in every category. The new V6 is very strong and I'm averaging about 26 MPG in all around suburban driving. The interior is very quiet but the road noise from the front is the only complaint I have. There is almost no wind noise. The interior material quality is excellent and the fit and finish is superb. I am disappointed in the autostop performance. When it does activate (when is hard to predict) the engine has an annoying shudder when it stops as well as restarts. I have driven other GM models that are much better. The transmission shifts very well and doesn't seem to have a problem managing 8 gears. Although I like the hard inside cover for the sunroof, the roof itself does not seem to open as far as the previous version and it looks a bit clunky from the outside when open. The Cue system is much faster than before I have no problem with the controls at all. I did expect the Navigation system to have a more colorful display and I can't see how to name a route for future use. The gooseneck trunk hinges seem to be a step backwards from the articulated system of the Gen II model. The front seats are better than before but still not all that great for longer trips. Overall, I am very satisfied by this new CTS.Update 1 year after purchase: I did have a transmission issue that was annoying. After a stop with the auto stop/start active, the transmission would have an abrupt 1-2 shift. It did that since new and i realized that it couldn't be normal. GM replaced the transmission and the problem is gone--it apparently was a manufacturing defect and not a common problem. I replaced the run flat tires with conventional tires and that eliminated the road noise that I was complaining about. The gas mileage is outstanding in all around driving. Overall this is the best car I have had. It is a pleasure to drive.",5

1201, on 07/14/16 09:14 AM (PDT),Danny ,2016 Cadillac CTS Sedan Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Make sure you don't mind the AutoStart feature," The Auto Stop/Start is terrible.  It may not bother everyone (I cannot fathom how people don’t mind this), but it is annoying and distracting every time you stop the car.  The car shakes and jiggles at every stop sign and stop light.  My passengers are incredulous when they’re first taken for a spin.  It is not only annoying, but also distracting.  Your mind goes to it every single time you stop.  You can turn this off every time you start the car, but it is not possible to turn this feature off permanently.Almost all the 2016 Caddys have Auto Stop/Start (I think the XTS is the only one that doesn’t) and they take the fun and relaxation out of driving.  Make sure you thoroughly test drive them before buying.  When test driving, make sure you do some city/urban driving and turn the A/C off (it doesn’t kick in when the A/C is chugging at a decent rate).  Like I said, it won’t bother everyone, but will bother many.  Enough so that GM put out a couple bulletins on the subject.  These are for the ATS and CTS, but I would think it applies to all 2016s with Auto Stop/Start.  Check out #15-NA-033 “Normal Characteristic – Slight Bump, Jerk or Rough Engine Startup [Oct 15, 2015]”.  It says “Condition: some customers may comment that there is a slight bump, jerk or rough engine startup during an AutoStart event”.  Then it says, “Correction: This is a normal condition”.  I guess they said it was unusual, then had to correct it and say it is a normal condition!!!  Directive #16-NA-071: Diagnostic Tips for Stop/Start and Auto Stop Operation [Mar 4, 2016] says, “Condition: Vehicle does not engage in Auto Stop mode and Vehicle automatically restarts during an AutoStop event”.  It goes on to say, “It is imperative that the customer be well informed about the unique features and operational characteristics of their vehicle equipped with Stop/Start.  For the sales team to be fully prepared, they should use the Getting to Know Your Vehicle guide as an outline when presenting the vehicle to the customer”. Cadillac knows this is a terrible and they are not notifying their customers.Other cons: the run-flats are a poor ride; they’re loud and you can feel everything.  The 2016 CTS models don’t come with a spare and instead have run-flats.  The tactile sliders/”buttons” are over-engineered.  Just give me a knob for the radio volume; ditto for the A/C fan speed.  Also, a little more difficult to get out of than previous CTS.Pros:  trunk is larger than previous CTS; nice and roomy.  The panel that comes up in the dash is a cool storage area (and lockable).  Cool feature that lets you program the radio so you are notified when your favorite band is on XM.  Bluetooth with phone is loud and clear.",3
1202, on 06/30/16 11:55 AM (PDT),Robert ,2016 Cadillac CTS Sedan Standard 4dr Sedan (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Glad it's only a Loaner," I received a 2016 CTS base model with 4 cyl as a loaner while my 2013 XTS Luxury is being serviced.  I love the XTS, the most comfortable car I've ever owned, ad thought about downsizing to the CTS Luxury as i like the exterior.   Appearance is great, the interior is basically the same look as my XTS however it is more cramped and the quality is a bit less, but being a downsize from the XTS i was not put off by that.  The ride is horrible!!  It's like driving an old pick up.  You feel every pebble, the engine noise is annoying.  The front seat is very comfortable though, I am 6 ft. so had the seat back almost all the way, making the backseat behind me useless.  Not a big issue for me, but thought i'd point it out.  The biggest problem with this car is the price.  They want more for a CTS and my XTS which is roomy, comfortable and rides like a cloud.",2

The fuel saving feature - where the engine cuts off at a stop - is a pain.  Glad there is an override feature.

As usual still rides the same as 25 years ago.  Noise from tires, exhaust, engine come right through with the stereo set on low, requiring music to be turned up.  Lacks innovation, and technology, poor aero dynamics causing poor mileage.  Very heavy for no obvious reason except they're stuck in 90's.   Mercedes comes out with touch shift, GM will have to copy it.  Lexus are perfectly quiet on the inside, Cadillac has yet to copy.  Just seemed like a poor performance from all angles with little innovation.  I will go with Mercedes or Lexus over this manufacturers offerings.  Priced at 65,000 and told it rides like a Cadillac.  If you want poor quality still from a U.S automaker.  Test drive after driving a lexus or Mercedes and you to will be disappointed in a Cadillac just as I was.  Probably be another 15 years before I give them another chance with such poor planning and innovation.",3

Although the SLK55 is a great car, it just seemed too small for me.  My daughter said ""you look like an elephant riding a peanut"" (referring to the short wheel base and short overall car length).  Mercedes made a big deal out of their hard top retracting in 19 seconds vs. 30 seconds for the Caddy.

With the ground effects the chassis does a nice job sticking you to the road. The slap stick / shifter is pretty cool with the HUD system and the cruise control great. With this system, the XLR matches the speed of the slower car ahead of it until either you switch lanes or the slower car ahead of you speeds up, then your set speed on the cruise control returns to your set speed. How cool is that! The downfall is with the top down ther is very little room in the trunk, no place for those golf clubs to go with the roof down.

My car was one of the first off the line, and had brake squeal with low speed stops.  Cadillac replaced all four rotors with upgrades.  All subsequent cars produced have the same rotors.  Have had one chip in the paint on the retractable roof.  External trunk release was replaced. You do have to tell the carwash guys the trunk is ""powered"" and you don't close it by hand.

For example, when you raise the trunk lid outside in the rain the water drains off the forward lid and into the trunk. This causes a damp, musty odor and wets anything inside.  The electronics on the car are very complicated and the owner's manual is poorly written.  If a passenger who is not familiar with the car is left inside without a fob, they can't get out. This is very dangerous in an emergency!  There is an electrical drain on the battery. When my car not used 2 or 3 days the battery dies.

The XLR's handling is precise and exhilerating. The retractable top is an engineering masterpice and delivers a whisper quiet interrior when up, and a head turning air in the hair thrill when stowed.

These are just the proverbial tip of the iceberg, many other things have gone wrong, but I am getting depressed even more by continuing on.

Looked to check the value of the vehicle and its around 50k in immaculate condition; first issue: truck does not hold its value.  During my time, the Escalade has had its share of issues, to which the dealership was more than happy to resolve since it was under warranty.  However, some of the issues out of the gate were fairly major.  For example, my transmission was changed 1 year into the purchase (never got a full explanation on this one), airbags needed to be serviced, CUE system has been changed twice due to malfunctions like rebooting during use and turning bright green at times, and many, many small issues here and there.  Unfortunately, these repairs were not lemon-able because they were all different, but on the upside I did get a try a wide variety of Cadillac cars through their loaner program.  Other small issues like cabin noise and vibrations were similar to what I experienced in my Chevy Tahoe, except the Tahoe was around 40k and not exactly a premium vehicle.

We have had problems since the first day.  Bad airbags, steering wheel had to be replaced 3 times, steering column replaced, torque converter replaced, front camera replaced.  The MAIN issue is still not fixed after many many many trips to Service. There is a rough idle at any stop.  The engine idle is so rough that the RPM's bar is moving up and down while the car is stopped.  At times it feels like the car is going to shut off.

It's the CUE system. The CUE system is the worst infotainment system ever. Sometimes it won't even come on when you start the car! It can take up to 6 blocks for it to turn on. The response is slow, voice commands can be frustrating and it glitches a lot. I also don't like the sliding things to turn the volume up or turn the AC on. I like knobs. The headlights can be a little too bright and people think your high beams are on. Also the turn signals on the mirrors can be blinding at night. But the tail lights are INCREDIBLE. It lights up the whole street!! The gas mileage is great for an SUV like this. The DVD player in the rear is great too. I love the power fold down seats. Mountain driving is one of the best places to drive it. It flies up the hills and I love the hill decent braking. Overall I expected more when paying $93000 for this beast. When I Kelley Blue Booked it, it said it was worth $70000 and it only has 8300 miles on it. The Escalade is the perfect family hauler, it is safe, cool, and I don't think there is anything on the road like it. We have had four Escalades and they all are great. The reason we keep buying them is because it saved my brothers life in a car accident and the vehicle was totaled. It took one for the team. So if you were looking at a big burly safe SUV, the Escalade is a great choice.",4

At the end of 2014 I purchased a used CPO 2009 Cadillac Escalade with ~53,000 miles. It was fully loaded. THANKFULLY, it has had all repairs still under warranty, However, the warrant expires in a month and I am seriously considering selling the car to avoid costly repairs. Since I have owned it for almost a year the following repairs have been needed: heating and ventilation front driver seat repair, front struts needed replaced, cables to and from battery replaced due to complete electrical system failure while driving, lumbar support driver's seat repair, right driver's side CV boot leak, side cover for moon roof replacement, tire pressure monitoring system constantly going on/off, and now battery draining overnight and auto-up/down on driver side window malfunctioning. The complete electrical failure while driving was the scariest. We experienced a complete electrical system failure while driving twice (i.e. NO POWER STEERING, NO ANTI-LOCK BRAKES, NO INJECTION OF FUEL INTO ENGINE). Thankfully, my wife and I were able to pull the vehicle over before an accident occurred. Cadillac replaced the cables going to and from the car battery which has seemingly remedied the issue. There are tons of forums of this occurring and how the NHTSA has not recalled the car because of this boggles my mind. Overall this car is a prime example of poor mechanical engineering. DO NOT PURCHASE this car if you value reliability or quality craftsmanship. Unfortunately, it was my wife's dream car, but it has been in the shop for more often than not and she has been unable to showcase its most valuable asset: aesthetics. I cannot imagine the cost that we will incur once the CPO warranty expires. For example, the cost to repair the driver's side heated and ventilated seat was just over $1,000. The Cadillac dealership near us charges $150 just to diagnose an issue. I guess this is what you get for a ""luxury"" vehicle. In comparison, I have owned a 2004 Lexus ES330 currently with 130,000 miles and the only maintenance I have performed are oil changes and new tires. I have owned it for 3 years when I purchased it with ~90,000 miles on it. Good luck Cadillac owners. I feel your pain",1

1653, on 02/25/18 04:20 AM (PST),AMZ ,2002 Cadillac Escalade SUV 2WD 4dr SUV (5.3L 8cyl 4A),a 2002 in 2018," A few months back my wife totaled my 2008 Toyota Camry Hybrid.  It was long paid off and I was enjoying not having a car payment.  Unfortunately, while my wife was fine, my Camry wasn't.  She managed to crease a light pole in the snow in the perfect spot to total the car.  We needed another car and shopped hard.  In the end we picked up a 2002 Cadillac Escalade in Diamond White for approximately $7k out the door from a local dealer's ""super saver"" lot.  Now, ordinarily I'd be leery of buying a 16 year old car, but this one had ""old people"" miles on it at 125k from two previous owners and the carfax showed it had been serviced at the local area chevy/cadi dealers it's entire life. We needed a larger SUV due to two children who are not getting any smaller. Our other car is a 2010 CTS Luxury and while I have never been a GM fan I have to say the past few months have impressed me with the build that went into these SUVs.  We actually jumped on the truck so fast that the dealer hadn't gotten it detailed or cleaned after the auction yet.  No obvious leaks on any of the seals but there were a plethora of Starbucks napkins in the center console.  The motor is the iron block LM7 which is the venerable Vortec pushrod V8.  These things are still out there running at well over 200k+ miles and were used in about everything GM made for the better part of a decade and a half I believe.  Parts are still available all over the place.  The transmission in this truck is pretty bulletproof if the fluids are serviced and this year did not have the air suspension so that added complexity/fail point is thankfully missing.  The vehicle appeared to be garage kept and the paint/chrome was still bright.  Handling and ride are straight old school Cadillac with a floaty ride and effortless steering as numb as your lip after a dentist visit. It's like sitting on your living room couch at 65 mph.  Traction control and ABS are fully functional.  One point we did find was the climate control was on the fritz which is likely why the car had been traded in (in December).  The blend actuator was futzy and the dash only blew hot air while the rear A/C froze your neck.  That was at least about a $500 repair due to the need to take out the entire dash, which the dealer performed before we bought it.  I've seen the same part (which is pretty much unchanged in the last couple decades) futz out in considerably newer GMs.  The only other thing I've found is the mirror control switch is dead but that is an easy fix at $20 and a bit of my time.  While the technology has not held up in terms of obsolescence (have not seen a cassette deck in decade plus and the OnStar doesn't work due to the FCC mandated removal of analog cell) the interior materials, components, and build themselves have.  All the body seals needed a drink of silicone but all were functional.  Mileage is not the greatest but the vehicle is getting about 15mpg combined with mixed highway/city driving so, not bad for a truly full size SUV.  I expect, with continued care and maintenance, to be driving it daily when it enters it's second decade.   I have to say, GM got this one right back in the day.",3

The mpg can easily exceed the epa (needs to be dismantled) estimates. The best is 30.7. You will read much by the professional motor media, about the same caliber of journalism as the rest of the media, parroting that the ride is harsh. Utter nonsense. These people are checking with one another to see what the consensus while be. Disregard them. We have purchased a range rover and the Escalade is a nicer vehicle in many regards. The solid rear axle is advantageous for the high tow rating. While the RR has better off road capabilities and is a wonderful vehicle, the Escalade has other attributes to stack up to any large SUV. Cadillac has done a wonderful job with this vehicle. We purchased it over the competition for the third row seat and the retractable running boards. These running boards are far far better than any fixed running board. So, forget the ""professional"" reviews, try it, you will like it.",5

I wanted more room, larger towing capacity, 4WD/AWD, and a nicer interior. After 2000 miles in an ESV 4WD Luxury, a new surprise emerges everyday. It has a beautiful interior, nice fit and finish, tons of electronic safety features and the oft-criticized CUE infotainment system. I am pleased and surprised with the ride quality of the suspension and 22"" wheels.  The sophisticated electronically controlled shock technology may be the reason. I have not found the CUE system overly complicated. There is a lot to learn here, but most of the controls seem logical and useful, if you are patient and read the owner's manual.  The interior's low noise level is impressive as is the standard Bose designed sound system.  A big surprise is the weight of this vehicle of this vehicle compared to its European competitors, ie., the M-B GL series and the large Range Rover. They all weigh in the 5700-6000 lb. range.  Cadillac has used a lot of aluminum and lightweight high strength steel based on my research. I like the ability to run less expensive regular or mid-grade gas, (which is acceptable) although premium is recommended. Mileage so far has been slightly less than the EPA estimates.  So far I have only towed my 6000 lb. boat for about 200 miles. The torque and H.P of this model's drive train seemed unfazed with the task. And the room in the rear cargo area is huge. This is a large vehicle, but it doesn't feel that way from the driver's seat or in its handling prowess. It also has a very tight turning radius. So what is there to not like? Keeping in mind the concept of this vehicle and the reason I bought it, I haven't found much to dislike yet, but I'll keep looking. Most owners that I have talked to, love their vehicles and without hesitation would buy another one.  Enough said!",5

They are big, comfy, quick, safe, smooth, good looking, and spacious. They are a great car!!!!! There is one problem though. It's the chrome on the car. The Magnesium Chloride destroyed it!!!!!!!!

The dealer offered us only $18000!!!!!!  The vehicle had to be worth $25000 or more. I also have an issue with the radio. If you turn the radio knob to the right, the radio channel goes the opposite direction. Same if you turn it to the left. It also freezes and glitches a lot. The quality of materials could be better. The dashboard is plastic and so are the door panels. Overall, I absolutely adore  this car and highly recommend it.",4

NO BRAWN: 7) The Escalade at 403HP is grossly underpowered. I am forced to switch the vehicle into tow-mode, to get higher revs out of each gear, in order for it to perform decently. Unfortunately, when in tow- mode, it down-shifts like a jake-brake!    ",4.625

Everyone that sees this thing loves it. When quickly accelerating the exhaust reminds of the race cars in ""Days of Thunder"". What a sound - almost better than my Vet. When you enter the car at night, the lighting, both inside and out, are unbelievable. Everything about this vehicle exudes luxury.  I have read some complaints about the trans. But, I like the way it works. It tends to quickly go to the next gear. You have to go nearly 80 MPH to get to 2K PRM - an amazing engine. Still, if you're in hurry, you just need to punch it and it takes off.  Like the TV ad says, if the Escalade had a bathroom, I'd live in it.",5

The 2008 seats are hard, do not hold you in position when cornering.  The sun visor is poor.  Previous model had more flexibility.   Headrest ability to bend forward is now seriously lacking.  I happened apparently to be one of the few people that used the disc changer system under random ALL.  Since the addition of the backup camera this feature has been removed.  This last item damed near stopped the purchase.  I now wish that I had purchased a Mercedes GL 550.  Which at this point in time will be my next purchase; and most likely sooner than later.

Exterior style is pretty much the best aspect of the car.  It's classy and has an edge.  The ride is luxury car smooth for the most part.  I don't feel tired most of the time I drive home from a long day at work. Fuel economy is average at best but I expected that.  At $3.10/gal a fill up is $60, which lasts me about a week. Build quality is as good as other luxury cars.  Lots of cheap plastic and panels that do squeak and come off.  It looks good though. Nav system is great.  Seats are comfy.

It has great looks, lots of luxury and features, 403 hp, and an exhaust note from a muscle car. I never thought i would buy and SUV, but the Escalade sold itself. The power and exhaust note surprised me most as it is quick (for and SUV), and sounds great. The handling also really surprised me as it handles like a much smaller car. The only negatives i can fin is the old school tilt only steering wheel, third row seat ( everything about it from room to not power folding), and a light in the rear of the car rattles. The GPS in this car is absolutely fantastic, it is the highlight of an already great interior. Just a great SUV.",4.875

Reliability issues, possible wind noise, gas mileage...and while we liked the GL 320 & 450 the pricing was too good to pass up on the Caddy. Wife loves it. Tons of room inside, great rear-entertainment (unfortunately it blocks rear view mirror. No problems to date though. We love the curb appeal as well.

I totally enjoy the XM radio and panicked when my trial period neared its end (and I was the one who said that I never listened to the radio while driving...yeah right).  OnStar occasionally gets you lost although there is the capability to record the directions. The navigation system is a must. It easily guides you to your destination.  The heated seats are great on a cold winter's day.  I could use a few more inches of leg room for driving though.

I test drove a few SUV's, but most were ruled out by the lack of 7-8 seats, the poor customer service of the dealer, or looks. In the end, the only two contenders were Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade.

Actually had an agreement on an 07 ESV in late 2008 but dealer sold it out from under me.  OK since by that time, I realized the tiny, non-adjustable rear seats were almost deal-breakers anyway.  No, not the third row small, nonadjustable seats - the SECOND row.  My $30k 06 Pilot had more rear legroom and it has seats that move fore and aft, unlike the $70k Escalade.  Cool looking as the Escalade is, the QX56 is more usable and we're getting that.  I'm surprised you mention Land Rover as an option: Land Rovers have the #1 disparity between perceived quality and actual quality - they're bad trucks but great for poseurs!",3.25

We went with the Mercedes R350, but when it was time to change, the styling was a turnoff compared to the GL. So we went with the Gl450. It has a great third row, but the bench seat is a turnoff. So we decided it was time for a new luxury SUV, with captain chairs, leaving us to the Navigator, extremely bold, the QX56, in which the redesign didn't thrill us but was a near choice, or the Escalade. By far the styling is great and overall i am pleased with it. It has AWD, which I need, and is VERY difficult to get in Florida.",4.875

1800, on 03/19/18 06:08 AM (PDT),Roger Lake ,2016 Cadillac Escalade SUV Premium 4dr SUV 4WD (6.2L 8cyl 8A),Worst Car I have ever owned!," Ok we will start with the PRO:  Looks and cargo space.  That’s all.  Now the Con:  First off I want to start off by saying I own a car dealership and have personally owned every type of vehicle their is.  This truck is the worst vehicle by far that I have ever owned.  The engine burns oil at 11k miles. Brought it in to the GM dealer and they hand me a paper stating that it’s acceptable to burn up too a quart of oil between oil changes. 92,000 dollar vehicle and Iam adding oil between oil changes?  The transmission shifts horrible and slams into gear every day I pull out of my garage.  Going up hills the truck loses power and seems to not know what geat to go into.  Also my wife and I smell coolant in the car when you first turn on the ac as if the heater core is leaking.  We paid extra for power running boards and they Stick.  Truck rides ruff and clunky.  It’s a real shame because we sell used Cadillacs on our lot and the older ones were much better.  I feel the quality of a Hyundai or Kia far exceeds the quality of this truck.  I have never went on and reviewed a car or truck in my life as all vehicles have their issues but this truck has so many problems that even though it’s so pretty this truck makes me so angry and Iam so laid back.  I don’t care how much money you have this truck will be your worst financial decision you have ever made in your life if you buy it.  No redeemable features other then size and beauty. I had to go jump start this truck the third day of owing it because the battery was no good.  And I remind you we bought it brand new with no miles.  I don’t have time to go to the dealer every week because of all the problems.  We can’t even drive the truck we’re paying so much money to have.  The dealer wants to give us a Chevy Cruze as a loaner car every time.  We bought this truck because we have a big family.  I end up putting a dealer plate on a Honda Pilot and have my wife drive that.  So basically buy a Honda Pilot to drive when your Cadillac is broken down and in the shop every week.  If I could give this review negative stars I would.  Nothing in my life has disappointment more then this vehicle.  Buy German or Japanese the quality it much better.",1
1801, on 10/08/16 20:12 PM (PDT),S.Alexander ,2016 Cadillac Escalade SUV Standard 4dr SUV 4WD (6.2L 8cyl 8A),Presence like no other SUV!," I owned a previous generation Escalade and the new model is a huge improvement over the old one.  Interior is very luxurious, and looks way better than GLS or Q7.  Old model was Rear or AWD only, and now you can get 4WD, and use it in rear wheel drive mode (or automatic or permanent 4WD) for everyday driving.  No need to use 4WD for summer driving and waste gas.   As a result fuel economy improved substantially, I get 16 mpg in the city and up to 26 mpg highway.  Apple CarPlay adds a nice touch and all electronics and navigation look/work perfectly fine.  My complaints would be lack of a sunroof in the base trim ($76K), and even if you get a model with a sunroof, it's a small one.  Panoramic roof is not available. Magnetic ride is awesome and very smooth, however, once you hit a rough pavement, the ride becomes very jittery. Handling is very confident and acceleration is very good, but, try to change lanes quickly at highway speeds, and you will be quickly reminded that you drive a huge truck. Overall driving feeling is very confident, you won't be bothered by snow, heavy rain or any other nonsense. In the end, I decided to get this car for its unique look and presence.  Park it next to Audi Q7 or MB GLS and see for yourself.  Q7 looks like a station wagon/minivan from the side, and GLS looks very unassuming and small next to the Escalade's huge grill and glowing vertical LED lights.  Euro competition may offer better ride and some technical advances, but Escalade brings such unique and unrivaled presence - it is still the king of SUVs.",4

I love the styling and the technology, but that is about it. Comparing the 2016 Escalade and an 8 year old Navigator, the ride in the Navigator was superior.

I couldn't be more disappointed in the quality of the car this time.  They really cut corners in the interior and it shows  from parts coming unglued to the interior leather peeling.  On the outside of the car the Crome trim on the door popped off and all four doors trim work between the doors had to be replaced. My car had less than 8k miles and they replaced the transmission.  For a vehicle costing almost 100k very disappointed Cadillac. This will be our last.,3

1805, on 05/05/16 20:54 PM (PDT),GM-vs-Euro ,2016 Cadillac Escalade SUV Platinum 4dr SUV 4WD (6.2L 8cyl 8A),Nice but Not Refined compared to Euro SUV," The Escalade is a luxury truck in my opinion; even the huge column gear shifter reminds me of a Chevy Truck.  Despite the plush seats and upscale interior, the ride has many jitters from road bumps, engine drones, and the transmission drones under acceleration. If you have ever owned a truck then you know what I mean.  If you are transitioning from European vehicles you will not like this unrefined beast in many aspects.  Despite the unrefined integration of all its bells and whistles, the Escalade makes a strong presence with its huge size, powerful engine, big LED taillights and headlights.  Maneuvering into a normal parking spot can be a challenge, especially in an indoor garage.  The front, rear, and top down view cameras do help with parking.  I love the feature that vibrates your seat to warn you before you back into an obstacle.   Road handling is its strength. This beast can handle every road condition because it is really a truck.  But riding in a truck with plush seats and interiors still can't trick your senses into believing that you are not in a truck.  The high pressure suspension doesn't have very good rebound damping.   When the suspension jitters are triggered, it resonates throughout the car.  It doesn't give you a muted and dampened ride that you get from an Audi Q7 or Mercedes GL.The GPS and radio has a nice big screen but it is tilted in a strange angle. The buttons are intuitive but again not refined like European or Japanese entertainment systems.  Also, I wished the GPS map has a way of displaying on the large LCD dash display while the car is in motion.  The Escalade only lets you see small arrows and turn instructions on the dash and on the minimalist HUD display.  The audio system has clear sounds, and the interior is quiet enough even when blasting down the freeway at 80mph, as long as the road is smooth and you don't trigger the suspension jitter from poor road conditions.  I also like the air vented and massaging seat.  The lane departure control that vibrates your seat as a warning is a nice touch.  Having owned a Z06 Vette, and now got a chance to experience the Escalade, my complaints about high-end GM products are the same, un-refined interior.  Unless you need the SIZE of the Escalade, an European SUV is much nicer to live with.",4

I never thought I would buy a car off the showroom. My wife and I were just shopping for an upgrade of our current 2010 Denali. We looked at the Escalade, we were swept off our feet and signed the paperwork that night. This vehicle is nothing short of amazing. I never in my wildest dreams thought I would get a back massage while cruising at 75 mph down the interstate.  We are still discovering the latest gadgets and taking it in tomorrow to have upgraded software installed to integrate our phones for easier applications of usage. Another plus, we got an astounding average of 26mpg at 70 mph last weekend on a road trip.  The down side is that the apative cruse control would go offline going down the highway due to an error in the system. That is going to be addressed tomorrow also.

You get looks in it like no other vehicle, probably because I'm 19 years old, but thats besides the point.  If I could give one bit of advice, put a chrome grille on it, that makes it look 5 years newer.  I like the 5.7 Vortec engine a lot.  Its acceleration is great considering the weight of the vehicle. Its 4 wheel drive is also very capable, I have tried it in sand and accelerated like I was on dry road. The Bose radio also impressed me with its volume as well as sound quality.

Oil runs down my arm everytime I change it. I have hauled 20 bags of cement or 25 cement blocks with no set down problems.  This truck has a great suspension. I had to change the front disc rotors, they worpt.  Also, the front suspension rubber bumpers needed replaced. This truck tows a 20' ski boat no problem.  When in 4WD the front end is jumpy.

The running boards were automatic and both motors burned out along with several other smaller items. Overall we spent well over $3000 trying to fix the car (of course the dealer did not help at all as they washed their hands clean- not surprising).

It was to replace my 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis with 156,000 miles---now 163,000.The Cad looks and runs like a brand new car, but the ride is not near as nice as my aging Grand Marquis. Lots of road noise on city streets.Plus, too many buttons to push---very distracting. I would have bought another Mercury, but Ford wrongly decided to not manufacture them any more.  The Mercury does not have as many distracting buttons to push and the ride, both city and highway, are much, much better.Headroom in the Cadillac for the driver's side is poor.  I am 5'11"" and 230 lbs.  I have to move the seat to the maximum down and rear positions, plus relocate the steering wheel to the maximum up position, in order to get in without bumping my head on the door frame.  In my 60 years of driving, I have owned many luxury cars.  This Cad is the worst of them all.  By the way, my wife, much smaller, loves the car, or I would get rid of it immediately.The Cadillac recently developed an oil leak in a cover on the front part of the engine.  The Cad dealer wanted $2,900.00 to repair this mild to moderate leak, stating that the entire engine has to be removed to make the repairs.  Ugh to Cadillac and General Motors.Another distraction is the speedometer display.  When the morning sun is up, you cannot read the dash lights.  And, turning the headlights on to the maximum does not help any.  No more Cadillac's for me.  This is not a car for the un-rich owner.  Driving into the Cadillac Dealer costs an arm and a leg for even the smallest services.  I have traded this Cadillac off for a new KIA Optima.  Not as many buttons to push but the compact KIA handles better and is more comfortable than the ""Luxury"" Cad.  As previously said----no more Cadillac's for me.",2

The first screw, of seven, was over torqued during manufacture and let water into the led housing. You must replace entire unit. About $125.00. I see lots of DTS's with same issue. New one works well. Only other repair was front wheel hub/bearing. Rough winter/potholes in Ohio. A great car, fantastic ride and the last of the big ones. ",4.75

I've owned many domestic and foreign cars and rate this as one of the better vehicles I've owned. The build quality is excellent. The motor performs as it should and has a nice exhaust note under acceleration. The Bridgestone tires leave much to be desired however, there are few choices of Mfg. for tires of this size. The Yokahoma Advan S.4 look like a better option. Torque steer is manageable however if your driving becomes to0 spirited I could see where this could get one into trouble. I would like to see better sway bars on this car I think it would greatly improve its handling even though it is very good for a two ton car. ",4.625

I have read many complaints about the factory tires and after 37,000. miles mine are just fine with regular rotation and correct pressures I believe they will easily reach 60k.

The Performance edition with the larger engine gives a little extra punch, the ride is much better with the enhanced suspension and ride package, takes bumps and railroad tracks with ease. Brakes very well stops on a dime while holding the road. Navagation system combined with onstar is easy to use and very accurate.

The ride was great, fuel economy ok (22 mpg overall in 2600 highway miles and 1600 urban miles), and the XM radio simply fantastic.

I bought a 2006 in anticipation that it would be better, however in my opinion it is worse.  It has very shallow cup holders.  I have spilled several cups of coffee since owning the car due to this issue.  It also is a bit noisy during hard acceleration, but the cruising noise level is fine.  It has some torque steer at highway speed when you floor it because it is front wheel drive, which I find annoying.

With the performance package it handles well for a car of its size and it still rides well.  It has the best suspension for this car - I've driven both styles. The interior is typical Cadillac high quality. The downside of the interior is the cup holders.  They are too shallow  to really really hold cups or bottles, especially during turns or braking. I had issues with the original dealership and Cadillac introduced me to another dealer for any required maintenance or warranty work.  Cadillac has excellent customer relations.

I had no plans to get another Cadillac because none of their other models appealed to me, but the 2006 DTS, is no longer an ""old-folk's"", boat of a car and it really got my attention.  It looks great inside and out. The Performance package has more options than one has the right expect.  Getting all the preferences set takes some study and experimentation, but this car really pampers you once they are. The DTS has plenty of power, as good as my ETC and is very quiet and well-mannered on the road. The environment control is superb.",4.875

I've had several back operations and needed a comfortable smooth riding car I got beyond my expectations with the DTS.  It has power to spare. Comfort and ameneties are plentiful. My favorite option is the adaptive cruise control which does an amazing job maitaining safe spacing between cars.  The front and rear heated/cooled seats are extremely comfortable.  The sound system is excellent though with the nav system you loose the six disc changer. Other manufacturers manage to have a CD changer with nav system.  GM should do so too. Everything else is great.,4.75

1977, on 06/14/17 17:41 PM (PDT),Auto Terry ,2010 Cadillac DTS Sedan Premium 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 4A),A Great Luxury Sedan!," Ok, I drove many cars before picking the DTS, Lincoln was a very close second! But I choose the DTS for Ride, Comfort, Quiet Cabin and pure size. It is a big car with ROOM. When looking at Lexus, Audi, Infinity or BMW, you will spend more money. Plus you have to use premium fuel at .50 plus more per gallon ad the performance is not as smooth as the Northstar V8! On regular fuel i get 18MPG around town and have got 25 MPG on a trip, running 70MPH and our luggage and presents for the Grandkids! The professional reviews if you want to call them look toward the status symbol of a name plate. I looked at pure car comoparison not an image of how I arrive, after all isn.t that what driving a car is all about. Sure the car floats, that is luxury. What do people do buy a luxury car with real tight handling and take it to the track? Get serious. I own a Z06 Corvette for that. And I will tell you the Caddy is no slouch! Not as tight as European cars, but I bought a luxury car. The massaging seat are superb on a long drive, Bose stereo sounds great. And when I look at the dash it is straight forward, easy to use. Some of the other cars I looked at including Lexus and Toyota Avalon and the above, there were so many confusing controls that were not ergonomically designed, it made you wonder. I am driving the car not operating and airliner. Infinity, BMW and Audi were the worst set of dash controls. Now to the car, if anything breaks it is half the cost of other parts, the same base components are made in high quantities as they are on the GM cars and less than competitors. The dealer has been great. The car has only need normal wearable maintenance items. No big scheduled service appointment for required maintenance that cost $1800 like some of the others. I have taken good care of the car and the fit and finish is perfect, nothing has come loose or ever left me down! Does it look dated, no it is a classic look. And when driving it the seats are like the recliner at home, not a hugging seat with tight seat bolsters (save those for racing seats) pure comfort. The engine is smooth and steady, always there when you need power and quiet! The NAV is now a tad outdated, but that is technology. I have owned many luxury brands including Benz and some of the above and the Caddy is a keeper!",5

However, this car rides like crap.The front end bottoms out over the slightest bump in the road.

Handling if very good and responsive. The cabin area both front and rear has more than adequate room. Our friends could not believe how roomy and stately this car is. The chrome wheels really enhances the silver DTS. I previously owned a Lincoln Town Car and this DTS is far superior both in roominess and handling. DTS interior is by far more rich looking. Has an awsome stereo system. My wife and I will definetly purchase another Cadillac. We are very satisfied and throughly enjoy riding in ourDTS. MPG on the road is 20 and in town 16.

I just completed test driving both vehicles multiple times starting out w/an open mind - The Avalon rides like a little & lighter car compared to the DTS. The trunk is significantly smaller on the Avalon & it just doesn't have the ride quality of the DTS. The overall appearance is that of a much cheaper vehicle, which the Avalon is.I was very surprise when I looked at the expert review & found these two vehicles being compared as peers. The DTS is significantly more of a luxury vehicle in nearly all respects. This notion that not having a six speed trans somehow lessens the vehicle is hogwash.",4.75

DTS engine is noisy and expansion joints cause booming throughout the structure. TC's body on frame is quieter with much less road noise. DTS steering is too firm making small corrections difficult without yanking the wheel. DTS: no locking fuel filler door; no trunk lid pull down; no trumpet horn; FWD; occupants sit too low; seems like a mid-sized car when compared to the TC. Town Car: rides too firmly; accelerator and brake pedals too close together and too far to the right; engine not as responsive as in DTS; RWD.",3.125

I love everything about it except the build quality.  Ride is spectacular. Interior build is just good.  Inside window molding is lose and has a gap where you can see the edge of the window.  The outside is where the build quality looks bad.  Trim on doors does not line up.  Doors themselves do not line up.  Doors either hang higher or lower than the front or rear doors. Trim inside the trunk fell off as it was never snapped on.  Transmission leak at 1000 miles (Bolts had to be sealed).  GM just doesn't care about the DTS as they are doing away with it.

Think if you spent 30 year sleeping on the floor, and you just got a top of the line pillow top (King Koil Matress). You sleep would never be the same you wouldn't want to get out of bed.

I know part of that is because it is so new, (and, after all, it IS a Cadillac), but the bold front grille and clean lines with just the right amount of chrome, really grabs attention. The engine has lots of power and acceleration, not like a big vehicle, at all. I can't wait to get in it going to or coming home from work.  ",4.875

We knew they put a new motor in it. We bought it 14 hours away from home. Then stopped 9 hours away from home for dinner. It would not start back up just click, click , click. Had it towed to the nearest Cadillac dealer, stayed in a hotel, got a rental . Called Cadillac customer service and since we had AAA tow it they refused to help me with anything. ( Hello, I JUST purchased the vehicle a few hours previous.) Went back over to the dealership in the morning with the rental after getting uber to take us to the nearest rental place open on a sunday hoping it would start and it did. Took the rental back, drove straight home did not shut it off at all. Once home we shut it off , then tried to start it again and it would not start just click, click, click. Had it towed to a dealership near us. It would not, not start for them (4 days). I went up and got it. I had e-mailed Cadillac Customer service 3 times by now with no response. I called Cadillac customer service got a case# and was told to e-mail my receipts of being stranded in Toledo Ohio, so I put the receipts in the next e-mail for reimbursement.   Afraid to shut it off wherever we went,  two weeks later it acted up again. no start, just click, click, click. My guys bumped the bottom of the starter and it started so WE knew it was the starter and the dealership confirmed that 20 miles after the motor was put in they put in a starter ( not told to us when we bought the vehicle) . Back up to the dealership it went. For a week this time. I e-mailed Cadillac customer service again asking for the status of my case# and to advise them the vehicle would still not start intermittently . Still no response from Cadillac customer service.  Still it would not, not start for them. I went back up to pick it up. Now today June 19 2018 exactly a month from the day we bought it . It will not start just  click click, click. I know if we put it on the tow truck to go back it will jostle the starter and it will start again for them. I called the dealership and they can not send someone to my house. So, I am again stuck with a vehicle I do not dare drive anywhere without leaving it running. Cadillac Customer Service is a Joke. I have a case# and yet still nothing has been done. I have e-mailed them 5 times called 9 times and the only contact I have had from them is from me making the effort to contact them. I have received 1 phone call from them on June 16th(Saturday I was with my children and do not answer my phone) and it was on my voice mail that if I did not contact them by June 18th they were closing the case.    I called them and got NO ONE, only a voice mail and I left a message. Still no call back. So I called another # this morning and they transferred me to the same ""Senior Rep"" for me to leave another voice mail. I received a call on my cell phone which I had told them only to use after 5pm. She ""Sheila"" the senior customer rep stated they denied my reimbursement and told me to have the dealership near me reimburse me. Then they possibly would reimburse the dealership. WHAT it is not the dealership I am taking it to to be fixed fault that the vehicle stranded me 9 hours from home 5 hours after I bought it . I told her it is not the money, I have the money to cover the hotel, uber, rental,  it is the principal that Cadillac is suppose to be the ELITE of customer service !!   I asked to have her supr call me. She said it will be 1-2 business days. Then preceeded to tell me that they consider business days as 8 hours a day and it would be before 48 ""business"" hours that I would receive a call.    So, maybe 5-6 days before I get a call and in the meantime I am stuck with a Cadillac I can not depend on !!!!!  BEYOND FRUSTRATED !!!!!",1

It was used w/less than 20k miles on it and still has less than 30k miles. Within the short time frame we've owned it, the info/CUE screen/system blanked out several times, had to take in twice and seems to be fixed now but? When it goes out, of course so does your air. More importantly however the brake pads (on the front end) are defective. Not just worn/general use issues, but pretty much disintegrating and need to be replaced. Since this is considered a 'maintenance' issue, it is not covered under warranty. So a 2 year old vehicle w/less than 30k miles and paying for new brake pads OOP. Other issues like shifting when taking off or stepping on it to get going after slowing down are regular occurrences. The ride itself is noticeably better than the 2017 Tahoe we had before and so far the rest of the bells and whistles are functioning nicely. Just wish Cadillac would stand by it's product better.",3

Gaytan ,2016 Cadillac Escalade ESV SUV Luxury 4dr SUV 4WD (6.2L 8cyl 8A),Transmission shifting is still not great.," My husband and I have purchased brand new GM vehicles for many years now. Needles to say we have invested a great deal of money in our trucks and suvs. In 2015 we decided to purchase a 2016 Cadillac ESV because we liked the look of it. Well, not everything that glitters is gold, that's for sure!! Shortly after purchasing we started noticing the shifting was rough, the gears shift so rough all the passengers feel the rough shifting especially when taking off and on and off during a ride. The roughness of the shifting gets worse after time. As the problem with the shifting gets worse and worse the truck eventually won't even turn on, it just goes dead. We had to use cables to start it up so we could drive it to the agency and hope it would not leave us stranded. We expected so much more from a Cadillac vehicle being that our investment was a total of 94,000 dollars. The truck has been in the shop a total of six (6) times and it almost feels as if I've been driving a loaner more than my vehicle. Our family loves to take road trips in the summer months but we we have not been able to take summer road trips since we do not trust this truck to keep our family safe. We have no faith in Cadillac products and will never, EVER invest in Cadillac again!! We contacted GM to informed them of our concerns and expected GM to stand by their product but the best they could do was inform us that the shifting pattern is a new one with these new Cadillacs and the customers are not used to it. Whaaat??? No vehicle that we have ever driven shifts as rough and in such unpredictable patterns as this Cadillac ESV. Plus every time we get our vehicle back and new parts such as , gear box, are replaced and computer is reprogrammed it rides much better but eventually the problem starts once again until it gets so bad it eventually goes dead again! We will be trading this useless piece of JUNK for a real quality suv. Obviously GM does not care enough about their customers to keep them satisfied. Never Again!!It's been a while since my first review and a lot has changed. After filing the lemon law documents through the BBB and getting our lawyer involved GMC offered to exchange our vehicle for any other vehicle we wanted.We paid a fee of approximately 10,000 dollars which in the lemon law is called a usage fee. The usage fee is basically what you have to pay for the time the vehicle was used based on a formula.We chose another Cadillac Escalade ESV.it was great at first but now just two months and a half driving the vehicle we are starting to notice the modulator acting up. We will be calling the agency to get it serviced.  This truck is much, much better. We are hoping it just needs adjustment.The interior assembly of this new 2017 model seems to be much sturdier since I don't hear rattling of panels like with the last one.  It's too soon to tell though.If you are thinking of spending high dollar on a luxury vehicle I don't recommend it. Try Lexus or Range Rover.",3

Keeping in context we have owned Lexus since 1990, total of five LS models over the years. Best single auto manufacturer in the world for quality, value, cost of ownership.  Unless you need the size of the ESV for family, road travel, don't buy one.  Your hard earned $80K+ needs to go elsewhere because of the workmanship, quality issues.  It LOOKS awesome, rides great, it is the fitment, vibration, flutter of plastic parts rubbing against each other that will drive you crazy. The center CUE had a vibration as if a wiring harness had been flopping around. The sunroof decided just this morning that something up in there, needed to be jostling around, and these things happen only when they want to.  We have only owned her 3 weeks, she has 735 miles on her.  We got her for the room, size to accommodate family.  If LEXUS ever decides to make one similar in size, we are in.Nothing in my review changes except that I will never own another.  It is GM junk at the highest level.  Last May 22, 2016 we finally got help from the BBB in Washington DC to help replace the original 2016 we bought in Dec. 2015.  It took us 6 months to get rid of that pile of junk, replaced it with another pile of junk.  Folks other than the dealer experience being so stealor and supportive, I will never own another.  PERIOD.  From problems with transmissionn shifting at times I cant understand, to the dye color of the leather already wearing away.  Plastic parts look like wood and yet vibrate into a frenzy at times.  Listen carefully, you do what you want.  If you want to toss money into a pit loaded with stress and problems, then buy this thing.  If you want to save yourself the grief, buy Lexus or something else.

The ride is very smooth and controlled no mater how you drive it. It is not as loud as you might expect from a performance sedan and just a joy to drive. The quality is as good as you can get and I have found no problems with it.  The performance is off the scale, the Recarro seats are fantastic and the interior is well layed out and functional, not to mention beautiful.  I have gotten an average of 11.4 MPG since I bought it but this is not a hybrid.

I was hooked. I bought the loaded Reacaro version with an automatic and I can tell you: this car is the real deal. It is a beast on the road and a beauty to behold. Loaded with luxury, handles lke a much lighter car, and will simply plant your head and body in the back of your seat whenever you ask. Here's a little secret: the ZR-1 engine is in this pup. You can easily get this engine to produce way more horsepower. In fact GM built it in such a way that it almost begs to be upgraded. A pulley here, new headers and cat back there, tune the tranny and engine, and there is nothing under 100k that can catch this car. Buy if you dare.",5

I have 3500 miles on my 2005 CTS-V, half of it being wide open interstate and half in the doldrums of Los Angeles commuter traffic.  This car replaces a highly modified Jaguar XJS-V12, and I am generally delighted with the move.  The Cadillac handling is hard to fault, and selective turn off of stability and traction is welcome. I am less pleased with straight line performance, as the vehicle is subject to axle tramp unless care is taken to avoid it.  Also, engine management slowly (over seconds) decreases rpm on release of throttle which makes for an odd feel on hard acceleration.  DIC is distracting and features ill thought out.",4.25

I have put 2000 miles on the car and it really is a great car.  Everything works, the car looks great, nice fit and finish.  The engine just has a nice rumble and everything works with no drama.  Just press the gas pedal and hang on!  Handling reminds of my Porsche, just a tight nice ride and it loves the hills.  A GREAT value for such a world class car.  No regrets at all.  ",5

I had a Troféo with 300,000 + miles and the ESC was the best substitute I could find.  Interior styling is not as luxurious as the Oldsmobile.  But the power and mpg make up for it.  Since their is no other American luxury coupe and Chevrolet refuses to upgrade the Monte Carlo, I may buy another ESC or ETC and rotate the two until GM comes to their senses about what we want.

It is very classy and very comfy and the price was right. It gives a very nice ride. However after my first two years with it everything that could go wrong did.  I completly replaced the cooling system in the engine I mean everything from the water pump to the radiator every hose and even the bucket the holds the coolent.  It was just this great big money pit.  Finally the head gasket went that was a mini fourturne to replace.  The Northstar engine is the biggest joke 10 mechanics said the same thing.  I'm also very upset with the way Cadilac treated me they were so rude and fought me on every problem.  ",3.375

It appears ironic, but works. The finest automobile that I have ever owned and offers unparalleled luxury from top to bottom.  OBD II system virtually checks systems and can be manually accessed for DTC's (diagnostic trouble codes)  In essence, it diagnoses its own problems.  Leather interior is exquisite.

Many people seem to be scared off by these cars, but I've always felt they're quite a value after taking the initial depreciation hit.  This '98 Eldorado was no exception.  The power of this car has amazed everyone who's rode in it, and the exterior is a nice ""Cadillac interpretation"".  Considering the compliments and head-turning ability, it's a rather impressive vehicle for the sub-$10,000 used car group.  However there are some hidden costs such as the high-octane fuel and a few extra things to go wrong, but if one doesn't mind a doing little tinkering and is in the market for something nice, this is certainly a car worth a look.",4.75

I drive hilly, winding roads & the El never ceases to amaze me with it's easy & steady handling. I'm a female 5'2"" & always feel in control of this car even though it has supreme power when needed. Of course, there have been repairs (it's about 140K now) but the engine still sounds as smooth as the day I bought it. I keep thinking I need to sell it but I can't seem to part with it.

Find any type of performence part is impossible for some reason there seems to be a lack of parts out there. I bought this car with 55,000 miles on it for $10,500. which is way over the book value but now am glad I did.

So far the car has measured up outstandingly, othern than for a few cosmetic interior things that I had to fix.  The engine is smooth.

My only real concern is with the maintenance history of battery changes.  So I'm watching this closely.  I've also noted that the interior dash lights dim (very little) when I press the brake pedal.

A Real Cadillac that beats BMW!," I have owned this car for 3 years and has been great owning this car. I owned a 2002 Eldorado and this car is vastly improved over the Eldorado. The engine is strong to redline. The transmission is silky smooth and when drive fast shifts smooth and fast with no lag in downshifting. Passing on the highway is effortless and is strong in any situation. The suspension is smooth in touring mode and nice and firm in sport mode but not harsh. Extremely comfortable, any person can find a nice position to drive comfortably. It's luxury, performance and value all in one car. All I have needed to do is replace the rear shocks outside regular maintenance. Not a bad deal. All the electronics and power options work fine after 10 years. All the interior and exterior has held up wonderfully. No rattles, squeaks or noises. Extremely happy with the STS V8 AWD. I recommend to stay away from the v6 and go with either V8 STS. Truly a driver's car that you can put the family in without giving up anything. When you're alone you can drive it like a Corvette and when your with the family you can drive it like a Cadillac with all it comes with, comfort, great ride, and quality with all the luxury you could want. BMWs, Lexus and Mercedes of this age are nowhere near holding up like the Cadillac. Especially in the price to fix all the problems those cars have when they get to this age. Don't forget the price to fix them neither! Cadillac prices for parts are much cheaper to replace than all those cars. I drove a S class Mercedes that was two years newer than my car and it felt like it was going to fall apart, total junk! My Cadillac drives like a two year old car, not a ten year old car. American cars get a bad rap. I'll take a Cadillac over all those cars I mentioned any day. Maybe I got lucky and found a good one, but I don't think so. I think it is a well built and engineered car.",5

Besides oil changes, breaks and tires, I've had to replace the battery due to age. I did have a pot hole issue which bent a rim and a lower control arm, I had both left and right arms replaced.  The glove box latch broke because it's cheap. I'm real careful with it now. There's nothing high tech about it. I guess it could use a USB and a WIFI but, It's a car not a internet router. It does have GPS and remote garage opener. The stock sound system is excellent. I'm hoping to get 10 more years out of it if I live that long. I didn't like the GM dealer support where I live.

Well this car I got from the dealer was a eye catcher and test drove it fine. After a couple weeks, I started to have some issues, the dealer couldn't figure it out and the warranty on the car wouldn't kick in since they can't nail what the problem was. Basically the noise sounded like a belt going bad, they changed everything imaginable and still the issue was there. Brakes are horrible, and electronic pieces go to quickly such as the steering wheel controls for the radio. Additionally, to replace your headlights you have to remove the entire bumper off to do so, dealer asks 350.00 in labor only, which is a rip off, although I do it myself, I have to take the day out on a weekend to do it which then the rest of the weekend is gone. My opinion is that they need to make a car that is consumer friendly for repairs such as maintenance for lighting etc. and then the dealers need to know how to fix these issues.

I was a little skeptical until we took it for a test drive.  It was really impressive and comfortable.  The first 1000 mile trip yielded 25 mpg on regular gas. Some of the controls are a little unfriendly but well worth the time to master.  Last night I started the STS from inside a restaurant which turned on the heater & seat heaters during a snowstorm.

The white diamond paint is to die for!",5
2497, on 07/25/16 04:51 AM (PDT),Alex ,2005 Cadillac STS Sedan Rwd 4dr Sedan (3.6L 6cyl 5A),Gorgeous car with a decent price tag.," Bought this car from the dealership with 106,000 miles. It came in the ""white diamond"" color and the looks on this thing are head turning to say the least! This paint scheme practically could sell the car on its own! I've only owned the vehicle for a few months now but aside from a few flaws, which i'll point out, this is a relatively fun and comfy car to drive in. Firstly, for a car thats over 10 years old, the technology is surprisingly ahead of its game. Air conditioned seats, heated seats, driver recall settings, bluetooth which works great, nav system, dvd player, rear proximity sensors, tire pressure sensors, heated mirrors, and the list goes on and on! Too many electronics to name, which could be a blessing, or a curse, if any of these fancy bells and whistles malfunction. Thankfully its been smooth sailing so far, and everything has worked great. This car feels fast...i'm not one to boast about it, since I normally don't spend my time racing it, but it really does pick up and I find it almost hard not to give it some throttle on occasion. I find myself looking down at the speedometer from time to time and asking...""am I really doing 50 right now?!"". The only complaints I have so far are the suspension. This thing is certainly not the smoothest ride out there! It feels awfully stiff and you can feel each and every bump on the road. I dread things like potholes because in this car, you'll practically knock yourself out if you drive over one!! My girlfriend has complained multiple times about the bumpy ride, and though the interior is loaded with luxury, it isn't doing its job correctly if you aren't comfortable during the ride! Other than the stiff as a board suspension, this car is a blast to drive around! In my old beat up Cavalier...I regretted driving on the highway...mostly just merging onto the highway because the thing was so sluggish and unsafe. Now i'm eager to merge just to hear the engine roar for a few brief moments! Not to mention the car feels much safer as well. Lastly, I keep hearing bad things about the gas mileage. I deliver pizza as a side job, and after a 6 hour shift, i've gone through a little under 1/4 of a tank. Not too bad for my standards. Not expensive to fill up, and it isn't as bad of a gas hog as people say it is. Overall, i'll say that this car has been a dream come true for me in my mid 20's. I feel much more confident driving this car than I did with my previous one. I have more fun on the road, and I feel safer while driving it. Did I mention the sound system is awesome?!",4
2498, on 07/24/16 19:12 PM (PDT),Christopher Newton ,2005 Cadillac STS Sedan Rwd 4dr Sedan (4.6L 8cyl 5A),2005 STS v8 in 2016; So Much Car for so Little," Ok, so I bought this car a few months ago for a little over $5k. Brand new, eleven years ago mind you, it was somewhere around $68k at the dealership. It is pearl white (my name for it because that's what everyone says it looks like), Northstar V8, with every imaginable option. All of them, each and every one of them, work - despite the age, despite the 130k plus miles. It has a quirk or two here and there, but nothing that hasn't been easily sorted out.  Also, apparently the previous owner decided to delete the mufflers and go with straight pipes (cats are still there obviously), and that alone sold me on it when I took the test drive. The SOUND, holy cow! OMGoodness, that noise. At around 3k RPM the V8 comes to life and rolls from a growl to a roar as you accelerate all the way to 6500. It's intoxicating if I'm honest. But mostly, inside and out, the car oozes class and elegance. Nevermind the snobs that say a plastic dash is cheap - frankly it doesn't LOOK cheap and who the heck goes around feeling the dash of a car every day anyway? No one, that's who. Everything is first rate, high-end and maybe ten or eleven years ago, at $67,000 one has a reason to complain about minute things. But today, at $5 grand or so - or even two or three times that if mileage is low enough to justify - it's simply to die for. I couldn't tell you the number of compliments I get on the car - it's several each week - even being more than a decade old, it's still an eye catcher. It's also a joy to drive, although it took some getting accustomed to for sure. I read one review where the owner laughably equated it to driving a truck. This clearly is due to the handling, probably magnetic ride, and the turn-in the car gives as it enters curves and counters G's. At first it feels like rear-end body roll but it's the shocks adjusting to the road and conditions and stopping roll before it starts. It's a unique sensation to the uninitiated. Mine handles terrifically, eating up curvy roads with ease and provides a steady confidence.  So, it looks amazing, drives amazing, and the features? Yes, it has a ton of them. The 8 inch LCD screen with navigation is great, I have the 2016 update DVD so it's not old or stale. Turn-by-turn, maps, searches that are a bit cumbersome at times, but once you learn the system it's fine. Also integrated is voice commands which are head-shakingly amazing. Just have to know the command and it works - most of the time lol. There are ones I use regularly that greatly simplify use of the car. Like ""windows down"", ""windows up"", or ""navigation home"". The head-up display is a feature I never knew I'd love so much. At first it was annoying, but as I grew accustomed to it, I will no longer drive a car without it if I don't have to. It's not just that it shows speed, but that it flashes up integrated data as well, most notably navigation turns. The adaptive cruise control is great, but sometimes traffic is just too heavy for it - although that's true of regular speed control also. Forward collision warning is nice for sure - in the event you're glancing away and you come close to another car or object. Automatic high-beam headlamps is nice too, but sometimes it doesn't turn off for an on-coming car. Remote start is really nice but I don't use it often as I'm not that pampered frankly. The automatic lights work well, but mostly I just turn it off and choose to set lights manually. OnStar and XM Radio are nice features I'm enjoying also, in addition to being able to use my phone's streaming media to pipe to the car's system via Bluetooth and the onboard RCA jacks. It's a 2005-era workaround for audio/video but it works. If you're looking to buy one of these cars, do a few things; 1) insist on the navigation center stack, it was part of a big option package and at a glance you'll know the car has other nice options 2) Adaptive cruise has issues here and there, but the head-up display system is first-rate and it's an option I'd insist upon, 3) Insist on the automatic wipers - seriously, it's one of the best features on the car, they rock, 4) If you're looking at an '05 to '09, insist on the Northstar V8, 5) Bottom line, get it with as many options as you can. You'll love the technology! I can't say enough good things about the Cadillac STS. In one word, it's ridiculous.",5

Currently, it has almost 80,000 miles.  There were a few minor mechanical problems when new, all covered under warranty, but over the last several years the repairs have been minimal, or just routine maintenance.  The car has very good handling, braking and acceleration for a luxury car, and plenty of room to ride very comfortably, which makes road trips no problem.  With the Norstar V-8 it has plenty of power, but without sounding like a ""boy racer.""The major caution when driving this car in wet, slushy, or icy conditions is the power.  The traction control is okay but does not really rein in the car quickly enough if the rear wheels loose traction.

I saw a 2005 STS V8 and decided to test drive.  I fell in love and purchased.  It is much more sporty, handling more like a Mercedes than ever imagined.

Many prefer the CTS in both respects, but I prefer the toned-down design of the STS.  I am not normally an extended warranty fan, but anybody considering the STS would be wise to find one under factory warranty, or in the case of a 2005 or 2006, a factory CPO warranty.

I think that the rear seat comfort could be improved though, but other than that I have no complaints so far!  Also, received a great deal on a great car!",5

The car is solid, and extremely quiet, except when I have the 15 speaker Bose DVD system cranked up. The power is awsome, and the handling smooth and responsive. This is my fourth consecutive Cadillac in the Seville line. The past vehicles were SLS's and I loved them. I was having mixed emotions turning in my last car which was a 2002 SLS. It only took one test drive of the new STS and I never got into the old car again, and didn't look back. The controls are state of the art and user friendly. From programming the features to using the GPS navigation system. The car is an absolute dream to drive and own.",4.75

The price on the new 7-Series has gotten a little pricey, so I looked at alternatives.  For the money, I could not have found a better drive.  I tested the V8 for a week then the V6.  There is truly NO noticable difference in the performance, and since the majority of my driving is in the city, I would highly recommend the STS V6.  Fully optioned it is priced closely to the base V8. ",5

It took 2 dealer techs 2 hours to get the job done. The old Seville came with VHS instructional tape and a handy card. This new STS is not user friendly in that respect. The glove compartment is next to useless, being so shallow and the return of standard cigarette lighters and ash trays is not a welcome addition. The buyer gets more ""toys"" than he can keep track of, so eventually forgets all but the most used features. The tires and brakes could be a little more high-performance but are only adequate as they come from the factory. The coffee cup holders have only one purpose: to hold coffee cups. ",3.875

The V6 is the perfect engine at 255 HP, coupled with a 5 speed auto trans that has sport mode as well as a manual shift option, this car not only looks great it's a blast to drive.

The First was a 2005 with the V8 and the one I have now is a 2008. They are great cars for the thought but stay away from the V8 North star engines by all means. At around 87, 000 and up the V8 North star starts going to the ground with problems. The found out problem with this engine is the design for the cylinder head mounting studs start to loosen due to corrosion and the material or metal used for the Head studs that clamp them down. This leads to head gasket failure and even engine damage. You can get the head gaskets fixed but the problem will come back after 30,000 miles or so, ultimately leaving you with a reoccurring and expensive problem. You can re-drill new studs in the engine and the problem still will come back. Its a nice luxury / performance car overall but I recommend buying the V6 with the 306hp. Oh and on my 2005 car the transmission started to give up on me. I think the 5 speed can barely handle the V8 power, the 07 and up have 6 speeds that are more adequate.",3

So far this car is solid in all respects; handles well,comfortable, reliable, good mileage and is fast enough. In my opinion, this car favorably competes with BMW, MB and the other usual suspects but after you negotiate your final price, there really is no comparison becuse you pay a lot less. The status of a label is unimportant to me (although a Caddy still has some clout left) and as car enthusiast, I look to the raw driving experience.

This is quite simply a nicer car than the  5- series BMW and E-Class Mercedes without the price tag of the BMW or the poor quality of the Mercedes.  I could not tell the difference in performance test driving the V-8 and V-6.  The DI V6 feels like a V-8.  This car simply babies you.

That is not to say anything bad about the '03, just that Cadillac got it right with this one. RWD, IMHO, is a much better way to design and build this class of car.

Used synthetic oil and changed only every 10,000 miles. Ash tray covers (f&b) both broke off, and the bushings in the front suspension have moved out of place so we do get some clunking noises over bumps. Both headlamps burned out within months of each other and were costly to replace because the whole front end had to come off. On third set of tires, otherwise no issues.

There is some vibration felt under extreme acceleration but to anyone that has owned an AWD vehicle if you say you have never felt this you are lying they all do it, before getting this CT6 I had a S550 AWD same feeling when picking up speed under hard acceleration, some reviews compared it to the junk Audi A6, had one of those junks too always at dealer for problems with vibrations, electrical stuff battery use to drain, trim on doors and pillars coming off, nav screen stopped working  and weird noises from AWD system under hard accelerations and or turning at low speeds, after just 16mo. of ownership decided to take it to the nearest carmax and get rid of it, not to mention the trade value on the A6 was less than 45% after 16 mo. : (.. The Benz was a lot better than Audi very smooth and not as much vibration, the only problem was the electronic suspension other than that great car. I test drove the Lexus and I can't believe why people make such a big deal about that car, the LS 500 felt like driving a Ford Econoline felt very heavy and not mannered at all during lane changes, lots of tire noise at highway speeds and seats are not comfortable at all they are very hard rear are a little better but still for the price tag there is no comparing. Some websites say ""the CT6 competition Offers more technology and options"" well thats a lie, none of the ones I mentioned above had any of the options the Premium Luxury CT6 offers and even if you get the top of the line Lexus, Audi or Mercedes you still don't get the same technology you get with the CT6, Panaray Bose, Active Chassis and steering, wifi , night vision and not to mention Supercruise the best. There are a few flaws to the CT6 1. Engine should have more HP, even though it gets up and going very well . 2. Transmission on AWD model shifts hard at low speeds sometimes, not all the time but I do have a lead foot. 3.  Start / Stop Technology is annoying I think Luxury cars shouldn't have this period or at least a setting where you can turn it off period never to come on again at next ignition cycle. Other than that there is nothing at the time that bothers me, fits all the stuff I have to carry for my 3 kids , car is very safe all of the safety and driver awareness stuff works great, Heads up display is great you see all the warnings there , auto parking feature is cool and works perfect, love the night vision and the 360 cameras record any disturbance to the car and records you trips.

Other times it takes seconds for the car to shift from first to second and during that time the car has no power applied to the wheels.  GM and the dealerships appear to do nothing about this after several complaints and tell me its normal (no...it's not normal for a $70+ car to shift like a 30 year old truck).,3

Point is the car is gorgeous. But DAMMMMMMN ive never seen a ""Luxury Car"" who is so called trying to compete with the Lexus, Audi, BMW, and Mercedes!! this is by far THE CHEAPEST made vehicle i've even seen!!!!!  i have 8,800 miles on the CT^ and i'm hearing noises, squeaks, oh and when i go over a bump, it sounds like the damn bottom is going to fall out! similar to when i'm driving my grand dad;s 1970 Buick!. I""ve owned both Inifiniti and BMW both with well over 170k miles! and never had to bring it to the dealers. Ive had this car for 6 months, and have been to get repairs 4x already. Everything is made of cheap plastic! i rented a 2017 Chevy impala on a vacation, and realized this car is the exact!! same thing, only with more hi tech features and fancier plastic!!! I highly suggest leasing this vehicle if interested!! so that way you wont get stuck regretting getting stuck in it.",2

On occasion the transmission shifts/lurches so hard that it feels like the vehicle was struck from the rear.  I did take the vehicle in for service and dealership stated that they upgraded the computer and the problem should  not re-occur.  Wrong!  The same issue has occurred several more times and one time my grandkids were in the vehicle and it actually scared them when the vehicle lurched.  Reading other reviews involving the Cadillac CT6 shows that I am not alone with this issue.  I know that there is no perfect vehicle available on this planet but, what I fear is that the lurching may occur and cause an accident or  transmission will not last long and will need to be replaced (hopefully, while under warranty).This transmission issue is still  an issue, as I have taken the vehicle back to the dealership and the dealership cannot ""duplicate"" the hard shift.  Interesting fact is that every single person that has been in my vehicle has felt this problem and I have had it occur before and after taking the vehicle for service.",3

It has been in the shop for approx 4 of the 20 weeks that I have owned it. I would not wish this car on my worst enemy. Here is a list of all the problems. Brake pedal assembly needed to be replaced, seat belt tightening motor needed to be replaced,  and panel under steering wheel fell off. Those are the problems that have been resolved. What has not been resolved is the headliner makes a loud rattling noise. It comes from the area between the sun roofs. I have taken it to two dealerships and they have attempted to fix it with “clamps”. That actually made it worse. Last but not least. The car makes a very loud whining noise. It sounds like a cat being tortured( not that I have heard a cat being tortured). It’s really loud. I understand that I may have just gotten a lemon but so far GM has not done anything to make this right. It’s a great looking car but so far miserable to drive.",1

Found it very composed, offering a nice ride on smaller bumps, as well as very solid high merging acceleration. Seats comfy during test drive, and CUE system worked fine for the limited amount I used it.  Felt the transmission shifted nicely and kicked down quickly for acceleration, though noted that the car was in sport setting.  Wife claimed she couldn't quite get comfy in the driver seat, though she didn't spend that much time adjusting it.  Overall, I though the chassis felt nicer than the E400 wagon i had just test driven, though not as fast.  The Merc was more luxurious inside, but I was not disappointed in the CT6.  Didn't get a chance to really lean on the car, but my test drive was enough to convince me that I should spend more time in one, and that it is still on the list of possible candidates.",4

The dealer can't seem to find what is causing it.  If they can't soon find a fix, we are considering if the dealer will buy it back.The dealer thinks the whine is coming from the rea drive shaft.  They have replaced the drive shaft three times, and the whine is beginning to start again.  Since this the third time they have been unable to fix the problem, GM said to replace the  vehicle.  It also falls into the lemon law.  I hope we can get them to give us a 2018 CT6.  By the way, GM says this vehicle is only the third one in the entire CT6 fleet to have this problem.

If you are committed to a CT6 insist that you road test your intended purchase for a few days before making the deal. First, I have owned 12  Cadillacs and was hoping that the CT6 was going to be the new flagship of the Cadillac fleet. It's not. . This disaster has the most crude, rough shifting 8 speed transmission that won't 'learn and adapt'  and gets confused about which gear to crunch into. My CT6 has build-quality issues as my car needed to have its entire front end reassembled because of a mis-aligned fender that got crunched by the front door. My CT6 experienced a catastrophic rear axle hub/bearing failure in its first 200 miles. If you don't have access to German smooth autobahn pavement, stay away from the 20"" wheels and magnetic suspension . . .  the car will shake apart on normal roads. The AC is weak and has issues with the thermostat's control of its fan speed. Cheap hard plastic interior with a poorly designed center console featuring a useless cell phone charger.

I transferred from a Cadillac XTS to my CT 6 so my learning curve was much shorter but the surround vision was great, USB and Hot spot features take some getting used to, ONSTAR uses the built in Navigation system - you need to understand the interface features between Onstar and the onboard Navigation system - the one feature that is confusing is the memory setting from your remote key bob - they are not numbered anymore for some reason so you can confuse the memory setting for the seats and mirrors if you transfer remote keys - this is the one feature you should have the dealer explain before you drive your car away - it will save time later. Other than that - curl up with the instructions books and enjoy.

First of all, like many high end luxury vehicles, this car is air tight.  Therefore, when all the windows are up, it is difficult to get the doors to close without slamming them.  That's the reason why many of it's competitors went with automatic soft closures for the doors, like the trunk.  Next, a rear wheel drive is not available with the 3.6L engine.  Though I live in the snow belt next to one of the Great Lakes, I have never found the need for AWD as long as I use the right winter tires.  I love the way rear wheel handles.  I will never own FWD again, but would do an AWD as long as primary power comes from the rear.  And, I won't be sold on a turbo charged 4 cylinder engine forced to work hard to act like a 6 or an 8.  Besides, now you are stuck using premium fuel.  Next, I dislike steering wheel paddle shifter's and want to do my manual shifting on the stick in the center console.  And, I was hoping to be able to select something other than black for the dashboard and trim without having to move into the Platinum model.  What with the rear camera mirror?  It actually made me nauseous looking at it.  Otherwise, it is a very good looking vehicle and would most likely own one if it at least had the door closures.  I'm not going to slam doors on my vehicles.  I liked many of the features like heads up display, start/stop technology and brake hold.  With just a few more changes, I can see me behind a wheel of a CT6.",4

Low profile tires is the culprit. hit a curb, no tire scrape just grinding of the very expensive wheel.

My new 2017 CT6 has the magnetic ride as well but with very little rubber between the road and the pretty 20"" wheels you feel the bumps like never before. I kept the 2007 for a few weeks and can't believe how much difference in the smoothness of the ride the 2007 has over the new 2017 and have to believe these low profile tires with large wheels must make up the difference. As for warranty, I am pretty upset that you do not cover these wheels since they come with the upgrade package. I have a strong feeling the first large chuckhole I encounter will damage the tire and wheel. NOT GOOD BUISNESS for such a great expensive vehicle. By the way, this is my 5th Caddy.

2698, on 12/28/17 19:02 PM (PST),Snowbird ,2016 Cadillac CT6 Sedan Premium Luxury 4dr Sedan AWD (3.0L 6cyl Turbo 8A),Guilted Into It," I've had the car a little over a month now.  I needed it like I need a hole in the head (had a perfectly good 2006 Buick Lucerne CXL with the Northstar V8 that I still enjoyed but family was ""ragging"" on me to get a newer car that reflected my financial circumstances).  But now that I have it......... I actually sort of like it.  It was a brand new leftover 2016 (in Nov 2017) with 300 miles on it, and I got an appropriate deal on a two year old car from the dealership.  The performance of the TT 3.0 is not in dispute.  It went 0-84 uphill in the blink of an eye (seemed like it anyway) when my son drove it.........and it was incredibly stable and quiet when he did it.....and mine doesn't have the super-duper steering package.     Around town, it's quite smooth, but you notice the downshifting of the transmission sometimes (tight?). The dash/interior is beautifully done, but I think I'd prefer some of the ""old school"" practicalness....like airvents that close and can be directed almost anywhere.  The exterior styling is exceptional and I notice nuances every day that I missed initially.  People notice it...and I've caught quite a few just staring at it when it goes by them.  Trunk might be small but will be more than adequate 95% of the time.  I don't do electronics, but again, my 27 and 29 year old sons loved it all.  Too much for most folks, but comparing apples to apples, a darn good price vs Mercedes or BMW for the same capability.  Car cruises nicely and can be a very good executive commuter.  Back seat has lots of room for anybody but really designed for only two people.  The stop-start technology is irritating and I'm still looking for a permanent kill switch.  You can turn it off when you get in by pushing a button on the dash, but there should be a permanent kill switch too. As others have mentioned, storage pockets for all the little stuff are almost nonexistent in the front.  Over all though, not a bad package at all and worth looking at if you're in that price range.  Glad I made the plunge after the fact.",4

My first was a 1982 Cimarron (ok to laugh) then a 2007 STS, a 2010 SRX, a 2013 XTS and traded a 2014 XTS for this gem.  Car has styling, performance and handling.  Most noticeable is the ride quality over the XTS which was not bad but the CT6 gets a 10 out of 10 for ride quality.  It handles like a much smaller sports car yet it bathes you in luxury.  My only complaint is the lack of storage compartments for the driver.  The auto stop/start takes some getting use to but the on/off switch allows you to turn the system off if desired.  I looked at the 750 BMW and a S550 Mercedes before choosing to stay with the Cadillac CT6. The lack of performance and handling with earlier big Caddy's drove me to BMW for a spell.

Also, the battery, because it ran down too low more than once as the alternator was failing. Then the transmission failed and had to be replaced. SO, now I'll have this car forever because it isn't worth how much I've put into it on repairs.At least it gets better MPG than the van it replaced, and it's not our primary vehicle.UPDATE; I've now had this car for 1 year and I'm freally pleased with it.

Have owned and Eacalade ESV, Mercedes M Class, Audi A4, etc prior. Never have I had a car that I hated more than this. Poor gas mileage, slow to accelerate, oil always low, panoramic roof broke twice, lost just goes on and on. Constant mechanical issues. Took to dealer a few months ago because steering gave out. Gave me a list of things wrong including the entire power steering system. Every last bit of that was shot. Unacceptable for a car with 100K on i and a car I properly maintained. These problems added up to the tune of $6,000. That was last straw. Traded it, got nothing for it, but so happy to be rid of it. Went with a Lexus RX 350 ",1.5

The car has been very reliable, and we've only ever paid for routine maintenance. There are a few problems you should be aware of. (1) The engine consumes several qts. of oil between changes. (2) The build integrity is fair-poor, as evidenced by numerous squeaks and rattles. (3) The passenger foot-well is extremely narrow, and uncomfortable. (4) Fuel mileage is much lower than advertised. We experience 15/20. Update. The care was sold after experiencing a rear wheel bearing failure. The wheel bearing failure left us stranded at the side of the road with absolutely no help from the Cadillac dealership where we serviced the car. They would not even arrange a tow truck. The car performed as I stated, and I would not change the rating. I would caution a prospective Cadillac owner, however, to be extra-diligent in assessing your dealership experience before buying any Cadillac product.",3

Art 'n Science design themed SRX offered best of what I wanted/needed; snazzy style, ample cargo space, loads of comfort & safety technology. A better torque-to-speed ratio would definitely be a useful improvement! Gas mileage is acceptable for a vehicle of this weight, but ONLY if you stay on top of required maintenance schedules, replace tires ahead of suggested interval, maybe treat it to a fuel system cleaning from time-to-time?  Downside, buzzy, slow-ish acceleration. When I want to pass, I want to pass then, not later! Once it gets there though, it moves!!  This vehicle would definitely benefit from enhanced engine compartment sound insulation. Perhaps higher quality materials could've/should've been used?? Getting accustomed to the fat 'c' pillar blind spots is a thrill, but also potentially dangerous. All things considered; electric vs. gas, coupe-sedan-truck, vanilla vs. rocky road, I love my SRX waaaayy more than not!! Unfortunately, now have to consider a competitor's product due to the XT5's size and lack of appeal to me. The XT4 seems 2b aimed at Volvo, Honda, Huyndai buyers, so I'm forced to consider a Jaguar F-Pace, Jeep Cherokee, Range Rover or a yet-2b-determined vehicle. Because the SRX's unique design stands out (in a good way) among the industry's current smoother, softer design direction, I'm pleased Cadillac isn't completely abandoning the A & S theme.",4

2770, on 10/26/15 12:23 PM (PDT),Kevin Taube ,2013 Cadillac SRX SUV Performance 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Cadillac SRX Review," We were looking for a late model used CTS sedan when we came across this 2013 SRX Performance model.  The car was a lease return and had only 11,300 miles on it.  The car is also Certified, meaning we get an extended warranty for no additional cost.   The Cadillac salesman was very helpful and came down to meet our offer without making us go through annoying back and forth with a sales manager.  Overall, a very good experience. The car is primarily for my wife and met her requirement for AWD and outward visibility.  Having a very positive experience with the 3.6 engine in my older CTS,  I was pleased to see that this car had the same motor.  This motor has proven its performance and reliability for more than 10 years on tens of thousands of GM cars and trucks, including the Chevy Camaro.  After more than two months, we are very pleased with the car.  We enjoy the XM radio on the CUE system and the back up camera and parking assist features work flawlessly.  The car even brakes automatically to prevent backing into a bush (or worse).   While it does not afford an overly generous amount of space in the rear cargo area, few SUV's of this size do.  The auto power lift gate opens the door well out of head bumping range and is adjustable should you prefer less of a lift height.  The front seats are very supportive and appear to be made of quality materials and craftsmanship.   The heated power seats  will adjust to any reasonable position and provide very good support.  The sun roof is very impressive, opening up directly overhead for front passengers and having a fixed roof window for those in the rear.  Overall a very comfortable and solid ride car. The performance is the best part of this car.  It goes fast and shifts authoritatively.  The car will carve turns at speeds twice that of those posted with no noticeable body roll.  Steering is taught and braking superb.  Acceleration is outstanding for a two ton SUV.  It should be noted that the Performance model does require that you give up that softer, quieter Cadillac ride to a noticeable  degree.   If that's a concern, you should consider one of their world class sedans.   We are very happy with this car and would buy it again.  If you're concerned about buying a Cadillac, you needn't be.  Cadillac has come a long way in ten years and is making great cars.   And you will have the added benefit of knowing that you are supporting an American company.",5
2771, on 04/14/14 13:38 PM (PDT),pensman ,2013 Cadillac SRX SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Not Quite There but close," The SRX handles well, especially on highways; but visibility is an issue. The rear view mirror is too small.  Probably the worst I have dealt with but I suspect the size is such because of the side ""pillars"" which can obscure your view. So you really need those side mirrors that light up to warn you when a car is passing.  Having the defensive driving add-in helps. Plus my model has a driver's seat that vibrates should you start to drift into another lane. On the highway, I have managed to get 24 mpg. The CUE system needs some major improvements as it is totally non-intuitive nor can apps be added to it which I believe is a big mistake.  And the HD radio can drift which makes it difficult to hold on to a station. Storage in the rear compartment is excellent.  No spare tire, just a can of stuff that you use to halt a leak/puncture as you then limp in for help.  I have had a few problems with the power driver's seat. The seat refused to drop down.  It was repaired, unsuccessfully, several times. Finally, I insisted the seat and power mechanism be replaced.  But after I left the car with the dealer, who promised to drive it and prove the repairs worked, I received a call informing me the entire seat and all would be replaced. I still enjoy the car but my wife isn't as enthusiastic.  Actually, she hates it. She finds she can't cope with the rearview mirror.  She drives an Audi Q5. I like the way the SRX handles, and it is great for highway driving and holds the road well for a front wheel drive car. This Caddy is still a road winner. A friend bought the new XT5 and I have noticed some good tweaks, but this model is still great to drive but I have wished at times there was more storage in the back. Time has passed but the car is still a winner with me. As I take care of my cars, the SRX looks new. I'd like to trade it in for a new XT5 but I can't come up with a good enough reason. It's good that I like this car.",4

The seats are uncomfortable, rear visibility and right side visibility are poor, the transmission shifts rough. I have gotten more accustomed to the CUE system and it is easier to use, even though it is slow to respond and continues to be difficult to use in traffic. The air conditioner is poor and not made for Texas heat. When starting, you have to drive a couple of city blocks before you get cool air. I keep the temp on the lowest position and the fan on high most of the time. The car did not come with a spare tire and I got a big sales pitch about how great Cadillac service is, in all parts of the U.S., even rural areas. Cadillac service has not been that great when I park it in front of their door. So I am afraid to take it out of town on the road. I have a second car that I use for vacations. I like the safety features. The seat shaker gets your attention and when backing a large triangle appears on the screen if you have cross traffic. The 307 HP engine is nice, but you pay for the power with poor gas milage. The interior has not held up very well. The carpet and floor mats are very poor. I've had a couple of minor mechanical problems, but overall the drivetrain has been reliable.",3

I never purchase brand new vehicles because of the instant depreciation so I was specifically looking for a vehicle that was 2-3 years old with low mileage. In addition to the SRX, I researched and test drove quite a few different mid-size SUV makes/models including Acura, BMW, Ford, Range Rover, GM and Lexus. Each of the different SUVs had their own strengths and weaknesses when it came to power, comfort, handling, entertainment, etc. The SRX Performance AWD impressed me in many different areas, not the least being style and looks. I was very attracted to the ""Art and Science"" design incorporating the sharp angles and aggressive stance. In my opinion, it is far more appealing than the rounded and plain looking Acura and Lexus. From a driver's standpoint, the SRX didn't match the acceleration and handling of the BMW, but it was comparable or better than the other makes/models I drove. Steering is responsive and handling very good. The fact that this is the Performance AWD model probably aids in that category. I have read many negative comments about the CUE entertainment system and must say that I don't have much of a problem with it. It seems intuitive to me and responds quickly to any touch command. The Bose sound system is incredible for a stock/factory set-up. The comfort and safety features were as good or better than other models I drove. I guess the only real negative that I've come to experience is limited/restricted sightlines towards the rear of the vehicle. Thank goodness for the excellent back-up camera, driver assist package and tilting side-view mirrors! As noted in almost every review, gas mileage is probably the worst in this vehicle's class and the fact that I don't use ""Economy"" mode probably doesn't help. When in ""Economy"" mode shifting and acceleration is a little sluggish, so I prefer to drive in ""Sport"" mode. I've also noticed some negative comments about dealerships. I guess I'm one of the fortunate ones and have only received top-notch service from my local dealership and was really impressed that I haven't had to pay for any oil/filter changes up to this point. Having owned and driven the SRX for about 12 months, I can say I'm very satisfied with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to friends.",4

2799, on 01/22/16 09:32 AM (PST),Jeff ,2015 Cadillac SRX SUV Standard 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Most comfortable car I've ever owned.," Most will say that the SRX is over-priced for a luxury crossover of its size.  And then they slide into that extremely comfortable front seat and drive away.  I knew after driving this car for less than a mile that I had to have it.  Front seats are extremely comfortable, especially if you have the ventilated seats.  My only real beef with the interior design is the memory seat function.  I'm not quite sure I understand the reasoning behind the need to continue to hold the seat memory buttons in order to adjust the seat if auto recall is not enabled (can be a real pain).  The response of the engine was somewhat sluggish at first.  Then I turned off the ECO setting and placed the transmission in Sport Mode.  What a difference.  It literally threw me and my passenger back in our seats.  Everyone complains about the fuel economy, but if you can afford the sticker price of an SRX to begin with a little extra for gas isn't going to turn you off.  I went from driving a Suburban to the SRX.  17 mpg average is a huge improvement from the 12 mpg (and that's not towing anything) I was getting in that beast.   The technology and entertainment package included in the Premium model are well worth the extra money.  Love the customizable driver information center.  The Cue system could be a little more responsive and it could be played out more logically.  Also, I would really like to see an update to integrate Android (and Apple if they really must) cellphones more.  The GPS is the most accurate I've used yet in a stock system.  My kids now insist on taking the SRX everywhere because of the entertainment system (I'm almost positive it's because of the fact that they each get their own seatback monitor with the capability of viewing separate sources).  The sound system is amazing, but then you'd expect that from Bose.  The safety systems are outstanding.  Lane-departure warning, side-blind warning, auto braking, auto adjusting cruise control (this is just PFM), and the list just goes on.  Cargo space is somewhat limited when compared with other luxury SUV's, but then if cargo space is what you're looking for you're probably not going to be buying a crossover.  All-in-all, the SRX is well worth the money (especially if you can find a lightly used demo with several thousands of dollars off).",5

2806, on 12/12/14 15:25 PM (PST),donb1 ,2015 Cadillac SRX SUV Performance 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),"First ""American"" Car "," My last purchase of a ""Big Three"" car was in 1985.  I have had Toyota's with great results. I have been looking for a SUV to replace my 2011 Avalon.  My initial plan was the Lexus RX350. I was taken with the look of the SRX and decided to give it a test drive.  I was impressed with most everything in the car. As a kid I always thought Cadillac was a great car. In the ensuing years GM and Cadillac were never in my thoughts when it came to new cars.  I was happy to give GM a chance once more. I was able to get a good price esp with a $1500 rebate from Cadillac.  The 4 yr warranty and maintenance paid program was a big factor in my decision.  I just hope my faith is rewarded with a quality car.This is a one year follow up. Overall I am very pleased with the car.  I have had one minor issue and it was quickly resolved.  Gas mileage is as anticipated, in other words not great.   I have 12k miles on it and it rides great and looks great.  I noticed yesterday that I do not have a single paint chip on the front!  I can not say that about the Toyotas I have owned.  I do love driving the car and the space is perfect for my requirements.  I an still not crazy about the button-less, knob-less dash design. I am getting used to it but I am not sure I would get another one.  The navigation system is just horrible.  It cannot find well established roads, the time calculations are wildly out of whack and the routes can be interesting.  This system falls well short of what this car deserves.  The rest of the CUE system works fine most of the time.  The rain sensing wipers have a mind of their own, coming on for no apparent reason on bright sunny days.  Two year update on this car.  Overall the car is still excellent. The issues I mentioned remain.  Over time I have found the cup holders to be awkward. This design issue was corrected in the new model.   For some reason my memory seat quit working. I followed the instructions in the owners manual to no avail.  I mentioned it to the dealer we told me the manual was incorrect and he showed me how to reset the seat.  The car is otherwise, working well and I have no regrets at buying it.  The blind spot monitoring, cross traffic alert and lane departure warnings are great. I really appreciate them. I am happy that Cadillac has achieved quality parity with imports in the class.  It has been an enjoyable ownership experience so far.Year 3 update. I am still enjoying this car.  I have mentioned a few of my dislikes. These are my personal pet peeves but overall I could say I am very glad I bought this.  The paint has held up much better than the paint on my Toyotas.  Chances are good I will buy another Cadillac, most likely it will be the SRX successor.  My trial of buying another Big Three car has worked out very well. There will always be naysayers but I will not be one after this ownership experience",4

Trips to New England, the Great Plains and many trips in between. The Good: Quiet, comfortable ride. Quality materials. Most comfortable driving car I've owned including a Lexus RX200. The Not-So Good: Front A pillar blind spot. The front pillar is so large it often blocks people walking in a crosswalk if you are turning a corner. Headlights: Just plain dim. Almost worthless. SatNav: Just ridiculous. The suggested routes it takes are miles out of your way. Google Maps is far more accurate on choosing a route. The software needs a major update but updates are few and far between. Acceleration: Don't expect to win any races. Anemic at best. The Bad: Timing chain issues. Seriously? Of all the cars I've owned over 40 + years, including Lexus, Ford, Audi, BMW, on and on, this is the only car where a timing chain has needed replacement. If your 'Check Engine' light comes on, be afraid. Very afraid. This little repair item will set your bank account back, oh, say about $2000. Apparently, timing chain issues are common with this GM engine no matter which car; Cadillac, GMC or Chevrolet. You've been warned. Depreciation: The SRX has one of the highest depreciation rates of any used car. This is great if you are looking for a nice, used high-end luxury SUV for a bargain price, but not so great for resale value.

Appearance-wise, the SRX is great looking SUV, but that is where my positive opinion of it ends.  It only has 17,000 miles on it, but it looks like it has over 100,000.  The leather seat is already worn and cracking, the interior panels are popping out of place, and the leather on the steering wheel is faded.  The SRX is a very cheap feeling vehicle.  The rear hatch doesn't open because water got inside and damaged it.  The water damage was repaired under warranty, but the dealer won't fix the hatch motor, even though Cadillac acknowledged that it was caused by the water getting in.  Also, the roof trim on both sides are popping up by the windshield and I can't get it back in place.  Performance wise, the SRX is severely underpowered.  The 3.0L under the hood is not competent enough to move this SUV and it feels like I am towing something, but it's just the lack of power.  The technology in it is a joke.  Bluetooth doesn't work and when you try to pair the phone the system freezes.  If I have a USB cord plugged into my phone the car won't recognize it and says it is not supported.  The navigation is garbage, very inaccurate.  The whole interface is overly complicated and slow.  Luckily, this vehicle was inherited and not purchased.  My family gave up on domestic vehicles long ago and the SRX is a reminder of why.  You can do no better than purchasing a pre-owned Japanese luxury vehicle.  They are super affordable, reliable, and have great resale value.  There is a reason why a used Lexus RX350 with 100k miles cost the same as a used SRX with 30k miles.",3

I have loved this crossover and have never had any issues.  Aside from a few minor recalls, this vehicle has been virtually maintenance-free!  I have to admit that after 4.5 years I have racked up a meager 33,000 miles (mostly city driving), but have had the opportunity to take it for a couple of long road trips.  Except for sluggish acceleration, it drives like a dream.  I have the pop-up Nav screen and the sound system is awesome!  The interior is beautiful and the ambient lighting (at night) is a nice touch.  The seats are comfortable and the ride is very smooth.My major complaint is the lack of room in the back seats. We have a massive car seat for my son, which only works in the middle of the backseat.  With another on the way, it has come time to get a larger vehicle.  If it weren't for needing more room, I'd drive this until the wheels fell off, which I'm sure would be a very long time from now at the rate we're going!One thing I think could be improved is the vents...I live in Houston, Texas and the summers here are brutal.  I'm sure it didn't help that I picked a black SRX with charcoal interior...but the A/C system was a little too slow to cool the vehicle some days.  I ended up using the Onstar remote start feature a lot to get the car going and cooled off early.All in all, I would definitely recommend this Caddy and I would consider buying one again (once the kids are older and in smaller booster seats)!",5

Despite many complaints from many buyers, GM and Sewell resolve this issue with a letter to complainants telling them they don't know how to fill their car.The other issue is a slushing sound in the gas tank.This is very annoying and sounds like a lead ball rolling around in the back.

This poor showing despite having a less powerful engine put into the car which sacrifices pick up power and supposedly giving better mileage.

It is docile and precise but can roar when you put your foot down. My opinion of it would be far, far more favorable if we hadn't seen the early timing chain failure at a bit over 50,000 miles.  The car was maintained by the Cadillac dealer for the first 30,000 miles. Thereafter I did the maintenance. I changed the oil every 3300 miles regardless of what the oil monitor said. I never even saw a Change Oil message.   One evening we were driving it home up a gentle hill at about 35 mph. There was a horrible noise, grinding, clicking, and it died. We were barely able to pull into an empty parking lot. The left upper timing chain had slipped. The engine had gouged cylinders, two bent rods, a holed piston, and two valves in the sump. Other valve bits and a lot of oil damaged both cats. The only thing salvageable was one head. The dealer wanted $11,000 to repair it because we were out of the LY7 timing chain secret warranty extension program deadlines. I found a new/rebuilt engine for $3500 delivered and did the work myself -- making certain that the timing chain system parts were marked Cloyes True Roller USA -- discovering that it's impossible to change the engine in this car without taking it out/rebuilding it in pieces OR dropping the front subframe in unit. We also experienced the dreaded Cadillac dead car/won't release the key electrical issue which eventually required the replacement of both engine and transmission control units. And at this late date I've run into a number of the 2-hour minor signal bulb replacement issues. This was our last GM product.",1

Thee dealer could not tell us . In 2 weeks the check engine light came on. Took to dealer who ran diagnostic and found a cyl was damaged due to low oil.

My biggest gripe is the fact that my friend's Accord (and naturally my TL) are much more luxurious then this ""Luxury"" SUV. GM's gotta work on interiors. ",3.5
2925, on 07/12/17 17:03 PM (PDT),William ,2004 Cadillac SRX SUV Rwd 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 5A),Could have been a great car," I love the looks and handling of my SRX. It's 13 years old now and holding up well with the exception of rust on the drivers side wheel well. I've noticed this on several others and the body shop believes it is caused by a poor factory seal between the inner and outer surface. The car is labeled a sports wagon and truly lives up to that name. The front seats are firm which I prefer but combined with the stiff suspension they can quickly become uncomfortable on roads that are anything other than flat and smooth. The dash has a nice layout compared to many newer vehicles with the exception of the heater controls which are located low in the center close to the console. They are loaded with many small buttons and digital readout. Seems easy enough to use but a simple adjustment like switching on the defroster or turning up the fan may require looking at the controls instead of the highway and I've discovered it can be dangerous taking eyes off the road with it's quick and responsive steering. The storage is great and its handled everything I've thrown at it over the years, which is a lot. The major drawback is the drivetrain. The 3.6 v6 motor has all the power I could ever ask for but I'm afraid to use it because these motors suffer from timing chain issues and there are three of them. Second to that is it's oil consumption. The motor requires 6 qts Mobil One and has always been thirsty for more which Cadillac considered normal. Thirsty btw has been anywhere from one qt per 800-1500 miles. The second major drivetrain problem is the transfer case chain. The supplier provided weak chains the first couple years of production and they are prone to stretching and slipping. At least the replacements are properly tempered. Repairs like spark plug, coil and injector replacement require the upper intake plenum be removed which adds to the cost of repairs. I was quoted $310.00 for spark plugs after the warranty was up so I learned to do it myself. Lastly, the car requires two different tire sizes which limits choices and rotating. The oem Goodyear's on mine ran close to $1000.00 mounted.  I love this car, it's served me well, still looks and drives like new but I would never buy another.",2

Despite negative reliability ratings from Consumer Reports, the only maintenance issue I've had was the collapse of the two front shock absorbers, which the dealer immediately corrected.  The vehicle has a wonderful ride and great handling characteristics, especially on the highway. It's quiet and comfortable, and the seats are firm and very supportive. My wife, who is not easily impressed with domestic makes, really loves it. It's been great on road trips, averaging 24 MPG on the highway. The Northstar V8, is considerably more thirsty I'm told, but I don't miss the horsepower...the V6 is quite responsive.   I recommend the car without reservation.",5

It gets 26 MPG on long trips. Its city gas mileage is not so good though at around 16 MPG.  This truck is fun to drive, has great power for a V6, and has excellent styling.  Its negatives are the unconfortable back seat (too stiff and upright), the V6 is noisy when accelerating, the information center controls are difficult to operate, the very wide door sills makes graceful entry difficult for women and puts dirt on men's slack bottoms, there is no adjustment for the shoulder belt height (where it contacts the neck), and no power opener for the rear hatch.

I spend over 4 hours a day in the SRX and it is fantastic.  It has become difficult for me to get comfortable in other vehicles.  For a V6, it does everything I ask it to do quickly and quietly.  A yound woman co- worker who was riding in the car actually burst out with a ""NICE!"" during heavy on-ramp acceleration.

This is the first generation SRX and it was built on a truck platform, which translates to DURABILITY.  Trucks are built to last and this is one tough-built SUV.  But for all of its ‘truck DNA’ this is a fantastic passenger vehicle for daily use and highway driving — great road car.  The interior is well laid out and super comfortable (excellent front seats).  Reliability has been terrific and maintenance is generally inexpensive, even at the Cadillac dealer.  I did have to replace the timing chains at 92,000 miles due to a supplier quality issue — at my expense.  That’s it.  Gosh, my only regret about this outstanding SUV is that it’s got 154,000 miles on the odometer now In 2018 and I know it’s getting long in the tooth.  I’m actually shopping for a newer SRX (first generation) with much lower miles.  2009 was the last year for this truck-based SRX, so hopefully there are some pampered low mileage ones stills out there.  The 2010+ models were totally redesigned using a car-based FWD chassis, so they’re smaller, lighter, and less durable.",5

I'm older now and getting in and out of it is so easy even for my elderly mother.Always having a sports car in the past it handles remarkably well.

I have to say that the V8 engine makes quite a difference (my mother has the V6). However, you really only feel the extra power if you accelerate while already moving (like passing) and then it flies! Off the line this vehicle sort of lumbers as it is quite heavy. Also, my SRX does feel much sturdier and less hollow than the V6, I'm not sure why. My drive to work is 40 minutes and I actually enjoy it now, it is very relaxed and has a great factory stereo... as opposed to my VERY unreliable Saab which had less than 30,000 miles!

I read one criticism was that the center console had two levels, and that you have to remove the top layer to get to the bottom, if you don't like this feature, remove the upper tray, and it becomes one large compartment.  The handling was a very pleasant experience, and all of the controls are thoughtfully positioned.

The SRX rides as one would expect a Cadillac -- very smooth and soft, yet the handling is quite acceptable. Oddly enough the FX had better gas mileage. On a round trip from Long Island, NY to Allentown, PA I achieved 18 MPG on the SRX averaging 70-80 mph. Similar conditions with the FX yielded 21 MPG. The last time I owned an American car was in 1982. I've gone foreign ever since. GM has done something nice here to win me back.

Having driven very flashy cars over my life time, I was worried that the SRX may not get the looks I was use to. But having bought black on black, it gets attention everwhere I go, so I highy recommend the SRX when life tells you the desire for a two seater has past, but you still do not want a boring box on wheels.............simple visit your local Cadillac dealer.

We average 17 mpg (city) and 23 mpg (road).  We LOVE the automatic folding 3rd row, especially with 3 kids.  It's easy for the kids to get into from the 2nd row.

This, of course makes seeing the road and other traffic much easier.  We do believe this is a safety feature.  We feel secure with the knowlege that there are air bags in front, side, and upper side areas.  We love the low sill which makes it easy to load and unload the cargo area.

Because my original warranty had expired before the headlights had  become so dim that I started noticing there was an issue, I had to buy aftermarket lights and replace them ourselves.

It  is ridiculous that I had to pay for something that comes standard on a vehicle and shouldn’t have be replaced unless wrecked, especially at its price point. Shame on Cadillac/GM.

I have owned mine for 16 months and have had no issues with it mechanically. City driving yields around 15 miles per gallon and highway numbers come in around 18 miles per gallon. These numbers are a bit lower than I had hoped for, but the trade off is a nicely appointed ride with many cool luxury features. I am happy with the performance factor, as this caddy has plenty of zing under the hood to get you going there in a hurry. Cargo space allows for 4 sets of golf clubs, but with some difficulty, as it seems to be a bit lacking in width in that area. By comparison, my 2015 Honda CRV actually has more room for your cargo. My wife isn't a fan of the touch sensitive buttons, but isn't interested in learning either. Overall, an excellent suv, featuring good looks and power, and I would rate the reliability as 5 stars.",4

When gaining access to the vehicle, sometimes the seat thinks I'm a Hobbit!  So before I get in, I hold the #2 button on the seat to set it for me.  My wife has no problems so maybe it's just me?  LOL  The handling and performance is based a lot on the tires.  Had new ones put on and everything has improved.  last winter, we did have some snow and the vehicle impressed me with its handling in that environment.  Like everywhere else, the city dosen't plow the residential streets and I was really amazed how well it handled in several inches of snow.  Again, tires do make a difference!",4

Now Cadillac CPO vehicles and Cadillac did stand behind all repairs and took care of me with another vehicle to drive while the repairs were done.

3113, on 05/31/16 06:20 AM (PDT),Evelyn ,2014 Cadillac SRX SUV Premium 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 6A),Too many repairs," I bought this car over a Range Rover Evoque, a BMW x5, and an Audi Q5.  What a mistake.  Based on my experience with this car I will never buy an American car again.  I have less than 20,000 miles on the car and I have had it in the shop at least 8-10 times for various issues.  Warning lights come on when there's nothing wrong with the car.  Driver's window has failed three times, in that without any warning it will not go up; instead it goes half-way up, grinds around, and goes down again.  The motor has been replaced and prior to that the gaskets around it were replaced.  Taking it in tomorrow for the third time.  The equipment in the cargo space is useless if you want to partition it off with the provided adjustable bar.  The bar is not solid, and items that you want to protect will slide through.  The temperature controls are supposed to be easy but they're not; you have to figure out the right touch on a flat surface, or you have to slide your finger across a very small area.  All while taking your eyes off the road.  The navigation system is very disappointing.  The maps are difficult to adjust, and the routes provided by the system are often the most confusing or the longest routes possible.  Again, I deeply regret buying this car and will trade it in as soon as the driver's window is fixed.",1

This one does!  Couldn't quite pull off the luxury package so we got the base and I do love it.  Loved it from afar from the first time I saw it.  My only issue is blind spots...they take a bit to get used to.  If I had to do it over, would have for sure gotten the rear camera.  Even with the base model, it is quite luxurious.  Great interior, easy to use and fun to drive.  Great gas mileage around town (over 17) and handles well in the snow and ice.  Feels sturdy when driving - we drove a few of the competitors which felt light weight and unstable - this one just felt safer when driving.  Interior - the black seemed to be the only model that had ""matching"" interior.  Did not care for one color dash, different color seats, different color carpet...then the wood accents...a little too pimpy for this lady.  Went with the black...black seats, dash and carpet and carbon fiber (rather than wood) and that did the trick.Update:  I have had this for a little while now and still love it just as much as the day we brought it home!  We've taken it on a few trips and for the long haul, the ride is very nice.  I think my only complaint was $25 for a wiper blade...one wiper blade!  But I suppose its all relative...right?Update:  Still in love with my SRX!  I have gone through all 4 seasons now and through rain and snow and ice and everything in between, this baby has taken care of us!

Takes a little getting used to but I have found I am becoming more and more dependent on all these safety features.

This is my first Cadillac, and I am very impressed with this brand.  I get above 17 mpg driving in-town.

3118, on 12/17/13 07:35 AM (PST),roy79 ,2014 Cadillac SRX SUV Premium 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A), I am disappointed in my SRX," The view to the rear is very poor. The back up camera is a necessity. Right turn vision is also difficult. The front seats are hard and uncomfortable. My in town gas milage is below 15 mpg. The on board computer system is very fancy with a lot of Wow factor but it is very difficult to learn and is slow to respond. It is very difficult to make any adjustment safely while driving in traffic. Now that I have gotten accustomed to the CUE system it is easier to operate and I actually like it better than the system in my Lexus RX. The fact that the car does not have a spare tire keeps me from taking it out of town. Cadillac service has not been impressive even when I park it in front of their door, so I expect road service to be extremely poor or nonexistent. I paid over $50K for a car that I can't trust to drive on the highway. The air-condition system is very poor to the point that I never use the auto setting. It is NOT an air-condition system built for Texas. The rear air has to be adjusted every time you get into the car. The transmission is horrible, the worst automatic transmission I have ever seen. At times it shifts so poorly, I think it is going to jerk itself out of the car. I have had problems with it leaking oil in puddles on the garage floor.  Check engine light came on one time, not sure what they replaced. I will not keep the car without a warranty. I like the seat shaker and the big triangles that pop up if you have cross traffic while you are in reverse. Overall the safety features are very good. I think it looks better than the Lexus.",2

Multiple wheel bearings let go before 80k miles and the rear axle at 84k a 4k repair bill thats when I traded it for a truck made in the US. These cars are built in Mexico with cheap parts I would not recommend buying one especially the AWD. Ive had several Cadillac's over the years and the reliability has fallen short on the newer models. I suggest if you thinking about one of these you do you research most consumer reports are rating brand new models in a few days reliability is not a factor.,2
3121, on 02/27/18 04:08 AM (PST),Chet in Michigan ,2010 Cadillac SRX SUV Performance 4dr SUV AWD (3.0L 6cyl 6A),My 1st Cadillac probably will be my last," My dad had a 2000 Seville DTS, had many issues with ignition, door and window actuators etc, but she made 294000 miles when mum sold her after his passing. My mum had a 1998 Seville STS and she got rid of it after she started having issues mostly electrical and door pins falling off. So what do I do after many years later after they were all gone? I buy myself a 2010 Cadillac SRX4. So 4 days after I buy the vehicle, we have major rain storms in S.E Michigan. I come out of work to find mini swimming pools for ants and cockroaches in the passenger side and driver side floors. I was obviously devastated. Initially I thought I had left the sunroof open, but soon found that not to be the case. Having researched further on Google found 2010-2012 Cadillac SRX all 228,000 of them having the same issue. And in the state of California there is a pending class action suit against GM and owners of these vehicles for this issue. For GM does not consider it a safety issue and as such there is no recall. After numerous visits to the dealer I bought this from and threatening the lemon law (Which in Michigan is non existent on a used vehicle btw, only new vehicles, unless used vehicle came with expressed warranty at time of sale, which thankfully I had) they finally fixed the roof leak for free. See, GM was running behind in mid 2009 when they released the newly styled SRX so they used the wrong parts, and shipped out these vehicles to be sold. Over the years of road vibration later, they come lose, and the rain or any other type of water instead of going thru the drain pipes and falling on the road below vehicle, falls inside the cabin. (Also on Google) but GM does not consider a sunroof leak a safety issue so there is no recall. They however fixed the problem from the 2013-17 vehicles by redesigning the sunroof drain pipes.                                                                                                                                                    Now when winter arrives I have a new issue. Check engine light goes on. However engine runs smoothly enough. Upon using my OBD2 tester that I bought from Snapon many years ago, I find the code to be a P0017 code that comes up as 3 possible issues. Could be a lose timing chain (GM had a bad batch of timing chains for their 2009-13 vehicles) or 2 sensors. THANK GOD I TOOK OUT THE WARRANTY AT TIME OF BUYING THIS!!! So they have to fix this new issue with a $100 deductible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Overall fun vehicle to drive. In the snows this year my traction was a bit lose. Probably because the front tires are on the balder side. With a Haldex Stage 3 AWD system I should be having awesome traction. The same Haldex system used on AUDI, BMW and VOLVO vehicles.  All issues fixed she would be terrific. After all I do turn heads on that sunny day in Michigan when I roll past in my Black on Black Cadillac SRX4 3.0 Liter V6 for I am driving Cadillac Style......I think I'll try a Ford Explorer on my next venture.

It was great with nice acceleration and all the features...fully loaded with entertainment package.  I then saw the Performance model with all the same features except the 2.8 turbo and econo mode; however, I liked it better because it uses regular gas, not like the turbo, which requires premium gas.

From the subtle ""tailfins"" to the chrome V on the dash, there's no mistaking it as anything else than the classic American automaker.

I am beyond happy with my SRX. I love the quality of the navigation system and how easy it is to use. All my co-workers are in love with the sunroof and how big it is. I must say I'm always volunteered to do the driving at works since my car is so comfortable. I will say I was a bit skeptic at first going from a two door sports car to a cross over but I must say I am beyond happy. The only problem I have encountered with the vehicle is one of the aluminum pieces by the driver mirror fell off. I took it to the dealership and it seems a few people have had the same issue.,5

I didn't use the sport mode until I got it home. This has eliminated any concerns I had about pick up and the ability to pass on the highway. I bought the luxury model without the nav system.  Onstar downloads turn by turn navigation directly to the small screen on the steering wheel. It also comes over your stereo system prior to a turn.  Brilliant!  The pop up and rear view camera are nice but I am glad I saved the $2400. It also comes with rear and front parking assist without the camera and pop up.  The interior is incredible and really makes the driving experience a dream.  Great value for a luxury crossover!,4.875

Love the NAV, Weather reports, 40 gig hard drive.  Nice interior.   On the road, it feels very stable, quiet, very German.  With curves it feels like a truck.   My only wish is for more power.  The 265 hp is adequate but with such low torque, the SRX never feels that fast.  Took the car in today for a minor problem, they gave me a CTS with 3.6 L engine.  Wish they put it in the SRX.

If you purchase the srx with the standard 3.0 liter engine it's important to remember that performance is not what you will get. I was pleased with the way the car handled (we travelled to Florida 1585 miles) and the fact that I wasn't the least bit fatigued after driving for 27 hours with on nights rest.

The bottom line is that you are paying for the ""toys"" in this vehicle rather than performance.  I expected a vehicle priced this high should have some pep when it comes to the gas pedal.  It's pretty sluggish when it comes to shifting.  In automatic mode, it was revving at 4500 rpms before it shifted into 3rd gear.

A real looker, and there aren't too many of them out there alongside all of those Ford Edges and Nissan Muranos. The interior is impressive, even though we don't have the large nav screen, it still looks great. Expensive looking. The leather is high quality and the reason we bought the 2012 is because it really doesn't look worn at all.. We've only recently figured out why it doesn't look worn - it's very uncomfortable!! I'm 6'0 and had to sit in the backseat for 4 hours, and honestly it was less comfortable than an airplane for me. My head kept hitting the roof, i couldn't put my knees straight out, and for some reason this models' back seats don't recline (thought that was standard but it may only be for Performance models) so you're literally sitting stick-straight the whole time and the seats don't give in any way. The front seats are much more comfortable than the back, but still less comfortable than our 2013 Jetta SE.

3223, on 09/07/16 06:23 AM (PDT),JTM ,2016 Cadillac SRX SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 6A),"Cadillac SRX 2016, Thoughts"," PROS: Engine, Handling, Front Passenger/Driver Room, Technology, Road Holding, and Ride Comfort. CONS: Fuel Economy, Curb Weight, Rear Passenger Room, Visibility, Noise (from Panoramic Window).  2016 Cadillac SRX was heavily discounted during the month of August 2016 and I decided to purchase one. Here are my thoughts after the first 500 miles. The car is pretty nimble for an SUV, actually 0 to 60 in about 7.5 seconds. Brakes feel very spongy, therefore,  one needs to press the brake pedal harder than normal for the car to stop. I presume, the car is still ""breaking in"" so I will monitor the braking issue and update after 3000 miles or so. The huge panoramic window is great, however, at highway speeds, it does get noisy. Have the Cadillac dealer adjust the windows to reduce the noise. Fuel economy is poor (so far). Again, I was told the engine needs to break in for max fuel efficiency. The transmission ""jerks"" between 1st and 2nd gear, however, this is normal. This SUV tries to balance the ""sporty"" aspect and the ""family hauler"" aspect so it does handle ""sportier"" when you push the vehicle. Moreover, this is ideal for a family of 4 to get around as well. If you have a larger family, Cadillac is working on another SUV between SRX/XT5 and Escalade. It is slated to be released around 2018. The SRX does have great warranty (4yr, 50K (basic) and 6 yr, 70K mi (powertrain)). Also, the first 4 years of maintenance are included with a new vehicle (oil changes, etc). The tires are Michelin Latitude and they ride pretty well. The ride comfort, in general terms, is excellent and the suspension soaks road bumps/imperfections pretty well. I have not had a chance to ride in the snow yet. I will update with the snow performance at a later time. The CUE system is mediocre and some folks may find the small lag time in response from the system frustrating. If on highway, use care when operating CUE as you may need to take your eyes off the road to adjust settings on the CUE system. Music/Entertainment options include: CD, MP3/HDD, XM, Radio. My unit did come with the Navigation/Bose 10 speaker set up. I did not have the Driver Assistance Package so cannot comment​ on it. Reliability: one has to keep in mind that the SRX is at the end of its life, therefore, unlike the XT5, one is buying a proven car which has most of its ""kinks"" worked out. For example, in 2010, GM decided to use the 2.8 Turbo and the 3.0L V6 on the SRX. The Turbo did not sell well and there was reports of engine trouble since people were using ""regular"" gas to power the Turbo engine (which is a big no-no in the automotive industry, NEVER use Regular gas in a Turbo engine, no matter what the manual says). The 3.0 V6 was underpowered to move the heavy SRX and was also discontinued. Then GM decided to use their corporate 3.6L V6 and that was the best match for a heavy SUV such as the SRX. Hence, you are getting a proven vehicle in the SRX. The XT5 is on its first year in 2017 and I, for one, do not feel comfortable being the guinea pig for GM's new vehicle line, especially, when I am shelling out 40K + on a new XT5. The SRX seems like a solid choice in the Cadillac lineup as far as reliability is concerned. Now, there are sensors everywhere on this vehicle.  So, expect some kind of sensor failure at some point during ownership, however, the engine/transmission combo is a ""proven"" for this vehicle. By the way, use ""regular"" gas for the 3.6L V6 engine. Cadillac has been trying hard to ""remake"" their image. They have moved their HQ from Detroit to New York and has taken on the ""Dare Greatly"" motto in an effort to set themselves apart from the rest of GM's vehicle lineup. With this in mind, I found the dealership experience to be very pleasant. All I had to do was show up and agree on a price. The sales team did the rest of the work including, calling my insurance to transfer the policy from my trade-in vehicle to the SRX. They did a lot of ""leg work"" to have me out of the showroom in about 1 to 2 hours. They did offer food and beverages for the Cadillac customers and was very polite and pleasant to deal with. Currently, the Lexus leads the pack in dealership experience, but Cadillac is not too far behind.",5

I spent upwards of 40k for a car that malfunctioned with less than 300 miles on it. I don't know what the dealership (Barton Birks Chevrolet in Newburgh NY ) did to prep this car for delivery but obviously something got missed? This is not the outcome I expected after trading in a Honda CRV that never needed anything other than oil changes and tires. The dealership where the car was towed advised that the code read ""throttle body assembly"". This car just came out of the factory!!! I bought a new car so I could trust that when my family was away from home that the car we bought would keep them safe. Perhaps this is why they push the extended warranty at purchase.

The real problem with this car is it's suspension. Tie rods and intermediate shafts seem to be a recurring problem. Having 300HP going to the front wheels puts a lot of strain on those weak legs.

Compared mine with new Cadillacs and found the same thing. Changing the Bass up or down made no difference. Complained to dealer and they said that is just the way the Bose is.

I add a quart about 2000 miles after the oil change, and that seems to keep the light from coming on.  It's not a big deal.  Just buy a case of oil.  Now the bad: All the little pieces are falling apart.  The right headlight assembly fell out: $800, but instead we fixed it with clear duck tape, which looks crappy.

It helps to work for a dealership and get employee price. I burn 3/4 of a pint of oil between oil changes not bad. although these cars are known for drinking oil. ",4.75

When it ran out, let the fun begin. They use cheap quality parts and is not equal to the price you pay. Last night, March 20, 2008, the bolts and lug nuts broke off the front tire, leaving only one to hold the tire on, the other one that was on was loose. Today they tell me the hub assembly for the opposite wheel needs to be replaced. WHAT! This car only has 60,000 miles!!! Not to mention the oil leak that was reported back in December '07.

My left side mirror is loose and the right passenger door molding fell off. There was a little bit of vibration between 70 to 80 mph but a good set of Michelin tires fixed that.

I had some problems with Actuator motor on the AC, automatic levelers, ticking noise caused by me pinching a wire going to the hazard lights. It took me forever to figure that one out. Recently Motor went bad at 137,000 miles after a timing belt broke. Interference motor, terrible idea.      I bought the updated replacement motor.  Hoping it will be around a long time now.

Since 2006, I have replaced not only 1 but 2 engines and now this one quit yesterday. There are problems with the electrical system in it. The sunroof opens and closes when it wants to, the car is definitely a lemon and Cadillac should do something to alleviate some of the cost since it was their bright idea to sell an American made car that was produced in a foreign country.

Cylinder missfire, $910. Speedometer and odometer went out. Power steering went out. Everytime i braked, steering wheel would jerk and pull car all over the road. Sometimes couldn't pull key out of ignition, have to keep shifting till it came out. Slow coolant leak. finally car would start again, engine problems. just parts estimated $1500. im junking the car.

It is so quiet and smooth you can hardly tell it is running when in idle at a stop light.  I am selling for a newer 4x4 but will always like this car.

With a loss of apx. $4,500.00 in repairs, parked the thing, using it as lawn ornament.  Engine and cooling system is crap. Cadillac offered $1000.00 rebate if we would buy a new cadillac.

All normal maintenance has been preformed by an independent shop (I have never been to a dealer). My mechanic is a trusted professional that checks the Cadillac service bulletins  and keeps it on the factory service schedule. He also checks the built in diagnostic tools by connecting a little computer to the car. This seems to be the most important item done to the car.

The head controllers, which control the A/C temp cost about $1000 a piece and the car has two of them, my radiator light is always on after much tampering, and the Air Bag light is always on, which could be the result of a $701 part. Last fall, 2007, the car was being driven from Memphis to Atlanta and the transmission gave out. A $3,000 fix, there was a leak in the A/C Tubing and that was around $80- $90, the way things are connected seemed random. I had a fuse blow out and it knocked out my radio, my interior lights, my automatic door locks, and my fog lights. Love to car, just high maintenance. ",4

I found a front lower control arm for $100 on ebay with 22k miles and a radiator on radiatorexpress.com for $125.

It will cruise along at 130kmh all day without getting tired. The only mechanical failure I have had was a blown rear shock. Engine wise,it has been strong as an ox and not let me down.

I have had several German cars and this 1 is no different. Early models 97's early 98's had some electrical issues. If buying used look for late 98 or newer. Car rivals small BMW, Mercedes if you get one without eletrical glitches. Excellent room comfort and ride. Good used car buy resale is poor due to early eletrical issues.

3758, on 07/08/18 12:06 PM (PDT),R. Booth ,2018 Cadillac XT5 SUV Premium Luxury 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),The most dangerous vehicle I've driven," Having the Cadillac name I was expecting a quality vehicle. What I found was disappointing. During my first drive I found that the hidden shift buttons on the back of the steering wheel will shift the transmission with it set to ""Drive"" or ""Manual"". I accidentally touched the down shift side on the freeway suddenly finding myself in a much lower gear than I needed with traffic behind me making emergency moves to miss the suddenly slowing Cadillac.  That was just he first of many issues. Next was the cruise control. If you gently touch the cruise + side you accelerate 1 mile an hour per touch, like every other cruise control I've used. But with this one hit a bump as you press the button or push a little too hard it adds 5 miles an hour. With traffic around me traveling at 77+ mph and me at 76 I pushed the button to match the flow of traffic. I pushed it too hard and found myself doing 81 mph. A felony in Virginia. The next safety issue is with the windows that are another pressure sensitive issue. With a light touch the windows go up or down as you hold the button down. Press down with more pressure and the windows open completely. Not an issue my Lincoln does the same, but if you press or pull the switch up too far it also goes completely up by itself. This is a hazard for children whose fingers could be severed by the window. God forbid their head got caught in it.   Handling of the XT5 is ok but nothing to write home about. The Sport setting stiffens the suspension a bit and cuts down on body roll. Brakes are good. Transmission is an issue. It's an 8 speed automatic. If you live in a fairly flat area you won't mind it. Here in the Virginia mountains with back roads that wind up and down you'll notice the transmission is constantly shifting. Slow down for a corner, shifting, going up a hill, shifting. That's not only uncomfortable but really dulls the performance of the 331 hp engine. So i ended up keeping it in manual most of the time while we drove the back roads of the Shenandoah Valley.  The vehicle is loaded with so many gadgets that it really is like driving a video games. Center touch screen OK but I don't like all the in cabin lights during night driving. But that is more my issue as I find this with most of today's cars. Being able to turn off that screen in the middle of the console would be a great plus in my opinion.",1

I am in my mid-forties and never thought I would be so car crazy.  This vehicle is perfect.  Lots of tech features.  Some of the things I have been pleasantly surprised by is the visibility and handling in bad weather conditions and at night.  I also like the ability to switch transmission from front wheel, AWD, and sport mode.  Sport mode is fun and it gives a little mid-life crisis sport car feel or at least as close as you can get when trying to be practical with a family of 5.  I live in the Midwest and so deal with the four seasons.  This car cruises through them all.   If I had only one complaint is the start/stop feature and gas mileage - not great.  I am completely used to it, but prefer it didn't have it and perhaps a bit better on gas.   I looked at all the luxury models and this had the best combination of styling, technology, comfort, and overall handling.   Wife loves the vehicle and the kids love the vehicle which isn't easy since all of them have their opinions and different preferences.   I have been in a number of accidents unfortunately and the safety features make me feel really safe.   I cannot recommend this SUV enough.

After 3 good years the warranty was up and I wanted a sportier SUV. I was looking at the AMG GL43 and the Porsche Macan GTS. Both great vehicles, fast, but expensive. Cadillac was offering 5 years 0 percent interest. So on a whim we went to look at the XT5. We opened the door of the Platinum and my first response was OMG. The interior design, materials,fit and finishes were 5 Star. The Cadillac has a nice exterior design, is very spacious, a large tilting back seat, with lots of storage. The engine and transmission are very smooth. The front seats, instrumentation, NAV, safety features are excellent. And the ride is very smooth especially for long road trips. Yes, this SUV is not as fast or sporty as the two German SUV’s that I was considering. But the XT5 is larger, quieter, well designed and is far less expensive. I drive it in the AWD mode all the time so the handling is acceptable for an SUV. For me, the Cadillac was the way to go. I would recommend this vehicle.",5

Initially, the service was great and then I stepped in the car to drive away with the salesperson and it was not what I initially sat it. It had no heated seats and it had miles on it and I initially sat in a new car ( I had heated seats in my Terrain that I traded in). So anyway, get the car home and weeks later, I'm hearing a weird noice and it's the brakes. I shouldn't hear anything on a brand new car let alone a Cadillac that I'm paying and arm and a leg to have. I've had the car in the shop several time regarding the brakes. In car with my daughter, the car wouldn't let me drive it, it was so bad. Turn's out it was a chip that was related to the brakes after me bringing the car in multiple times, the finally get that squared away. So the last brake incident in July , my oil and tire rotation was supposed to be done, so I would not have to see these 🤡 for. Long time as I feel like I'm there all of the time (for a 2018 Cadillac). I get an email that I need an oil change and then my car indicate that on the display. I call the dealership and said I thought you changed my oil and the lady said that the computer said yeah it says right here that you're not due til March. I said well, my sucker says December of this year. So she says come in so we can take the light out. How bout actually doing the oil change.

The annoyances outweigh the pleasures.  The auto shut off feature is super annoying.  I thought I would get used to it but...NO.  For example, when I stop for coffee in the morning at the drive through,   my car stops and restarts constantly - when I order, pay, etc. Every time you stop at a light, stop sign,  on and on.  Passengers constantly question what is wrong with it.  I have read on a couple of blogs that this feature stopped working for a couple of customers after time and I pray that this happens with my vehicle.      I have started putting the car in Park every time I stop, but this is annoying in and of itself.  There is a  LOUD  bell that sounds every time you hit the park button and I am advised this cannot be disabled as it is a safety feature.  Apparently someone who has been driving for over 40 years doesn't know how to tell when they have put their car in park.  You can disable the VERY LOUD parking assist system but this has to be done each time you start the car.  There is also a rattle in the back passenger seat that we have yet to isolate.

Another ""feature"" I do not like is when I come to a complete stop - the engine stops.  I was told that was a feature to save gas and can not be uninstalled.  I ask you, when I pay $65,000 for an automobile - do you think I'm concerned with whether I get 20 mpg or 22 mpg?  It is annoying that every time I stop - the engine quits.

The seats are comfortable for me.  The back seat is OK but not super roomy.  The cargo area isn't bad either.  I can put a lot of groceries in the cargo area.  The moving bar that is in the cargo area tends to rattle a little bit and it's annoying.  I absolutely hate that the stop/start feature cannot be turned off.  The sound system is medium.  And the infotainment is easy to use and convenient. The gear shift is annoying when shifting into reverse.  Sometimes it takes a couple or three tries.  The interior is pretty and I love the various pages for the dash.  Android Auto works well and helps to keep my eyes on the road.  The large sunroof is great and I love that I can cover it on sunny days.  I've owned the car for about 8 months without any mechanical issues yet.  My gripe is the gas mileage is horrible.  It's supposed to get 19 mpg in the city but I'm only getting 11-12 while driving around town.  The freeway MPG isn't bad (20 plus).  I work out of my home and most of my trips are fairly short.

Love the styling, smooth ride, quietness and on board technology.  I've been pleasantly surprised with the fuel mileage, averaging just over 27 MPG and getting nearly 29 on a couple of road trips.  My daily commute is on a two lane highway so I may be getting a bit better than someone who has to drive in heavy city traffic or stop and go.  I have 2 minor complaints.  When the headlights are on the bright setting, it seems like they should illuminate out further than they do.  My other complaint is with the lane departure feature.  I'm good with a vibrating seat or flashing light or even a chime or buzzer.  I don't like that the vehicle will actually attempt to slightly maneuver the steering wheel in the direction it thinks the car needs to go.  While it makes the correct decision most of the time, there are driving situations where it does not.  In those instances, I have to ""fight"" the steering to override the decision and often end up over-correcting.  Not to the point where I would call it dangerous, but, to the point where I would call it annoying.  Also, I have a slight concern about what could happen when driving on a slippery surface and this happens.  Otherwise, I'm very pleased and really am enjoying the vehicle.",5

I had done my homework and researched it thoroughly. Except for one key area I will explain later. To the point, From day one, I had issues that should have sent up red flags.  On to the important stuff. Once I got the car and drove it for a week, I noticed a rough riding, quirky gas hog that had all kinds of electrical gremlins. The ride is harder than my F-150 pickup! No lie? That short"" break in period "" promised never came about. Gas mileage is aweful. 16 mpg around town with the small engine and 19 on the highway, with a very conservative driver. And only FWD. On to the Gremlins. It started when it wouldn't go into reverse. It's an electronic shifter, not like your conventional cars. On one occasion, it took 15 tries to get it into reverse. Shifting of the 8 speed transmission is sloppy and felt like it's slipping. I was told by the dealer"" It's the normal way it shifts"" . Really? The lift gate would just stop working. Wouldn't work with remote, inside button or outside  switch. The Bose stereo would go flat like my 1960 transistor radio.  Then pop back into this century at any given time. Overall, the quality of the radio was poor anyway. Not up to Bose standard. And the car has unusually loud noise from wind and tires. It is actually distracting to drive for long distances. After about 2,000 miles, a loud clunk could be heard coming from the transmission. Another issue looked at by the dealer but ""could not duplicate."" I could go on and on but I'll wrap it up. Wipers come on for no reason and don't come on when they are suppose to in auto mode. Poor  tracking, seems to chart it's own course going down the road. A recall later and several trips to the dealer has cured nothing. My final word, I looked up Cadillac and found they are 2nd to the worst for ""lemon law "" complaints. Should have done a little more research. Could have saved a bundle of money.",1

When I got my vehicle back after 2 weeks, found that they removed the dash and was not fixed properly as the dash close to the passenger side was misaligned and the under dash led light was also not fixed properly and I have to fix it myself as I don't want my vehicle to sit at the dealer for another week.2) I went out of Country for 2 weeks and when I came back found that the SUV will not start and called roadside assistance, they came and jump started the SUV with a Jump starter ( are you guys kidding me, its a brand new SUV that has done only 1000 miles) -  it took a week for them to fix it.3) Rattling sound coming from rear seat - which I fixed myself after buying some insulation material from Lowes.4) ""Crispy sound"" coming from electrical box located below the left side of driver side dash. The fine crispy sound comes every time I accelerate from 0-30 miles and then disappears - took the SUV to the dealer - they said that everything sounds good ( they don't want to acknowledge)5) After the battery issue was fixed, I started seeing that the voltage of the battery started falling again after a week coming back from the dealer - per dealer, the rear brake light was constantly lighting up ( the company had a recall for this as per the dealer).6) My car has made multiple visits to the dealership in 6 months of owning it - Horrible reliability.Went against Consumer reports rating about reliability and purchased this vehicle and I got burned. Don't waste your money. I ended up selling this vehicle after owning it only for 6 months.",1

The Cadillac Service Department has had it on and off for about 2 of those months. (They have it now as I type this memo) Its currently going on 3 weeks for this visit to the shop. The vehicle has had a host of reoccurring issues from: video from backup camera flickers when in reverse; service rear camera popups in Cue system; service front proximity sensor popup messages; issues with climate controls from the center stack as well as the rear console; folding mirrors sometimes don't respond when you touch the button; auto shutoff when the vehicle is stopped quit working. The Service Department has addressed these issues but some reoccur.  Its been serviced by Cadillac least 7-9 times in these 14 months. The Service manager says he is talking to GM about my issues.  I am seeking counsel. This is by far the most UNRELIABLE vehicle I've ever owned.,2

Seats are comfortable but a greater number of adjustment such as upper split bending/massage option wouldn't hurt.  You might want to order or get one with a spare tire as it's an option otherwise comes with an air compressor not good for certain flats but has roadside assistance.  The start stop function stopped working perhaps as the battery is slightly lower which is normal for lack of use but it's much better that way anyhow as there is no off on switch. There are improvements I would make for future editions such as fog lights, mirror turn signals automatic parking display when entering a parking space instead of only after reverse, less menus inside of menus by having more buttons, some materials are sensitive and delicate such as the dash velour so you have to be careful, I don't think the tires have rim protectors on these vehicles, add color changeable ambient lighting inside, night vision option for animal pedestrian detection which is available on some of their other vehicles.

On Dec. 3, 2017, Feb. 14, 2017 and May 13, 2017 the transmitter that locks/unlocks doors, starts and stops the engine failed.  This is a total of four failures in 7 months (including the one that came with the car). The 'patch' solution is to place the transmitter in a cradle at the bottom of the center console (a solution I discovered in the owner's manual when on a dirt road in AZ, late on a freezing cold afternoon by myself) when the car would not turn on.  However, in the case of car not turning off, the doors won't lock if the transmitter is out of the cradle.  So when out of the car, the car has to remain unlocked.  I'm a travel writer covering 5 states.  This means my car has been left unlocked in hotel parking lots many a night.  I'm a woman, usually traveling by myself, and I can't trust this car will start or stop.  The car hasn't started twice and the engine hasn't stopped twice so far.

Have you ever driven an SUV and thought it must be similar to driving a boat on the water? Yeah, me too. Until I test drove this one - it's actually a lot of FUN to drive! The XT5 has an excellent balance between comfort and handling. It's like driving a small sports car, it handles really well and has great pickup. I've only had it for about a month, but so far it seems super reliable. I expect this car to last a very long time. I'm also super impressed with Cadillac customer service - no other car brand seems to even come close to providing the same level of support.

If I never drove those cars my rating for the XT5 would have been higher.  But the SRX was so much more car for a lot less money.  The XT5 drives about the same as the SRX but the SRX was more luxurious.  It felt more robust too.  The interior of the XT5 is a lot less luxurious as the SRX.  In all the car is a disappointment especially considering it cost $5,000 more than the same 2014 SRX model and has fewer options.  I wish I had kept my SRX.",3

3802, on 01/10/17 00:10 AM (PST),CK ,2017 Cadillac XT5 SUV Premium Luxury 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),XT5 - Buyers Remorse," Over the years I've had very good luck and have been satisfied with several vehicles in the GM family...(Yukon, C5 Corvette, 2014 Stingray and two SRXs).  My previous vehicles operationed beautifully and I was often very happy with the driving exprience.  Given my good luck with GM, I decided to jump into the XT5 (FWD Premium Luxury Package).  The styling is terrific and the car is comfortble.  However, the instrument cluster is a recycled dash of the previous SRX but with illumination that is way too dim for day light driving.  The result is a dull, lackluster display not befitting a luxury flagship vehicle.  The Auto/Stop function is downright annoying and possibly even dangerous in heavy stop and go traffic.  With the vehicle shutting off / stalling all the time it gives the driver a very uneasy feeling when you need sudden acceleration, such as in making sudden turn in an intersection.  GM HAS to disable and or allow the driver to opt out of this feature.  Now, with only two weeks of owning my XT5, the entire Cue system has gone haywire and is blacking out and turning on and off at will.  Buyers remorse is an understatement. This flagship line of GM has been struggling for better market share and without a little more thought, time and real world testing, the XT5 and Cadillac for that matter will find itself lagging behind the completion and may fail all together.   Seek out other vehicle options or stick with the SRX until GM sorts out the bugs and design issues.",2

It came equipped with all of the safety tech that I wanted. Because of Edmunds and the Cadillac site, I was able to see all of the available inventory in the four states that would sell to me without sales tax (because I live in OR where there is no sales tax).  I read just about every review on this car. Seems like the reviewers were of two minds on this SUV - either they thought it was a rough ride that was not very sound proofed or a smooth ride that is very quiet. Some complained about the CUE system. I find the car to be a very smooth ride and quieter than my Lexus RX350. The CUE system is much more user friendly than the systems in the BMW and Mercedes to me. Neither of them have a touch screen. Using a mouse/touchpad and trying to maneuver it while keeping your eyes on the road is not user friendly as far as I am concerned. There is a bit of a learning curve, but certainly nothing like the other systems.",5
3804, on 12/08/16 09:22 AM (PST),John ,2017 Cadillac XT5 SUV Luxury 4dr SUV AWD (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Thoughts from an SRX driver," I took my SRX in for warranty work and was given the XT5 AWD as a loaner for one day.  Here is my thoughts based on the 55 miles I put on it. The XT5 is similar to my 4-month-old SRX in terms of pricing and trim level. However, the XT5 is very different in the following ways. Engine: newer engine with auto-start-stop function and a newer transmission.  Secondly, I noticed right away that the led lights are standard and the headlights are not halogen like the similar trim SRX. The XT5 does have the auto start/stop where the engine could be automatically turned off at a red light (by the software). When you step on the gas pedal, the engines turns back on. The car, also, switches between V6 and V4 mode depending on the power needs, similar to Honda's VCM technology. The ride is quiet, smooth, and sure-footed. However, I did feel that the SRX's engine delivers quick power when demanded while the XT5's engine has to figure out how much power the driver needs before delivering it.  So there is a brief lag time since the software has to decide between different modes (V6 vs V4) to deliver power. On the positive note, the XT5 is very fuel efficient compared to the SRX. The nagging windspeed noise originating from the panoramic roof on the SRX seems to have been resolved. The placement of several buttons on the SRX, such as parking brake or Onstar, have been moved around. So there will be a learning curve for the SRX drivers when they upgrade to the XT5. Most importantly, several ""digital"" buttons on the SRX's CUE (ex. such as heated seat button) have been replaced with actual buttons on the newer model. The CUE seems to be more responsive on this upgraded model but there is still a decent amount of time needed to learn it if you are not familiar with the system. The most important difference is the new, redesigned seats.  They are more comfortable than the SRX's seats. My XT5 did come with collision warning, cross traffic alerts, and the seats do have a vibrate function to alert the driver of imminent dangers on the road. Finally, XT5 has a bigger interior and seems less heavy while driving when compared to the SRX. Overall, it is a decent improvement over the SRX. In other notes: if you have a larger family or require more space than the XT5 but cannot afford to break the bank trying to purchase an Escalade, my recommendation is to hold off till the XT7 comes out in 2018-19 timeframe.",5

Our first bucket seats were in our 2002 4 door sedan. We are older folks and have never enjoyed the Cadillac bucket seats. We had a 2013 DTS and those seats did not fit our needs very well. We had to purchase kitchen chair pads from Walmart to get us out of the hole we were in with the vehicle. When we got our 2017 XT5 we thought maybe the seats might be better, nope the same old seats. A friend suggested we visit a Relax The Back store and look at one of their seat units. We did and bought one for our new car. We drove the car from Minn. to Arizona and found the new seat worked just great. When we arrived in Arizona we went right out to a store and bought another unit for the rider seat. This is the first SUV we have ever owned, we have to say we enjoy it very much. It's so much easier to get in and out of this style vehicle.

Did some research before buying. I never owned a Cadillac before and has always owned a Lexus. I was planning to buy a new Van/SUV for my wife as her Toyota Sienna has done 68000 miles on it. Even though the Sienna is a great van, I did not like the fact that AWD has the Run Flat Tires on them, which gives it a bumpy ride and is expensive replacing the tires as it cannot be repaired otherwise it was a great family vehicle for us. My son has been learning to drive and it was also did not look good for him as he was driving a family van. Since my Sienna was well maintained, I good a good appraisal for it, so we decided to buy new car. Initially we saw Pacifica, which my wife did not like - quality of the vehicle was in question. Then we took a test drive in Cadillac xt5, Very good ride, excellent quality overall. People talk about the Cue not being fast enough, I think the Cue is much better than the system in my 2014 MB ML350. I also noted that the xt5 does not have a CD player - which i don't mind as we never use CDs anymore, as we have learned to use USBs/SD cards. The vehicle has 2 USB port in the front console and 2 for the back seats, I would have expected Cadillac to have SD card reader installed - but not a big deal. The other issue is the cargo space, it could have been little bit bigger, the head clearance for back seat is 2 inches short when compared to Lexus RX - hope Cadillac brings an SUV with little bit more space for the back passengers and cargo. There is no other choice, either you go for xt5, or Escalade which is huge. Over all very happy. Have to wait and see how it holds up to its reputation.         The above was my earlier review. Currently my SUV is with the dealer with complete black out of CUE system. Why driving the CUE system completely went dead and an error message saying "" waiting for update media"" and ""copying 0/100"" appeared. I absolutely have no control on navigation, blue tooth etc. The service guy does not know what it means and said their technical guy in off. Its been 4 days and no answer yet. Ended up going to Cadillac owners forum and found out other XT5 owners having same problem and the fis is ti install"" human interface module"" and have to wait for that part to arrive. So frustrated that a SUV that is done 1400 miles and 3 weeks old in service station? what kind of quality they have in their car? I miss my Toyota van and made a blunder buying XT5 instead of Lexus RX350. No more Cadillac.UPDATE: - SOLD IT AT A LOSS",2

After 12,000 miles, I would say CUE is still crap.   A huge problem is that the touch screen requires far too many submenus to achieve even simple commands.  The navigation system relies on out-dated maps which reflected incorrect speeds easily half the time on our 40 state trip.  It got lost about once every thousand miles on interstate segments that had been changed at least 2 years earlier.  It had no detour option and will not reroute even after driving 50 miles on a different highway! Traffic warnings were unreliable.  Fortunately if you have a mobile phone supporting Android Auto (AA), that functions like you would expect a luxury car nav system to function.  AA understands my Bulgarian spouses accent every time.  When driving, handling is fantastic.  This car and turn inside many sedans with a far shorter radius than our SRX.  Pickup is quite peppy.  Mileage is very good for a car of this class.  The gearshift is counter intuitive, and the transmission sometime hunts for the right gear in stop-n-go traffic.

I contacted the service dept. at the dealer about 2 weeks ago and the service adviser didn't even seem to know that the XT5 had a no-turn- off start/stop system so he told me to just keep driving. I then called the salesman who told me to drive the car until the weather cooled down to see if it would turn off on its own. Today I visited the dealer's service department to make sure that I was not injuring the cat since it does seem to try to turn off at the same intersections that it used to. Today's service adviser printed off reasons that the system does not work and they are the same reasons that I saw long ago on the internet or in the manual. He told me to just drive the car normally and that I would get a warning from the car if something was wrong.  He also assured me that there are many XT5's out here and that none has reported a start/stop problem, although he did not bother to check my car.",4

However, in this car I feel like a queen.  I really like the safety features that tell me that a car or pedestrian is approaching and from where.  When there is a danger, the driver seat vibrates that alerts you to look at instruments to see what the problem is.  I was disappointed that there is no CD player.  CDs may be on the way out, but most of us still have favorite CDs.  It would be nice to be able to use them.  Also, I was disappointed that no spare tire (unless it is purchased as an addition) or donut was provided.  I only received a can of ""stuff"" to inflate my tire.

The XT5 checks all of the Boxes. Make sure you get the full wrap warranty protection, It covers anything that can happen to the vehicle, from you dogs scratching the interior or exterior, door dings, windshield nicks, replacing your rims if you hit a curb to 24/7 roadside service @ no cost, not even the loaner car.",5

I've owned more than a few SUV's in my including the RX (3), Audi (1), a Highlander, an Infiniti and1 other American SUV besides a Caddy. Had a SRX which quite frankly I didn't care for. I now own an XT5 and it is a great car. Transmission is 8 speed so it's moving through gears nicely. Blue tooth hookup and what I like is if the phone rings, the A/C gets quieter automatically. I like that there are now more buttons and less of that touch screen. I hated pushing the screen to increase the A/C. Now it's a button. The rear view camera can be used as your rear view mirror so if there are people in the back seat, your view will not be blocked. I'm 6 foot but not overweight so I find the seats very comfortable. My legs haven't fallen asleep while driving. All in all, I'm happy with this SUV and I believe it compares favorably with the RX.",5
3824, on 07/12/16 15:34 PM (PDT),Fredrick Dobbs ,2017 Cadillac XT5 SUV Luxury 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Oh You Cad.," This is a second shot at a review after 2000 miles and a fairly long trip of all day driving. First of all. The acceleration is wonderful. The handing is not Lazy boy Cadillac, it's sporty handling corners like a sporty SUV which I guess it is from the performance. Love the handling. Love the silence on the road. I have residual hearing problems from big guns in the military and even with my dodgy hearing I can easily hear my music and audio books on trips, not to mention the helpful musings of my spouse. Braking is excellent if not a tad touchy. You do not have to stomp on these brakes. I love the safety features like lane change warnings, rear crossing warnings and the back up camera although I have never got the need for the digital track in the rear camera to bend its my turning. I know I'm turning. I am very gratified that an American company is making a car of this apparent quality. It gives nothing to the off shore imports. This car is a stand out in a city where you can't swing a dead possum without hitting a BMW and Mercedes. It seems to be some kind of cultural imperative but I've had my share of complements even though I doubt many people look carefully enough to distinguish it from a SRX. The overall appearance of the exterior and mechanicals is stunning and the color I selected, Silver Coast is a stealth car wash avoidance feature. It hides the dirt wonderfully when I am negligent on washing the car.  one last small gripe. I don't like the design of the 18 inch wheels. Kind of seventies looking. Cadillac could do better. Look on the web to get some ideas. My single annoyance with this part of the car and it is a BIG one, is the inability to turn off the stop/start mechanism. You can off foot it and you get lurches. It is not as clever as the propeller hat engineers who designed it think it is. I hate it and would not buy the car again. I can find just about any other car that allows you to disable this dubious feature including other Cadillac models. It works off the brake and you can fool it. If you are at a signal and the engine turns off, just lift your foot off the brake and it will start again. Depressing the brake again while you are waiting will not shut it off a second time. I am not thrilled with the XT two step.  I want to get this all praise out because I think this is a Dr. Jeckel and Mr. Hide car. Mr Hide designed the interior. The dash lights adjust automatically and are too dim in day light for me. I can not manually adjust them higher. They brighten in a parking structure and at night and you can dim them down with the dimmer switch but that switch does nothing to brighten the dash lights in the day. This forces me to use the window with a large numeral for speed determination. This is a problem because of the propensity for the dash to reflect overhead sun at certain times of the day. In fact, same said genius engineer also probably designed the center information center with insufficient shading and helpfully tilted the screen toward to windshield at the top just to make sure that you don't miss getting the screen compromised by the sun reflection.  You can play CSI and count your finger prints on it for lack of seeing other information. The seat is my biggest interior problem. My wife's RX350 has wonderful seats. She is looking for a new car and ruled out the XT5 because of the hard seats and the uncomfortable lumbar support. I have the same complaint. Hard seating not good for long drives. bothers my leg. I had to get a piece of memory foam which my spouse sewed up in a cover to put on the seat. This is a sport seat and not suitable for a SUV in my opinion. All the SUVs I have ridden in and owned have had more comfortable seats. Again. Live with this car before you buy. Rent one and see if the seat suits your back side. I hate them which makes it awkward for a car I now own.  As I said, I am tall and large. When I sit with the seat back, it is obvious they thought to put in a long seat track for tall people but then failed to accommodate any other interior feature to this seating position. The center console is difficult if not nearly impossible to get into. The dash information center is way too far away. The door panels bow out near the front of the car then conveniently bow back in to crowd your arm. Another thing that escapes me is the logic of the seat memory. In any other car you press the memory button and number one for example to set your seat and in the future you just tap the button to make the seat move. In the XT, you have to lean on the button for the entire trip and if you stop pressing, the seat stops moving. To have the seat work automatically you have to turn on a feature in settings. After you do that the car resists any further changes. You have to turn it off to reset memory. In my case that is far too frequently because the seat does not seem to hold the back rest angle and must be readjusted periodically. Brilliant outside, not inside.",3

I love that the vehicle is a V6 with ""cylinder reduction""; only using all six when needed.  The AWD feature is controlled by a button and can be engaged while driving -- therefore, I do not need to use it in dry/warm conditions.  The interior is beyond gorgeous and comfortable.  Handling is seamless and sporty.  Love, love, the vehicle - so far, so good!  The XT5 is made in Spring Hill, TN - another selling point for me as I was looking for an American car.  Last, but certainly not least, the car takes ""regular"" grade gas.  A huge selling point for me.",5

On board center mputer actually shows my best at 41 on a trip home Friday m the mountains.Still frustrated with the arrangement of the indicator light for the electronic c parking brake.

The plus sides of Cadillac XT5 it is quieter almost a eerie quiet. The ride is better, Cadillac has always had that baby buggy ride much softer than the Lincoln. XT5 electric power is the best very smooth with a short turning radius. Possibly one of the best new feathers is the new eight speed automatic transmissionSmooth as glass, at eighty miles per hour tach is reading 1950 RPM about 200 less than the Lincoln MKX.

3829, on 06/07/16 13:17 PM (PDT),Ron L. ,2017 Cadillac XT5 SUV Premium Luxury 4dr SUV (3.6L 6cyl 8A),Update to my initial review," I wrote the below review about nine months ago when I bought the XT5.   I have definitetly changed my rating on this supposedly luxury SUV.   At 2000 miles, the rear spoiler blew off the car on the freeway, nobody hit but real quality, made the American way.   The best news:   at 6,000 miles , the engine BLEW one whole bank of pistons.   Completely new engine took 5 weeks to get in and installed.   I won't go any further other than the fact that if you buy one of these Caddys, expect nothing but headaches.   I recently bought a new 2018 Audi SQ5 and I am now ecstatic I did.   Audi has hit it again with another winner.  So far, this vehicle  outperforms and handles 100% better than anything Caddy XT5 has to offer for only 1 grand more.OLD REVIEW BELOW:Picked up my new XT5 this past Saturday after doing much research and test driving.   I was not even aware this model was being released by GM this early.   Glad I stopped and looked, drove it and got hooked.In the past 3 weeks, tested QX5, RX350, BMW X5, GLE and GLS.I'm very picky when it comes to attention to detail so I tested and looked at many vehicles.   This XT5 is simply amazing for the value and the money compared to some of  the Germans and Japanese brands.  I have been leary about American cars ever since the bailout but tried them out again.  Glad I did...  Without rambling, and after driving all those other vehicles, Caddy was the winner , hands down.    Handling , front, side and rear view amazing, quietness, power, etc were all as good as it gets in my opinion.  I am not a brand loyal person as you can see but I would recommend anyone looking in this category to give the XT5 a good look.My ONLY picky complaint in the piano black entertainment system panel.   It is a fingerprint magnet.   Told you I was picky.   If anyone has anyone particular questions , you can always ask.I will be really anxious to see what the National Crash Tests look like once tested.   So far, I am thrilled with my decision",5

We are trying to buy an American SUV. Also drove the Lincoln MKX which as very good. This Cadillac XT5 was simply amazing. The comfort, ride, handling, visibility, power etc. I was quite surprised.  I went to the Grand Prize Cadillac dealer in Nanuet. Linda was our salesperson. She is patient, wonderful and knowledgeable no pressure what so ever. The car was really great. The Lincoln was very good.  Unsure how the reliability will be which is always an issue with American brands but we are going to lease. Also waiting for crash test information as well.  We will consider this vehicle for sure expect to purchase within a few weeksOther vehicles driven/looked at BMW X5/3, Audi Q5, Highlander, Kia Sorrento, Murano. I realize some of these vehicles are not considered ""luxury"" but looked at them anyway. Criteria is a top safety pick or better and average or better reliability. Unsure if XT5 will meet safety whenever it is tested. hoping it will last for 3 LEASE YEARS. If anyone has any experience or thoughts please feel free. I called corporate Cadillac they are unsure if and when they vehicle will be tested. If I was them I would be making sure it gets tested.",5

3832, on 08/15/16 11:39 AM (PDT),Joe Manley ,2014 Cadillac ELR Coupe 2dr Coupe (gas/electric hybrid DD),I still love it after a year," One year ago I bought a new, no mile, 2014 Model with every option and Kona brown interior. It stickered for over 82K  and I bought it for 46k plus tax and registration. I got a $2,000 check from the state, a $500 rebate from the electric company and the $7,500 federal rebate brought the price down another 10 grand to 36k plus tax and registration. The car is simply stunning. It's beautiful inside and out. Whenever I park it I still look back and smile. It's a joy to drive, all the electronics are simple to operate, suspension is superb, plenty of power and the interior is just gorgeous, comfortable and just works. I usually get around 45 miles one a charge. My commute is 44 miles and when I get home unless it's really cold I will still have one or two miles left or will have just run out of charge a mile or so away. When I drive on the weekends the gas engine gets great mileage and I have never been able to hear when it turns on or off. I still get compliments everywhere I go. I have almost 13k miles on the odometer now and have not had one mechanical failure of any sort. Trouble free and stylish-just love this car.",5
3833, on 02/18/16 16:01 PM (PST),Gene ,2014 Cadillac ELR Coupe 2dr Coupe (gas/electric hybrid DD),ELECTRIC LUXURY ROADSTER," That's what ELR stands for. Coming from a Volt, I found a 2014 with 9000 miles on it as a great ""owners"" car considering my lease is coming up very quickly. It's a head turner, people gather around it, they look, they stare and while it's OK with me, it gets unnerving after while. I watch where I park, especially at places like the supermarket, home depot, etc. It is rare to see on the road. It's a partner when you want to drive it in an economical fashion. It's FASTER than the Volt. It handles BETTER than the volt. Forget about passengers. Forget about lots of storage. I took my 65"" TV home in my Volt. Forget about it with the ELR. It screams success, it's a very special car. I hate to drive it in the rain, I hate it when it gets dirty, I wax it all the time. I get 40+ miles on EV alone. On gas, I dont compete with MPG as I just floor it. Engine sounds a bit loud, it's ok.20's from the factory and it's all good.Update.....it's 8/25/17 now....Still get stares, looks and endless compliments. I now own a '16 GTR Nismo and I get just as much looks and compliments On the ELR as the GTR. Reliable, fun and top of the food chain feelings.",5
3834, on 11/06/15 15:34 PM (PST),BigW ,2014 Cadillac ELR Coupe 2dr Coupe (gas/electric hybrid DD),Wow - Get One If You Can Find One," I'd never bought an electric car before, so I researched the heck out of this thing before I bought it.  I probably read every review and watched every video review out there.  Then I went out and drove the car.  Going in, I expected it to be very much a mixed bag, with some big compromises I might be able to live with given the heavily discounted price.What I found instead was an absolutely stellar car that just didn't fit the conventional narrative and has really slipped through the cracks.   Is it a modern sports car?  No.  But it has plenty of power, nice handling, etc.  The disconnect between what some reviewers said and the car's actual performance was breathtaking.  In the kind of driving we all do in the real world, it will give you absolutely nothing to complain about.  It looks like it ought to be able to take on a Porsche 911 and it isn't that fast, but that is the only way in which the driving dynamics will disappoint you.  Is it a eco-warrior statement car?  No.  No one will actually realize that you are driving something that is better for the environment than a Prius.  So people who want to wear that on their sleeves will hate it because it doesn't make an eco-statement.  Also, it is far too plush and luxurious to give off that ""I'm sacrificing for the good of the planet"" vibe.  Is it a traditional luxury car?   Not really.  It is much more sporty and nimble than a traditional luxury car.  The ride is smooth and well-composed, not floaty at all. However, the interior is all luxury car, and the levels of quiet are better than any luxury car I've ever seen.  What it really is, is a car purpose-built for the real and relatively uninteresting driving we actually do in the real world.  You don't need a huge V8 to putter along in commuter traffic.  You don't need a bone-crushing suspension that handles well but beats you up every mile when you only see those twisty car commercial roads in car commercials.In the real world, quiet matters.  In the real world, power matters but only up to a point.   In the real world, handling and ride quality need to be thoughtfully balanced.   In the real world, you shouldn't waste gas getting to work, even when it is cheap.   The ELR does every one of those things well, all while looking absolutely amazing.  Yes, the backseat is tiny.  Yes, it should not have sold for $80k initially.  But that is about as far as the legitimate criticisms go. With gas prices low, these things are selling for absolutely absurd prices.  They are very rare, so finding one can be a challenge.  But if you land one, you will end up with an amazing bargain.",5
3835, on 10/29/14 22:33 PM (PDT),profrob ,2014 Cadillac ELR Coupe 2dr Coupe (gas/electric hybrid DD),The Ultimate Commuter Car," The ELR makes my commute so much nicer.  It is quiet, it is smooth, it has an amazing sound system, and it's economical.  Without too much effort, I can make my 40 mile round trip on electric only.   This isn't a fun car you want to rip up mountain roads in; that's not what it's designed to do.  It's designed to cart you around town in a quiet, luxurious cocoon that is still responsive and fun to drive.  Having the engine backup is vital.  There's no way I could do an EV with less than 100 miles of range without being constantly paranoid that I'd run out of juice.  The ELR solves that problem.  You can milk the batteries for all they've got, then the motor kicks in to keep you going.  ",4.75

(It is NOT a hybrid with a gasoline engine). My only fault is with the rear seat size - but lets face it, the population that drives an ELR is not running kids to dance lessons - you are way past that! (or have a mini van for the ""family car"".) Update 6/2017 --- I have since traded this ELR in for a new XT5 since I get a new car every two or three years tops.   Unfortunately the ELR didn't catch with Tesla buyers as a BETTER electric car, yet it remained a ""head turner"" right until the end. I still maintain that until  technology puts a charging station at every ""gas station"" and that electric charging time does not exceed the the time to gas-up, (5-min.) that an electric car with a back up gasoline source to power the generator when you exhaust the charge is the only way to go.",5

3846, on 05/09/16 14:36 PM (PDT),Eric Rotbard ,2016 Cadillac ELR Coupe 2dr Coupe (gas/electric hybrid DD),The perfect electric personal luxury coupe v.2," Having leased a 2014 Cadillac ELR (and 2011 Chevy Volt before it), the bar was already set very high.  Contrary to the comments of many online detractors, the ELR is -not- simply a dressed up Volt.  As any EV advocate should tell you, the fact that the Volt and ELR have the same powertrain configuration does not mean they are the same car.  That would be like arguing that any internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) is the same as any other because they both have similar engines and transmissions.  In an EV, what is a battery but the EV analog to an ICEV gas tank?  No one would argue two cars are the same because they have the same gas tank.  And the electric motor (be it in a Tesla, Leaf or Volt) is very similar in design from the original EV1 days, so it is more of a one size fits all part far more than the engine and transmission which need to be properly mated to the vehicle application.  Lastly, the ICE in the Volt and ELR are designed primarily to provide electricity rather than mechanical energy (although it does that too in limited circumstances).  What differentiates the Volt and ELR, then is the software and performance tuning (and the fact that the electric motor is more robust to handle the extra hp and torque).  The Volt and ELR provide vastly different driving experiences.  Other than the fact that both are silent,  you would never confuse driving one for the other.I had previously said that the 2014 ELR was the perfect electric personal luxury coupe.  It may not be as fast as a Model S, but it had plenty of torque.  Also, whereas the Model S is beautiful, practical, spacious sedan, the beauty of the ELR is that it is the opposite: it is designed to be a personal car first and foremost, not a family car.  It is not practical, nor is it intended to be.  The 2014 ELR was -exactly- what I wanted: a personal car that can transport my family in a pinch.  In my opinion, it is one of the most beautiful expressions of automotive design in history, both inside and out.  I thought I could not be happier with the 2014 ELR...... until I drove the 2016 ELR.  Cadillac increased its performance, refined its handling, upgraded its CUE infotainment system with faster processing, more features, and enhanced the interface, and lowered the price.  I had to have it, so I managed to transfer my 2014 ELR lease, and leased a new one.  After having an ELR for 2 years, I still enjoy simply looking at it.  The new '16 ELR is the perfect expression of Cadillac's Art & Science design theme, and is an absolute joy to drive.  I cannot praise it enough.",5

It is an amazing machine, great performance, awesome looks, and definitely unique when out on the road. There is so much power, no matter what gear, speed or RPM you are at, you are never needing more. The handling is phenomenal, great features and quality build. I love this car!",5
3849, on 08/13/18 11:24 AM (PDT),Vik ,2018 Cadillac ATS-V Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 6M),ATS-V Saved me, I loved my ATS-V. Wasn't perfect but it was super fun!  But unfortunately i only had it for about 2years then I rolled it 5 times in the freeway. Got out of the car with minor scratches,5
3850, on 06/26/17 19:27 PM (PDT),Scott ,2017 Cadillac ATS-V Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 6M),Don't own one quite yet," The ATS-V made my short list after exhaustively examining the car and talking extensively with the Cadillac product people at the LA and San Diego auto shows the last two years.  I like what I've read in all the reviews.  Last Friday Cadillac invited people who had indicated a previous interest in the brand to a driving/instructional event at Qualcomm stadium in San Diego.  After learning more about the features of the models and driving several cars under controlled conditions the ATS-V is now firmly at the top of my list for another car in 2018.  Corvette, Porsche 718 Cayman, and Audi TTS are now tied for second.  In an orchestrated but still pedal-to-the-floor straight line acceleration run to about 80 mph 464 HP, and then Brembo brakes, just took my breath away.  The 8-speed auto (in sport mode) snaps off shifts easily as well as a Porsche PDK.  I drove a regular ATS in a short mini autocross, too, and liked how that model performed.  I've read the criticism of the instrument cluster.  That's just going to be personal for everyone; it doesn't bother me.  Supposedly Cadillac is working on a better CUE for 2018.  The ATS-V is a real sleeper compared to the Corvette as it's arguably nearly the same car.  The back seat, however, is something that everyone will agree on.  It's uninhabitable for anyone over about 12 years old.  I'm only  5'11"" and there's no way to fit back there.  Fortunately, there's only my wife and me so I don't require a 4-seat car anyway.  But if you do, please heed my warning.  I've been doing 4 track days a year with my current car for a number of years now with AudiClub SoCal.  If my checkbook does indeed jump out of my pocket in 2018 I think this Cadillac ATS-V will acquit itself admirably at Buttonwillow, Spring Mountain, and Willow Springs.  See you there.",4

3853, on 11/06/17 07:24 AM (PST),Brian Jared ,2016 Cadillac ATS-V Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 6M),Thoroughly Impressed!," I bought this 2016 ATS-V Coupe used with 14K miles on it four months ago. I traded in a BMW 530i which I drove and loved for nine years. I have previously owned  2 Porsche 911's and a Porsche 944T (Yeah, I'm an older guy). I have only owned this vehicle a short time so I cannot speak to reliability issues other than to say the car had all the records and had been maintained by the dealership who sold it to me. Those records only indicate routine maintenance.                                                       I will start with the downsides. The backseat is for luggage, children, or an extremely crowded short trip for an adult. The car is essentially a two-seater, but that is what I bought it for. Getting in and out isn't the easiest, but it is a coupe. Compared to the Corvette and the Porsche Cayman S, it is much easier. I am not a fan of the touch-screen technology utilized throughout. I think it takes attention away from the road to a degree that buttons and dials do not. Also, the piano black color shows fingerprints quickly. I always carry a cloth to touch it up. And of course, when it comes to gas mileage, it is gonna cost you more. Those are the bad things. Lets talk about the good. PERFORMANCE! This thing is a rocket which handles so predictably, and gives you so many options as to how you want to set it up, that I just make excuses to get into it and drive. The Tour mode is remarkably comfortable for grocery store runs or cruising on the highway, but moving to Track Mode transforms the car. I really feel as if I get the best of both worlds. The Recaro chair upgrade is a must - I have never had a seat that was so supportive and yet flexible in how I want it to feel. As a driver's car, as opposed to a family car, this is an extremely comfortable and confident ride. It is both the fastest and best handling car I have ever owned. I chose it over a 2016 Corvette Z06, 2016 BMW M4, and 2014 Porsche Cayman S.  All were amazing cars, but the decision came down to comfort and cost. All four of the cars I drove were impressive, but the Caddy was just easier to get in and out of for this 66 yo. That probably isn't an issue for most. The cost also was a factor. It was between $7-14K cheaper than the other three with less mileage on it. But most of all, the ATS-V just blew me away with its performance. I did not ever think I would buy a Cadillac, but I did, and I could not be more thrilled. If it proves to be reliable, then I will hang on to it for quite a while.",5

Every-else is a matter of personal opinion.  Most coupes and sedans  all have the same look which is trying to look like the modern re-design of the BMW 7 series. Cadillac dares to be different. I love it for being distinctive. It is real sleeper and real surprise to lesser cars who challenge you at a stoplight. The CUE computer management is much maligned as a way to find something wrong with the V series, I find the CUE easy to learn and use, not slow in any way. I read a review that criticized the automatic transmission. The V transmission is the same one in the corvette and is quite a thrill in race mode.",5

3856, on 03/24/16 16:06 PM (PDT),Tucker Maclain ,2016 Cadillac ATS-V Coupe 2dr Coupe (3.6L 6cyl Turbo 6M),Caddie makes a World-class sport sedan!," This car can't be compared to a Camry or Accord, but rather a BMW M4 or Mercedes AMG C63 S.  When compared to those cars, they're all pretty even.  The Caddie has the nicest powerband with the twin-turbo.  The 8 speed automatic (GM 8L90) is borrowed from the 650hp Corvette Z-06, so in the application it's pretty bullet-proof and understressed.  It shifts every bit as quickly as Porsche's PDK.  It's a wonderful driver.  You really can't describe it, but rather you have to drive it to understand.  It feels as though it is on rails.  The interior quality is very high.  The Cadillac CUE has been updated and I don't mind it a bit.  It is a little slower to adjust fan speed or temp.  People have complained on the BMW fanboy site ""Bimmerpost"" that the instument panel looks out dated.  I think it's fine.  It has a totally cool, configurable HUD like an F-16 fighter that really makes the instrument panel unnecessary.  All 3 of these top-notch sports sedans have their own personalities and whichever you pick will get you a winner.  What I liked about the Caddie was that performance-wise or, really any measure, it is the equal of Europe's best. The Caddie gives up NOTHING in performance, comfort, of technology.  Numerous outings from Willow Springs to the Nurburgring have shown it at least equal to BMW and Mercedes best.  The Caddie has touring/sport/ track modes that adjust damping/shiting and other parameters that make it excel as a daily driver.  The back seat is pretty cramped--seriously.  Not for adults.  I didn't buy it for the back seat though.  All that should go into my back seat is a piece of soft luggage.  The Caddie is 10s of thousands of dollars less than the other two and is arguable better.  And finally, you can feel good about driving an American car.  I NEVER thought I would own a GM car.  It's a new company though.  the 2016 ATS-V, Camaro, CTS-V, and Corvette Z-06 are all world class cars at bargain prices.  No longer is driving one a compromise.  They are among the best.  I am more impressed with this car every time I drive it.  That engine and and automatic transmission are absolutely stunning.  The chassis is very stiff.  The feature list is high.  It's an amazing vehicle.  Other cars I considered were the CTS-V, the Corvette Z-06 (way too cramped for me), the Jaguar F-Type R, and the Porsche 911.  I'm very happy with my choice.",5

The car has performed extraordinarily well.  I do a fair amount of driving on back roads and the handling of this vehicle is superb around bends and winding roads.  There have been no squeaks or rattles. The car is tightly built. Gas mileage is similar to a large SUV. I am getting around 15 mpg around town which is slightly better than the rated mileage. One aspect of the car that you don't fully appreciate during the test drive is how well the driver seat holds the driver in place during cornering. The seat design is superior to that of most cars in this class. Mechanically, the engine and transmission operate very smoothly. ",4.75

Cadillac ATS coupe is a real upgrade for me from my beloved Honda Accord Coupe that has been discontinued from 2018 model.  The overall look is just great and I got so much compliment from my neighbors.  There some pros I'd like to state; a) there are not many around and I rarely see the same model that I drive (see sedans but not coupe), b) distinctive styling and ground crawling design, c) high quality material inside, d) CUE is not as bad as the critics have reviewed, e) great power from 2.0T engine, f) smooth 8AT shifting.  I must also mention some cons and they are; a) front seats do not recline fully, b) lane departure warning, blind spot warning, front collision alerts do not come with Lux model unless it is chosen.  My 2013 Honda Accord came with all of them as standard features, e) gas mileage is poor.  average is around 22, max. 33.  my 3.5L V6 accord coupe recorded max 36 highway, 27-28 normal, f) poor traction on OEM Continental run flat tires.  Got snowy day recently and the grip was poor.  I expected better and now am worried about coming snow season, g) it would be nice if the interior noise was suppressed since this is a luxury brand coupe.

3891, on 05/29/17 16:02 PM (PDT),Walter Marsh ,2016 Cadillac ATS Coupe Coupe Standard 2dr Coupe (2.0L 4cyl Turbo 8A),Great car except for two problems.," This is a great car as far as acceleration and handling goes. Plus, in my opinion, it's a great looking car and has a reasonably comfortable interior. The back seat is  unsuitable for adult passengers but I didn't buy a coupe for four people to ride in. I do think the workmanship is very good. There are two major problems. I do not have the cue system and as I'm not much for high tech things, this is fine with me. However most controls are via a touch screen. Especially annoying are the controls for the heating/a.c. system. They should have added a few knobs instead of having to look over at the screen and touch the appropriate arrow. My biggest complaint, and you don't hear much about this, are the run flat tires which cause the ride, when hitting any type of bump, to be extremely harsh. I so disliked the run flats that I recently changed them out to non run flats and the ride is tremendously improved. Maybe I can only do 70 around that turn instead of 73 but that's okay with me. I put a repair kit in the trunk which includes a compressor and sealant and I also have Cadillac and AAA road side service so I am not overly concerned about a flat. Also, when you ride on a run flat with no air in it, you can than throw the tire away as the sidewall has been compromised. Oh, one other thing. The engine has the stop/start system but in 2016 there is a disable button which I engage every time I start the car. On the 2017's you cannot disable the stop/start feature. All in all, I like the car a lot but it took me getting rid of the run flats to say that.",4

The rainsense wipers take some getting used to...I would prefer a simple timeout as in past models...find it distracting waiting for the wiper to resond.",4.25
