# Finding WHO tables referenced in demo notebooks

Because of concerns about copyright, we did not include the WHO published pdf used in the demo notebooks in this packge. The WHO publises COVID status reports [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports) daily.

To access the specific table we reference, this direct link can be used: 

[https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200714-covid-19-sitrep-176.pdf](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200714-covid-19-sitrep-176.pdf)

In the example we renamed the pdf file to "who_covid_report_table" and placed it in the `resources/tables` directory.
