    "\n",
    "In this article, we'll show how to perform an example market intelligence task using [Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding?cm_mmc=open_source_technology) and our open source library [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://ibm.biz/text-extensions-for-pandas). \n",
    "\n",
    "*Market intelligence* is an important application of natural language processing. In this context, \"market intelligence\" means \"finding useful facts about customers and competitors in news articles\". This article focuses on a market intelligence task: **extracting the names of executives from corporate press releases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information about a company's leadership has many uses. You could use that information to identify points of contact for sales or partnership discussions. Or you could estimate how much attention a company is giving to different strategic areas. Some organizations even use this information for recruiting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Press releases are a good place to find the names of executives, because these articles often feature quotes from company leaders. Here's an example quote from an [IBM press release](https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-12-02-IBM-Named-a-Leader-in-the-2020-IDC-MarketScape-For-Worldwide-Advanced-Machine-Learning-Software-Platform) from December 2020:\n",

    "![Snippet of a press release: \"By combining the power of AI with the flexibility and agility of hybrid cloud, our clients are driving innovation and digitizing their operations at a fast pace,\" said Daniel Hernandez, general manager, Data and AI, IBM. ](images/quote.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This quote contains information about the name of an executive:\n",
    "![The quote from the previous picture, highlighting the name \"Daniel Hernandez\"](images/annotated_quote.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet is an example of the general pattern that we will look for:\n",
    "* The article contains a quotation.\n",
    "* The person to whom the quotation is attributed is mentioned by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge that we need to address is the many different forms that this pattern can take. Here are some examples of variations that we would like to capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Variations on the quote from the previous picture: (1) Present-tense \"says\" instead of \"said\"; (2) Name occurs before the quote; and (3) Name occurs in the middle of the quote](images/alternate_quotes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll deal with this variability by using general-purpose semantic models. These models extract high-level facts from formal text. The text could express a given fact in many different ways, but all of those different forms produce the same output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic models can save a lot of work. There's no need to label separate training data or write separate rules or for all of the variations of our target pattern. A small amount of code can capture all these variations at once.\n",
