    "# Market Intelligence with Pandas and IBM Watson\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common applications of natural language processing in the enterprise is *market intelligence*. Market intelligence involves finding useful facts about customers and competitors in news articles.\n",
    "In this article, we'll show how to perform an example market intelligence task using \n",
    "[Watson Natural Language Understanding](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-natural-language-understanding) and our open source library [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://ibm.biz/text-extensions-for-pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our target corpus for this task will be a collection of IBM press releases from [the \"announcements\" section of IBM.com](https://newsroom.ibm.com/announcements). We'll use these documents to find information about the **names and titles of executives** at IBM and its business partners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Information about a company's leadership has many uses. You could use it to identify potential points of contact for sales or partnership discussions. Or you could estimate how much of a company's executive team is focused on different strategic areas. Some organizations even use it for recruiting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Press releases are a good place to find the names and titles of executives, because these articles often feature quotes from company leaders. Here's an example quote from an IBM press release from January 2021:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Equal access to skills and jobs is the key to unlocking economic opportunity and prosperity for diverse populations,\" said Valinda Scarbro Kennedy, HBCU Program Lead, IBM Global University Programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to what Valinda Kennedy is quoted as saying here, this snippet contains information about Ms. Kennedy's position within IBM. She is an IBM executive, and her title is *HBCU Program Lead, IBM Global University Programs*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet is an example of the general pattern that our code will be looking for:\n",
    "* The article quotes a person by name.\n",
    "* The article associates the name with a title.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge that we need to address is the many different ways that the pattern can manifest itself in natural language text. Here are some examples of variations of the quote above that we would like to capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--* **Original:** *\"Equal access to skills and jobs is the key to unlocking economic opportunity and prosperity for diverse populations,\" said Valinda Scarbro Kennedy, HBCU Program Lead, IBM Global University Programs.*-->\n",
    "* **Present tense:** *\"Equal access to skills and jobs is the key to unlocking economic opportunity and prosperity for diverse populations,\" **says** Valinda Scarbro Kennedy, HBCU Program Lead, IBM Global University Programs.*\n",
    "* **Attribution before quote:** *&nbsp;**Valinda Scarbro Kennedy, HBCU Program Lead, IBM Global University Programs**, said, \"Equal access to skills and jobs is the key to unlocking economic opportunity and prosperity for diverse populations.\"*\n",
    "<!--* **Attribution in middle of quote:** *\"Equal access to skills and jobs\", **said Valinda Scarbro Kennedy, HBCU Program Lead, IBM Global University Programs,** \"is the key to unlocking economic opportunity and prosperity for diverse populations.\"*-->\n",
    "* **Different form for title:** *\"Equal access to skills and jobs is the key to unlocking economic opportunity and prosperity for diverse populations,\" said Valinda Scarbro Kennedy, **Leader of the HBCU program at IBM Global University Programs.**&nbsp;*\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this challenge, we'll use general-purpose *semantic* models that extract high-level meaning from formal English text. Basically, these models analyze natural language text and identify facts in the text. The text could express a given fact in many different ways, but all of those different *syntactic* forms will map to the same output of our semantic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic models can save a lot of work. There's no need to label separate training data or write separate rules or for all of the variations of our target pattern. A small amount of business logic can capture all these variations at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main disadvantage of semantic models is that they are computationally expensive to compute. We'll use the power of Pandas and the IBM Cloud to manage this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our end-to-end goal is to create a program that takes as input a stack of press releases and produces as output a Pandas DataFrame full of executive names and titles. We'll break down the process of building this program into four parts:\n",
    "* **Part 1:** Use IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding's semantic role labeling model to identify people quoted by name.\n",
    "* **Part 2:** Use SpaCy's dependency parser model to identify the titles of people quoted by name.\n",
    "* **Part 3:** Use Text Extensions for Pandas to make the code from Parts 1 and 2 faster.\n",
    "* **Part 4:** Use [Ray](https://ray.io) and the IBM Cloud to to make the code run even faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started with Part 1!\n"

Among these models is the `semantic_roles` model, which, as the name suggests, performs [Semantic Role Labeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_role_labeling). You can think of Semantic Role Labeling as the task of identifying *subject-verb-object* triples:\n",

The `entities` model in this Watson service finds *named entity mentions* --- that is, places where the document mentions an entity like a person or company by the entity's name. This model will find all of the person names in our documents with high accuracy. To invoke the model, we use the same `analyze()` Python method as before. We tell the service to run its entities model and retrieve mentions. Then we convert the result to a DataFrame using Text Extensions for Pandas:"
