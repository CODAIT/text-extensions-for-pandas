    "# How to Load Deep Learning Models 300 Times Faster with Ray\n",
    "\n",
    "*One of the challenges of using deep learning in production is managing the cost of loading huge models for inference. In this article, we'll show how you can reduce this cost almost to zero by leveraging features of PyTorch and Ray.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are big and cumbersome. Because of their size, they take a long time to load. This model loading cost leads to a great deal of engineering effort when deploying models in production. Model inference platforms like [TFX](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/serving/serving_basic), [TorchServe](https://github.com/pytorch/serve), and [IBM Spectrum Conductor Deep Learning Impact](https://www.ibm.com/products/spectrum-deep-learning-impact?cm_mmc=text_extensions_for_pandas) run deep learning models inside dedicated, long-lived processes and containers, with lots of complex code to start and stop containers and to pass data between them.\n",

    "\n",
    "But what if this conventional wisdom isn't entirely correct? What if there was a way to load a deep learning model in a tiny fraction of a second? It might be possible to run model inference in production with a much simpler architecture.\n",

    "## Background: BERT \n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples in this article, we'll use the [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) masked language model. BERT belongs to a group of general-purpose models that capture the nuances of human language in a (relatively) compact format. You can use these models to do many different natural language processing (NLP) tasks, ranging from document classification to machine translation. However, to do any task with high accuracy, you need to start with a model trained on your target language and [*fine-tune* the model](https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-tuning-a-bert-model-with-transformers-c8e49c4e008b) for the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuning a BERT model for a task effectively creates a new model. If your application needs to perform three tasks in three different languages, you'll need *nine* copies of BERT --- one for each combination of language and task. This proliferation of models creates  headaches in production. Being able to load and unload different BERT-based model really fast would save a lot of trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by loading up a BERT model in the most straightforward way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading a BERT Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) provides convenient ways to load different variants of BERT. The code snippet that follows shows how to load `bert-base-uncased`, a medium-sized model with about 420 MB of parameters."

    "The `transformers.BertModel.from_pretrained()` method follows PyTorch's [recommended practice](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#save-load-state-dict-recommended) for loading models: First, construct an instance of your model, which should be a subclass of `torch.nn.Module`. Then use `torch.load()` to load a PyTorch *state dictionary* of model weights. Finally, call your model's `load_state_dict()` method to copy the model weights from the state dictionary into your model's `torch.Tensor` objects.\n",

    "This method takes about 1.4 seconds to load BERT on my laptop, provided that the model is on local disk. That's fairly impressive for a model that's over 400MB in size, but it's still a long time. For comparison, running inference with this model only takes a fraction of a second.\n",

    "## Zero-Copy Model Loading\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that we can indeed load PyTorch models while copying weights zero times. We can achieve this goal by leveraging some features of PyTorch and Ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, some background on [Ray](https://ray.io). Ray is an open source system for building high-performance distributed applications. One of Ray's unique features is its main-memory object store, [Plasma](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/serialization.html#plasma-store). Plasma uses shared memory to pass objects between processes on each machine in a Ray cluster. Ray uses Plasma's shared memory model to implement zero-copy transfer of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) arrays. If a Ray [task](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/walkthrough.html#remote-functions-tasks) needs to read a NumPy array from Plasma, the task can access the array's data directly out of shared memory without copying any data into its local heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we store the weights of a model as NumPy arrays on Plasma, we can access those weights directly out of Plasma's shared memory segments, without making any copies. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we still need to connect those weights to the rest of the PyTorch model, which requires them to be wrapped in PyTorch `Tensor` objects. The standard method of creating a `Tensor` involves copying the contents of the tensor, but PyTorch also has an alternate code path for initializing `Tensor`s *without* performing a copy. You can access this code path by passing your NumPy array to `torch.as_tensor()` instead of using `Tensor.__new__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this background information in mind, here's a high-level overview of how to do zero-copy model loading from Plasma. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to load the model into the Plasma object store, which is a three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the model from disk.\n",
    "2. Separate the original PyTorch model into its weights and its graph of operations, and convert the weights to NumPy arrays.\n",
    "3. Upload the NumPy arrays and the model (minus weights) to Plasma.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model and its weights are in object storage, it becomes possible to do a zero-copy load of the model. Here are the steps to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deserialize the model (minus weights) from Plasma\n",
    "2. Extract the weights from Plasma (without copying any data)\n",
    "3. Wrap the weights in PyTorch `Tensors` (without copying any data)\n",
    "4. Install the weight tensors back in the reconstructed model (without copying any data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a copy of the model is in the local machine's Plasma shared memory segment, these steps will load load BERT in **0.004 seconds**. That's **340 times faster** than loading the model with `BertModel.from_pretrained()`!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Comparison of running times for different ways of loading the bert-base-uncased model. BertModel.from_pretrained() takes 1.4 seconds, torch.load() takes 0.125 seconds, and zero-copy loading takes 0.004 seconds.](images/bert_load_times.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This loading time is an order of magnitude less than the time it takes to run one inference request on this model with a general purpose CPU. That means that you can load the model *on demand* with almost no performance penalty. There's need to spin up a dedicated model serving platform or a Ray [actor pool](https://docs.ray.io/en/master/actors.html#actor-pool), tying up resources for models that aren't currently running inference."

    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you call the `replace_tensors()` function, PyTorch will print out a warning:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "UserWarning: The given NumPy array is not writeable, and PyTorch does not support non-writeable tensors. This means you can write to the underlying (supposedly non-writeable) NumPy array using the tensor. [...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most PyTorch models don't modify their own weights during inference, but PyTorch doesn't prevent models from doing so. If you load your weights via the zero-copy method and your model modifies a weights tensor, it will change the copy of those weights in Plasma's shared memory. Ray (as of version 1.4) [always opens shared memory segments in read-write mode](https://github.com/ray-project/plasma/blob/7d6acc7af2878fc932ec5314cbcda0e79a9d6a4b/src/plasma_client.c#L111). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're sure that you model does not not modify its own weights during inference, you can safely ignore this warning. You can test for these modifications by comparing your model's weights before and after inference. If your model does modify some of its weights, it's important to copy the relevant tensors prior to running inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to note is that this method loads the model for CPU-based inference. To use GPU acceleration, you will need to call the model's `cuda()` method to copy all the tensors to the GPU device. Copying our example BERT model's weights to GPU memory takes about 0.07 seconds."
