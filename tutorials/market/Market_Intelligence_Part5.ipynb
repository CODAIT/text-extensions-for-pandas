    "\n",
    "Let's start by summarizing our progress so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 1](./Market_Intelligence_Part1.ipynb), we defined an NLP pipeline that used Watson Natural Language Understanding and Text Extensions for Pandas to identify the names of executives in corporate press releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 2](./Market_Intelligence_Part2.ipynb), we extended our NLP pipeline by using SpaCy and Text Extensions for Pandas to associate each executive name with a job title.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we separate the expensive NLP model evaluations from the rest of our code, we can think of this processing pipeline as having five distinct stages, as shown in the following diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "![First version of our processing pipeline](images/pipeline_v1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 3](./Market_Intelligence_Part3.ipynb), we applied the semijoin trick with Text Extensions for Pandas to reduce the cost of running the SpaCy dependency parser. This change decreased the cost of parsing by a factor of 9 and improved end-to-end running time by a factor of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Part 4](./Market_Intelligence_Part4.ipynb), we showed how you can use [Ray](ray.io) to rate-limit requests to a remote web service such as Watson Natural Language Understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final part of the tutorial, we use Ray to take the performance improvements from Part 3 to the next level by applying parallel processing. By the time we're done, we'll have a version of our pipeline that runs **300 times faster** than the pipeline we started with at the beginning of Part 3.\n",

    "## Using actors to manage request rate\n",
    "\n",
    "The large model that we attached to our `ParserModelActor` actor is an example of *immutable* actor state. Ray actors can also have *mutable* state that changes in response to tasks that the actor performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this application, we can use mutable actor state to track of how quickly our application is sending requests to the Watson Natural Language Understanding web service. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 4 of this tutorial described in detail how to add such rate-limiting logic with a Ray actor. Here's a quick summary of how it works: We track the request rate is by tracking how much time has elapsed since the most recent request. With that information in hand, our actor can throttle new requests if they would exceed the rate limit. We put the logic for managing this state into an abstract base class, `RateLimitedActor`, the code for which can be found in `market_intelligence.py`. With that base class in place, we can define a Ray actor that sends documents to the Watson Natural Language Understanding web service while respecting a request rate limit. Because the Python API for Watson Natural Language Understanding is thread-safe, we can use a multithreaded Python actor to track multiple simulataneous requests."
