    "# Part 3: Making an NLP Model 9x Faster with the Semijoin Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few years, machine learning models for natural language processing have become much more accurate, but they've also become much more resource-intensive. In this article, we'll show you a simple trick that can cut those resources by an order of magnitude or more. And we'll show you how to implement this trick using our open-source library, [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://ibm.biz/text-extensions-for-pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Many natural language processing applications involve combining the results of multiple models. A particularly common pattern is looking for **places in a document where the outputs of two models overlap**. For example, if you cross-reference a [document layout analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis) model and a [named entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) model, you can find who is the author of a document. Cross-reference a [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) model with a model for [resolving anaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference), and you can find which company the pronoun \"it\" refers to. There are many different pairs of models whose outputs you can combine to produce something more valuable than its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time that you see this pattern, it's an opportunity to deploy an old database performance trick called a *semijoin*."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## What's a Semijoin?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1980s, engineers started looking into how to find matching records from two databases that are physically far apart. Back then, wide-area network bandwidth was measured in *bits* per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that you worked in your firm's New York office, and you wanted to check for duplicate invoices between the accounts payable database in New York and the database in Los Angeles. You could download the entire contents of the L.A. database, but at 300 bits per second, that would take a long time. So instead, you gather up a list of dates and dollar amounts from your New York database, upload that list to the L.A. database, and ask the L.A. database to send back just the invoices that match your list. That way you send much less data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the basic formula for a semijoin: Instead of asking the remote system for all its data and then matching it with your local data, you send the remote system a description of what data *could* match with your local data. Then you ask the data source for just the data that matches your description. The description, plus the data that meets that description, are much smaller than the entire remote data set.\n"

    "## The Semijoin Trick for NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "What does this old database trick have to do with natural language processing?\n",
    "\n",
    "If your application is one of those \"find places where two models overlap\" applications we talked about earlier, chances are one of those models is much more expensive than the other. Running that expensive NLP model is a lot like downloading the results of the model over a very slow modem --- it takes a lot of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you could tell the expensive model to only \"download\" the results that are going to match with the outputs of the less-expensive model? For many NLP models, there's a way to do just that: Run the model only over certain parts of the document. Then you'll get back a fraction of the results in a fraction of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more concrete terms, we can apply the semijoin trick to a \"find places where two models overlap\" task by breaking the task into four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the document into pieces.\n",
    "2. Find all the pieces that contain a match of the less-expensive model.\n",
    "3. Run the expensive model over just those pieces.\n",
    "4. Cross-reference the results of the two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there are some tricky parts to making these steps work in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is that **NLP models are sensitive to context**. If you don't give the expensive model enough context from before and after a given place in the document, you can change the results at the place you're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "What constitutes \"enough\" context varies, but many models treat each sentence in the document as a separate unit of analysis. The trouble is, **finding sentence boundaries is hard**."

   "source": [
    "## Finding sentence boundaries is hard...\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding sentence boundaries with high accuracy is surprisingly hard. You might think that finding sentence boundaries is easy --- just look for punctuation. But there are many exceptions to that rule. There could be a quotation like \"This!\" in the middle of a sentence. There could be an abbreviation like Mr. or colloq. that doesn't end a sentence. Your document use punctuation to emphasize. certain. words. Or the author may have forgotten the punctuation entirely\n",
    "\n",
    "Even the best sentence boundary detection model gets about one sentence boundary in 10 wrong. For example, the [SpaCy library's most sophisticated sentence boundary detector](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/tag/en_core_web_trf-3.2.0) reports an F1 score of 0.91 on the OntoNotes corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worse, each incorrect sentence boundary results in multiple incorrect sentences. If your model misses a sentence boundary, it's actually making three mistakes, because the sentences on either side of the boundary will be replaced with a single larger, incorrect sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Each incorrect sentence boundary results in multiple incorrect sentences](images/sentence_accuracy.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## ...but that's ok\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we don't need to find *all* the sentence boundaries to make the semijoin trick work. We just need to find *some* of them with high accuracy. As it happens, some sentence boundaries are much clearer than others. \n",
    "\n",
    "For news articles, a good place to start is paragraph boundaries. Newspapers have traditionally cut articles on paragraph boundaries to meet space constraints, so news content is usually divided into small, clearly-delineated paragraphs.\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "So splitting on paragraph boundaries helps with the context problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a second problem: **Bookkeeping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run your expensive model over fragment of the document, the model only sees the fragment. It doesn't know about the original document and will return its matches relative to the current document fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to map these piecewise results back to the original document. So your code needs to keep track of all the fragment and the relationship between offsets into a given fragment and offsets into the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, our [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://ibm.biz/text-extensions-for-pandas) library gives you all the tools you need to track this information. The first\n",
    "thing we provide is a way of representing *spans*. \"Span\" is an NLP term that refers to a region of a document, usually defined by a begin and end offset. Text Extensions for Pandas includes a Pandas [array type](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/extending.html#extensionarray) called `SpanArray`. You can store a collection of spans in a `SpanArray` and use that `SpanArray` as the column in a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
