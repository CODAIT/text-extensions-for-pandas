    "# Part 3: Making an NLP Model 9x Faster with the Semijoin Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the last few years, machine learning models for natural language processing have become much more accurate, but they've also become much more resource-intensive. In this article, we'll show you a simple trick that can cut those resources by an order of magnitude or more. And we'll show you how to implement this trick using our open-source library, [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://ibm.biz/text-extensions-for-pandas).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Many natural language processing applications involve combining the results of multiple models. A particularly common pattern is looking for **places in a document where the outputs of two models overlap**. For example, if you cross-reference a [document layout analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_layout_analysis) model and a [named entity recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) model, you can find who is the author of a document. Cross-reference a [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging) model with a model for [resolving anaphora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coreference), and you can find which company the pronoun \"it\" refers to. There are many different pairs of models whose outputs you can combine to produce something more valuable than its parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any time that you see this pattern, it's an opportunity to deploy an old database performance trick called a *semijoin*."

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## What's a Semijoin?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the early 1980s, engineers started looking into how to find matching records from two databases that are physically far apart. Back then, wide-area network bandwidth was measured in *bits* per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that you worked in your firm's New York office, and you wanted to check for duplicate invoices between the accounts payable database in New York and the database in Los Angeles. You could download the entire contents of the L.A. database, but at 300 bits per second, that would take a long time. So instead, you gather up a list of dates and dollar amounts from your New York database, upload that list to the L.A. database, and ask the L.A. database to send back just the invoices that match your list. That way you send much less data.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the basic formula for a semijoin: Instead of asking the remote system for all its data and then matching it with your local data, you send the remote system a description of what data *could* match with your local data. Then you ask the data source for just the data that matches your description. The description, plus the data that meets that description, are much smaller than the entire remote data set.\n"

Running that expensive NLP model is a lot like downloading the results of the model over a very slow modem --- it takes a lot of time. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what if you could tell the expensive model to only \"download\" the results that are going to match with the outputs of the less-expensive model? For many NLP models, there's a way to do just that: Run the model only over certain parts of the document. Then you'll get back a fraction of the results in a fraction of the time.\n",

But there are many exceptions to that rule. There could be a quotation like \"This!\" in the middle of a sentence. There could be an abbreviation like Mr. or colloq. that doesn't end a sentence. Your document use punctuation to emphasize. certain. words. Or the author may have forgotten the punctuation entirely\n",

    "Pandas does not have a built-in type for storing spans, so we use a Pandas extension type from our open source library, [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://ibm.biz/text-extensions-for-pandas), to represent store the spans in the first column of this DataFrame.\n",

This function takes in the output from `find_persons_quoted_by_name()` and a SpaCy language model. It uses the language model's dependency parser to connect person names to job titles. Here's what the output of that function looks like on the same example document:"
