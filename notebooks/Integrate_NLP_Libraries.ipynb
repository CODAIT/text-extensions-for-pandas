    "In this notebook we demonstrated how Text Extensions for Pandas can be used to perform various NLP tasks. We started by loading our document and passing it through Watson NLU service. We extracted various entities and relations. We used Text Extensions for Pandas to manipualte the Span data and visualize some of our findings. Finally we pass this through a language model using SpaCy which gives us more insights such as parts of speech tagging. We then combine all the results to render a parse tree. \n",
