    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many organizations have valuable information hidden in tables inside human-readable documents like PDF files and web pages. Table identification and extraction technology can turn this human-readable information into a format that data science tools can import and use. Text Extensions for Pandas and Watson Discovery make this process much easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll follow the journey of Allison, an analyst at an investment bank. Allison's employer has assigned her to cover several different companies, one of which is IBM. As part of her analysis, Allison wants to track IBM's revenue over time, broken down by geographical region. That detailed revenue information is all there in IBM's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For example, here's IBM's 2019 annual report:\n",
    "\n",
    "![IBM Annual Report for 2019 (146 pages)](images/IBM_Annual_Report_2019.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Did you see the table of revenue by geography? It's here, on page 39:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Page 39 of IBM Annual Report for 2019](images/IBM_Annual_Report_2019_page_39.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what that table looks like close up:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Table: Geographic Revenue (from IBM 2019 annual report)](images/screenshot_table_2019.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But this particular table only gives two years' revenue figures. Allison needs to have enough data to draw a meaningful chart of revenue over time. 10 years of annual revenue figures would be a good starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Allison has a collection of IBM annual reports going back to 2009. In total, these documents contain about 1500 pages of financial information. Hidden inside those 1500 pages are the detailed revenue figures that Allison wants. She needs to find those figures, extract them from the documents, and import them into her data science tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, Allison has [Watson Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-discovery), IBM's suite of tools for managing and extracting value from collections of human-readable documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cells that follow will show how Allison uses Text Extensions for Pandas and Watson Discovery to import the detailed revenue information from her PDF documents into a Pandas DataFrame...\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of a DataFrame from later in this notebook.](images/revenue_table.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "...that she then uses to generate a chart of revenue over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Chart of revenue over time, from later in this notebook.](images/revenue_over_time.png)\n",

    "But first, let's set your environment up so that you can run Allison's code yourself.\n",

    "Allison's next task is to write some Pandas transformations that will clean and reformat the DataFrame for each source table prior to merging them all together. She uses the 2017 report's data as a test case for creating this code. The first step is to convert the cell values in the Watson Discovery output from text to numeric values. Text Extensions for Pandas includes a more robust version of [`pandas.to_numeric()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.to_numeric.html) that can handle common idioms for representing currencies and percentages. Allison uses this function, called `convert_cols_to_numeric()`, to convert all the cell values to numbers. She adds a new column \"value\" to her DataFrame to hold these numbers."
