    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use the open source library [Text Extensions for Pandas](https://github.com/CODAIT/text-extensions-for-pandas) to seamlessly integrate model training and prediction for NLP tasks with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example will build on the analysis of the [CoNLL-2003](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/ner/) corpus done in [Analyze_Model_Outputs](./Analyze_Model_Outputs.ipynb) to train a new model for named entity recognition (NER) using state-of-the-art natural language understanding with BERT tokenization and embeddings. While the model used is rather simple and will only get modest scoring results, the purpose is to demonstrate how Text Extensions for Pandas integrates BERT from [Huggingface Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/index.html) with the `TensorArray` extension for model training and scoring, all within Pandas DataFrames. See [Text_Extension_for_Pandas_Overview](./Text_Extension_for_Pandas_Overview.ipynb) for `TensorArray` specification and more example usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is divided into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retokenize the entire corpus using a \"BERT-compatible\" tokenizer, and map the token/entity labels from the original corpus on to the new tokenization.\n",
    "1. Generate BERT embeddings for every token in the entire corpus in one pass, and store those embeddings in a DataFrame column (of type TensorType) alongside the tokens and labels.\n",
    "1. Persist the DataFrame with computed BERT embeddings to disk as a checkpoint.\n",
    "1. Use the embeddings to train a multinomial logistic regression model to perform named entity recognition.\n",
    "1. Compute precision/recall for the model predictions on a test set.\n"

    "# Named Entity Recognition with BERT on CoNLL-2003\n",
    "\n",
    "[CoNLL](https://www.conll.org/), the SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning, is an annual academic conference for natural language processing researchers. Each year's conference features a competition involving a challenging NLP task. The task for the 2003 competition involved identifying mentions of [named entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) in English and German news articles from the late 1990's. The corpus for this 2003 competition is one of the most widely-used benchmarks for the performance of named entity recognition models. Current [state-of-the-art results](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/named-entity-recognition-ner-on-conll-2003) on this corpus produce an F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of 0.93. The best F1 score in the original competition was 0.89.\n",

    "IOB2 format is a convenient way to represent a corpus, but it is a less useful representation for analyzing the result quality of named entity recognition models. Most tokens in a typical NER corpus will be tagged `O`, any measure of error rate in terms of tokens will over-emphasizing the tokens that are part of entities. Token-level error rate implicitly assigns higher weight to named entity mentions that consist of multiple tokens, further unbalancing error metrics. And most crucially, a naive comparison of IOB tags can result in marking an incorrect answer as correct. Consider a case where the correct sequence of labels is `B, B, I` but the model has output `B, I, I`; in this case, last two tokens of model output are both incorrect (the model has assigned them to the same entity as the first token), but a naive token-level comparison will consider the last token to be correct.\n",
